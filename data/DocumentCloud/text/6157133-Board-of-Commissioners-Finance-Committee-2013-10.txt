Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

At the request of the Board of

8

Commissioners, we have asked for Karin Norington-

9

Reeves, the head of the Chicago Cook Workforce

10

Partnership, to come in and give us a status update

11

on the progress of the workforce initiative effort.

12

The Board may recall the Chicago Cook County

13

Workforce Partnership is the new 501(c)(3) formation

14

of the collaboration between the City's workforce

15

efforts and the Cook County workforce efforts, and

16

the prior iteration of the Cook County Workforce

17

that Ms. Norington-Reeves was the head of.
As part of this collaboration, I sit

18
19

as a board member with the new Workforce

20

Partnership.

21

come in and give us an update and answer any

22

questions on the progress of the initiative.

Ms. Reeves has kindly responded to

1

I am going to give a brief version of my remarks

2

that were given at our annual meeting on August 15.
On July 1, 2012, the Partnership

3
4

successfully consolidated Chicago and Cook County

5

workforce resources to expand the reach of the

6

region's employment and training services.

7

resulted in the creation of our nation's second

8

largest local workforce investment area; however, we

9

are the largest that is managed by a nonprofit.

This

In collaboration with a multitude of

10
11

partners, we see about 140,000 residents through our

12

forty-eight workforce agencies, our business

13

intermediary, our ten comprehensive workforce

14

centers, and two satellite centers.

15

managed just under $50 million in programs.

Last year, we

The creation of The Partnership

16
17

resulted in administrative cost savings of more than

18

$2 million annually by eliminating redundant

19

functions across three different administrative

agencies.

development, financial, compliance, business

22

relations, policy, IT, administrative and program

2

At the top of the reconfiguration, we

3

were tasked with several ambitious goals.

First, to

4

consolidate the competitive bid process.

5

shift the funding paradigm from an emphasis on

6

individual training to a demand-drive model that

7

contemplates training people for the jobs of today

and tomorrow.

Fourth, to use data

to the numerous economic development projects and

opportunities within the region.

agencies.

by enhancing evaluations and certification

standards.

Sixth, to improve

Seventh, to improve our training network

I am proud to say that we accomplished
each of these goals, and then some.
One of our important undertakings was
the institution of demand-driven reforms that

1

narrowly focused the use of subsidized training

2

dollars in the industries that actually have jobs

3

and need skilled workers within this region.

4

5

industries:

healthcare; hospitality; information technology;

manufacturing; retail; and transportation,

distribution and logistics.

they need the skilled workers for.

were previously asked to choose from under our prior

structure.

business-centric, but it is fundamentally about

17

ensuring that we fund training that actually leads

18

to employment, job retention, career pathways for

19

low-, medium-, and highly-skilled workers, and, most

20

importantly, it creates family-sustaining wages.

While we are proud of our

7

accomplishments in the face of a very challenging

9

economy, as well as the funding constraints, given

10

the status of the Federal Government, in the year

ahead there is still more to be done.

continue to explore innovative projects that will

foster further development of a skilled regional

the future programs.

I will say -- I know there
I want

First and foremost, there is no such

20

thing as a federally-funded summer youth program

21

through the Workforce Investment Act.

22

summer youth programs.

We are not responsible for

23

summer youth programs.

The programs that happened

24

in the past were generally due to ARRA funding,

Our youth

function is a one-year program.

4

because that negatively impacts our performance.

Kids cannot enter

Our youth programs have struggled this

5
6

year because many of these youth programs have not

7

been able to stay afloat as agencies during this

8

struggling economy.
2012 and 2013 saw the collapse of many

9
10

youth agencies in this region such as Jobs for

11

Youth, SEDCOM, which is the Southeast Chicago

12

Development Commission), and the Southwest Youth

13

Collaborative.

14

communities.

But those are not problems that we can

15

readily fix.

What we did with those dollars is

16

redistribute them to other youth programs that were

17

active, and asked them to take up the slack.

18

These left many gaping holes in the

You have before you folders that we

19

have distributed which show our collateral material.

20

In those folders you have a PowerPoint deck that

highlights the outcomes, our performance outcomes.

23

Federal guidelines.

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

Let me start where

2

you just said -- we do know that as a fact, but it

3

is my understanding -- and correct me if I am wrong

4

-- that once you merged as a 501(c)(3) there were no

5

City-County -- you said sixty percent City and forty

6

percent County before your 501(c)(3)?

7

MS. REEVES:

That was the composition of

8

the dollars given to this region through the State,

9

but from the Federal Department of Labor.

That is

10

the funding mix that was provided through the

11

Workforce Investment Act.

12

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

Once it becomes Cook

13

County, which includes the City of Chicago, is it

14

divided in terms of how the money is allocated?

15

MS. REEVES:

The intergovernmental

16

agreement that we signed off on, and that this Body

17

approved last June, required that for that first

18

year that we keep the same funding mix, the same

19

distribution, the allocation of dollars that was

20

originally provided by the State.

21

subsequent years, we would provide a formula to the

22

City and County, which they would approve, and then

23

we would go with whatever the new formula was.

24

For the

For this year, we asked to move
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 74

1

forward with the exact same formula because the

2

factors that go into determining the Federal

3

allocations have not changed significantly.

4

that when we see a shift in demographics, when we

5

see a shift in the number of companies that are

6

leaving, the number of plant closings, then you go

7

back and change the underlying formula.

8

the most part, there has not been a significant

9

shift that would warrant moving more dollars into

Meaning

But, for

one or the other.
COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

11

Let me ask you this

12

question:

13

or you are a quasi, where you have things having to

14

be approved by government, any government, let's say

15

the City.

16

this, the money has to come through the State.

17

concerned about -- if you are Cook County, why would

18

there be any changes that we have to approve?

19

Either you are an independent 501(c)(3)

I understand you have to come through
I am

The only thing that I see that we as a

20

Board legitimately can be involved in, that is the

21

accountability for the monies that we turn over to

22

you in the beginning, because you already have

23

received the money.

24

City of Chicago as well, accountable for the money

Once we get past that, in the

But beyond that you should be treated as any

That

I guess what we need is somebody

7

legally who is back there to tell me who and what

8

you are.

9

I want to understand that.
MS. REEVES:

I am an attorney -- we are a

10

501(c)(3), an independent 501(c)(3).

11

have intergovernmental agreements with the City and

12

the County and the State that allows us to be the

When we created the agency, we

18

looked at what the history had been with respect to

19

disallowed costs, on both the City and County sides.

20

What we noticed was that the highest amount had been

21

about $1.5 million.

22

for $3 million to cover that in the event that we

23

had to pay back any disallowed costs.

24

We took out liability insurance

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

That includes

MS. REEVES:

2

We have separate insurance

3

that would cover those types of acts.

4

insurance specifically designed to address any gaps

5

with respect to disallowed costs that would protect

6

both the County and the City.

7

we have other insurance as an employer.

something that I'm going to be looking at from a

that you had placed on jobs.

about the career tracks, and what percentage of your

MS. REEVES:

All of our money is going for

That is what I was

13

articulating, that we changed the way the training

14

15

-- it was almost eight hundred different occupations

16

that people could choose from; whether there was a

17

job at the end of that training or not.

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

12

Are you finding that

13

we are not spending as much of our dollars,

14

government dollars, taxpayers' dollars, on training

15

itself because they are participating and doing

16

their own training?
MS. REEVES:

17

We have a requirement by the

18

State to spend at least forty percent of our dollars

19

on training.
COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

20

I understand that.

21

So you need less money now for training that you did

before.

alluded to youth funding.

that better, because there is nothing in here that

that was interesting to me.

If we are looking for

that -- most of the time that young people want a

You had a hard time keeping people

MS. REEVES:

9

What do you

Not that we had a hard time

keeping people engaged; many of the youth agencies

closed their doors because they could not stay

afloat.

What you are saying

is right now workforce development is potentially

kind of tent pole type of activity that we think

about local governments doing, which is hiring young

people or facilitating the hiring of young people in

the summertime -- is that not going to be a part of

this Workforce Partnership going forward?

that allows us to do a summer youth program, we are

more than happy to do that.

5

getting kids a "quick fix" summer job.

by for youth under the Federal Act are an increase

in reading skills, literacy skills, an increase in

Herman, you look like you are dying to
say something?
MR. BREWER:

I was just going to try to

10

sort of bridge some of what has occurred.

11

say over the last three to five years what has

12

occurred has been kind of, as you said, a quick fix.

13

A number of summer youth initiatives have been

14

funded by sort of very quickly assembling dollars

15

from various programs, and some things thrown

16

together for a two- to three-month period.

I would

One of the challenges for this entity

19

to consider going forward is how to design something

20

that can acquire funding, corporate support,

21

philanthropic support, as well as government.

say for 2015 and 2016 and beyond, can maybe model a

program approach that the Feds will fund through

this mechanism.

years I have been at the sort of local neighborhood

together very quickly.

It has been a patchwork of

we really don't have that.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

2
3

I will just throw out

two things -MS. REEVES:

4

I'm sorry -- let me also say

5

that there can be a summer youth component for the

6

kids that are already enrolled in the year-round

7

program.

8

something that will just be widely open to everyone

9

through what you see in the One Summer Chicago

They certainly can do that.

That is not

11

than to say:

12

are the criteria; kids are welcome to apply, but

13

understand it is more than just a summer engagement.
How many children are

in the yearlong program?

These are the slots that we have; here

back to us generally on all of the youth stuff, I

would appreciate that.

I will definitely get back to

I will put one thing

Number one, I personally, and I know I

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

youth initiative.

10

the details similar to what you gave us for the

other populations.

MS. REEVES:

Sure.

13

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

We have that.
Two things.

One is

-- I would like to figure out whether it is working

with you and how you guys want to move forward.

16

think there is a huge unmet need.

17

It is a gateway potentially into maybe a potential

pipeline into this bigger investment of these 4500

young people.

us to work together -- whether that is separate

funding or however we go.

commitment, as we talked about, from Lollapalooza

The second thing I wanted to put a bug

7
8

in your ear about -- kind of nationally and even

9

internationally there is this whole issue of the

10

sixteen- to twenty-four-year-old age group.

What

11

are we doing with this age group?

12

across the board.

13

we adopted the City Colleges, the Harold Washington

14

College, and created a finance and insurance

15

cluster.

16

We are doing a whole bunch of things.

Lower skills all

In my other life at AON, I know

We are helping to redesign the curriculum.

One of the most useful things, after a

17
18

year and a half in, that we told the students and

19

the professors was that it was the interaction with

20

our staff.

21

will get all of the people that work at the office,

22

and we will invite the students from Harold

23

Washington over -- who are not all young people;

24

obviously there is a range.

We will have a networking event where we

networking is really important.

might take for granted, the ability to have a

We have lined up a whole

We are working on a similar

I think this idea of an apprentice

10
11

program, it is much longer, it is eighteen months.

12

Outside of this country there is often a greater

13

focus on investing in people when they leave high

14

school to really not to think -- if people are not

15

going to go to college, how do you invest in them

16

into skills?

17

universities, but they are really substantive.

18

Maybe that is something we can follow up on.

They don't have to include

I don't want it to be either/or.

19

I

20

think the summer component is really important.

21

would like to figure out a way to work on that with

22

you.
MS. REEVES:

23
24

on that.

component, mentoring is a very key element.

So

11

those opportunities to connect with people who are

12

within organizations and have professional

13

establishments, it is really helpful to give the

14

kids just sort of something to aim for.

15

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

I also like the idea

16

-- to Herman's point -- if we can structure

17

something for the summer to help put us in a better

18

position to go for something more long-term, I would

19

like that, too.

We will follow up.

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

MS. REEVES:

9

The bottom line is

Hello, Karin.

Hi, Commissioner.

How are

you?
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

10

Karin, two things I

11

have heard here.

What do you do with the money that

12

you receive from the Federal Government, if you are

13

not putting young people to work?

14

correctly, your agency does not put young people to

15

work.

16

MS. REEVES:

17

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

18
19

If I heard you

That is not correct.
Okay.

Then I

misunderstood.
MS. REEVES:

We have certain performance

20

metrics that we are held accountable for.

One is

21

increasing young people's literacy; one is

22

increasing their numeracy; one is ensuring that they

23

are earning credentials, and the other is putting

24

them to work.

There is not as great an emphasis on

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 96

1

the work piece as there is on the other pieces

2

around, ensuring that they are employable long-term.

3

Let me also be clear.

We don't

4

directly provide the services.

5

agencies that are responsible for compliance with

6

the Federal Act.

7

agencies that do, indeed, put youth to work.

8
9

We fund the delegate

We have twenty-three youth

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

Are these twenty-three

agencies that put young people to work, are they

10

located in the City, suburbs, or do you have a

11

breakdown of where these agencies are located?

12

Because I am one of those people that have been

13

sitting here saying:

14

got summer jobs.

15

you and I have talked about this.

16

summer from people saying -- the ministers,

17

agencies, they are all calling me saying, "Where is

18

your summer programs?

19

are able to work."

20

kids working this summer because that is all I heard

21

is that no kids are working.

22

I have no idea of what kids

I got calls all summer.

I think

I got calls all

We don't have any kids that

As far as I know, there were no

MS. REEVES:

That is not possible.

It's

23

possible that you got a lot of calls that people

24

said that they weren't working.

It's not possible

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

that they weren't working at all.

We fund everywhere.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

7

Let me ask you this:

8

When the funding came to Aunt Martha's -- maybe this

9

is the problem.

Does Aunt Martha's know that it is

10

the County-City collaboration and they think that

11

the funding is just coming from -- what is your

12

program called?
MS. REEVES:

13

The Chicago Cook Workforce

14

Partnership.

15

of the City-County collaboration, absolutely.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

16
17

They understand that we are a product

From the calls I got,

no kids were working.
MS. REEVES:

18

You also have to understand

19

that they have limits on the number of kids they can

20

take.

Aunt Martha's capacity might be at 150 or 200

21

kids.

They may not be able to serve the entire

22

demand. Even when you look at the, for example, One

23

Summer Chicago initiative, they might have gotten --

24

I remember last year, 2011-2012, they got 30,000
________________________________________________

applications, but they only had room for about

19,000 kids.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

3

Nineteen thousand kids

4

is still good, but when we are talking about

5

suburban kids, they got hardly any.

6

difference and a big disparity.
MS. REEVES:

7

I understand.

That is a big

I can give you

8

the data that shows the number of kids that we serve

in the south suburbs versus the west suburbs and the

Commissioner Steele.
Thank you, Mr.

Chairman.
Hi, Karin.

16

MS. REEVES:

Hi there.

17

COMMISSIONER STEELE:

You mentioned earlier

18

that you are being notified about jobs when we do

19

the passing of certain tax incentives for companies

20

and businesses, with the 6B program and those

21

specialized programs.

22

of the placement your department does with any of

23

those employers?

24

MS. REEVES:

Are you tracking any numbers

We are tracking.

In most of

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 107

1

those cases, the work that they are going to be

2

doing is longer term.

3

to us and tomorrow they are ready to break ground.

4

We actually just instituted this in the past nine

5

months or less -- maybe six months or so.

6

happens is they make application, they receive a

7

letter that comes from Herman's bureau that

8

introduces them to us.

9

come in to the EDAC, which I actually sit on, I

It is not as though they come

What

By the time they actually

10

thoroughly and heavily question them about their

11

hiring needs and hiring practices.

12

the time they have come in they are already

13

connected to our Director of Business Relations.

But usually by

We have actually not had enough time

14
15

yet to see those jobs come to fruition.

16

have had maybe five who have come before us so far.

17

We are in the process, and we will track.

18

track the companies that we make referrals to as

19

well as the number of people that they actually

20

place.

21

COMMISSIONER STEELE:

I think we

We do

I mention that

22

because we would like to see some results from that.

23

I think we constantly ask about the relationship of

24

these specialized programs that are given tax
________________________________________________

 108

1

incentives.

We want to know where we are getting an

2

opportunity for employment after we have given that

3

special determination to those organizations.
MS. REEVES:

4

I will tell you that I also

5

ask them, the ones that are breaking ground on any

6

type of construction, I also always ask them about

7

construction opportunities in terms of their hiring.

8

It is not just whatever their long-term jobs may be.

9

It is the creation of whatever that project is, and

10

we want to be involved as well.
COMMISSIONER STEELE:

11
12

Thank you.

I look

forward to getting some reports on that.
Secondly, what types of partnerships

13
14

are you doing through the union organizations, in

15

terms of training opportunities with the unions?
MS. REEVES:

16

The unions are admittedly a

17

very tough nut to crack.

We have done training

18

through our State Energy Sector Partnership, which

19

is funds that we receive from the Department of

20

Labor.

21

deck that I have provided, it breaks down our non-

22

WIA programs.

23

-- we train folks in energy conservation.

24

folks for Peoples Gas, the utility gas workers'

will tell you the Urban League was considered the

primary for the CTA project as well, and they set up

a hiring center.

5

my people, and we were doing the actual screening

6

and placing of those individuals.

That hiring center was staffed by

COMMISSIONER STEELE:

But I

The last question for

8

you:

What type of ex-offender programs are you

9

partnering with in your area?

10

MS. REEVES:

11

program for everyone is Safer.

12

can let us know what types of programs they offer.

13

Many of our agencies also offer ex-offender

14

programs.

15

that has been the leader.

16

do provide ex-offender training.

The primary ex-offender
All of our agencies

But, really, Safer is kind of the one

discriminate.

they are ex-offenders or not.

22

We ask people to let us know whether
We don't

We try to identify the employers that

COMMISSIONER STEELE:

Safer is the largest

of the agencies.

designate, when they are requesting funding, that

population?
MS. REEVES:

3

We ask for that information in

4

the RFP.

5

populations they are going to work with.

6

track that and provide that as well in the

7

aggregate.
COMMISSIONER STEELE:

8
9

We ask them to identify the different

for two things.

We can

I am going to ask you

One, to get a list of the

10

organizations by District that you are funding so we

11

can be aware of them so we don't have to look in the

12

future where the summer jobs are located.

13

the agencies that we should be sending the people

14

to.

We know

Secondly, if you have a list of the

15
16

type of description they are doing, in terms of the

17

ex-offender population.

18

us so that we can be aware of those as well in our

19

Districts.

If you can share those with

20

MS. REEVES:

I will be happy to do that.

21

COMMISSIONER STEELE:

22

MS. REEVES:

Thank you.

That type of information is

23

generally available on our website.

We list the

24

awards that we give out, the total amount of awards

populations as well.
CHAIRMAN DALEY:

I think maybe we should look at a

For me to come physically in?
Hopefully, we will see

that on some of the issues.
The other one will be the concerns

14
15

Commissioner Collins mentioned with the liability.

16

If there is litigation, what liability the County

17

has.

18

think the State's Attorney looked at this.

19

remember asking if there was any liability, and they

20

kept saying, "No - no - no."

21

that you have insurance, liability insurance?

I remember when we passed it, Commissioner, I

22

MS. REEVES:

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

I think you indicated

about this 501(c)(3), something that required

economic development of a government to be on the

again with the State's Attorney's office.

John Cooke.
MR. COOKE:

Good afternoon, Commissioners.

7

The Office of Capital Planning and Policy provides

8

safe secure and accessible facilities through

9

capital construction projects for all County

10

departments and elected officials.

In our first

11

page of the slide here, we will be requesting an

12

increase of approximately two additional staff

13

members for 2014.

14

In our 2013 accomplishments, we were

15

able to fully put in a cloud-based software system

16

that allows us to manage projects more efficiently.

17

We also now have the ability to do project cost

18

forecasting and provide better financial oversight.

19

We have a dashboard now, a Web-based

20

dashboard that allows user agencies to find out the

21

status of their projects, as well as the ability to

22

submit their capital request online.

23
24

We have implemented the master
planning conceptual design for the Stroger campus,

performance energy contracts as well as provide

auditing ability to make sure that the contracts are

performing as they should.

We will be looking to add staff of an

17

that we can bring all 17,000,000 square feet of the

County-operated space up to ADA requirements.

Not in our preliminary survey.

that that is one of the ones that is on your

demolition, you want to make sure that it doesn't

that we were hoping -- our hope, rather, is that the

things that compel owners to have properties remain

properties have just remained dormant.

If that person came to

you, would that be a sale to the Land Bank or would

it be a gift to the Land Bank?

to depend on the specifics of the land and on the

to do that.

I wouldn't like to see that happen to the City of

There are two things happening.

They have totally wiped that city out.

hard with the banking community to ensure that the

State, actually did help in the community.

That is one thing.
The other thing is:

We don't want the

through the County for delinquent taxes or for other

kinds of things, Sheriff's sales, just to hold it

MR. BLEUHER:

Commissioners.

Building and Zoning.

Good afternoon,

Tim Bleuher, Commissioner of

The mission of the department is to

promote the health, safety, and welfare of

12

unincorporated Cook County's constituents for both

businesses and residences.

15

striving to make improvements for our constituents.

16

Some of these highlighted endeavors are that we have

17

increased revenues from permits and inspections.

2013 has been a
We are

We now have a strategic and proactive

18
19

system.

This has generated a twenty-five percent

20

increase in permit revenue, and a thirty-nine

21

percent increase in annual inspection revenue.

22

number also includes the gradual elimination of the

23

partial waivers.

24

we were giving a one hundred percent waiver on

Board before the end of this calendar year the

with our sister governments that currently utilize

rather get a violation than actually have to drive

MR. PRZYBYLO:

Good afternoon.

Andrew

18

Przybylo, Secretary to the Zoning Board of Appeals.

19

The mission of the Zoning Board of Appeals is to

20

promote proper development of land in conformance

21

with the Cook County zoning ordinance and the

22

Comprehensive Land Use Plan.

23
24

Some of our accomplishments over the
last fiscal year is to satisfy as many customers as

 146

1

possible, that is to say participants in people

2

petitioning the Zoning Board, and to provide correct

3

public notices so that transparency exists, and

4

complete the hearing process on a timely basis.
We have, with our STAR report,

5
6

satisfied ninety-six percent of our customer base,

7

our attendees.

We have had a high rate of correct

8

notifications.

Our findings and our recommendations

9

to this Board have been submitted on the ninety-day

10

per ordinance requirement.

11

Our budget highlights going forward is

12

to increase ongoing communications to the public and

13

municipalities and interested parties about

14

permitting and the zoning process by the County's

15

website.

16

and equipment needed to ensure that the public can

17

attendance.

Commissioner Suffredin.
Thank you, Mr.

Chairman, and ladies and gentlemen of the Committee.
Mr. Przybylo, how many members do we
have on the ZBA?

11

MR. PRZYBYLO:

Currently we have three.

12

COMMISSIONER SUFFREDIN:

13

MR. PRZYBYLO:

The three are --

The three are Kevin Freeman,

Paul Montes, and Hank Oszakiewski, who is the newest

Board member from Justice.

16

Development.
MR. BREWER:

12
13

You're welcome.

Next is the Bureau of Economic

10
11

Thank you.

I will just summarize from

where I began.
We have had a robust discussion of

14
15

three plus hours, I think, where we have seen a

16

great detail of work underway in the Bureau of

17

Economic Development and Planning and Capital, Real

18

Estate, Building and Zoning, the Zoning Board of

19

Appeals.

20

work underway.

21

As you can see, we have an awful lot of

There has been a lot of rebuilding,

22

reinvention, recalibrating of our staff efforts, of

23

our resources.

24

One of the really exciting things we
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 149

1

think we have been able to generate net new revenues

2

to the County by virtue of this work coming out of

3

each of these departments.

4

recitation in Building and Zoning is reflective of a

5

substantial change in how work is conducted there.

6

We are now driving fees through the permit work and

7

the revised ways in which the inspections are being

8

done.

9

Again, Tim Bleuher's

Those areas in the County in the

10

unincorporated are areas where we have agreements

11

going, and being covered in ways that these services

12

are being provided that had not been before.

13

In our Capital Planning areas, you can

14

tell we have a very creative approach to developing

15

not only new projects, but with new ways of looking

16

at projects, recasting old projects, as well as

17

discovering new ways to generate new revenue

18

opportunities for this County.

19

Again, in summary, in the real estate

20

management we are very, very happy with the progress

21

and the outcomes of the US Equities report.

22

looking at seventeen-million-plus square feet of

23

County property that we have been responsible for,

24

and setting the framework for an asset management

It is

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 150

1

plan going forward that will yield us a very

2

different set of outcomes with our real estate

3

assets.
We are collecting rents at a much more

4
5

robust pace than in the past.

6

particularly in 69 West.

7

floor now being leased out, and other leases being

8

worked on on a daily basis.

9

this work.

10
11

We have new tenants,

We have the thirty-fourth

We are very proud of

We hope to be continuing to be very

aggressive going forward.
Again, a lot of what we have discussed

12

and outlined has been the result of our both

13

internally working with you various Commissioners,

14

but also with the other departments of the County,

15

whether they be the Department of Highways, the

16

Department of Environmental Control, Finance,

17

Budget, the Comptroller, the President's Office.

18

Everyone has had a hand, a foot, a finger, an arm, a

19

leg -- anything possible to help us build and

20

develop these new lines of work.

21

The new dollars that we have secured

22

from HUD, we will continue to pursue.

The new

23

philanthropic dollars we will continue to pursue.

24

We have solidified a number of new partners with us,
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 151

1

whether they be corporate leaders, whether they be

2

institutional leaders, or nonprofits; certainly with

3

a number of municipalities.

4

seventeen Mayors in the last forty-five days.

5

of the staff has done the same.

I think I have met with
Much

Again, we are very proud of this work.

6
7

We hope to continue going forward.

I know each of

8

you will see members of my staff as well as me

9

outside of this building.

We are in all of the

10

municipalities very regularly.

11

your help, and we will continue to move forward and

12

be very, very aggressive, and hope for our positive

13

outcomes.

14

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

15

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

Again, thank you for

Vice Chair Sims.
Herman, did you get the

16

answers to the questions we asked you before the

17

break?

18
19
20

MR. BREWER:

COMMISSIONER SIMS:
to the budget book?

22

budget page?

24

We got it all for you.

I will hand it to you when we adjourn.

21

23

Yes.

Is there a correction

Or is there a correction to the

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

It won't be corrected yet,

but I would assume, because I don't have it, he is
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 152

1

going to read it into the record.

2

MS. GIBSON:

Is this about the CDBG?

3

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

Yes.

About CDBG and

4

the positions in the budget book that is grant-

5

funded, and it is seven.

6

grant-funded.

7

he stated there are no people.

8

MR. BREWER:

9

Herman says there were no

He needs to make a correction because

The seven new positions being

advertised are not grant-funded.

The eight

10

positions that had been eliminated were grant-funded

11

positions.

12

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

13

seven positions are not grant-funded.

14

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

He is saying that the

My understanding is they

15

are going to meet with the Budget Director between

16

now and Monday.

17

she has been given the opportunity to review it,

18

they will be able to provide it to you on Monday.

19

She wants to verify that.

20

They will get it corrected.

MS. GIBSON:

That is right.

After

I would like

21

to have an opportunity to verify that.

I will tell

22

you preliminarily that we believe we will have to

23

make a correction in the year-to-date column for

24

CDBG and Home.

It looks like the column captured

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 153

1

the old business unit.

2

this situation where the business unit changed year

3

over year, it was picking up the old business unit.

4

It didn't fully reflect all of the expenditures.

5

But we will get you that complete answer on Monday.

6

This is technical, and in

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

The concern is that we

7

should have a correction to that.

8

people off and you are telling people that the

9

reason why we are laying you off is because the

10

funding for the grant expired.

11

and you hire people.

12

MS. GIBSON:

13
14
15

Then you turn around

I'm sorry, Commissioner.

I

was referencing the year-to-date expenditures.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

That was Commissioner

Fritchey's question.

16

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

17

reference to the grants.

18

and get back to you on Monday.

19

If you are laying

That one, and then in
She is going to review it

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

We just want to make

20

sure that it is reflected in the budget.

21

want to see seven new people hired under a grant and

22

they just laid off seven people.

23

MR. BREWER:

24

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

I don't

That won't be possible.
Or I don't see four new

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 154

1

people coming on board and seven people were laid

2

off.
MS. GIBSON:

3

The seven people that Herman

4

referenced are different positions than they are in

5

the General Fund.

6

will provide you that.

They are not on grants, but we

7

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

8

MR. BREWER:

9

You mean the seven new?

The seven new positions -- for

example, one of them is for ADA compliance manager,

10

one is an energy manager.

Two are in the economic

11

development, financial analyst positions.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

12

Didn't you have

13

somebody in that position already?

14

new one?

15

that was grant-funded?

17

Didn't you have somebody in that position

MR. BREWER:

16

No.

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

19

titles?

20

people?

So that person has two

Or are you talking about two different

21

MR. BREWER:

22

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

24

I have an economic

development deputy who is a financial professional.

18

23

You are hiring a

No.
I

misunderstood what

you said.
MR. BREWER:

I listed the positions that we

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 155

1

are going to be advertising.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

2
3

positions?

4

MR. BREWER:

5

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

6

That was two different

Yes.
So she will review it and

report back to us on Monday.

7

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

8

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

9

COMMISSIONER MURPHY:

Okay.

Commissioner Murphy.
To follow up on that,

10

does that mean that you are going to show if there

11

is money that is expended this year maybe in

12

brackets, in the 2014 budget will show it not in

13

brackets?

14

and you only spend $5000 this year, you have $15,000

15

left.

16

In other words, if $20,000 is going out

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

Commissioner, in all

17

likelihood there will be an amendment in the budget.

18

It will be offered by the Budget Office, and will

19

show specifically the correction in the budget.

20

That is on this one or any other one.

21

COMMISSIONER MURPHY:

It is hard to know

22

what we are doing if we don't know how much money is

23

left over.

24

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

She does have the

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 156

1

authority in the budget resolution to make technical

2

amendments.

MS. GIBSON:

3
4

Not major.
That's right; just

corrections.

5

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

Commissioner Moore.

6

COMMISSIONER MOORE:

I just wanted to

7

applaud the efforts of the Department for using US

8

Equities to catalog and document all of the Cook

9

County capital projects that are going on.
One of my concerns is -- and I will

10
11

address this concern -- I also asked Jim D'Amico

12

recently how they are going to catalog and document

13

facilities work.
Is the microphone now working?

14

The

15

question was:

We are using US Equities to document

16

and catalog all of Capital Planning's work ongoing

17

so we have a one-stop shop, if you will; is that

18

correct?
MR. BREWER:

19

Commissioner, that is where we

20

are going.

We have cataloged and documented all of

21

the County-owned buildings, in terms of the

22

facilities' conditions.

23

on the repair costs, timing, and things of that

24

nature.

We have sort of estimates

It has effectively given us the framework

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 157

1

for an asset management plan, for how we deal with

2

the properties going forward.
There will be other recommendations

3
4

forthcoming about how we make adjustments to carry

5

forward on the recommendations.

6

working on that throughout the year.
COMMISSIONER MOORE:

7

But we will be

I thought that the

8

purpose for the US Equities contract is so we can

9

document and catalog the work that is taking place

10

currently, the capital work?

11

MR. COOKE:

12
13

John Cooke, Capital Planning

Director.
Yes, Commissioner.

Part of the

14

outcome of the US Equities study is that we do now

15

have a comprehensive software program that allows us

16

to track Capital Planning projects, track real

17

estate, property data.

18

that Facilities can also link into that would allow

19

us to integrate the work orders as well as the

20

capital projects all into one.

21
22
23
24

It has an enterprise version

We haven't taken that step yet, but it
does have that ability.
COMMISSIONER MOORE:

That was one of the

concerns when I worked for Capital is how would we
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 158

1

document and catalog the work that is being done so

2

that we don't duplicate services; especially if

3

Facilities and Capital are not communicating on

4

every project.
MR. COOKE:

5

A year ago.

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

4

Commissioner Gainer.

Chairman.
I had a question that came up

5
6

yesterday.

7

here -- is that right, Andrea?

8
9

Thank you, Mr.

Andrea and I agreed that we would ask it

There was a question that I had asked
the Budget Director.

There was a bucket for $29

10

million in other revenues.

11

rebates or things tied to contracts that were

12

generated in the Capital Planning Department.

13

One of those was around

The question I asked was:

a better

14

understanding of how you guys were managing things

15

that you were actually able to recoup some revenues.

16

Then, to reiterate my request to Andrea, which is:

17

If there are expenses for contracts, whether it is

18

personnel or payments to a vendor that are in one

19

department, but yet the revenues are captured

20

somewhere else; it makes it really hard to track the

21

back and forth, especially since these contracts can

22

get complicated in multiyears.

23

a personal plea that that stuff stays together;

24

otherwise I think it gets really hard.

I would like to make

I think it

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

was Johnson Controls and some of these other

2

contracts.
Andrea, which contract was it that was

3
4

generating revenue?
MS. GIBSON:

5

Actually, I think I conflated

6

two issues yesterday when we talked about this.

7

There are rebates that are in the miscellaneous

8

revenue line that are a million dollars from

9

installing some equipment.

10

separately energy savings.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

11
12
13
14
15
16

Then there is also

Energy savings; that

was it.
MS. GIBSON:

Which is the result of some of

this effort.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

The result was from a

contract that resided in Capital Planning?

17

MS. GIBSON:

Yes.

18

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

Then how come in

19

Capital Planning, if they bear the expense, they

20

don't have the revenue come forward?

21

MS. GIBSON:

The utility costs are budgeted

22

outside of Capital Planning.

That is where the

23

savings show themselves.

24

System or at the jail, we have a pool for some of

For example, at the Health

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 164

1

the smaller facilities.

That is where the savings

2

are from the work that Capital Planning is doing.

3

It is an investment on their end, but we reap the

4

benefits in the utility account.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

5

I understand that,

6

but we are able to track the amount of savings that

7

achieves on the utility bills?

8

that is part of the contract.

9

MS. GIBSON:

10
11
12
13

Because I believe

I will defer to John Cooke on

that.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

How does the tracking

work, John?
MR. COOKE:

The tracking for the energy

14

guaranteed performance energy contract -- we are in

15

the process of hiring an energy manager.

The

16

project is about fifty percent complete.

We have

17

another year of construction work.
At that time, the energy manager, the

18
19

County energy manager will be responsible for making

20

sure that the kilowatts and therms -- the energy use

21

is reduced by these improvements that we have made.

22

The reduction in the consumption of energy will then

23

yield money.

24

that the County has to spend on energy.

It reduces the baseline as a savings
So that

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 165

will be done.

2

and audited by our energy manager.

3
4
5

That will be reviewed, maintained,

Then on an annual basis we talk to the
County Auditor to take a look at it for us also.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

The personnel that

6

are responsible and accountable for delivering the

7

value of the energy savings work for you?

8

MR. COOKE:

Yes.

He or she will.

9

COMMISSIONER GAINER:

But the savings, when

10

accrued, go into a general kind of bucket in the

11

corporate level?

12
13
14

MS. GIBSON:

Specifically in the utility

account, in this case.
COMMISSIONER GAINER:

I made my point.

I

15

think when we do these contracts that have these

16

incentives built into them, some of them are better

17

structured than others.

18

19

the savings and the expense in the same department,

I think it will make it a lot easier to track.
