PROPOSED RESOLUTION
EXAMINING THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A REVOLVING BAIL BOND FUND
FOR COOK COUNTY JAIL DETAINEES
WHEREAS, the Cook County Jail has been at or near capacity for most of 2013; and
WHEREAS, the average cost of keeping a detainee in custody at the Jail has been estimated to cost $143 a
day; and
WHEREAS, the average length of stay for detainees who post bond was 13 days in 2013; and
WHEREAS, it often costs more to keep a detainee in custody than their assessed bail bond is worth; and
WHEREAS, any bail made sooner will save Cook County $143 per detainee released, per day; and
WHEREAS, many detainees are non-violent offenders and not flight risks for whom judges have low bond
amounts that the offender cannot post, and thus would pose little risk to the general public should they be
released from custody on bail; and
WHEREAS¸ a possible solution to the problem would be to create the “Cook County Revolving Bail Bond
Fund;” and
WHEREAS, the purpose of the fund shall be to provide no-interest loans to detainees at the Cook County
Jail for payment of their court-ordered bail bond and provide an ongoing source of funding through
achieved savings; and
WHEREAS, in order to be eligible for a loan in the fund, detainees must meet requirements, including but
not limited to, the following: 1) be charged with a non-violent misdemeanor or felony; 2) not use the loan
proceeds for payment of private legal services; 3) be eligible for a “c” or “d” bond which entails the posting
of a total bond amount of $2,000 or less (i.e., if the “c” bond is for $20,000 or less, or the “d” bond is for
$2,000 or less); 4) the posting of such bond will cause the detainees release from custody; and 5) possess
health insurance at the time of release or apply for CountyCare at the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System.
NOW THERE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Budget Director and the Executive Director of
the Justice Advisory Council (JAC) shall review the legal and financial feasibility of a program to establish
a revolving bond fund to provide prompt posting of bail for non-violent detainees and make a
recommendation to the Board of Commissioners by March 1, 2014. The purpose of the fund shall be to
provide no-interest loans to detainees at the Cook County Jail for payment of their court-ordered bail bond
and provide an ongoing source of funding through achieved savings. The recommendation to be provided
to the board shall include: a legal review of authority to pay such bonds; a method for loaning such funds
to non-violent detainees; a financial model to identify savings; a recommended amount for the fund; and,
if recommended for implementation, an implementation plan. In order to be eligible for a loan, detainees
must meet requirements, including but not limited to the following: 1) be charged with a non-violent
misdemeanor or felony; 2) not use the loan proceeds for payment of private legal services; 3) be eligible

for a “c” or “d” bond which entails the posting of a total bond amount of $2,000 or less (i.e., if the “c”

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CREATING “ACCOUNTABILITY CHARGES” FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE SHAKMAN
CONSENT DECREE
WHEREAS, violations of the Shakman Consent Decree cost Cook County over $600,000.00 in Fiscal
Year 2013 and millions of dollars in previous fiscal years; and
WHEREAS, payments for violations of the Shakman Consent Decree are deducted from the Cook County
Self-Insurance Fund; and
WHEREAS, there is no financial penalty to individual departments that violate the Shakman Consent
Decree; and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Budget Director and the Chief Financial
Officer of Cook County shall develop a plan to assess an “Accountability Charge” against any Department
that is found to be in violation of the Shakman Consent Decree in Fiscal Year 2013 and future years; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the “Accountability Charge” shall be a deduction in the operating
funds of the Department in an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the total amount assessed for the
violation of the Shakman Consent Decree and the deducted funds shall be transferred to the Cook County
Self Insurance Fund;

BOARD AGENDA

November 13, 2013

Contract Number(s): N/A
Summary: The Department of Human Rights and Ethics is preparing to transfer all hearing
officer/administrative law judge services to the Office of Administrative Hearings in FY2014. In closing
out payments to existing Commission on Human Rights Hearing Officers for FY2013, the Department
discovered an unpaid invoice from Hearing Officer David L. Lee for services rendered in June and July
2013 for $5,323.17. The Department contacted Hearing Officer David L. Lee to determine whether he has
already rendered any other non-invoiced services to the Commission on Human Rights since this June-July
2013 invoice, and he estimates this sum to be no more than $285.00. Hearing Officer David L. Lee will
not render any additional services for the Commission on Human Rights during FY2013, and the
Department has contacted all other Commission on Human Rights Hearing Officers to ensure that
anticipated FY2013 billing does not exceed $5,000.00 in aggregate for any Hearing Officer. Going
forward, hearing officer/administrative law judge services will be provided to the Commission on Human
Rights by the Office of Administrative Hearings in FY2014 and that will ensure that the Department does
not exceed the direct payment limit of $5,000.00 for hearing officer/administrative law judge services.

Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). While this program ended previously, demand
for down payment assistance funds remains. Specifically, a high level of interest among lenders and
prospective homebuyers in west suburban Cook County has been identified. In order to address this
persistent demand, the Department would like to implement a pilot program for this purpose. OPRHC will
administer down payment assistance programming in west suburban Cook County. We respectfully
request approval of this grant award, and that the Bureau Chief of Economic Development or his/her

(AIFH) in 2012 which included an assessment of barriers to fair housing choice. HUD requires that Cook
County take proactive documented measures to address said impediments in order to fulfill its Federal fair
housing commitments. CAFHA will provide a variety of related fair housing professional services to

PROPOSED CONTRACT (TECHNOLOGY)
Department(s): Bureau of Technology
Vendor: NTT America, Inc., New York, New York
Request: Authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute.

Good(s) or Service(s): Web hosting and related professional services.
Contract Value: $422,000.00
Contract period: 10/1/2013 through 12/31/2014, with two (2) one-year renewal options.
Potential Fiscal Year Budget Impact: FY 2013: $250,000.00; FY 2014: $167,000.00; FY 2015:
$5,000.00
Accounts: 009/441 ($75,000.00); 490/441 ($347,000.00)
Contract Number(s): 1341-13159
Concurrence(s):
The vendor has met the Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprise Ordinance.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: The Bureau of Technology (BOT) is requesting approval to enter into a twenty-four (24)
month, sole source agreement with NTT for the purpose of providing web hosting services. Cook County
developed its current website in NTT’s hosting environment after NTT won an RFP for provide hosting
services. After the competitive award, the County developed its website on NTT’s hosting servers, for
which NTT held a proprietary license. Now, because the County’s website relies upon this licensed
technology (i.e., an NTT-owned operating system license), migrating to another website hosting service
would require the County to rebuild its entire website in a manner that does not rely upon NTT’s operating
system license. Simply rebuilding the County’s current website as-is from the ground up is an inefficient
use of taxpayer dollars.
Instead, BOT will focus on a rebuild that also redesigns and modernizes the County’s website, for which the
County issued an RFP on 10/15/2013. Procuring a redesigned and modern replacement solution will allow
the County to migrate to a different hosting provider. Also during the remainder of the two year term of
the NTT agreement, and while BOT remains in NTT’s hosting environment, BOT will virtualize its
website servers, which will allow the County to utilize NTT’s cloud hosting services and retire BOT’s
current, legacy hosting services that NTT is maintaining solely for Cook County. This virtualization will
save an expected $120,000.00 over the remainder of the two year agreement.

Fiscal Impact: $4,618.28
Accounts: 335-440
Contract Number(s): N/A
Summary: The services were to provide maintenance coverage for mailroom equipment. The proposed
renewal invoice for the equipment was received subsequent to the scheduled renewal period. Once the
invoice was received the Clerk of the Circuit Court (Clerk’s Office) requested for a portion of the
maintenance cost to be removed from the proposed amount due to the equipment software and hardware
being obsolete. Additionally, in an effort to generate cost savings and due to infrequent equipment
breakdowns the Clerk’s Office contacted the vendor to request for all maintenance costs to be removed.
Upon receiving the new invoices it was discovered that the invoice amount included maintenance costs for
the entire year instead of a pro-rated amount up to the date the vendor received the Clerk’s Office
notification request. The revised invoices were recently received, totaling $4,618.28. Due to the Direct Pay
limit the Clerk’s Office would exceed the $5,000.00 direct pay amount.
