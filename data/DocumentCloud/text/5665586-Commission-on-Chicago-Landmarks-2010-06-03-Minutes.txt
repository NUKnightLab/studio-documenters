Proposal:

Proposed construction of a one-story, rear rooftop addition; alterations to exterior
and interior designated spaces to accommodate circulation and accessibility;
construction of an ADA ramp at the front entry; and replacement of original steel
grillwork and entry doors with bronze replicas

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
Exterior Doors and Grillwork
1. The original decorative steel doors and grillwork on the front (south)
elevation, proposed to be removed and replic ated in bronze, are original and
significant historical and architectural features of the building and shall not
be removed. The doors shall be retained, repaired, and preserved in situ,
consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation
#2;
2. Historic Preservation staff will continue to work with the applicant regarding
any necessary repairs and/or hardware upgrades to the historic doors as part
of reactivating the main entrance of the building and making it accessible.
Prior to or as part of the permit application, the applicant shall submit a
report by a qualified materials conservator assessing the condition of the
existing doors and grillwork and determine the appropriate treatment to
address any necessary repairs;
Interior Alterations
3. As much of the original stone and stone surrounds shall be salvaged and
reused as possible. If replacement stone is required, the new stone shall
match the existing stone in color, finish, profile, and dimension. Samples of
existing and new stone shall be submitted to staff for review and approval
prior to order and installation;
4. Existing and proposed door and surround details shall be included in the
permit drawings;
Ramp and Dock Alterations
5. The screen wall for the new accessibility ramp should be further studied,
such as “stepping” the top of the ramp to better coordinate with the façade of
the building. As proposed, the wall of the ramp and new landing slab shall
be granite to match the existing granite. Masonry samples shall be submitted
to Historic Preservation staff for review and approval prior to order and
installation;
6. The new metal canopy shall be designed (e.g., in terms of design, details,

be factory finished with a color to match the existing metalwork on the

 building. Dimensioned detail drawings and attachment details of the canopy
shall be included with the permit plans;
Fourth-Floor Addition
7. Glass and masonry samples shall be submitted to Historic Preservation Staff
for review and approval prior to order and installation;
8. The new metal flashing proposed for behind the historic metal grillwork at
the existing masonry openings in the parapet as part of the new addition shall
be painted a dark gray matte color to reduce its visibility; and,
9. New rooftop HVAC equipment shall be located as far away as possible from
the parapet to minimize visibility from the public way.

(Arlington-Deming District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed 1-story rooftop addition to existing 2-story masonry townhouse and
alterations to the south masonry parapet wall

Action:

The Committee unanimously found that the project, given the specific
circumstances and conditions of the project and the property, would not have an
adverse effect on the significant historical and architectural features of the
landmark district and conditionally approved the project subject to these
conditions, to be reviewed and approved by Historic Preservation staff:
1. As proposed, the rooftop addition is to be clad with fiber-cement siding on
the east, south and west elevations. The siding shall have a smooth finish
and otherwise match the wood siding typical of the district in size, profile,
lap exposure, and finish. The addition siding, trim, roofing shingles, gutters
and downspouts shall be a dark matte or non-reflective color to minimize
their potential visibility. Samples of the color shall be reviewed and
approved by Historic Preservation staff prior to permit approval, and details
of the siding material shall be included in the permit plans; and, and
window/storefront details shall be included in the drawings; and,
2. As proposed, the height of the south parapet wall shall be extended and
constructed with common brick, to match existing. The Historic
