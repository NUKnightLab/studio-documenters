MONTHLY NEWS AND INFORMATION FROM YOUR RETIREMENT BOARD

On behalf of the entire Retirement Board and the Firemen’s Annuity &
Benefit Fund Staff, we want to express our heartfelt condolences to the
Bucio family and our Chicago Fire Department (CFD) family on the
tragic loss of Firefighter/EMT Juan J. Bucio. In particular, our thoughts
and prayers go out to Mr. Bucio’s two sons, Joshua, age ten and Jacob,
age nine.
FF/EMT Juan J. Bucio, 46, is survived by his nine siblings, including a
sister who is a member of the Chicago Police Department and a brother
who is a member of the CFD.
The EMWQ has set up a Memorial Fund in honor of FF/EMT Juan J.
Bucio. 100% of the proceeds donated to the EMWQ Juan Bucio
Memorial Fund will go to Mr. Bucio’s family.
Donations can be made directly to Mr. Bucio’s EMWQ Memorial Fund via PayPal on the EMWQ
website at http://www.widowsandchildren.org/. Donations can also be made in person at any BMO
Harris Bank branch, or by mail to EMWQ Bucio Memorial Fund, 20 S. Clark St., Suite 1400,

Thank you to all for honoring the sacrifice made by FF/EMT Juan J. Bucio and the entire Bucio
