changes and make the necessary decisions to ensure this government will be
financially viable and responsible to the taxpayers it represents and efficiently
provide the services for which it is mandated; and

where to make cuts, if necessary, is essential to running an effective
organization.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners does hereby request that a desk audit be conducted of every
employment position; including those of all elected officials, by industrial
engineers to substantiate the need for the position and that the individuals
meet the qualifications that are consistent with the job title or required duties.

informed decisions as to which positions are essential in order to fulfill the
mandate of Cook County Government's core mission .
