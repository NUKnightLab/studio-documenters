couple of additional responses, but I will be

where he was a senior project manager there.

15

has worked with the CIT and handled the Retrofit

One project on behalf of the PBC, so he's very

familiar with the Infrastructure Trust.

18

First is George Marquisos who is to my

managing our street lighting project for the CIT.

3

I'm thrilled to welcome him.

4

join me in welcoming him and getting to know him

5

as soon as you can.

So I hope you'll

The second person who starts with us

7

and Monday is Patricia Dominguez who is here on

her lunch hour and sitting in the back.

9

your hand, Patty.

Raise

Manager of Administrative Services and a project

14

years.

15

really is going to make this board meeting -- you

16

will now have a lot better information going

17

forward and she will make it very easy to be

18

working with the CIT going forward.

19

you will enjoy working with both George and

20

Patricia as much as I do.

21

welcoming them.

22

I have worked with her for many

She is really a skilled administrator and

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So I know

So thank you for

Great.

Welcome guys.

23

don't know, Leslie, if you were planning to

24

particularly given George's background and

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

I

 5

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

expertise and what he's working on; but if

2

everyone could carve out some time to visit with

3

George and get to know him and get his thoughts

4

on things and provide some feedback would be a

5

good thing to do.

6

MR. MARQUISOS:

I welcome that.

7

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

All right.

The next on

8

the agenda is board officer appointment which I

9

expect to be very controversial.

10

MR. LINGENFELTER:

I don't remember --

11

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

You don't remember -- Do

12

you remember when we called you and said

13

congrats.

14

MR. FALK:

Double the pay.

15

MS. DARLING:

16

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

For you triple.
Right.

So everyone

17

should have received a resolution to be adopted

18

electing our secretary treasurer as Carl

19

Lingenfelter a member of the board.

20

questions about this, Scott, just in 30 seconds,

21

60 seconds on why they need to do it.

22

MR. FALK:

Any

So the bylaws and the ordinance

23

from the City of Chicago creating the Trust

24

require that there be an officer of the board

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 6

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

entitled secretary treasurer.

2

a little unusual.

3

treasurer would be an officer of the Trust not of

4

the board, but that's how it's been historically.

5

You'll replace Diane Ferguson who did a fine job

6

in that role previously.

7

officer.

8
9

Typically -- it's

Typically the secretary

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And so it's a board

Great.

Any questions on

the resolution for the secretary treasurer?

10

there a motion by anyone other than Mr.

11

Lingenfelter?

12

MS. HUBBARD:

13

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

14

So moved.

Second by Mr. Zarate.

15

Is

Moved by Miss Hubbard.
All those in favor.

(Chorus of ayes.)

16

MR. LINGENFELTER:

I'll abstain.

17

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Congrats.

Triple the

18

pay.

We should also welcome a new member of our

19

advisory board, Alderman Scott, who was appointed

20

by the Mayor this week to join our advisory board

21

which as everyone knows is a collection of folks

22

who are meant to provide expertise and support to

23

the staff and to the board in various areas.

24

his background working with some of our sister

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

And

 7

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

agents here and effectively our clients in many

2

cases is an exciting addition for all of us and

3

will contribute a lot to the work of the Trust.

4

So welcome.

5

MR. SCOTT:

Thank you.

6

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

This is the part where

7

you guys are supposed to grill him and haze him.

8

Okay.

9

Next is the benefits.

MS. DARLING:

Sure.

When we last met in

10

August we talked about how important it was for

11

the CIT to have an appropriate benefit package to

12

offer employees to both retain and recruit.

13

have been lucky enough to recruit two employees

14

so far.

15

to recruit many more, but it is important for us

16

to have -- to have an appropriate benefit

17

package.

18

I

And I hope as we grow that we'll be able

I am still working on health benefits,

19

but in the meantime I have been able to secure a

20

401K plan for the CIT.

21

of research on this and have made the -- or want

22

to make the recommendation today that we go with

23

a company called Betterment for Business.

24

offered a turnkey solution that's affordable and

I did a tremendous amount

They

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

 8

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

very easy to administer.

2

shop.

3

internet.

4

Infrastructure Trust.

It's sort of a one-stop

Much of it can be done through the

5

There is no cost to the Chicago

As an early adopter to their program,

6

they agreed to waive their $1500 annual fee.

7

Typically for small businesses with a -- with a

8

401K plan, you have an administrator.

9

also a large expense for record keeping,

10

etcetera.

11

Betterment is providing for us.

12

There is

All of that is wrapped into what

There is a low cost to participants,

13

it's .7 percent or less and that includes fees

14

for investments which is also very unusual.

15

the fee includes advice, trades, fund expenses

16

and account administration.

17

turnkey solution for us.

18

for me requires very limited burden on

19

administrative staff at the CIT which was

20

important for me.

21

and I am happy to answer any questions.

22

questions?

23
24

And

So it's an all-in

And it -- importantly

So this is my recommendation

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

No.

Any

The only thing I can

say about Betterment, I'm familiar with them.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 9

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

They have great technology, great software.

2

think it will be a great tool for the folks that

3

join the team.

4

So well done.

All right.

Do we need a motion to --

5

Okay.

6

Betterment for Business as our 401K provider.

So motion to approve the selection of

7

MS. HUBBARD:

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

12

Second.

second by Miss Hubbard.

10
11

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:
Okay.

All in favor?

Any opposed?

Great.

Now, the fun begins.

MS. DARLING:

14

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

16

Moved by Mr. Zarate,

(Chorus of ayes.

13

15

I

Yes.

Now we get to work.
Strategic planning.

Go

for it.
MS. DARLING:

So as all of you on the board

17

are aware, except for Alderman Scott who joined

18

us yesterday; we have been in the midst since I

19

started in a strategic planning process in an

20

effort to work on the Chicago Infrastructure

21

Trust 2.0 at the request of the Mayor and do a

22

reboot of the Infrastructure Trust.

23
24

And in an effort to do that we have
been working closely with the CCA, the Civic

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 10

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

Consulting Alliance, and we have been working

2

with Antonio Benecchi who joins us here, raise

3

your hand, Antonio.

4

Brian Fabes at the CCA, we were lucky enough to

5

have Tom Budescu be assigned to us as our CCA

6

fellow.

7

which has been wonderful.

8

to work with us at the CIT every day since

9

December and he has been engaged in a very

And through Antonio and

He is secunded to us for three months
So Tom has been coming

10

serious strategic framework discussion with you

11

on the board, other stakeholders and helping us

12

plan for the future.

13

And so I am going to turn it over to

14

Tom to give an update on his work so far.

15

really want to express my appreciation to both

16

him personally and to the CCA for the terrific

17

support that they have given the CIT as we -- as

18

we find a really successful path forward.

19

based on Tom's work so far, I am very excited

20

about the path we see ahead of us.

21

over to you.

22

MR. BUDESCU:

Thanks, Leslie.

And I

And

I'll turn it

So as Leslie

23

gave a good overview of the scope, you know, I

24

think the CCA's working with the CIT to help

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 11

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

define and clarify the strategic and operational

2

framework with an eye towards effectively

3

delivering needed infrastructure projects and

4

over time an aim to become self-sustaining.

5

You know, the critical elements of

6

what this entails in terms of our analysis is

7

defining what the appropriate scope of CIT

8

activities are, thinking through the project

9

evaluation framework and also figuring out an

10

operating model that complements the strategic

11

goals of the CIT.

12

As Leslie mentioned it's been a --

13

I've been secunded for three months and that's

14

set the project schedule starting around mid

15

December and we are probably going to keep going

16

through mid March.

17

A quick update on where we are and

18

what's still left to do.

We identified a list of

19

key stakeholders and also formed a Project

20

Steering Committee.

21

all the identified key stakeholders and that's

22

amounted to over a dozen interviews and begun to

23

synthesize the stakeholder feedback regarding --

24

as well as internal CIT guidance regarding the

To date we've interviewed

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 12

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

updated organizational mission and goals.

2

And we are in the process of having

3

the first Steering Committee to review and

4

finalize that high-level organizational mission

5

and goal.

6
7
8
9

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Tom, can you just remind

everyone who is on the Steering Committee?
MR. BUDESCU:

Yes, absolutely.

So the Board

Chairman, Kurt Summers, is on the Steering

10

Committee along with the City's CFO, Carol Brown.

11

The Deputy Mayor, Steve Koch.

12

Rebekah Scheinfeld from the Department of

13

Transportation and David Narefsky who is on the

14

Board of the Civic Consulting Alliance and also

15

sort of a nationally known expert in the

16

infrastructure finance community.

17

Commissioner,

And, you know, once that portion -- we

18

are progressing on that portion and then moving

19

forward after the finalization of the updated

20

organizational mission and goals, we are going to

21

look to better define the more grand strategic

22

and operational decisions which, you know,

23

includes defining the project screening and

24

operational strategies.

And then finally

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 13

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

refining and finalizing a comprehensive report

2

that captures the mission as well as the

3

strategic and operational framework in

4

articulating the value proposition for the

5

Infrastructure Trust.

6

And so I did want to walk you guys

7

through some of our initial findings based off of

8

the key stakeholder interviews.

9

as I noted these remain drafts that will continue

And, you know,

10

to be refined with feedback from the Steering

11

Committee as well as the key stakeholders.

12

Leslie, would you --

13

MS. DARLING:

Oh, I'm sorry, yes.

14

MR. BUDESCU:

So the first focus we've had

15

is refining the mission and guiding principle

16

based on key stakeholder interviews.

17

that there's been a fair amount of consensus

18

regarding what the CIT mission and guiding

19

principles should be.

20

to take an initial draft in laying them out with

21

saying the CIT shall seek to leverage alternative

22

financing and delivery structured to expand the

23

capacity of the City and other government

24

agencies to deliver new and improve existing

We've found

And we have sort of tried

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 14

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

infrastructure.

2

And building into that the principles

3

that will guide the CIT will include, you know,

4

looking to provide services that are

5

complementary to the City and that responds to

6

the needs of the City and its sister agencies.

7

Insuring value to the City and its sister

8

agencies and through that the City taxpayers and

9

the delivery of infrastructure projects.

And

10

looking to act as a dedicated specialized

11

resource for alternative project delivery to the

12

City and its sister agencies.

13

And then on the next slide, you know,

14

we've talked to a lot of the stakeholders about

15

how do we refine the intermediary and long-term

16

goals and the vision for what the CIT wants to

17

achieve.

18

of conversation about really establishing

19

intermediary goals and achieving them and

20

building the framework for the success of the

21

ambitious vision of the CIT.

22

And, you know, I think we've had a lot

I won't go into too much detail

23

knowing we've only got a limited amount of time;

24

but, you know, on the organizational structure we

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 15

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

want to sort of continue building and expanding

2

on the personnel and institutional resources.

3

operational funding, you know, we want to

4

introduce external revenue streams that fit the

5

structure and strategy of the CIT.

6

increase the proportion of the operational

7

funding that's being funded from these external

8

revenue sources.

On

And over time

9

We want to expand our base of

10

knowledge to grow to become a nationally

11

recognized subject matter expert, and one that

12

can be a great resource to the City and the

13

sister agencies.

14

we want to really focus on project execution

15

initially and getting things right and taking

16

successes to market.

17

and be even more ambitious as we start to build a

18

base of project success.

19
20
21

MS. DARLING:

And I think on the project side

And over time build on that

That's all I have.

Any questions for Tom or me on

the project?
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Tom, have you been able

22

to visit with all the advisory board members as

23

well?

24

MR. BUDESCU:

Well, I have been not with

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 16

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1
2
3

Alderman Scott, but I'm sure we can work on -CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

You've had a whole 24

hours.

4

MR. BUDESCU:

5

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

6

MR. BUDESCU:

7

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Great.

8

MR. LINGENFELTER:

I just wanted to note,

9

Yes.
But the others you have?

I have.

Tom, we glossed over this.

Tom is donated by EY

10

to CCA for this period of time.

11

example of the private sector investing in the

12

City's infrastructure right from the start.

13

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Great.

So that's an

Sounds like, you

14

know, from your conversations with the board

15

members, advisory board members, we agree that

16

there's sort of a violent agreement on what we

17

need to be focussed on in the shortened

18

intermediate term which is great.

19

MR. BUDESCU:

Absolutely.

20

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

All right.

Well, we look

21

forward to getting the update at the end of your

22

work.

23

MR. BUDESCU:

Yes.

24

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Now, we are going to move

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 17

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

to individual project updates.

2

Leslie is going to pull different folks for

3

different parts of it.

4

with that.

5

MS. DARLING:

And I think

So I will let you focus

We actually have a number of

6

projects to discuss and updates for you today.

7

The first one we are going to start with is an

8

update on Retrofit One.

9

that that project was instigated between the CIT

I know you are aware

10

and the City, in particular the Department of

11

Fleet and Facilities Management, in 2013.

12

George, is that right?

13
14
15

MR. MARQUISOS:

It kicked off April 15th of

2014.
MS. DARLING:

2014.

So we are well into

16

that project, but we thought it would be

17

important today to actually have George, who was

18

running for the project for the PBC and now for

19

the CIT give you an update and sort of have an

20

opportunity to educate you on -- a little bit

21

more on how that project worked, what our

22

learnings were from that project and then how we

23

can actually build upon that for some of our

24

future plans.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 18

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

Another thing I'm going to update you

2

on is the CTA's 4G project which has recently

3

been completed.

4

extensively about an update on our smart street

5

lighting project which I am really excited to

6

share our progress with you.

7

going to be joined by our friends at George K.

8

Baum Investment Bankers who are sitting behind

9

Alderman O'Shea, Alderman Scott and Chairman

We are also going to talk

And then we are

10

Summers and the City CFO, Carol Brown, who are

11

going to address the home buyer assistance

12

program that the Mayor announced earlier this

13

week.

14

So I want to go ahead and turn it over

15

to George to give us the update on the Retrofit

16

One Project.

17

MR. MARQUISOS:

So when Leslie asked me to

18

put together a few slides, I went back to the

19

deck that we used when we kicked off this

20

project.

21

project manager to go back and look at what they

22

promised versus what we deliver.

23
24

And it's all often sobering for a

So this is essentially the slide that
we promised.

The project description was there

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 19

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

was this desire to see if we could somehow

2

leverage the energy spend that the City has and

3

allocate some of that money towards modernization

4

and those kind of energy related capital

5

improvements would pay for themselves over a

6

period of time.

7

And so the goal was can we do this in

8

a wide variety of public buildings across the

9

City.

We want to utilize these special companies

10

called ESCO's, that's Energy Service Companies.

11

These are national companies who do this for the

12

federal government and for universities and a lot

13

of other companies, corporations.

14

They do kind of a special job.

They

15

get contracts under this thing called a

16

performance contract.

17

they will analyze how you are using your

18

14

out with 235 possible buildings.

15

as candidates for the first round Retrofit One.

16

We came up with 114 discrete energy conservation

17

measures, these are the ECM's is what the term is

18

in the energy world about projects that you can

19

use -- you can do to save energy.

20

with about an 18 percent annual reduction in the

21

buildings that we touched and a guaranteed

22

savings of just over 1.4 million.

23

this for 12-and-a-half million dollars.

24

We had a lot of

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

were -- the Mayor announced this as a win, win,

2

win, win proposition.

3

to create local jobs and have minority

4

participation and we were going to further our

5

sustainability goals by reducing greenhouse

6

gases.

7

kind of enhance the City's efforts to control and

8

manage their buildings better ideally from remote

9

locations through computers.

So it was an opportunity

And in addition to that, we were going to

And along the way

10

hopefully we would improve occupant comfort.

11

that was the grand promise.

12

And here is where we landed.

So

this project over a year-and-a-half.

15

percent of the trades people were Chicago

18

under 25 percent MBE, 23.55; and just over 5 for

20

numbers, but that's a little bit -- we define

21

community as quite broadly so I'm not sure that

22

was a really relevant stat.

23
24

50.5

We don't have the final numbers yet

We exceeded the community involvement

We did achieve the greenhouse gas
savings equivalent to taking just under 3,000

1

cars off the street every year.

So that's a good

2

thing.

3

Retrofit One project is that the City now has 35

4

more buildings that they can -- with new controls

5

that they can look at and remotely monitor from a

6

computer workstation as opposed to sending

7

someone out there and actually driving to the

8

building.

And I think the big legacy of the

9

And so that's been a culture change

10

for 2FM and I am pleased and proud to be part of

11

it.

12

adapted and adopted by the City's operating

13

engineers.

14

would say a good 40 percent of the operating

15

engineers the first thing they do when they come

16

in in the morning is log into their computer

17

which is a different mindset than where they were

18

when we started this project.

19

And I'm really happy to see how it's been

So I'm proud to say that right now I

of examples of how comfort improved.

even and they love the way the system operates.

I have a

 23

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

We had some kind of sizeable

2

differences at Harold Washington Library and at

3

Woodson Regional Library where we did major

4

lighting changes and people have really commented

5

on just how dramatic the libraries feel as a

6

result of this lighting switch.

7

there's a lot of examples of that, but I won't

8

bore you with all of them.

9

We can go on --

So in addition to kind of achieving

10

our stated goals, there are a lot of additional

11

benefits or ancillary benefits that go along with

12

these kind of projects.

13

worth noting.

14

sometimes worth doing these projects to get to

15

the ancillary benefits so we're monetizing the

16

energy savings, but in some regards the energy is

17

second to the overall project.

18

And I think they're

And more than that I think it's

And so the things that came out of

19

Retrofit One is we had fairly extensive training

20

of operating engineers on the latest computer

21

systems, so building automation systems.

22

City has a platform called GBMS, it's a Global

23

Building Monitoring System that they spent a fair

24

amount of money kind of putting in the works; but

The

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

 24

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

no one really used it because they didn't really

2

know how.

3

GBMS both in the ESCO world and the City's world

4

and they are able to look at buildings across the

5

City and track transit how they're performing and

6

see what the temperatures are.

turning into something quite vibrant.

It actually does work.

The other part of it is as part of
this system we procured a computerized

basically a work order system.

has a work order system, but it is a work order

That is

The City already

So the deal with the ESCO's was they

guarantee the savings, but you also have to tell

us what to do to maintain things so we have that

savings over time.

through this CMMS system.

2

respond through this system letting the ESCO's

3

know that the preventive maintenance has in fact

4

been done.

5

And then they in time have to

The other big part of this project is

6

we now have third-party people looking at how

7

these buildings are operating.

8

on the hook for the savings for the next 14

9

years, so they have whole divisions that pull

These ESCO's are

10

data from these building automation systems and

11

they're tracking to see how they're operating so

12

these savings are being achieved.

13

they're not being achieved, they give us a heads

14

up.

15

by the way, you had this on manual override.

16

was on all weekend.

17

And so that's the kind of outside input that kind

18

of helps people stay on track.

And when

So we get e-mails now all the time that say,

19

It

Is there a reason for that?

Prior to this project there was a real

20

siloed effect between those who operated the

21

building and those who paid the bills for the

22

building.

23

how much energy they were using.

24

Retrofit One they know that there's cost

The operators never really understood

1

consequences associated with how they run the

2

building.

3

of how utility dollars are being spent.

4

And so there's a lot greater awareness

The good news from the ESCO world is

5

that they did achieve their substantial

6

completion.

7

base contract sum.

8

change orders.

9

ESCO's do some additional work while they were

There were no change orders for the

success in that regard.

12

benefits of the performance contract is, you're

13

not buying a particular scope of work, you're not

14

buying a chiller; you're buying the performance

15

of that chiller.

16

that chiller performed, they have to do.

17

therefore, you get rid of all the change order

18

stuff and their little incidental adds.

19

questions at this point?

20

And so generally speaking it was a

accredited to him and one of the big reasons that

2

I really wanted to see him join us at the

3

Infrastructure Trust.

4

and his project.

5

MR. MARQUISOS:

So this is really his work

I appreciate that, but it's

6

not true.

There's a lot of people who worked on

7

this and it's a tough slug.

8

that everybody should do this, it's really easy.

9

It's very detailed and you're saving pennies all

I don't want to say

10

over town and it accumulates.

11

general -- it's a way to kind of start the

12

conversation about how do we optimize the way

13

that our buildings are managed and operated.

14

MR. O'SHEA:

But I think it's a

George, what about a scenario

15

where we're not achieving what we're being told

16

to do.

17

Who is held accountable for that?

MR. MARQUISOS:

That's a very good question.

18

So we are in the -- we finished the installation

19

period.

20

And so what ends up happening and I'm probably

21

going to get kicked under the table here because

22

this is off topic; but what ends of happening now

23

the ESCO's have a responsibility to produce an

24

annual savings report.

We are now in the performance period.

And so they -- they are

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 29

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

going to come back with the list of buildings

2

that they touched and they said, okay, here's

3

what we show you saved.

4

document it through some previously agreed upon

5

protocols.

6

a check and they have to do additional work on

7

their dime.

8
9

And they have to

And if they come up short, they write

If they exceed -- if the savings -and just to be truthful, the ESCO's typically

10

build in a safety factor so if they think you're

11

going to save 20 percent, they will guarantee you

12

18 percent.

13

there.

14

there are exceptions.

15

And they have a fluff factor in

So generally they hit their numbers, but

And if we have disputes, there's

16

contractual provisions where we bring in a

17

third-party expert to arbitrate those disputes.

18

But we did a lot of research in the procurement

19

of these ESCO's.

20

that they don't hit their numbers and they don't

21

live up to their -- they do occasionally write

22

checks and they really don't fight that.

23
24

MR. O'SHEA:

It's a pretty rare occurrence

So in this first year of

operating like this, we are in roughly 15 percent

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 30

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

of our City owned buildings, 60 buildings of the

2

400 some odd?

3

MR. MARQUISOS:

4

MR. O'SHEA:

Right.

Have there been any examples of

5

those 60 where they haven't come close to hitting

6

where they thought they were, whether that be

7

those buildings were already operating

8

successfully?

9

MR. MARQUISOS:

No, what we encountered was

10

we had buildings that had unforeseen

11

circumstances that limited the ESCO's capacity to

12

do certain things.

13

much detail, but public safety headquarters is a

14

perfect example at 35th and Michigan.

15

very large lighting control project scheduled

16

there because that building is largely unoccupied

17

a large part of the day and we wanted to shut off

18

all the lights.

I don't want to get in too

We had a

19

A real reasonable plan the ESCO's went

20

in there like they're supposed to, they put their

21

data loggers in.

22

24/7.

23

off.

24

They said these lights are on

There is nobody here.

We can shut them

But when we went to install the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 31

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

sensors we realized that that building is set up

2

with a -- it's a critical infrastructure building

3

and it's backed up by generators.

4

give enough energy to get people out of the

5

building, but to keep that building running.

6

so one-third of its circuits are on this

7

emergency system and there was a real desire not

8

to touch those circuits in any way.

9

of the lights we couldn't sensor.

10
11

Not just to

And

So one-third

So that left a

shortfall.
The ESCO's found other opportunities

12

within that building to save energy.

And so we

13

ended up coming actually a little bit higher than

14

we envisioned, but it wasn't through turning off

15

the lights.

16

were -- so it's that kind of switching around

17

when we find things that didn't quite work as we

18

had thought.

There were some other measures that

MR. O'SHEA:

Thank you.

20

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

In terms of the way the

21

ESCO's work, obviously they hold the liability

22

for not performing.

23

out-performance, is there some ability to

24

participate or if exceeds what was required to

2

finance the initial project?
MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes, that's the -- the terms

3

of the deal are and I think Bank of America

4

really was hoping that this was going to happen

5

is if there is excess saving as we think there

6

will be, the debt gets paid back quicker.

7

then as soon as the debt gets paid back, the City

8

realizes all the savings for themselves.

9

that's the way it's supposed to work.

10

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

11

MR. MARQUISOS:

12

MS. BARRETT:

And

So

Great.

To be determined still.
Quick question, back on your

13

win, win, win slide you cited the 18 percent.

14

Have you tracked the aggregate where we are

15

against that target now?

16

MR. MARQUISOS:

That will be the first

17

savings report that we expect to see end of

18

February.

19

MS. BARRETT:

20

MR. MARQUISOS:

Okay.
So they have to collect the

21

utility bills through the end of the year and

22

then they analyze it and give us their first

23

draft report.

24

MS. BARRETT:

That may be a good opportunity

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 33

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

for the trust to remind people about what those

2

goals were and how performance is.

3

MS. DARLING:

Absolutely.

And we'll be

4

bringing a much shorter Retrofit One update at

5

our future board meetings so we will make sure

6

that we are keeping you all up to date on the

7

progress.

8

presentation today just to make sure that you are

9

all familiar with how the program worked and

We wanted to give a larger

10

where is it going in the future.

11

because we think it's so important because we

12

think that there are additional opportunities

13

with the City and sister agencies on projects

14

like this that can be realized, a Retrofit Two if

15

you will.

16

later today.

17

And we'll talk about that a little

MS. DARLING:

No other

Then we'll move to the

Yes.

So we're going to talk

21

about the Chicago Smart Lighting Project which

22

since my very first day at the CIT we have been

23

engaged in a comprehensive street light

24

modernization initiative.

Where we have -- we

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 34

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

were asked by the City -- we're working with both

2

the City and the park district and to find out

3

what's possible for the City for an LED

4

conversion for our street lights.

5

So we have many different kinds of

6

street lights in the City and what it would take

7

to change them over to LED which is a much more

8

efficient light.

9

at what it would take to install a lighting

10

control network which is a relatively newer

11

technology using nodes on top of street lights.

12

Also, look into the possibility of lighting

13

infrastructure improvements with both our

14

electrical system and our poles.

15

poles date back to the '50s and so -- which some

16

of them are actually in great condition, but look

17

into what our infrastructure is like and what it

18

would mean to modernize it.

19

additional services that can be provided by

20

utilizing the street lights.

21

there are a number of technologies that are being

22

piloted on this and we wanted to see what might

23

drive revenue to allow us to increase the size of

24

our project.

And we were also asked to look

Some of our

And then look at

So there is a --

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 35

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

So the next slide actually is that

2

hopefully our win, win, win slide for this

3

project.

4

and what we really sought to do in the RFI that

5

was released back in September is our goals are

6

improving public safety, reducing the City and

7

the parks energy consumption and operating costs,

8

creating local jobs, advancing the City's

9

sustainability goals, enhancing public goods and

So what our goals for the project are

10

services and supporting the City's economic

11

growth.

12

promise slide we will be looking back at to see

13

if we -- if we were able to accomplish these

14

goals.

15

So this is the -- this is kind of the

21

have been working really diligently on a daily

 36

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

to walk through the timeline with you and then --

2

and I'll chime in occasionally as well, so

3

George.

4

MR. MARQUISOS:

So when I told my mom I was

5

taking a new job she asked me what are you doing?

6

And I said, well, I'm being hired to figure out

7

how many people it takes to change a light bulb.

8

And she said, well, they're lucky to have you.

9

I'm sure you'll do a great job.

10

MR. O'SHEA:

Spoken like a true mother.

11

MR. MARQUISOS:

And then she said, while

12

you're at it, could you fix the light that's out

13

in front of Mrs. Contini's house because it's

14

been out for a while.

15

you know, we'll probably be able to do that as

16

part of this.

17

And I said, well, I think,

So the truth of the matter is it

18

sounds like a pretty rudimentary thing, right,

19

let's just convert sodium vapor, high pressure

20

sodium lights to LED and let's just go do it,

21

right?

22

complicated calculus to figure out the best way

23

to do that.

24

with a lot of people's input to figure out what

But in actuality it is a fairly

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 37

1

are the best options for the City.

2

And so we started out with an RFI.

We

3

received 40 responses mid November.

4

lot of great information from that process.

5

picked a bunch of people to go back to and kind

6

of drill down on some of the details and get a

7

better understanding of what people are doing,

8

what they've done in the past, what the future

9

holds, where this business is and who is playing

10

in it.

11

the landscape if you will.

12

And we got a

from the City.

that the Mayor wants this done.

they convert their lights.

that with the help of Tom.

In addition, we've made a really

important alliance with MEEA, which is the

Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance.

a division of the Department of Energy who has a

15

major initiative to transform as many municipal

16

lights to solid state lighting LED.

happen to be located in Chicago even though they

18

are in charge of the entire midwest region.

19

their mission is to share best practices and kind

20

of promote this kind of thing, and they've been a

21

really great resource and we are thrilled to be

22

partnering with them.

And that is

And they

The biggest player to
They have changed 160,000

We are likely to double that number.

MR. SCOTT:

So

We've been having all

In LA, how many did you say they

did again?

10

MR. MARQUISOS:

11

MR. SCOTT:

12

MR. MARQUISOS:

13

MR. SCOTT:

14

MR. MARQUISOS:

160,000.

What was the time span on that?
Seven years.

Seven years.
And they started out slow

15

with dipping their toes in the water and they've

16

-- they're now at 50,000 per year.

17

kind of -- they're pretty much capped out at

18

their easy lights and now they're working on

19

their ornamental lights.

20

MR. SCOTT:

And they're

And over the seven-year period

21

because have they had to go back?

So you started

22

seven years ago, have they had to go back and

23

before they started the new phase of completing

24

the ornamentals; go back and do any retrofitting?

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 40

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

Because I'm sure technology has advanced over

2

seven years, have to go back and catch up from

3

seven years ago?

4

MR. MARQUISOS:

I asked that same question.

5

And the answer is they have had really good

6

durability success.

7

advanced a lot.

8

project a typical Cobra Head LED fixture was

9

$750.

So the technology has

So when they first started this

They are buying that fixture today that's

10

even more efficient -- significantly more

11

efficient than that older fixture for under $200.

12

So it's a -- there's been a tremendous

13

advancement.

14

Because of the early stage of the

15

technology, they decided not to install controls

16

in their early projects.

17

now and putting the control nodules on, but other

18

than that they are reporting good success rate as

19

far as durability.

20

with outages or replacement of worn out things.

21

MR. SCOTT:

So they are going back

They haven't had big issues

And one other question.

In the

22

-- the presentation, the last presentation; you

23

talked about the controls having preemptive, if

24

you will, detection so that we can kind of do

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 41

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

preemptive maintenance.

2

this so that, again, we don't have to wait 10

3

years and have to replace 10,000 of them when we

4

begin to retrofit as we go so that we can do

5

preventive maintenance, is that --

6

MR. MARQUISOS:

7

between -- Okay.

8

question.

9

light goes on.

Will that be included in

Well, there's a difference

It's a really interesting

The nodes tell you real time when the
So right now we are relying on

10

citizens to call 311 and say, hi, my name is Mrs.

11

Contini, my light is out.

12

and we actually verify that the light is out

13

before we send a crew and then we go and fix it.

14

Now we are going to have realtime information,

15

lights out, send someone there.

16

that it's out.

17

MR. SCOTT:

18

MR. MARQUISOS:

19
20

And we go out there

We know for sure

Right.
And so that will be a huge

step up.
MR. SCOTT:

And savings and man hours and

21

everything.

But, you know, one thing that

22

happens especially in my community especially in

23

the park district is, you know, there is a lot of

24

old copper wiring.

And they'll go in and they'll

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 42

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

strip that copper wiring out of there.

2

Will we know when that -- I mean, I

3

know all the lights will go down, but can this

4

system kind of detect what that issue is?

5

it's a bigger issue than just replacing the bulb,

6

if it's wiring; will that system be able to kind

7

of tell us what we need to do to fix it?

8

the people come out, they don't come out and say,

9

light's out, we changed the light, oh, something

10

else is wrong.

11

equipment and come back.

12

MR. MARQUISOS:

So if

So when

So they have to leave, get the

Yes, that's a great

13

question.

14

Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance, they have a

15

guy who is the national expert on controls.

16

his name is Michael Poplowski and he'll be

17

joining us in early February.

18

him over the phone.

19

We are -- so one of the duties of the

And

So far we have met

But right now the technology exists

20

where it not only tells you whether the light is

21

functioning or not and whether you can dim the

22

lights remotely, you can do all kinds of things;

23

but it also is telling you the realtime energy

24

burn.

So you can meter exactly what the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 43

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

individual bulb is burning.

2

know that continuity is stopped to that circuit,

3

you know that someone is doing something with the

4

wiring.

5

that -- so, yes, other municipalities are using

6

this technology to go after copper thieves.

And you can kind of instantaneously know

7

MR. SCOTT:

8

MR. MARQUISOS:

9

So the minute you

Okay.
Okay.

So we've spent the

better part of three months now trying to figure

10

out or requesting information from all kinds of

11

sources.

12

today that we didn't know when we started this in

13

September?

14

I've learned a lot.

15

So what have we -- what do we know

I think a lot.

I know personally

But in general I think that there is a

16

lot of different ways you can structure these

17

deals.

18

transferring of risk and just how you define the

19

risk and who takes it is kind of intricately

20

involved in the deal structure.

21

recommends that you have a really solid audit of

22

your lights, like what condition they are, how

23

many they are.

24

They tend to revolve around the

Everybody

And CDOT right now has really good

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

information on a couple of things, not so good

2

information about the quality of the

infrastructure.

recommendations on how we can augment the

5

information we have and aggregate it and make it

more usable.

Google map and it will be very useful to see

8

every street light on a map.

9

to kind of give you a characteristics of each

11

So we are putting together

So we are kind of moving it to a

And we'll be able

light.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Real quick, George.

12

Wasn't there also an issue of, you know, the

13

total utility costs and energy use as part of the

14

inventory assignment, the need of, you know, kind

15

of what we have; but how much it's truly costing

16

us in line with our view of that and utility?

17

MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes, so that's -- when I

18

first got involved in this people said I wouldn't

19

even touch that because we are getting a great

20

deal from ComEd.

21

the lights, you're going to end up paying more.

22

And I thought, you know, that's a really

23

interesting marketing ploy.

24

customer believe that you're paying less than

The minute you start counting

You just let your

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 45

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

you're supposed to and they'll never question

2

their rate.

3

And the reality is that the City pays

4

today somewhere about -- last in 2015 just under

5

$19 million a year for the electricity to power

6

streetlights.

7

Probably one of the lowest rates in the country.

8

We are right around 5 cents a kilowatt hour.

9

what that means is to run a 100 watt bulb for one

And we pay a very low rate.

So

10

hour, it costs the City 5 cents.

11

it's 12-and-a-half cents.

12

cents.

13

which makes this project difficult to pencil out

14

on an energy only project, but we'll get to that.

15

In California

In Hawaii it's 30

So it's -- we are paying a very low rate

Anyway, I'm getting a little off

16

track.

17

is pretty much every municipality we talked to

18

when they installed LED's the perception of the

19

population was this is a superior light.

20

color rendering index is better so you can

21

distinguish between a blue and a green and a car

22

that was -- and so the light is better directed.

23
24

So the other part that we learned about

The

It doesn't pollute if you will.
not as -- so generally speaking very well

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

It's

 46

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

received by the citizens and there's a clammer

2

for them in their neighborhoods sooner rather

3

than later.

4

several different places.

5

That's kind of been the case in

The other thing we learned is that

6

lots of municipalities have tried different

7

phasing approaches.

8

pilot programs.

9

there's some strong benefits to doing that and

Most have tried trials,

Let's see how it works.

And

10

then there's some cons because you don't get it

11

all done and it just lingers forever.

12

working through that.

13

So we're

When we started this we thought that

14

having 200,000 nodes on a wireless network might

15

be incredibly valuable for the City, and could we

16

leverage that value and pay for some of this or

17

-- and what we think what we have determined from

18

the informational interviews that we have

19

conducted so far is the value is still very much

20

in the potential category.

21

possibilities in the future.

22

of in the U.S. at least is monetizing that value

23

to date.

24

There is a lot of
No one that we know

Having said that, there are cities

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 47

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

that are using these nodes to collect information

2

from smart meters.

3

potential very good fit with the water department

4

on this project.

5

that -- we still have some more to do.

So we think there is a

Again, we are going to work

6

And we're -- we feel pretty confident

7

that it makes sense for us to kind of do as much

8

as we can right now; but make sure that we are

9

set up so we are ready for the future.

So as

10

this technology emerges, evolves, we'll be able

11

to kind of adapt to it.

12

Anything I forgot?

13

MS. DARLING:

14

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

That's the plan anyway.

No, I think we have some -Just to be clear then,

15

the premise that we are working under is that we

16

want to try to make sure that we have the highest

17

amount of flexibility and adaptability for each

18

node, right?

19

MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes.

20

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So that if we see

21

opportunities to move from potential to realize

22

or realizable, we can activate that?

23
24

MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes, and actually the

industry is going that way.

So there is this --

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 48

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

without getting too detailed, each one of these

2

control nodules come with a receptor that can

3

take three, five or seven pins.

4

the more new technologies you can add to it.

5

so it costs extra to have a seven pin receptor.

6

Everyone is moving to seven pin because they all

7

know that sooner or later you are going to use

8

those pins.

9

The more pins,

Then there's dimmable drivers.

And

We may

10

not dim our lights at this time, but we may want

11

that ability in the future.

12

cost increase to have a dimmable driver.

13

those are the kind of things that we'll most

14

likely be doing and specking to make sure that we

15

have the full capability of moving into the

16

future.

17
18

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So it's a marginal
So

These are all the fun

variables in Tom's model.

19

MR. MARQUISOS:

20

MS. DARLING:

Yes.
It is.

And, yes, we know more

21

about controller modules for LED street lighting

22

than I ever thought I would know, but it's

23

actually incredibly important because of the

24

capabilities of, you know, as George mentioned

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 49

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

either dimming the lights or, you know, there are

2

certain companies that say if you call 911, they

3

can flash the light in front of your house.

4

There's all kinds of additions that are possible

5

just by using the control nodule.

6

And so we've learned about a

7

tremendous number of options.

8

learned from Los Angeles is they didn't put the

9

control nodes on when they started and they are

10

And what we also

going back and putting them on now.

11

MR. O'SHEA:

12

MS. DARLING:

As technology develops.
As technology develops.

13

Because seven years ago when they started the

14

program, they probably didn't see a use for them,

15

but now they do.

16

that additional expense of going back later and

17

putting them on.

18

financially to include them in what we are doing

19

now and we think it's really important for us to

20

maximize the possibilities, to have as many nodes

21

as possible including for the data management.

22

We would like to avoid having

So we are trying to find a way

So it's actually an incredibly

23

exciting project.

And it may sound a little bit

24

dull, but the good part about this is it

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 50

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

literally touches every single part of this City

2

and will involve every neighborhood.

3

at its core the kind of project that the CIT

4

should and could be doing.

5

And it is

And so we are thrilled about the

6

possibilities and we will, you know, now we are

7

going to look at what the procurement

8

possibilities are.

9

Steering Committee and internally with the City

We'll be meeting with our

10

in the next few weeks.

11

further update for you at our next board meeting,

12

but I expect that you'll be seeing a lot more

13

information about this from all of us here at --

14

on this side of the table coming up in the next

15

few weeks and months.

16

MS. HUBBARD:

And we'll be having a

Did all the RFI respondents

17

have similar capabilities or are some not as

18

advanced as others?

19

MS. DARLING:

Some are not as advanced.

20

Because of the openendedness of the RFI, you

21

could respond to some or all of it.

22

companies only did, you know; said, well, we just

23

make the lighting -- we just make the actual lamp

And so some

And so they just told us about their lamp

and then some that were just hardware based or

Some were more wholistic and brought

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So there was a really wide

Damon, did you have a

question?
MR. SILVERS:

I was just going to comment

11

that this -- it seems as though you all are

12

grappling with this sort of opportunity or

13

challenge here that on the one hand when you do

14

the -- the replacement with LED lights is a very

15

significant sort of technological improvement and

16

offers the opportunity to deal with things like

17

people having stripped the wires and communities

18

that don't actually have lighting.

19

and the economics of doing that are relatively

20

well established, so it's financeable.

21

the next -- the next stage we're a little ahead

22

of the curve.

23
24

But the --

But that

On the other hand, we go to the -- if
we go to the expense of sending out the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 52

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

electricians to every one of these lights, you

2

won't get that chance again, right.

3

history -- and I'm familiar with this in the

4

context of buildings, that it can be very -- you

5

can regret a lot.

6

building renovations, for example, not having

7

done the energy efficient piece of it and them

8

coming back five years later and saying, hey, you

9

know, let's open up the walls.

10

And the

In the context of doing

And so the -- I'm very pleased to

11

hear, Leslie, you're talking about really kind of

12

looking under every rock for the revenue sources

13

that will enable you to do the most advanced node

14

that you can.

15

regret not doing that, right, if that -- you

16

know, if we're not able to.

17

really pushing on that point.

18

larger mission of the Trust.

19

The City will probably deeply

And it's worth
It connects to the

If this can be a truly transformative

20

exercise, it will realize kind of what I think

21

the Mayor and the City Council have been looking

22

for from the Trust, something that it's more than

23

incremental.

24

successfully that kind of -- the fact that we're

And that he -- managing

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 53

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

a little ahead of the curve, is going to be key

2

to that.

3

MR. O'SHEA:

George, could I get the

4

breakdown; how many street lights, how many alley

5

lights and how many park lights are we talking?

6

The total is --

7

MR. MARQUISOS:

We are at 317,000 total for

8

the City.

9

figure another 20,000 on park pathways.

So we're

10

not talking about any stadium lighting.

We're

11

not talking about --

12

MR. SCOTT:

13

MR. MARQUISOS:

14

MS. DARLING:

15
16

72,000 of those are alley lights and

How many park pathways?
20,000, round figures.
Any other questions on the

street lights?
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Yes, just one other.

One

17

of the things that I know came up as we started

18

talking about this is what the response in the

19

departments have been.

20

minute talking about the response, any concerns

21

from the workforce that maintains these today and

22

how we're thinking about that.

23
24

MS. DARLING:
with this.

And maybe you can spend a

You know, I think I'll start

So, first of all, I think that one of

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 54

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

the valued propositions that the -- the CIT can

2

bring is to be able to work with so many

3

different stakeholders and departments.

4

across the agency and cross departmentally and I

5

think that this project has been a great example

6

of, you know, so far how that's been very

7

successful for us.

8

As George mentioned in his

9

presentation, we have had outstanding

And work

10

participation from the commissioner level on down

11

to the men and women who are installing and

12

working on street lights right now.

13

George and I were just out at the

14

Bureau of Electricity last week meeting with the

15

team that does the work out there, and it is a

16

fascinating place where we learned a great deal

17

about the day-to-day operations of the Bureau of

18

Electricity.

19

So we -- we obviously have to look at

20

what kind of options we have as to operational

21

savings and what that would look like; but we

22

haven't made any firm decisions or have any firm

23

recommendations on that except to make a

24

determination, to go to Damon's point, which is

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 55

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

how can we drive as much savings as we can to be

2

able to achieve the largest project that we can.

3

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

4

MS. DARLING:

Sure.

Because some of our

5

infrastructure needs a great deal of work.

Some

6

of the electric needs a great deal of work.

7

can put an LED fixture on many of the lights, but

8

we want to make sure as the City and the CIT,

9

that when we are putting a lamp head on a pole

You

10

and the lamp head has a 10-to-15-year lifespan;

11

we want to make sure that that pole is going to

12

survive for 10 to 15 years also.

13

sense to put something up on a pole that won't

14

last.

15

It doesn't make

And that also goes directly also to

16

George's point on the assessment of our inventory

17

and how important that is.

18

know, the -- we have to determine how we are

19

going to share the risk with the vendors or the

20

workers and the internal City workers who are

21

going to be doing that work and who is doing it.

22

There's a lot of remaining questions so.

23
24

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And that is, you

That's just one thing I

think to serve as a reminder to all of us that,

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

you know, the savings that are not just, you

2

know, energy efficiency savings, you know,

3

lowering that 19 million; some of those are going

4

to come from owing them savings as we think about

5

this and those aren't just numbers on a piece of

6

paper, right.

7

and the team are, I want to make sure that we all

8

have an understanding of that; we have to be

9

understanding of all the implications of that and

And so we have to be, as Leslie

10

the full set of options that we have.

11

your point, there's plenty of work to be done,

12

right.

13

MS. DARLING:

14

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Because to

Right.
And there may be lots of

15

opportunities for -- for taxes to be freed up for

16

that work.

17

Alderman Scott's point on preventative

18

maintenance and what's required there; but this

19

is, you know, it's all collectively more than

20

just kind of numbers on a spreadsheet, that's

21

all.

And there's plenty to be evaluated to

22

MR. SCOTT:

23

MR. O'SHEA:

24

MR. SCOTT:

Last question I think.
Don't say that.
So when --

2

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Didn't he just start

yesterday?

3

MR. SCOTT:

With other alderman like myself

4

and Alderman O'Shea who have menu money and TIF

5

dollars who are actively right now saying, okay,

6

I have dire improvements that are needed

7

immediately, are we -- when we're looking at the

8

infrastructure not just the pole; are we looking

9

at the infrastructure?

10

Now, I know you are working with these

11

other agencies.

12

buildings that are coming online, are we looking

13

at them and making sure that they are running the

14

proper infrastructure underneath so that if we do

15

go back and replace those poles in the next few

16

years, that we don't have to throw in more money

17

because it's already been done.

18

at that?

20

The park district has brand new

MR. MARQUISOS:

Are we looking

Do you want me answer that

one?

21

MS. DARLING:

22

MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes.
So one of the things that we

23

learned in this process and it was kind of a

24

harsh lesson is the thinking that we were going

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 58

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

to be able to kind of let's just change

2

everything and make it all new like we did in

3

1950.

4

over $2 billion to make every pole in this town

5

brand new with the associated underground wiring

6

and everything that goes along with it.

7

It's not going to happen.

We're talking

So the menu program, the TIF program,

8

is going to continue to be the incremental

9

improvements on a block by block basis.

But we

10

do think there is an opportunity for this program

11

to stabilize the existing structures to reach the

12

threshold that Leslie defined.

13

We are looking for things to last 10

14

to 15 years in line with the life of the new

15

light that we are putting on.

decided yet.

to the City with their options and their pros and

19

cons and get direction from them.

20

So that's the

Again, nothing has been

Our job is to bring recommendations

MR. SCOTT:

Well, I just want to make sure

21

that what I would hate to do as an alderman is to

22

go in and redo my lights, and there is a

23

recommendation on the table that if it's going to

24

cost me a little bit more, I would rather do what

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 59

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

I need to do to make sure that it's compatible to

2

the rest of the ward.

3

some lights that maybe they're LED, but they're

4

not the technology that we're talking about, the

5

nodes where we have to improve them.

6

line I'm going to have to put another X amount of

7

dollars to improve what I've already done.

8
9

I wouldn't want to put up

Down the

So my suggestion would be when we are
dealing with our different sister agencies as

10

well as departments if their recommendation comes

11

sooner rather than later; to share that standard

12

with people so that when we go in and I go in and

13

I do Roosevelt or I do Kedzie, I'm doing them in

14

the manner that you would do them so that down

15

the line if I need to upgrade, I can.

16

MS. DARLING:

Right, and we are -- we are

17

really cognizant of that.

And the aldermanic

18

menu money is something we have discussed and are

19

well aware of and we are taking that absolutely

20

into consideration.

21

City Council to have to use their funds for

22

something that we are going to be doing in 6

23

months or 12 months or 18 months.

24

is -- no matter what we do, this is a phased

We certainly don't want the

I mean, this

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 60

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

project and we won't be able to do everything --

2

every single ward at one time.

3

phased, but we want to be cognizant and we are

4

well aware of the challenges you face and we want

5

to be helpful to you and in that respect.

6

we will definitely be cognizant of that going

7

forward and we'll keep you updated.

8
9

And so it will be

And so

And so there will be, you know, should
we get to an actual project phase, there will be

10

a lot of information shared with you about what

11

that phasing of that project will be so you know

12

when to expect that LED delivery would come to

13

your area.

14

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

It's an interesting

15

question, you know, whether aldermen through menu

16

money would have the ability to opt into things

17

that we can't afford system wide as we were

18

discussing, right.

19

of, you know, new bulbs and nodes, but there's,

20

you know, additional technology that might be of

21

interest that we pursue if there was revenue or

22

some financial support mechanism that we can't do

23

system wide; it would be interesting to see if

24

there's a way for folks to opt in.

If we have kind of taken care

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 61

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

MS. DARLING:

I think that for right now

2

absolutely everything is on the table including

3

certainly perhaps piloting those technologies as

4

they come online.

5

learn more about that and have recommendations to

6

make, we will be bringing them back to you.

7

MR. MARQUISOS:

So as we move forward and

And just to clarify, the CIT

8

will not be writing any specifications on this

9

project.

Everything will be coming out of CDOT

10

and it is the standard City -- whatever CDOT says

11

is the standard that will be throughout the

12

system.

13

whatever it is, everyone is working off the same

14

spec.

So whether it's menu or smart light or

15

MR. SCOTT:

Okay.

16

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

17

questions on lighting?

18

MS. DARLING:

Great.

All right.

Any other

I think in the --

19

I am going to skip over 4G for now because I know

20

that Carol Brown is here.

21

Financial Officer of the City of Chicago and we

22

have our guests from George K. Baum here as well

23

and -- I can't actually see Carol.

24

to -- Can I ask you to join us up at the table?

She is the Chief

Can I ask you

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 62

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

Hi.

Welcome.

2

MS. BROWN:

Thank you.

3

MS. DARLING:

Since I introduced Carol,

4

Anthony and Al and Mark; could you all introduce

5

yourselves as well to the board, please.

6

MR. BOUMENOT:

Al Boumenot, George K. Baum.

7

MR. PASKULIN:

Marc Paskulin, George K.

8
9
10
11

Baum.
MR. FRATTO:

Anthony Fratto, George K. Baum

& Company.
MS. DARLING:

Thank you.

So as the board

12

knows and I sent some information out to -- over

13

the past few days, this week Mayor Emanuel

14

announced that the City in conjunction with the

15

CIT are moving to help make homeownership

16

possible for low and moderate income families by

17

providing support for down payment and closing

18

costs.

19

In this program the qualified buyers

20

can receive a grant of up to seven percent of the

21

total loan amount based on their income.

22

firmly believe that the infrastructure of the

23

City is based on homeownership and strong

24

communities.

We

And so the CIT is thrilled to have

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 63

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

been asked by the City to assist them in

2

administrating this program.

3

We will do some back office compliance

4

work for the City.

5

do that.

6

person into the CIT to administer that program in

7

conjunction with the City.

8

us today and also Al and Marc and Tony from

9

George K. Baum to help share with you some of the

10

We will receive some fees to

And we will be hiring at least one

I asked Carol to join

details about that program.

11

I know you've received a lot of

12

information and a lot of documents on this

13

already many times over.

14

the program further, but I thought it might make

15

more sense to open it to questions instead of

16

giving you a full presentation.

17

do whatever the board would desire.

18
19
20

MR. ZARATE:

So I'm happy to discuss

But I'm happy to

Do we have any lenders in place

already or is this brand new hot off the press?
MS. DARLING:

Well, right now the process

21

has just begun.

There will be an ordinance that

22

will be introduced at the City Council in

23

February with the hopes that it will pass at the

24

March City Council.

And so all of the details of

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 64

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

the program are still being worked out including

2

all the documentation that has been sent to you

3

is all in draft form.

4

finalization that needs to take place.

5

There is still a lot of

So I believe the thought is to start

6

with a few lenders that are already working with

7

the City.

8

participate who qualifies under HUD and FHA and

9

fills out an economic disclosure statement with

But any lender who wants to

10

the City can participate.

11

analyzing them or selecting or choosing any

12

vendors in any way.

13

through the City.

14

The CIT will not be

That will all be done

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And the process before it

15

was a -- it was the designation of MCC or I don't

16

remember what it was, there was some -- you guys

17

had in your presentations.

18

MR. FRATTO:

The City has an MCC program

19

that they administered for many years and over

20

the years they had about 20 different lenders

21

that they worked with that they had been

22

successful with in administering their MCC

23

program.

24

So what we did since we've -- we've

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 65

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

been involved with housing issues for the City

2

since maybe 1995.

3

important whenever we get involved in any of

4

these things, not only in Chicago but anywhere;

5

is to make sure you have some lenders that can

6

pull their oars, you know.

7

that are going to have to be out there on the

8

ground as well as the aldermen and their

9

respective communities.

10

And one of the things that's

And they are the ones

And it's kind of a process for

11

everybody together to help let folks know about

12

this and let them know how it works.

13

how these loans get paid and that's how people

14

get into homes that they wouldn't necessarily be

15

able to get into.

16
17
18

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And that's

So to Miguel's question,

do they just apply to be an MCC and fill out -MR. FRATTO:

Not the MCC.

They can just

19

apply -- apply to be in the program.

20

apply here since they are going to be helping

21

with the administration.

22
23
24

MS. BROWN:

Well, wait.

They can

Just to be clear

are you asking how home buyers?
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

No, I'm asking --

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 66

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

MS. BROWN:

2

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

3
4

Or the lenders?
Miguel's question was

about lenders.
MS. BROWN:

Lenders.

So as Leslie said we

5

will have a standard lender participation

6

agreement and there are requirements under the

7

federal program.

8

designed to assist people in accessing kind of

9

federal loans, the City is not obviously creating

So because this program is

10

the loans.

And if the lender is willing to enter

11

into that agreement, if the lender is willing to

12

submit an economic disclosure form and if the

13

lender meets the requirements under the federal

14

programs; those would be the three kinds of

15

screenings that we would do.

16

any additional kind of parameters for potential

17

lenders.

18

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

19

MR. FRATTO:

We would not impose

Awesome.

Like we mentioned the MCC, all

20

of those lenders have done all of the things

21

that --

22
23
24

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

That's what Carol has

just said.
MS. HUBBARD:

Can we clarify the role of CIT

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 67

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

in this?

2

they're in place, but what exactly does that --

3

what will our process be, our responsibilities?

4

I know we administer the loans once

MS. BROWN:

So the City had a pretty robust

5

and successful single-family low income down

6

payment assistance program that started like kind

7

of in the -- I don't even know if it started in

8

the '90s, but as Tony alluded to it was '90

9

through kind of the housing bubble.

And at the

10

time the City also had a separate housing

11

department.

12

When Mayor Emanuel took office in

13

2011, he kind of reorganized City Hall and

14

wanted to save money and get efficiencies.

15

one of the things he did was collapse the housing

16

department into the Department of Planning and

17

Development.

18

And

And I should step back and say in 2008

19

when the market crashed, the housing bubble --

20

the single family -- this program really kind of

21

died out and we weren't really writing new loans

22

and we weren't really bonding.

23

original program we actually issued debt to

24

support the program.

Because under the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 68

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

So George K. Baum approached us almost

2

two years ago to consider revamping the program

3

because without a government sponsor, there's no

4

way for lenders and, therefore, potential home

5

buyers to access the program.

6

government sponsor.

7

the possibility of revamping the program, but

8

over in that time the Department of Planning, you

9

know, we've lost people.

You have to have a

And so we were looking at

We don't necessarily

10

have the capacity to administer fully the program

11

inhouse.

12

And so when we started considering

13

what -- how we could do it and the administration

14

is this, on the front end it's assisting with the

15

marketing.

16

buyer education which is a requirement of

17

participating in the program.

18

are a first-time home buyer, you have to go

19

through borrower education.

20

end kind of administration.

21

And it is helping to administer the

You have -- if you

So that's the front

And then it's also kind of making sure

22

all of the closings are documented and working

23

with -- to make sure that we have the appropriate

24

documentation at closing and attend the closing,

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 69

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

deliver the checks, things like that.

2

the front end administration.

3

So that's

There is also back end administration

4

because as Leslie alluded to, it's up to a 7

5

percent loan that over time becomes a grant.

6

so there's certain compliance that needs to be

7

done over the course of the loan to make sure

8

that we have met all the requirements so that the

9

loan can go to a grant.

The lender, the

10

servicer, do some of it; but the government

11

sponsor is responsible for doing some of it.

12

And

And so we thought to some extent the

13

trust could be the agent for the City as the

14

government sponsor for this program to do that

15

work.

16

MR. PASKULIN:

And as the -- as you may have

17

seen references to George K. Baum & Company as

18

the program administrator, we are in a position

19

to fulfill all those roles as the program rolls

20

out.

21

recruiting of the lenders, the coordinating, the

22

-- the -- all of the recording.

23

course, over time if CIT would like to hire

24

someone to look at what we do and take on those

Do all the front end, the training, the

And then, of

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 70

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

responsibilities, you have a ramp up time or a

2

period of time in which to accept those

3

responsibilities.

4

So we could certainly proceed with the

5

program as is.

6

program administrator, but over time that's

7

something that based on what is the appropriate

8

responsibility that can be transferred over to

9

your staff.

10

Our role being defined as the

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Can you guys talk a

11

little bit about just what historical volume was

12

and how to think about kind of magnitude and size

13

and how that may or may not be impacted by rate

14

movements, etcetera?

15

MR. FRATTO:

Just so everyone knows Marc

16

Paskulin is the head of the housing department

17

with George K. Baum and Al and I work in the

18

Chicago office; but go ahead, Marc.

19

MR. PASKULIN:

And as Tony mentioned we have

20

been working with the City since 1995.

The last

21

time the City had a successful single family

22

housing down payment assistance program was in

23

2006, 2007.

24

bonds at that time.

The City was issuing tax exempt
The bond financing traded a

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 71

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

lower loan rate or a rate that was close to

2

market and down payment assistance.

3

culmination of two was very appealing.

4

So the

We started off with six lenders; the

5

usual suspects, Chase, Wells Fargo.

And after 2

6

years we ended up with 35 lenders.

7

initial lenders didn't do very well, but we had

8

the guaranteed rates and prospect banks and all

9

the banks did very well.

All those

And then, of course,

10

the market slowed down.

11

came by and we couldn't issue a tax exempt bond

12

at all.

13

the mortgage market.

14

The financial meltdown

Certainly not at a competitive rate with

Now, there have been programs since

15

then sponsored by the U.S. Treasury for example.

16

The U.S. Treasury required some ongoing reporting

17

requirements from each housing finance agency or

18

each government in order to participate in those

19

programs and the City of Chicago could not abide

20

by those conditions.

21

not participated in any kind of a tax exempt bond

22

program since 2007.

23
24

MR. FRATTO:

So the City of Chicago has

And there are no bonds involved

here.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 72

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

MR. PASKULIN:

As far as volume about 175

2

million in 2006.

3

2007.

4

before the market tanked.

5

considerable amount of volume.

6

Another 150, 160 million in

And another 50 million or so in 2008
So there is

In the past it has been roughly 10

7

million; 10, 15 million per month.

We have a lot

8

of local governments in other states that have

9

done this kind of a program.

We think

10

counties -- cities and counties with a comparable

11

population should be, you know, 5 or 10, 5 or 10

12

or 15 million per month.

13

So we have provided some numbers to

14

the staff and based on the per loan fees, they

15

know exactly what they can expect.

16

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Given that this new

17

program doesn't have a rate subsidy component the

18

way the previous one did, is there any impact to

19

rate movement?

20

still apply if rates are higher, folks are still

21

looking for kind of more relief?

22

Is it still -- you know, would it

MR. PASKULIN:

That's a very good question.

23

When rates are this low, whether it's a 4 percent

24

loan with no assistance or a 4.50 or 4.75 or the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 73

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

4 percent grant; it really doesn't impact the

2

ability of the home buyer to qualify.

3

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

4

MR. PASKULIN:

Right.

It does become an issue when

5

you're at 6 or 7 percent and that's when

6

tax-exempt bonds have flourished when that gap is

7

there.

8

tell you -- I can't tell you where rates are

9

going to be a year or two years from now, but

Right now there is no gap.

So I can't

10

right now this program is doing exceedingly well

11

in many states because of the interest rate

12

environment.

13

market interest rate then that -- that

14

assistance, that grant, that cash close is really

15

the driving force behind the program.

16

Because even at a higher than

So right now if rates stay at these

17

historically low levels, we expect very, very

18

good performance.

19

we'll have to check in with the program and look

20

at tax exempt bonds and look at some other

21

alternatives.

22

MR. FRATTO:

When the interest rates rise,

Just as a point of information

23

when we were doing the last programs in 2005 and

24

'06, it was like 51 percent was in non-targeted

 74

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

areas and 49 was in targeted areas.

2

how -- and if you look at a map, it was pretty

3

well spread out except the 43rd Ward.

4

understand.

5
6
7

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So that's

We didn't

Something tells me 19 and

24 are going to be well covered.
MS. HUBBARD:

If I read this correctly, I'm

8

sorry, the fees that the trust will get are tied

9

to the interest rate of the participant; is that

10

right?

11

lender is charging four-and-a-quarter, that

12

quarter percent might be coming back to --

13

So that if they are charging -- the

MS. BROWN:

There is a spread above market.

14

And the spread above market is what's used to pay

15

the administrative costs and the servicer and so

16

the trust would be paid out of that spread.

17
18

MS. HUBBARD:

And is that going to be

standard across all the lenders?

19

MS. BROWN:

Yes, the spread will be.

20

MS. HUBBARD:

21

MR. PASKULIN:

Okay.
And from that spread your fee

22

will be the same regardless of which loan rate is

23

chosen, whether it's a lower loan rate or a

24

higher loan rate with more assistance; your rate

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 75

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

is still the same or your spread is still the

2

same.

3

MR. LINGENFELTER:

Let me ask an entirely

4

different question for maybe a different take on

5

-- at its peak like how many individual

6

homeowners are we helping?

7

MS. BROWN:

So in 2006 it was just over 1600

8

homeowners that participated.

9

just over 1700.

10

MS. HUBBARD:

In 2007 it was

And then is the City and the

11

Trust when I read through this; the

12

indemnification, is that one in the same because

13

they mention the City being --

14

MS. BROWN:

You know what, we haven't

15

negotiated the documents.

16

agreement between the City and the Trust.

17

will be an agreement for the City with to -- for

18

the program and we just haven't negotiated that

19

yet.

20

There will be an
There

So I think what Leslie is asking you

21

is for authority to negotiate and enter into

22

those agreements.

23

once you guys have approved, once we've -- City

24

Council has approved; I think we can come back

And then once we've executed,

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 76

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

and report out kind of what the general terms of

2

our agreement are and the final parameters of the

3

program.

4

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

You know, the resolution

5

states to authorize Leslie to negotiate with the

6

Chair's approval.

7

representation from the board in that process.

8
9

MS. DARLING:

So there will be

And you'll get -- as a board

member or the entire board will get all the

10

documents as we go through and, you know, what

11

the resolution says.

12

anything to this is just I am being given the

13

authority to negotiate it.

14

doing that with counsel.

15

And if Scott wants to add

Obviously I will be

I have Scott Falk from Kirkland.

And

16

so I expect the negotiation will be relatively

17

simple and easy, but I will also make sure that

18

you are all apprised in realtime as we move

19

through that process.

20

surprises.

21

the documents prior to.

22

So there won't be any

You will have an opportunity to see

MS. BARRETT:

Question, prior to 2007 was

23

the government sponsored by the Department of

24

Housing?

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 77

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

MS. BROWN:

Well, it was still the City.

It

2

was the City, but it was administered through the

3

City Department of Housing.

4

MS. BARRETT:

And was reinstatement in the

5

housing division a part of planning development

6

of that function contemplated?

7

MS. BROWN:

Yeah, we looked at it.

I mean,

8

it was always a program that was kind of dually

9

administered from an internal standpoint with the

10

Department of Housing and Department of Finance

11

at the City.

12

tax exempt bond component to it.

13

Especially when there was a robust

But one of the things that we

14

consistently have tried to do with the

15

reconstitution of the Infrastructure Trust is to

16

leverage those synergies.

17

as Leslie noted, housing is an important

18

component of infrastructure of the City.

19

it made sense.

20

internal capacity issues.

21

with two things, candidly if the program is as

22

successful as it was in the '90s, it creates a

23

self-funding source for the Trust which is --

24

And we thought that,

And so

And it helped with our own

MS. BARRETT:

But also it helped

Part of our strategic plan.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 78

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

MS. BROWN:

Yes, that's one.

But the other

2

is that as you start to or continue to evaluate

3

projects, we're hopeful that the Mayor's focus of

4

investment in the neighborhoods will be a

5

priority that the Trust embraces.

6

like the synergy with housing and housing

7

throughout the 50 wards would help to inform

8

future project evaluation and selection by the

9

Trust.

10

And so we felt

So that was kind of our thought.

MR. SILVERS:

You mentioned the program ride

11

up during the crisis.

12

thinking about the technicality of the housing

13

markets, were there any other consequences for

14

the City as the sponsor during the crisis with

15

foreclosure rates and so forth?

16

MS. BROWN:

Were there any -- just

No, the actual -- and I don't

17

have it all and George K. Baum may.

But if you

18

look at the performance of loans of the portfolio

19

from our program, it was generally very good.

20

we weren't any more exposed to the housing bubble

21

in the foreclosures than I think any other

22

program.

23

loans performed pretty well.

So not -- it was a

24

program that the City liked.

It was not a

So

And so and generally we perform -- our

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 79

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

program that exposed the City to undue loss.

2

And, in fact, we are just done kind of closing

3

down in some of the escrows that were still

4

around from that time in the City and it also

5

created -- I wouldn't characterize it as a

6

windfall, but it created some additional resource

7

for the City.

8
9

MR. FRATTO:

One of the other things if I

may for the program at that time and for this

10

program also, the things that make it more solid

11

in terms of financially and the potential for --

12

for foreclosure, is not as much as in some of the

13

other areas in the country.

14

loans.

There's no -- there's no nondocumented

15

loans.

There's -- at some point when you get

16

your loan, you have to have certain -- a certain

17

FICO score.

18

before and they are still going to be in place.

19

So that's why the performance of all those loans

20

weren't as bad as what happened throughout the

21

country.

22

component to this.

23
24

They're for 30-year

And so those were all in place

And we have a home buyer education

MR. O'SHEA:

So that's an important thing.

Based on the fact that George

K. Baum has administered these programs other

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 80

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

times, other places based on past experience; how

2

long do we think it will take before this program

3

is self-sustaining?

4

MS. BROWN:

It starts out being

5

self-sustaining.

6

not as clear with you all.

7

is required to reimburse I guess is the best

8

word, reimburse the City within 30 days of the

9

loan closing the down payment.

10

I think in my briefing I was
But the -- the lender

So it starts out

being self-sustaining.

11

So the seed really is we have to show

12

for certain loans the sponsor has to show a level

13

of reserves.

14

then it's for that first start up, certain

15

start-up costs; but the cost of the loans will

16

immediately start funding back or the cost of the

17

down payment, excuse me, will immediately start

18

funding back to the City 30 days after a close.

19

So if we do a loan with a $10,000 grant, 30 days

20

after close the lender has to send the City back

21

$10,000.

22
23
24

So the seed money is for that.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And

Any other questions on

the home buyer program?
MR. O'SHEA:

I would just like to say like

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

 81

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

everything we have been talking about the last

2

hour-and-a-half, this is going to be huge.

3

is going to be huge in low income communities.

4

This is going to be huge in middle class

5

neighborhoods.

6

for all the time you've put into it and Leslie

7

for your leadership.

8

my neighborhood and talk about this.

9

This

And I just want to thank Carol

MS. BROWN:

I can't wait to get back to
This is --

I would just add one thing.

The

10

Mayor did an event earlier this week and where he

11

announced that we were going to start working on

12

this program.

13

the police officers who was doing security there

14

stopped me and said, now, when can I get -- I

15

said, hold on.

16

we'll be ready.

17

And as we were walking out, one of

Give us a month or two, but then

MR. O'SHEA:

This is how we are going to

18

rebuild neighborhoods that suffered the last ten

19

years.

20

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I'm sure your office,

21

Alderman, and, you know, we have been flooded

22

with calls since Monday.

23

How do I sign up?

24

MS. BROWN:

Where do I sign up?

Hold on.

And one more thing I forgot to

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 82

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

mention or maybe I did mention it, it's been a

2

long day.

3

do as soon as -- once City Council acts and once

4

we get approval, is we will do a series of

5

informational sessions throughout the City for

6

potential home buyers so they understand kind of

7

how they can access the loans, condition of the

8

loan and things like that.

9

try and do as much as we can to build up the

One of the things that we are going to

So we are going to

program.
MR. SCOTT:

I would like to say to echo my

12

colleague's sentiments.

You know, the

13

neighborhood in which I serve is in desperate

14

need of a program like this.

15

would say we probably have the largest

16

concentration of vacant lots.

17

location where I have developers that want to

18

develop, but want to make sure that we have the

19

ability to bring in qualified homeowners that

20

will be there for the duration of the 30-year

21

loan so they are not taking a bath on it.

22

something like this, again, your leadership on

23

this program is going to do great things for my

24

neighborhood and other neighborhoods just like

We have over I

With -- in a great

And I was just talking to my alderman,

3

whatever we need to do on our end to make sure

4

that our colleagues understand how important this

5

is for the City and for our communities, you can

6

count me as somebody who will be out there

MS. BROWN:

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

10

Okay.

I appreciate that.

MS. DARLING:

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Thanks guys.

Are you going to back to 4G?

11

13

All right.

I'm sorry?
Do you want to go back to

MS. DARLING:

I think we should go ahead and

vote because I know we are starting to run out of

 84

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

2

MS. DARLING:

Any opposed?

Thank you so much.

Great.
So I

3

realize that we are swiftly running out of time

4

and I want to be cognizant that we scheduled two

5

hours for the meetings and I thought that would

6

be well more than enough, but I think it's, you

7

know, we have had such terrific conversations.

8

So I'm so thrilled that you are so engaged in the

9

work that we are doing.

10

So just to sum up perhaps some of you

11

have seen a lot of press about this.

12

been a number of stories recently and a number of

13

announcements made by the Mayor's office and the

14

CTA about the completion of the 4G being

15

implemented in the City's subway system.

16

-- there were two announcements.

17

treasurer and I were at before the holidays and

18

then one much more recently.

19

the completion of the red line 4G implementation

20

and one to celebrate the completion of the entire

21

system in the blue line.

22

There's

It was

One that the

One to celebrate

So there is now 4G in all of the

23

subway tunnels throughout the City.

And that

24

project as you know was brokered by the CIT.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

It

 85

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

was the $32.5 million agreement fully financed by

2

the wireless carriers.

3

are very happy about it is an understatement.

4

There were tons of quotes from all kinds of

5

people who were thrilled about the program and

6

able to text their friends and relatives that

7

they're coming home or meeting them out.

8

people are very happy with the increased user

9

experience, the interconnectivity and -- adds to

10
11

And to say that people

And

the safety of our underground system.
So as you all know that was a project

12

that was implemented before I started at the CIT.

13

But we were pleased to see it come to completion

14

and we do think it is a hallmark project of the

15

kind of thing -- it's the exact kind of project

16

that the CIT can be integral in bringing people

17

together, both private industry and public

18

agencies to get projects done.

19

MR. FALK:

Can I make one observation just

20

for the board.

21

does the CTA need the CIT for.

22

have you ever tried to get four cage match

23

competitors like Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and

24

T-Mobile in -- to get agreement on any project?

You might wonder what -- what
The reality is

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 86

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

It takes more than a cat herder.

2

ring master.

3

It takes like a

And so the role that we played

4

principally was to get everybody to see why it

5

was a win win for CTA and for commuters and for

6

the carriers.

7

-- the CIT was able to do was crunch a bunch of

8

numbers and show that, you know, based on

9

historic usability, the ability for a commuting

And, you know, there was a lot of

10

phone user to stay connected during the entire

11

duration of his or her commute meant that much

12

more loyalty attribution to the carrier.

13

So it actually -- and this had never

14

been done before anywhere in the country.

15

New York is now starting I think.

16

so it was the first time these guys were ever

17

brought together.

18

was able to do in a way that none of the carriers

19

were -- there was no one agent within the

20

carriers willing to carry that weight.

21

MR. SILVERS:

And

But, you know,

And that's really what the CIT

Can I just add to what you

22

just said.

The FLCI owned company by

23

infrastructure at a national level has made the

24

point over and over again that there's a suite of

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 87

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

experiences that business travelers have in the

2

top cities of the world.

3

includes mobile phone and broadband access,

4

high-speed rail connects and low delay at the

5

airport; that suite is not available anywhere in

6

America.

7

And that suite, which

This is a -- this is the first step

8

that I know of by a major city in the United

9

States to make that suite available.

And if we

10

are going to be competitive as a nation with the

11

world's business centers outside of the United

12

States, we've got to have this.

13

the Trust is making this point that this is --

14

this is a big deal.

15

it's wonderful for the citizens of Chicago to be

16

able to text that they're coming home, but this

17

means in the long-run, jobs.

18

MS. DARLING:

And so hopefully

A bigger deal than it --

Thank you for making that

19

point.

20

4G, I just briefly want to address what's coming

21

up.

22

So if there are no other questions about

In addition to all the projects that

23

we have talked to today, I have been working very

24

hard at refocusing the CIT's efforts on serving

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 88

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

our main clients which as the City Council

2

created us, we believe that our first client

3

should be the City and her sister agencies.

4

so I have spent a great deal of time meeting with

5

sister agency heads, their staffs and many

6

department heads at the City of Chicago to

7

determine what other opportunities might be

8

available for us at the CIT and how the CIT can

9

be increasingly helpful to the City in any way

10
11

And

that we can.
You know, one of the things that came

12

out of the discussions was the home buyer

13

assistance program.

14

know that we are making a lot of progress.

15

are looking at projects in bullets that are --

16

that you see before you.

17

we think that there is a high likelihood of a

18

Retrofit Two in the CIT's future.

19

So I am pleased to let you
We

So energy efficiency,

We have been talking to the Department

20

of Aviation -- this is just illustrative, but we

21

have been talking to the Department of Aviation.

22

We have been talking to MPEA.

23

have very large needs for energy efficiency.

24

with George on board, those are things we know

They -- CPS, they

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

And

 89

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

how to do.

We have a lot of learnings from

2

Retrofit One that we feel like we can apply to a

3

much broader and larger retrofit team.

4

look forward to working on that in the coming

5

months.

So we

6

We are looking at underutilized assets

7

whether they be real estate, working with the CTA

8

to look at transit oriented development and what

9

our opportunities are there.

10
11

That is something

that Tom has also helped us look into.
I've worked with Tom Powers to try and

12

make some determination about whether there are

13

opportunities for us at the water department.

14

They have a lot of access to very cheap money

15

through the state revolving fund.

16

future that may not be an option, but it is

17

something that we feel is worth looking into and

18

we are continuing to look into that.

19

tying the underutilized assets also into

20

transportation options and the fast bills that

21

congress recently passed, a transportation bill.

So in the near

And then

22

In that transportation bill was a

23

small section that references infrastructure

24

accelerated programs.

And delineates $12 million

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 90

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - January 27, 2016

1

in grant money that could be available for

2

infrastructure accelerators and regional

3

infrastructure accelerators of which I feel the

4

CIT is a perfect example.

5

I have been working in collaboration

6

with other infrastructure accelerators throughout

7

the county.

8

have one in Denver.

9

heard about some of those projects, but I've been

They are starting one in D.C.

they

And so some of you may have

10

collaborating with my colleagues in those other

11

states in Washington D.C. to learn more about the

12

opportunities there.

13

funds are going to be available in the very near

14

term, but we think that they will be appropriated

15

and I hope that we will have an opportunity to

16

compete for that grant.

17

competitive.

18

We don't think that those

I think we will be very

So that's just a really brief update

19

because I want to be mindful of people's time and

20

I hope we will have more to talk about at our

21

next board meeting.
