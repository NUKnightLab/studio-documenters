$1.00 spent on childhood vaccinations, our country saves $10.10 and vaccines given to children born
between 1994-2016 will prevent an estimated 381 million illnesses, 24.5 million hospitalizations, 855,000
deaths, and $1.65 trillion in total societal costs; and
WHEREAS, as the operator of one of the largest Public Health Systems in the country, Cook County
Government and our health system bears a large portion of the economic burden of treating preventable
diseases, for example the Minnesota outbreak of measles took three (3) months to contain at a cost of $1.3
million to Hennepin County and the State Department of Health; and
WHEREAS, vaccines are safe, effective and the best protection against these diseases, from infancy to
early adulthood and into old age, and by getting vaccinated, we not only protect ourselves, we help stop the
spread of disease to our children, families and communities; however, for vaccines to be most effective,
vaccination rates must remain high; and
WHEREAS, unfortunately, continuing disease outbreaks across the United States remain a public health
concern, and lack of access to vaccines, combined with people who are not taking full advantage of
opportunities to protect themselves, their families, and their communities, leaves people susceptible to
preventable diseases; and
WHEREAS, two (2) decades ago, measles was declared eliminated in the United States yet in the first five
(5) months of this year, the CDC recorded 1,000 cases, more than occurred from 2000 to 2010 combined;
and
WHEREAS, the explanation for measles’ return is simply that fewer Americans are receiving vaccines;
since the turn of the century, the share of American children under the age of (2) who go unvaccinated has
quadrupled, and a growing number of American parents are refusing vaccines and as a result we are
welcoming back a disease that decades ago killed hundreds of people a year and hospitalized close to
50,000; and
WHEREAS, part of the problem is a collective forgetting of the devastation caused by diseases such as
smallpox and polio that extinguished many lives and disfigured bodies and so we must remain vigilant and
continue to educate our residents on the importance of vaccination; and
WHEREAS, this Honorable Body wishes to promote and raise awareness of National Immunization
Awareness Month in Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, on behalf of the more than 5.2 million residents of Cook County, do hereby take this
opportunity to acknowledge National Immunization Awareness Month; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that in conjunction with National Immunization Awareness Month, that
the month of August be hereby declared Immunization Awareness Month in the County of Cook, and
encourages everyone to remind their family, friends, and coworkers to stay up to date on their shots; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be spread upon the official

HONORING THE LIFE AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF ALLAN HOWE
WHEREAS, Allan Howe, a religious leader and peace activist, died at the age of 77 in his home in
Evanston, Illinois; and
WHEREAS, Allan was born in 1942 to Paul and Dorothy (Powell) Howe. He grew up in Arcadia,
California where he was an accomplished student. He was president of his Methodist Church’s young adult
fellowship, graduated 5th in his class from Arcadia High School in 1959, and attended Stanford University
where he participated in the Wesleyan Foundation and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1963; and
WHEREAS, from an early age, Allan was committed to social justice and peace. He did two (2) years of
volunteer service as an alternative to military service, helping youth on the West Side of Chicago. He was
active in the civil rights movement and community organizing, such as taking youth to hear Dr. Martin
Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech in Washington, D.C.; and helping the oppressed register to vote in
Mississippi and on the near west side of Chicago. He met and worked with many young Christians at the
West Side Christian Parish; and

July 24, 2019

in 1969, they moved to Evanston, Illinois to begin a Doctoral program at Northwestern University’s Garrett
Theological Seminary. He completed his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D). in Biblical Studies in 1978; and
WHEREAS, upon moving to Evanston, Allan and his wife joined Reba Place Fellowship. He provided
leadership and aid to others in many capacities: as leader of the Toad Hall household in the early 1970’s;
as a social worker at Travelers and Immigrants Aid in Union Station, Chicago from 1972 to 1976; as a
founding director of the North Suburban Peace Initiative, which led the peace movement and Nuclear
Freeze campaign on the North Shore from 1978 to 1988; working for the Illinois Mennonite Conference as
a support for Chicago area pastors; as an elected leader of Reba Place Fellowship (RBF) from 2003 to 2009,
during which time he founded Plain and Simple Furniture; as Administrator of RPF’s Leadership Team
from 2009 to 2017; and, for over 20 years, as chairman of the board of the Reba Early Learning Center preschool; and
WHEREAS, Reba Place began as a Fellowship of believers who committed to joining the common treasury
and moving into shared housing in the Mennonite tradition of meeting often, asking for grace, admonishing
each other, and “hold(ing) all things in common for the sake of those in need.” Rapid growth before and
during the Vietnam War led to challenges for the community. This led to the formation of the Reba Place
Church, a Mennonite congregation that people could join without being a part of the Fellowship. In these
years, the Reba Place members continued the Fellowship’s day-care center and other programs, while also
organizing refugee resettlement efforts and launching projects to serve people with disabilities and
experiencing homelessness. They also experienced challenges over women in leadership roles and in trying
to become a convincingly interracial congregation. At its 50th anniversary celebration, Allan reflected
aloud, “It is a marvel and a miracle that Reba Place has continued as one people.” The response was a
resounding “Hallelujah!”; and
WHEREAS, Alan, through his work at Reba Place and beyond, has touched and improved the lives of
many people; and
WHEREAS, Allan is survived by his wife, Jeanne; his son Mark (Judy) Howe, their children, Colleen and
Lily; his daughter Kathleen (Sarah) Howe, their children, Connor, Isaiah, Adin, Olivia, and Elisa; his
daughter-in-law, Danae Howe, her son, Sterling; his brother, Bruce (Donna) Howe; and his sister, Marcia
(Ted) Adams. He is preceded in death by his parents, Paul and Dorothy (Powell) Howe, and his son, James
Marcus Howe.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on behalf
of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County, commemorates the life of Allan Howe, and herewith expresses
its sincere gratitude for the years of service he gave to the Citizens of Cook County, Illinois; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be spread upon the official
proceedings of this Honorable Body and that an official copy of the same be tendered to the family of Allan
Howe.

HONORING THE LIFE AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF MARGARET BLACKSHERE
WHEREAS, Margaret Blackshere was a powerful and historic force in Illinois labor and politics, from her
time as the first woman to head the state American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
Organization (AFL-CIO) to her tenure as a member of the Democratic National Committee, and as a
delegate to the party’s presidential nominating conventions; and
WHEREAS, Margaret was raised in North Venice, Illinois by her mother, Frances, and her Aunt Margie.
She received her master’s degree in education at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville (SIUE) and
became a kindergarten teacher in nearby Madison. While a student at SIUE, she served as a student trustee.
After completing her studies, she was appointed by the governor to continue in the role of trustee. In
Madison, she launched the organizing drive that led to the school’s teachers becoming affiliated with the
Illinois Federation of Teachers (IFT); and
WHEREAS, Margaret was known as being tough but charming. She went from being a kindergarten
teacher to taking on union and political posts while working to modernize the labor movement. She made
history as the first woman to lead the Illinois AFL-CIO and helped lead Democrats to victory across the
state; and
WHEREAS, Margaret rose through the ranks of the statewide IFT and in 1993 was elected secretarytreasurer of the state AFL-CIO. Seven (7) years later, following a rare, bitterly contested battle for control,
she was elected president of the umbrella organization for labor unions in Illinois. It was a post she held

WHEREAS, Margaret was known for trying to make union leadership more inclusive along racial and
gender lines to be more representative of the membership. She brought a higher level of union activity to
the Democratic Party, including leading coordinated campaigns among candidates, along with serving on
the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and as a convention delegate. She threw her full support and

Barack Obama as President of the United States; and
WHEREAS, Margaret had many accomplishments during her tenure, including winning increases in the
state minimum wage and helping land pro-labor individuals on state boards and commissions; and
WHEREAS, Margaret’s greatest contribution to Illinois’ labor movement may have been her capacity to

Manufacturers Association to create and save manufacturing jobs in our state and with The Transportation
for Illinois Coalition, a group of labor and business groups working to secure state and federal funds for
Illinois’ infrastructure. Within the Labor movement, Margaret worked tirelessly to keep Illinois affiliates
united and working together in political and legislative efforts, even when several international unions left
the AFL-CIO; and
WHEREAS, Senator Dick Durban described Margaret as having, “the caring heart of a downstate teacher
and the fierce spirit of an advocate fighting for justice in classrooms and workplaces across Illinois”; and
WHEREAS, Dan Montgomery, the president of the Illinois Federation of Teachers, the union in which
Margaret began her labor advocacy, described her as “A very dynamic person (with) a great sense of humor.
She would have to have had a great sense of humor to do the work she did. But she was also tough. She
had to be tough to get to the position she got to - trying to mediate the trades and industrial unions, and
public sector unions; taking on tough issues in Illinois politics, finances, and human rights; and
WHEREAS, Barbara Flynn Currie, a close friend and associate, described Margaret as “down to earth, …
a real person.” She enjoyed baseball and other hobbies. At the same time, as the first woman president of
the ALF-CIO, she created a seat at the table for female workers and always fought for their best interests.
Her passing is the end of a very important era in Illinois labor history; and
WHEREAS, in addition to her labor and political work, Margaret served on boards, councils, and coalitions
that included the United Way of Illinois, American Red Cross in Illinois, Chicago Council on Foreign
Relations, the Illinois Women’s Institute for Leadership and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Advisory
Council; and
WHEREAS, Margaret is survived by two (2) sons, Michael (Catherine) and Thomas (Zoe); her sister,
Patricia (the late Leroy) Smith; and four (4) grandchildren, Michael, Alex, Quinn, and Raquel Blackshere.

of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County commemorates the life of Margaret Blackshere, and herewith
