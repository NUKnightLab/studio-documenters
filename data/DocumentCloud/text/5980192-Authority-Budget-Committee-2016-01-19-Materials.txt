2. Minutes of the September 24, 2015 Budget Committee Meeting
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the Minutes of the September 24, 2015 Budget
Committee meeting. Ms. Paziotopoulos seconded the motion and it passed by unanimous
voice vote.

3. Justice Assistance Grants (JAG)
Authority Special Projects Manager Mike Carter called attention to the memo from
Director Maki dated October 20, 2015 regarding the FFY10 JAG plan adjustment and
contained at Item 3 in the meeting materials. He then delivered a PowerPoint presentation
that described details of the statewide criminal justice information sharing environment;
current issues and challenges; and recommended future changes that the DuPage County
Justice Information System (DuJIS) is uniquely suited to develop and implement in the
pursuit of a viable integrated justice information model to potentially be adopted
statewide. He said that the primary role of the DuJIS project manager is to ensure that the
vendor(s) deliver the proper products and services.
Executive Director Maki said that the Authority is interested in information system
upgrades that do more than simply re-silo data. This is an investment in a data sharing
environment, not just technology that will allow shared data to drive better outcomes.
This investment will help address the fact that Illinois is information rich, but knowledge
poor; Illinois has the third highest information technology budget in the United States,
and relatively little to show for it. The DuJIS project allows for an opportunity to change
this environment starting at the county level, with the goal of eventually up-scaling such
systems to address statewide needs.
Bill Hayden, representing the Village of Addison Police Department, gave a brief history
of the DuJIS project. He said that at this point, a project manager needs to come into the
project to oversee the next phase of development as there was no single agency or
individual in DuPage County government who could effectively execute this job singlehandedly. He said that DuPage County has committed between $8 million and $10
million to the DuJIS project.

 Executive Director Maki said that it would be worthwhile to make the investment at this
stage to ensure the best possible program development, as future expansion will be built
upon this work. He said that this designation recommendation deserved separate attention
because it embodies everything that has been discussed by the Strategic Opportunities
Committee and it is a request-for-proposals based outcomes-driven project that the state
is interested in scaling up and that the federal government is viewing as a potential
national model.
Ms. Wolff said that future designation recommendations should identify:

Intended outcome(s).
Measurements that will determine whether the intended outcome is achieved.
Evaluation process by which the measurements will determine outcomes.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Community-Based Residential Treatment for Adults (Adult Male Re-Entry) – Illinois

Department of Corrections (IDOC)
Funding Source:

JAG FFY14; - $331,569 Total Federal; 25% Cash Match Amount

Program Description
The need for this program was identified at the Authority’s 2000 statewide planning summit and first funded
out of the Byrne Anti-Drug Abuse Act (ADAA) fund and has been continued with JAG funding.
Program Activities
This pre-release program design provides for a structured environment that includes strict expectations for
behavior, participation, and active involvement during substance abuse treatment programming at an IDOC
Adult Transition Center (ATC). Treatment services focus on the reintegration of the offender into the greater
community, with a particular emphasis on employment and confinement. Treatment is specific to maintaining
abstinence and preventing relapse and vigorously promotes personal responsibility and positive character
change.
After release from the ATC, the participants receive individualized case management. The former offenders
receive referrals and linkages to community-based agencies and services. Post-release, the grant-funded case
managers may assist participants with appointments, goal setting, acquiring identification, job search, housing,
admittance to educational or vocational programs, childcare, transportation, etc. as needed on an individual
basis. They work to link offenders to services, supports and resources in the community including recovery
home beds and facilitate admission to treatment or other support programs.
Priorities
The program addresses the State Corrections priority to, “Support programs which allow state and local
correctional facilities to apply proven and innovative programs to assist in meeting the needs of incarcerated
persons and to maintain the safety and security of the institution, staff and inmate population.”
Performance Assessment
Without a State budget, IDOC has not been able to pay its vendors. Case management vendor TASC has
nonetheless continue to provide one of the three budgeted case managers and is working to hire another.
Because of the extensive background checks necessary to work with juveniles in a correctional setting, the
process of hiring replacement staff is lengthy and sometimes necessitates agreement extensions to fully expend
allocated funds. Despite some staff shortages, the program continues to meet performance and reporting
requirements.

Heroin use has greatly increased across the state and local jails have seen significant increases in
the number of users detained for property crimes committed to fuel their habits. This program
will link detainees to community-based treatment for heroin addiction. RFP applicants will
discuss the problem in their jurisdictions and propose plans to implement the model program,
which will include enrollment in Medicaid or other health insurance coverage as well as linkage
to qualified treatment providers.
Implementation of this program is expected to be responsive to current local need and provide an
opportunity to test this model for possible replication in additional jurisdictions.
A minimum of three years of funding will be necessary to implement and refine the program and
fully assess its impact. At the summer 2016 Budget Committee meeting designation of funds
will be sought for an initial twelve months of activity with additional designations contingent on
performance.

Program Summary (State the problem and supporting data; identify target population and intended consequences)
The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) was enacted to protect the public from convicted sex
offenders by establishing a comprehensive national system for the registration and notification of those offenders. The
Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 established a penalty for jurisdictions that failed to substantially
implement the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) by July 27, 2011, and for any year thereafter.
States must use these reallocation funds to enhance SORNA compliance.
A previous federal grant to the Office of the Attorney General supported the implementation of the Offender Watch ©
system, which captures the sex offender information at the registration point, allowing automated notification in a near
real time method for all victims of convicted sex offenders who must register.
The Illinois General Assembly amended the sex offender registration law in 2010 to require an annual registration fee of
$100. Thirty dollars from each fee paid is deposited into the Attorney General Sex Offender Awareness, Training and
Education (SOATE) fund to be used to support the operation of sex offender registration and management information
systems. Collection of these fees has lagged as a preponderance of offenders claim indigence, leaving insufficient funds
in the account to continue Offender Watch © service. SORNA FFY 14 funds will be used to supplement SOATE funds to
continue provision of this service.

Activities & Tasks (Describe what will be done. Who will do it? How will it be done? Where? When?)
Through this award, the Illinois Sheriff’s Association (ISA) will enter into a one-year contract for statewide provision of
Offender Watch © services, SORNA FFY14 funds will be used to supplement not supplant the fees collected from sex
offenders. During the twelve month term of this award and the Offender Watch © contract, the agencies who make up the
membership of the Illinois Sex Offender Management Board (SOMB) and I-SORT committee will work to develop a sex
offender indigence affidavit and a training initiative to improve collection of fees from sex offenders to support operation
of the system in the future.
Offender Watch © provides sex offender registration officers with a web-based database to house offender data, photos,
addresses, phone, vehicle history, scars, tattoos, aliases, employment, offenses, verification schedule, email/IM addresses,
and more. The software is compliant with the Adam Walsh Act requirements data and is easily searchable, and may be
mapped, searched and exported.
The Booking Alert feature enables registration officer to be automatically notified if an offender is booked into a jail
anywhere in the United States. Offender Watch © also manages the address verification/compliance check cycle and
places offenders on a calendar, based on their individual verification cycles, with an automatic reminder system. The
Active Offender Notification feature enables agencies to pre-record multiple messages, and then create rules to notify
offenders via an automated call center reminding them of re-registration dates and other compliance standards.
This system automatically manages safety buffers and residency restrictions around schools, day care centers, churches,
bus stops or other places where children gather. Deputies are alerted as the offender is registering. The service also
provides for the public to access and search the database of publishable offenders through custom portals linked to agency
existing websites. This feature allows citizens to run radial searches using Watch's Smart Radial Search feature, register to
receive automatic email notifications of changes affecting their desired addresses and download important tips to protect
their family and more. In addition, this feature analyzes the density of offenders near an address and either restricts the
radial or enlarges the radial to provide citizens with a reasonable and manageable number of offenders.
Citizens may register to receive email notifications each time there is a change regarding offenders within their
area. Citizens may register an unlimited number of addresses for which to receive alerts. Offender Watch © prints and
mails postal card notifications to all residents within the prescribed radius as required by your law, plus the institutions
selected for a notification list, such as schools, day cares, libraries, within 48 hours of offender registration.

FFY15 Victim Assistance Discretionary Grant Training (VADGT) Program
Introduction

VICTIM ASSISTANCE DISCRETIONARY GRANT TRAINING PROGRAM FFY15
INTRODUCTION
Under this award, the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) made $25 million available to eligible
state victim assistance programs to apply for noncompetitive funding to support training and
technical assistance for victim assistance service providers and others who work with crime
victims. Illinois was awarded $946,913.
The purpose of this program is to provide each state and territory with funding to support
training and technical assistance for victim assistance grantees and others who work with crime
victims. States are encouraged the use of the funds to enhance existing State Victim Assistance
Academies (SVAAs) or to establish new ones. These funds can also support statewide training
initiatives, crime victim related conferences, basic training for new programs for underserved
victims, and scholarships to service providers and others who work with crime victims. As with
all VOCA awards, states would have the year of the award plus three years to spend these funds.
RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
Illinois has an extensive network of coalitions and statewide issue groups that are supported by
strong legislation dedicated to victim rights and services. Yet, Illinois is a large, diverse state
that still has many unmet needs in the victim services field. Local agencies throughout the state
struggle to meet the training and staffing needs for their services. Issue specific training is
available in some areas and increasingly required for some positions, but the availability of
training that is affordable and the opportunity to hear state and national experts in many fields is
often beyond the reach of local agencies.
Funding from this program will be used to expand training opportunities for victim service
advocates throughout the state of Illinois. One such opportunity is the Illinois Victim Assistance
Academy (IVAA) through the Illinois Office of the Attorney General (OAG). Following the lead
of the National Victim Assistance Academy and the OVC State Victim Academies Cluster
group, IVAA has worked with a curriculum and provided sessions that reflect a more skill-based
approach.

 VADGT FFY15
January 19, 2016

The Office of the Attorney General also provides leadership in coordinating Illinois’ efforts to
serve sexual assault survivors. Through the Illinois Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE)
program, the OAG coordinates adult and adolescent SANE 40-hour educational component
training on a statewide basis and provides two-day Advanced SANE and 40-hour Pediatric
SANE trainings to practicing SANEs.
Other training opportunities are provided through the state coalitions; the Illinois Coalition
Against Domestic Violence (ICADV), and the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault
(ICASA). Both of these agencies provide training for victim service advocates through a network
of partner agencies throughout the state of Illinois.
Since their inception, ICADV trainings have played an important role in helping advocates,
counselors, and criminal justice professionals across the state develop their skills. The trainings
also help participants learn about emerging and topical issues in the field.
The ICASA will also receive funding through this program. In order to be most effective in their
work, counselors and advocates need training to ensure their information is current. Changes in
the law and turnover among advocates require annual training updates. Sexual assault
counselors also require training to stay abreast of new counseling techniques to practice skills
and to receive clinical consultation.

RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
On October 22 and 23, 2013, the Authority convened the Victim Service Ad Hoc Committee
(VSAHC) to review past priorities and define new ones for the use of STOP VAWA funds. The
VSAHC recommended that FFY14 - FFY16 VAWA funds be used principally to continue to
support programs previously funded through VAWA. The designations recommended in this
memo and future designations will be consistent with the priorities set forth in the VAWA
FFY13 – FFY16 Multi-Year Plan.

At the 2013 VSAHC planning meeting, Multi-disciplinary Team (MDT) Response Programs
were identified as a funding priority. In July, 2015, the Authority issued a Request for
Application (RFA) seeking proposals for the development or enhancement of sexual assault or
domestic violence MDTs. Five of the eight submissions met all RFA requirements and were
recommended for funding by the review panel. The projects began January 1, 2016, so staff
requests that these designations be retroactive to that date. Staff recommends designating funds

Program Description
MDT programs are designed to bridge the gaps in service for victims of domestic violence
through the establishment and implementation of model protocols and model guidelines to
enhance the criminal justice response to victims. MDT programs are multi-disciplinary and
require, at minimum, the involvement of prosecutors; law enforcement; probation; victim service
agencies; and an MDT Coordinator who convenes regular meeting of team partners to examine
the operation of team response to victims.
Program Activities
The overall focus of this Domestic Violence MDT expansion project are to identify households
that are at high-risk for future violence, proactively connect families to services, strengthen
investigation and prosecution of domestic violence offenders, provide inter-disciplinary
trainings, and to conduct ongoing self-evaluation to ensure that our pilot program continues to
benefit victims of domestic violence in the communities served.
The MDT partners will be responsible for ongoing monthly case reviews identifying trends from
case reviews that inform practices of all agencies involved, identification of training needs, long
term planning and assuring that leadership from all agencies remain involved and committed to
the MDT approach for addressing domestic violence in the City of Chicago. Various cases will
be reviewed, including cases where charges were not filed, cases that have reached disposition
and cases that have ongoing involvement with Adult Probation. During case review, team
members will have the opportunity to discuss what other evidence may have been considered,
what other questions may have been included in the victim and witness interviews, what other
sanctions may have been effective in terms of sentence and court monitoring as well as

additional services that could have proved beneficial to the survivor. These meetings will be led
by the designated Assistant State’s Attorney on the project and will be confidential in nature.
Goals
To develop and implement, or expand, a program that provides specialized criminal justice and
victim service personnel in the areas of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and
stalking through a Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) Response so that victim services can be
provided in a coordinated fashion and hold offenders accountable.
The Authority has developed standard objectives and performance measures for each component
of the MDT programs.
Priorities
At the 2013 Authority Victim Services Ad-hoc planning meeting, Multi-disciplinary Team
(MDT) Response Programs were identified as a funding priority. In July, 2015, the Authority
issued a Request for Application (RFA) seeking proposals for the development or enhancement
of sexual assault or domestic violence MDTs. Five of the eight submissions met all RFA
requirements and were recommended for funding by the review panel. The projects will begin
January 1, 2016.

Awards resulting from this RFA are for 12 months of activity with the possibility of two 12month continuations based on satisfactory performance.

Program Activities
The Sexual Assault Multidisciplinary team will utilize a model that encompasses a core team for
leadership as well as a broad based multi-disciplinary team (MDT) approach through the Cook
County State’s Attorney’s Office (SAO) Sexual Assault Advisory Group. The core team will
function as a steering committee for the project and will be made up of the SAO, Rape Victim
Advocates (RVA), Chicago Police Department (CPD), The Cook County Probation Department,
Life Span and a designated SANE Nurse. This team will be responsible for ongoing monthly
case reviews (led by the Assistant State’s Attorney), identifying trends from case reviews that
inform practices of all agencies involved, identification of training needs, long term planning and
assuring that leadership from all agencies remain involved and committed to the MDT approach
for addressing sexual assault in the City of Chicago with a primary area of focus on Area North.
This core team will be responsible for ensuring a proactive, results-oriented process that
purposefully achieves the goals of the MDT model.

The original Sexual Assault Multi-Disciplinary Team Response Project funded through the
Authority has grown over the years and has expanded into a designated Sexual Assault
Response Team (SART) with the addition of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) at
Presence St. Mary’s Hospital.
The success of the Kankakee County Sexual Assault and Stalking Response Team (SART)
lies within the responsibilities of its core funded and match funded team members who meet
monthly to discuss issues related to sexual assault and stalking, problem solve, conduct case
reviews, network to build relationships and explore training needs. The focus of the Kankakee
County SART is to heighten sensitivity to victims of sexual assault and stalking while
improving the initial response, evidence collection, victim interviews, victim referrals, and
prosecution and conviction rates. The SART follows the Model Guidelines for Sex Crimes
Investigation Manual for Illinois Law Enforcement which has been updated and expanded on
to accommodate each discipline participating in the SART.

be comprised of 17 funded and match positions which will be utilized to assist victims and
deal with domestic violence offenders. The PCDV-MDT has team members co-located in
downtown Peoria, at The Peoria County Family Justice Center. Located across the street
from the Peoria County Courthouse, it co-locates partner agencies creating a confidential,
secure, neutral "One Stop Shop" for victims of domestic violence to access to receive
services and emotional support. The PCDV-MDT initiates contact with victims of domestic
violence as soon as possible after the incidents occur. From the time the domestic violence
occurs, until resolution of the case in civil or criminal court, as well as for the duration
offenders are participating in domestic violence counseling, or on probation, the PCDVMDT provides extensive one on one follow up to victims of domestic violence in Peoria
County. The PCDV-MDT also actively network with community agencies to assist victims
in accessing the resources they require for their safety and wellbeing. The PC-MDT

Illinois Department of Corrections, Regional Board of Education, Corrective Solutions, St. Clair
County Juvenile Justice Council, St. Clair County Elder Justice Council, East St. Louis Housing
Authority, local colleges and universities, and law enforcement associations.
Through this program expansion, the State’s Attorney’s Office will, for the first time, incorporate
sexual assault and related offenses into the MDT grant. All misdemeanor classified sexual
offenses will be transferred to the courtroom that previously only handled domestic violence and
violations of orders of protection misdemeanors to facilitate the targeted prosecution by attorneys
specifically trained in the unique aspects of prosecuting sex crimes. Additionally, a
comprehensive training program by prosecutors will be implemented by the State’s Attorney’s

Program Summary (State the intent of the program, the target population and intended consequences. Briefly summarize what will
be done. Who will do it? How it will be done? Where? When?):
The Illinois Integrated Protocol Initiative is funded by OVW through the Grants to Encourage Arrest and Enforcement of Protection
Orders program (FFY14 award). The 23 Local Family Violence Coordinating Councils and 2 additional contracts (Macon
Resources/Blue Tower Training and the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board) were previously funded by OVW
through the Grants to Encourage Arrest and Enforcement of Protection Orders program (FFY11 award). The funds requested on this
recommendation are to allow the grantees/contractors to continue expand upon the work from the FFY11 grant and the first year of the
FFY14 grant.
The IFVCC Integrated Protocol Initiative (IPI) has as its goal the statewide adoption and implementation of protocols for law
enforcement, prosecution, and victim services on domestic violence, elder abuse, and abuse perpetrated against women with
disabilities. The renewal FFY14 grant allows this work to continue and expand to working with emergency medical services, 911
personnel, probation and court personnel. Additionally, evaluation will be done to measure the effectiveness of the protocol trainings
that occurred in the prior grant.
This goal will be achieved through utilization of the existing statewide Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Councils and local
Councils in each of the 23 judicial circuits, to provide localized training and technical assistance for the adoption and implementation
of each of the protocols. Through this process it is anticipated that the formal and informal relationships among the systems (criminal
justice, social services, law enforcement, etc.) will be strengthened with the resulting improvement in response for victims, including
an increase in arrests and prosecutions.
In order to successfully execute the goals of this project an Advisory Committee has been convened comprised of statewide
stakeholders. The Advisory Committee provided oversight and technical assistance for the updating of the
• 2008 Model Domestic Violence Protocol for Law Enforcement and Prosecution; and the
• 2009 Protocol for Law Enforcement: Responding to Victims of Elder Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation;
as well as for the development of:
• Protocol for Prosecution: Responding to Victims of Elder Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation;
• Law Enforcement Protocol: People With Disabilities Who Experience Abuse;
• Prosecution Protocol: People With Disabilities Who Experience Abuse .
Teams, made up of prosecutors, law enforcement, domestic violence educators, first responders, court personnel and the local council
coordinator, from each of the 23 circuits attended Training of Trainers sessions and are providing training and technical assistance to
professionals in their local circuits on the protocols. Through the local circuit Arrest Grant Planning Committees, the protocols
currently in use in the circuits are being reviewed and updated as needed to meet the standards of the Model Protocol. Training and

implementation plans for the circuit have been developed by this multidisciplinary committee, made up of criminal justice, law
enforcement, and the local domestic violence, elder abuse and disability service providers and are in process in the local circuits.
The Illinois Law Enforcement Leadership Institute on Violence Against Women was established to develop stronger leadership in the
law enforcement community on the issues of violence against women. The Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board
Executive Institute will continue to develop and facilitate a training process for first-line supervisors to promote consistent
implementation and adoption of policy changes at the supervisory level. Illinois.

Goals for the Program (Goals are a broad statement of what will be achieved.)
The IFVCC Integrated Protocol Initiative (IPI) has as its goal the statewide adoption and implementation of protocols for law

Evidence Based / Promising Practices (Describe briefly any EBP/PP incorporated within your program strategy)
The Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Councils and the Illinois Integrated Protocol Initiative is based on the Coordinated
Community Response model for addressing violence against women. “Since 1995, The Violence Against Women Act has provided
grants that support a wide range of activities that emphasize “a coordinated community response from advocacy organizations in
partnership with the criminal justice system [as] critical to reducing violent crimes of violence against women and enhancing victim
safety and offender accountability.” Program Overview, Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies and Enforcement of Protection Orders

RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
At the 2013 Victim Services Ad-Hoc Committee (VSAHC) planning meeting, Multi-disciplinary
Team (MDT) Response Programs were identified as a funding priority. In July, 2015, the
Authority issued a Request for Application (RFA) seeking proposals for the development or
enhancement of sexual assault or domestic violence MDTs. Five of the eight submissions met all
RFA requirements and were recommended for funding by the review panel. The projects began
January 1, 2016, so staff requests that these designations be retroactive to that date.
Staff recommends designating funds to entities and programs as described below. Further details

Program Description
MDT programs are designed to bridge the gaps in service for victims of domestic violence
through the establishment and implementation of model protocols and model guidelines to
enhance the criminal justice response to victims. MDT programs are multi-disciplinary and
require, at minimum, the involvement of prosecutors; law enforcement; probation; victim service
agencies; and an MDT Coordinator who convenes regular meeting of team partners to examine
the operation of team response to victims.
Program Activities
The overall focus of this Domestic Violence MDT expansion project are to identify households
that are at high-risk for future violence, proactively connect families to services, strengthen
investigation and prosecution of domestic violence offenders, provide inter-disciplinary
trainings, and to conduct ongoing self-evaluation to ensure that our pilot program continues to
benefit victims of domestic violence in the communities served.
The MDT partners will be responsible for ongoing monthly case reviews identifying trends from
case reviews that inform practices of all agencies involved, identification of training needs, long
term planning and assuring that leadership from all agencies remain involved and committed to
the MDT approach for addressing domestic violence in the City of Chicago. Various cases will
be reviewed, including cases where charges were not filed, cases that have reached disposition
and cases that have ongoing involvement with Adult Probation. During case review, team
members will have the opportunity to discuss what other evidence may have been considered,
what other questions may have been included in the victim and witness interviews, what other
sanctions may have been effective in terms of sentence and court monitoring as well as

additional services that could have proved beneficial to the survivor. These meetings will be led
by the designated Assistant State’s Attorney on the project and will be confidential in nature.
Goals
To develop and implement, or expand, a program that provides specialized criminal justice and
victim service personnel in the areas of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and
stalking through a Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) Response so that victim services can be
provided in a coordinated fashion and hold offenders accountable.
The Authority has developed standard objectives and performance measures for each component
of the MDT programs.
Priorities
At the 2013 Authority Victim Services Ad-hoc planning meeting, Multi-disciplinary Team
(MDT) Response Programs were identified as a funding priority. In July, 2015, the Authority

Program Description
MDT programs are designed to bridge the gaps in service for victims of sexual assault through
the establishment and implementation of model protocols and model guidelines to enhance the
criminal justice response to victims. MDT programs are multi-disciplinary and require, at
minimum, the involvement of prosecutors; law enforcement; probation; victim service agencies;
and an MDT Coordinator who convenes regular meeting of team partners to examine the
operation of team response to victims. MDTs often also include unfunded partners such as
Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANE).
Program Activities
The Sexual Assault Multidisciplinary team will utilize a model that encompasses a core team for
leadership as well as a broad based multi-disciplinary team (MDT) approach through the Cook
County State’s Attorney’s Office (SAO) Sexual Assault Advisory Group. The core team will
function as a steering committee for the project and will be made up of the SAO, Rape Victim
Advocates (RVA), Chicago Police Department (CPD), The Cook County Probation Department,
Life Span and a designated SANE Nurse. This team will be responsible for ongoing monthly
case reviews (led by the Assistant State’s Attorney), identifying trends from case reviews that
inform practices of all agencies involved, identification of training needs, long term planning and
assuring that leadership from all agencies remain involved and committed to the MDT approach
for addressing sexual assault in the City of Chicago with a primary area of focus on Area North.
This core team will be responsible for ensuring a proactive, results-oriented process that
purposefully achieves the goals of the MDT model.

The overall mission of this Domestic Violence MDT expansion project is to strengthen
investigation and prosecution of domestic violence offenders, provide inter-disciplinary
trainings, and to conduct ongoing self-evaluation to ensure that our pilot program continues to

dramatic expansion of both funded and unfunded partners, including Call for Help, Inc., the
Illinois Department of Corrections, Regional Board of Education, Corrective Solutions, St. Clair
County Juvenile Justice Council, St. Clair County Elder Justice Council, East St. Louis Housing
Authority, local colleges and universities, and law enforcement associations.
Through this program expansion, the State’s Attorney’s Office will, for the first time, incorporate
sexual assault and related offenses into the MDT grant. All misdemeanor classified sexual
offenses will be transferred to the courtroom that previously only handled domestic violence and
violations of orders of protection misdemeanors to facilitate the targeted prosecution by attorneys
specifically trained in the unique aspects of prosecuting sex crimes. Additionally, a
comprehensive training program by prosecutors will be implemented by the State’s Attorney’s
