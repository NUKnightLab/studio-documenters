I would like to say good evening to everybody,

7

South Loop, Drake, Chinatown, all of our

8

12

manner tonight.

13

important, so we want to make sure we hear them

14

So this meeting is part of the

17

reassignment boundary change for National Teachers

18

Academy, which was proposed to the board on

19

December 1st following months of community

20

engagement leading up to the announcement.

21

You all have seen me.

I am Chip Johnson,

5

specific proposal.

So as I mentioned before, the purpose of

18

this meeting is to allow CEO Jackson and the board

office to hear feedback from you about the

20

specific proposal under discussion.

21

by running through a brief description tonight,

22

and then I will give you the information on the

14

the stenographer that you see here that is taking

notes and the notetaker will not be present in

Please note that these

17

This meeting is part of a broader

So over the past year, we

have engaged various communities on this proposal

14

and have had good feedback and formed adjustments

15

to the proposal.

16

communities, as you see here.

17

Drake, Haines, Healy, NTA, South Loop, Ward;

18

community members from Armour Square, Bronzeville,

23

five meetings of the steering committee comprised

24

of community leaders across these groups, over 30
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

We had

 January 9, 2018
Page 8
1

small group meetings with various stakeholders,

2

and received over 900 emails at the

3

cps.edu/transitions website.

4

In this engagement, we heard a lot of

5

feedback from various perspectives, including

6

those interested in high school and potential

7

boundaries, as well as others who want to maintain

8

NTA as an elementary school, including its strong

9

culture and staff.

10

We worked to adjust our proposal in

11

response to various points of feedback, including

12

expanding the South Loop boundaries to incorporate

13

all of NTA's current boundary and releasing an

14

initial draft boundary and releasing the boundary

15

for community feedback.

16

We also wanted to take time to explain

17

the proposal and where it stands today and

18

continue to gather feedback through these

19

community meetings.

20

So as we move into the proposal, you'll

21

see all the proposed changes are scheduled to

22

begin in school year 2019 and 2020.

23

elementary side, this proposal involves a new

24

state-of-the-art South Loop facility, three-campus
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

On the

 January 9, 2018
Page 9
1

model at South Loop, and expanding South Loop's

2

boundary to encompass all of NTA's current

3

boundary over time.

4

On the potential high school conversion,

5

as you see on the graph, this proposal involves

6

NTA, rather than converting to a high school over

7

time, transitioning grades pre-K to 3 to South

8

Loop while allowing students in grades 4 through 8

9

to remain at NTA or to transfer to South Loop and

10

provide a guaranteed seat for all NTA students to

11

attend the high school regardless of where they

12

live.

13

In the following slides, we will go

14

through a few details of this proposal.

15

of the high school conversion timeline, this

16

proposal involves the following changes for

17

2019/2020:

18

South Loop; enrolling incoming kindergarten

19

students at South Loop; rising students in grades

20

1 through 3 will be reassigned to South Loop or

21

have the option to transfer to another school; NTA

22

students in grades 4 through 8 to either stay at

23

NTA or transition to South Loop.

24

In terms

Transition of pre-K program at NTA to

All NTA students will have a guaranteed

312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 10
1

seat of the high school regardless of where they

2

live.

3

Starting in school year 2019/2020, NTA

4

would begin a gradual conversion to a high school

5

over time.

6

contain students in grades 4 through 9 in

7

2019/2020 years.

8

gradually phase in high school grades while

9

phasing out the elementary school grades.

As you can see below, NTA would

In subsequent years, NTA would

10

So by school year 2022/'23, NTA would

11

contain students in grades 7 through 12 and in

12

school year 2024 through '25 and beyond, NTA would

13

only contain the high school grades 9 through 12.

14

We will ensure that high school and

15

elementary grade transitions will be managed with

16

the appropriate safety and security

17

considerations.

18

In terms of the transition for specific

19

NTA students, starting in 2019/2020, the pre-K

20

program at NTA program will be located at South

21

Loop.

22

For students in the neighborhood program,

23

rising kindergarten students that live in the

24

current boundaries of NTA will be zoned to South

The RGC programs for grades 4 through 8

would remain at NTA and phase out over time.

would also have the option to transfer in to South

12

students and the phaseout of elementary school

13

grades at NTA.

14

This boundary change over time is in

So, for example, in school year

15

2019/2020, kindergarten through 3rd grade at NTA

16

transitions to South Loop; and likewise, the

17

boundary for kindergarten through 3rd grade

18

students in NTA's current boundary will be South

19

Loop.

20

NTA will offer grades 4 through 8, so the

21

boundaries for students in grades 4 through 8's

22

NTA current boundary will still be NTA.

23
24

All students residing in this boundary in
grades 4 through 8 will also have the option to

attend South Loop Elementary School.
We recognize that this change will be

3

difficult for some families and students.

4

engaged both NTA and South Loop parents in

5

developing this transition plan, including

6

multiple steering committee meetings.

7

We

Ultimately we developed a draft plan that

8

budgets 3.5 million to support that transition of

9

NTA students to South Loop and the coming together

10
11

of these two school communities.
So some of the key transitions that we

12

included were:

13

activities designed to support community building

14

and culture integration, starting the year prior

15

to any proposed actions.

The budget for variety and events

16

Another one was creating of a Joint

17

Culture and Climate Team comprised of staff,

18

parents, and student representatives from both NTA

19

and South Loop.

20

Then the principal and school-based

21

transition coordinators to assist with

22

implementation of new programs and practices at

23

each school.

24

support, examples are recording transfers and the

We would also provide logistical

like, and the other supports identified by both

2

schools' leadership.

3

Implementation of restorative practices:

4

Professional development and training

5

opportunities for all school staff and

6

transportation for transferring NTA students to

7

commute to South Loop Elementary School.

8
9

In addition, as part of this proposal,
all NTA students as of 2018/'19, regardless of

10

where they live, will have a guaranteed seat at

11

the high school as they matriculate from the

12

elementary school to the high school.

13

Following months of asks from community

14

members, we wanted to release a draft boundary to

15

gather feedback on the proposal.

16

draft, we gathered input from community leaders in

17

the near south area incorporating all effective

18

stakeholders.

19

steering committee were an integral component.

20

To develop this

Conversations with the near south

Ultimately based on these discussions, we

21

released draft boundaries that incorporate both a

22

neighborhood as well as a preference boundary,

23

which I will explain later.

24

As you can see in the map, the proposed
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 15
1

neighborhood boundary incorporates the current

2

elementary school boundaries of the following

3

schools:

4

and James Ward.

5

Drake, Haines, Healy, NTA, South Loop,

The proposed preference boundary

6

incorporates the current elementary school

7

boundaries of both Armour and Holden and Pershing.

8

The addition of the preference boundary allows us

9

to expand quality high school options and

10

opportunities for students in nearby communities

11

and help foster the diversity in the school.

12

In terms of what each boundary means for

13

parents and students, I will explain.

14

neighborhood boundary gives students living in the

15

boundary a guaranteed seat at the school.

The

16

Many high school students choose to

17

attend schools other than their neighborhood

18

school.

19

22 percent of high school students attend their

20

neighborhood school.

21

gives preference to students living in the

22

boundary over other students in the city based on

23

the number of available seats.

24

Across the district, approximately

The preference boundary

If too few students from the preference
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 16
1

boundary want to attend, then the remaining seats

2

would go to students from the rest of the city.

3

If too many students from the preference boundary

4

would want to attend, then CPS would conduct a

5

lottery for the remaining seats.

6

We do not anticipate a lottery based on

7

current enrollment projections, which we will

8

review here on the next slide.

9

There are 2,037 high-school-age students

10

living in the boundary area, including both

11

neighborhood and preference boundaries.

12

students would make up one of the most diverse

13

high school communities in the city with

14

27 percent of African-Americans attending,

15

19 percent Hispanic, 41 percent Asian, and 74

16

low-income students.

17

These

The estimated capacity of the high school

18

is between 1,000 and 1200 students, depending on

19

the final space configuration if the proposal is

20

to move forward.

21

Based upon school preference among

22

current students in the area and enrollment

23

patterns at other highly sought-after neighborhood

24

schools, projected enrollment among students
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 17
1

living in the neighborhood boundary is not

2

expected to exceed 50 percent.

3

Based on current enrollment projections,

4

this would allow students in both the neighborhood

5

and preference boundary to attend the school.

6

This projection has been based on an

7

analysis of highly sought-after schools with

8

neighborhood boundaries, such as Lincoln Park High

9

School, which draws only 46 percent of students

10
11

living in its boundary.
In addition, 60 percent of the current

12

high school students who live in the draft

13

boundary area already attend a selective

14

enrollment or a Level 1 Plus high school.

15

That's the presentation.

16

Moving into public cmment, before we get

17

started with the public comment section, I wanted

18

to go over a few logistics and the guidelines for

19

a very good conducive and respectful meeting.

20

voices at these community meetings that expressed

I'm a parent of two CPS graduates and
I'm the [inaudible] --

We oppose the closing of NTA, which is
falsely labeled a reassignment boundary change.
For years, CPS has used questionable

10

measures in their school action decisions, closing

11

so-called low-performing schools based on narrow

12

metrics of test scores or closing so-called

13

underutilized schools based on deeply flawed space

14

utilization formulas, which allows 36 students in

15

a classroom.

16

We've objected to those standards, and

17

the lack of a broad context used to analyze how a

18

school is doing again and again and again.

19

schools are forced to adapt to these various

20

metrics CPS imposes on them as they are judged,

21

punished, or rewarded.

22

But

So now CPS has decided to toss their own

23

rules and close this high-performing

24

African-American school.

So tonight, we do want to say, because we

know there may be parents here from Bridgeport who

are just hearing about this, we want to say to

you, do not become part of these racist hunger

The

16

other day, her teacher emailed me and another

17

parent, about a conflict she had witnessed between

18

my daughter and her friend that resulted in hurt

19

feelings.

20

This is the age where many preteen girls go

21

through experiences similar to this.

The conflict itself wasn't surprising.

22

What I appreciate, though, was the great

23

length that her teacher went to help repair that

24

space.

She didn't just ask one girl to apologize
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 42

to the other, but rather she took them through an

2

exercise of reflection, listening, accountability,

3

and working together to resolve the issue so it

4

wouldn't happen again.

5

restorative justice where problems are adjusted

6

head on, healing is prioritized, and justice and

7

community are at the foundation at all is why my

8

children are at National Teachers Academy, and

9

this is what they will lose if NTA is converted

10
11

This process of

into a high school.
The fact that my daughter, who isn't even

12

10 yet, is engaging in this type of learning every

13

day in her school gives me hope not only for the

14

kind of citizen that she and her peers will become

15

but for the future of this amazing city.

16

I truly believe that tomorrow's activists

17

and public servants, those who are organizing

18

rallying on the streets of Chicago and improving

19

it for its better will come from the National

20

Teachers Academy.

21

Schools like this should be highlighted,

22

replicated, and improved, not underutilized or

23

closed down.

24

Unfortunately, though, we're here today
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

because CPS has decided that it's in the best

2

interest of the near south community to dismantle

3

the great working happening at NTA and convert it

4

to a high school.

5

So tonight, I ask if NTA had been

6

majority white, would we be standing here before

school to open a neighborhood high school because

9

of the belief that there is no viable high school

10

option in the near south is actually insulting to

11

the hard work of Phillips and Dunbar and the work

12

that they have put in their schools to get them to

13

where they are today.

14

To dismantle a thriving community

It also enables the South Loop

15

communities' unfounded racism and classism toward

16

their school options that they have.

17

should be investing in these institutions and

18

their 4600 vacancies, rather than creating a

19

brand-new option at the expense of another

20

community.

14 percent of the kids were meeting our city and

people in this room, both politicians and CPS

understand these transitions and understand the

that's going to serve such a diversified group in

Now, if you drive south on Halsted -- has

I'm honestly wondering, why are we even

I think what is most important to me is I

wonder when CPS releases this process of the

school transition or whatever it's called, what

7

weight or consideration is given to how a

8

proposal, even if it originates within a

9

community, or opposing, lack of better term,

10

community, what consideration is given to that how

11

proposal will affect most of these communities.

evidence that it has a negative affect on GPA.

we have been raising in our racial equity

assessment is let's take a look at the plan.

Let's ask ourselves two questions:

21

benefit?

22

First of all, a racial equity

Who gets the

Who bears the burden?
And if the burdens are borne by the same

23

people that have borne burdens by Chicago's

24

planning in the past, the same families who have
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

Page 84
1

been burdened in the past, the same racial groups,

2

black and Latino families predominantly in Chicago

3

who have borne the burdens of racist policies,

4

then we have to say to ourselves, that's not

5

right.

6

Now, I hear that there are families here

7

who have come forward who didn't know about this

8

plan before today, and they're just interested in

9

a high school.

And I would say to you it's okay

10

for you to have intention for something good for

11

your child.

Everybody has that.

12

But what I would say to you also is now

13

that you know it does something where it puts a

14

burden on black families in Chicago, low-income

15

black families in Chicago, you have to ask

16

yourself a question:

17

something for your child come before your

18

intention to be antiracist?

19

Does your intention to have

Antiracist is different than not being a

20

racist.

21

to actively do something against black people,

Latino people, people of different races.

23

antiracist means that when I see something that's

24

going on that is disproportionately burdening

Not being a racist means I am not going

through, comes to life, and all of us at NTA are

second, if anybody needs a screen shot, I have it.

With 80 percent low income, that's the reason

8

they're not sending their children there, and

that's the impetus for this plan.

So if you think about that for a

11

know that you are standing with that mindset.

14

think to themselves, when this is documented, like

your data, your research, your numbers.

showing your children that you are standing on the

grader, and fifth grader.

Her dad's name is Maurice.

There's

Under the new proposal, their grandpa

14

walks them to school every day.

15

going to be at different schools.

16

major concern of the communities where there's a

17

lot of grandparents or people like Ms. Peaches,

18

who walks these kids to school, is how

19

logistically are they going to walk them.

These kids are
That is the

20

And it's more than just about travel.

21

This little girl, only 5th grade, was worried

22

23

sister that I can't look out for.

people, I hear you that you want a high school.

2

But it is different to live in 500-, $600,000

3

homes than to live in Long Grove and have your

4

grandparent have to be transporting you to three

5

different schools.

6

So I think -- think about what side

7

you're going to stand on and stand on the right

8

side of justice when you're thinking about these

9

things.

It's easy for us to say I'm not a racist,

10

but maybe we should all take a look at ourselves

11

and think maybe there's a little part of me that's

12

racist or a big part of me that's racist and do

13

something about that.

14

My other thing to think about is this:

15

If this is engaging all of the community, all of

16

you elected officials need to keep your elected

17

official pages open for public comments.

MR. JOHNSON:

We'd like to thank everybody

tonight for comments.

20

I do want to share with you who's in the

21

22

From Office of Diverse Learner Supports and

23

Services, ODLSS, Shani Boone and Luis Rodriguez,

would you please stand just so they know who you

community meeting will be held next Tuesday,
