CALLING UPON THE GOVERNOR TO VETO VIDEO POKER
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to
Article VII, Section 6 (a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise
any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board recognizes the tremendous economic
challenges facing the State of Illinois and the nation, we also recognize that there
has to be revenue in order to meet essential challenges like capital development
and improvements in order to ensure the safety and welfare of the people we
represent; and
WHEREAS, we feel that the proposed revenue projection from video poker does
not provide a solid revenue stream for capital bonds proposed in the State budget;
and
WHEREAS, the proposed Video Poker Bill which does not fall under the purview
of regulations and monitoring of the Illinois Gaming Act raises serious questions as
to the fiscal impact upon local units of government to enforce any unlawful acts or
behavior rising out of the operation or customers utilization of such gaming
machines; and

COOK COUNTY CLERK, David Orr, by Jan Kralovec, Director of Elections,
transmitting a Communication:
The Clerk is submitting for approval changes in precinct boundaries under the
jurisdiction of the Cook County Election Department. The Clerk proposes to
eliminate 350 voting precincts changing the total number from 2,290 to 1,940.
More than half of these precincts share a polling place with other precincts.
Reducing the number of precincts and combining precincts will save the costs
associated with the Judges of Elections, equipment programming, equipment
delivery and polling place rental fees.
