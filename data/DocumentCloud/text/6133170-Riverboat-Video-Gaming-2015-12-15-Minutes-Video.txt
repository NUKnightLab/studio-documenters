Proposed Amendment to the Video Gaming Rule 555
Rule 555 (Withdrawal of Applications")[1] currently authorizes applicants for licensure to
withdraw their applications without leave of the Board, if written notification is received before
Board action on licensure, and unless the intended withdrawal is objected to by the
Administrator.
It is proposed to amend Rule 555 by authorizing the Administrator to approve surrenders of
licenses as well as withdrawals. Analogously to withdrawals, a license granted by the Board
may be surrendered without leave of the Board if written notification of surrender is received,
unless the intended surrender is objected to by the Administrator. This surrender provision will
apply to all categories of licensure under the Act.
