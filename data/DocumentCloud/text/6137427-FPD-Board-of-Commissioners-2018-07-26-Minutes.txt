since the beginning of the 20th Century; and

region likely will experience increased events of extreme precipitation during winter and spring, and

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REQUESTING A SUMMIT BETWEEN COUNTY AND FOREST PRESERVES LEADERS
WITH MEMBERS OF THE PUERTO RICAN COMMUNITY
WHEREAS, on June 14, while setting up to celebrate her birthday at the Forest Preserve Caldwell
Woods, Ms. Mia Irizarry was harassed for at least 36 minutes by a man who questioned and berated her
about her Puerto Rican flag shirt, with all this captured in a video taken by Ms. Irizarry; and
WHEREAS, recent data from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State
University, San Bernardino shows that hate crimes in the top 10 U.S. cities increased 12.46 percent in
2017 from the previous year with anti-Latino hate crime bias listed as one of the most common types of
hate crimes in 2017; and
WHEREAS, in said video, a Forest Preserves Police officer is seen standing by without taking
appropriate action despite numerous requests for help and intervention from Ms. Irizarry, who repeatedly
Page 9 of 47

 Journal of Proceedings
FPD Board of Commissioners

July 26, 2018

expressed her fear for her safety; and
WHEREAS, on July 9, a 5-minute clip of the original video was shared via social media by a national
organization and quickly went viral, prompting responses and requests for action from the community
and national representatives including the Honorable Ricardo Rosselló, Governor of Puerto Rico; and
WHEREAS, the officer of the Forest Preserves District of Cook County was placed on desk duty on
June 26, and resigned on his own accord on July 11, before his scheduled hearing regarding the incident;
and
WHEREAS, as of this moment the 5-minute clipped video has been viewed more than 42 million times;
and
WHEREAS, the inaction by the officer embarrassed many law enforcement officers and tarnished the
whole department with his failure to act in accordance with his oath to serve and protect the community
of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the unfairness that Ms. Irizarry had to endure, multiplied by the attention given to the
incident, thanks to the distribution of the video via social media, has created a perceived and real harm to
the relationships between the Puerto Rican community, the Forest Preserves Police and representatives of
this government; and
WHEREAS, this one incident reflects a situation that, while not exclusive to the Forest Preserves or
Cook County, requires a clear and substantial intervention by the leaders of these governmental units in
conjunction with leaders of the Puerto Rican community and Ms. Irizarry, to fully understand and address
the circumstances which contributed to this incident, in an effort to repair the harm that resulted from this
injustice; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of the Forest Preserves
of Cook County requests that a meeting, or set of meetings, be held by the President of the Forest
Preserves of Cook County Board of Commissioners, the General Superintendent of the Forest Preserves
of Cook County, the Chief of the Forest Preserves Police, and the Cook County State’s Attorney with
members and leaders of the Puerto Rican Community of Cook County and Ms. Mia Irizarry or her
representative to fully understand and address the circumstances which contributed to this incident, and
find common ground for policy and training reforms to ensure that the harm that this injustice created can
be repaired and the relationships restored; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the members of the Board of Commissioners of the Forest
Preserves of Cook County hereby express their deepest regret and most heartfelt apology to Ms. Mia
Irizarry for the regrettable situation she had to endure, and vows to work on making sure these incidents
are never repeated and reassert our commitment to making the Forest Preserves of Cook County a place
where everyone is, and feels, welcome and safe for discovery, renewal and fun.
