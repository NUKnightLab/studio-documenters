and extend for thirteen (13) months, Contract No. 08-41-321 with THE

 FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
OCTOBER 6, 2009
PAGE 31
Reason:

Pursuant to Clause 5(f) of the agreed order appointing a Transitional
Administrator, 99 C 3945 Doe v. Cook County, the Office of the
Transitional Administrator, in its authority as established in the Court
Order entered on August 14, 2007, has selected The Wackenhut
Corporation to provide security services to ensure the safety and
security of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC)
residents and staff members while the JTDC continues to implement
its hiring plan. The JTDC continues to experience unexpected
terminations, resignations, transfers and new eligibility requirements,
causing fluctuations in the needs for the JTDC staff coverage. The
expiration date of the current contract was May 31, 2009. The
contract was extended on June 16, 2009 for the period beginning
June 1, 2009 through August 31, 2009; however, the contract was
not extended due to a delay on the part of the vendor. We are
projecting the need for continued services provided by the
Wackenhut Corporation through June 30, 2010.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $5,042,594.85 (FY 2009: $542,594.85; and FY 2010:
$4,500,000.00). Contract extension: June 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010. (569260 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2010 funds.
* Referred to the Committee on Finance on 09/16/09.
Chairman Daley stated Earl Dunlap, Transitional Administrator for the
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center has requested that the Finance
Committee convene in Executive Session with respect to Communication
Number 302621.
Commissioner Peraica questioned the legality of convening in Executive Session
without notice. Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State’s Attorney, responded that
the request for Executive Session does meet the guidelines for the Open
Meetings Act, inasmuch as Doe v. Cook County is pending litigation.
COMMISSIONER GORMAN, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MURPHY,

SESSION BE CONVENED TO DISCUSS DOE v. COOK COUNTY. THIS

Chairman Daley entered into the record a facsimile entitled, “National Press

NO ACTION WAS TAKEN BY THE FINANCE COMMITTEE WITH RESPECT
TO COMMUNICATION NO. 302621.
