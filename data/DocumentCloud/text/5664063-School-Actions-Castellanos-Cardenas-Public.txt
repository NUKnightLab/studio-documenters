MS. CARRETO:

I just want to welcome everyone

6

to the first two meetings that we're having

7

regarding the consolidation of Castellanos and

8

Cardenas Elementary.

9

So just a brief overview of how we're

10

going to conduct the meeting.

11

an introduction of the meeting, then we'll have a

12

presentation regarding school action, and then we'll

13

take public comments.

14

We're going to have

Like I said, my name is Cristina Carreto.

15

I'm the Family and Community Engagement Manager for

16

CPS.

17

Minerva Garcia Sanchez, who will be doing the

18

presentation of some of the consolidation today.

19

We also have the Chief of Network here,

The office of all of these departments

20

are going to be here present after the meeting for

21

any questions that you may have.

So they will be here during the meeting and after

2

the meeting if you have any questions.

3

This meeting will last two hours.

I'm

4

going to be giving a presentation about the school

5

action, and then there's also going to be time to

6

listen to your comments from the public.

7

have here a person who is taking notes as well as a

8

court reporter.

9

the comments, everything that's said in today's

10

meeting in public will be taken to the Chief of

11

Schools as well as the Board of Education so that

12

they can make a more informed decision.

13

We also

And that's very important because

If you would like to add public comment,

This is the first meeting today,
Then we have the second

Finally there will be a public

hearing on Thursday, January 25th, from 7:00 to

2

8:00 p.m. in the main board room for CPS, which is

4

If you didn't have an opportunity to make

5

a comment or you don't feel comfortable saying

6

something today, you can also go and send an e-mail

7

to the e-mail address that's up there,

8

transitions@cps.edu, for any comments or any other

9

things that you would like to add to what's said

10
11

today.
And so I'm now going to pass the

12

microphone to the Chief of Schools, Minerva Sanchez,

13

who's going to explain a little bit more.

14

MS. SANCHEZ:

Happy New Year.

Thank you very

15

much for all of you being here for doing this.

16

so we're going to get started with a little bit of

17

information that's up here, general information

18

about the legal process, and so I'm going to read to

19

you exactly what you're seeing up in front so that

20

you can hear.

21

And

So that on October 1st is when -- I'm

22

sorry, let me grab a copy here.

23

the draft guidelines for school actions.

24

on October 1st.

So CPS published

That was

Page 7

On December 1st is when CPS proposed the

2

school actions and sent notice letters and draft

3

transition plans.

4

In January 2018 CPS created two community

5

meetings and one public hearing prior to sending any

6

recommendation to the Board.

7

As Cristina has already explained to you,

8

on February 2018 or later is when CPS will make

9

recommendations to the Board after the community

10

meetings and the hearing.

11

on any recommended school actions.

12

may occur at the February board meeting or at a

13

later date.

The Board will then vote

The consolidated school will operate from

So before the beginning of the school

18

year -- I want to talk about the participation.

19

Before the start of 2017-2018 school year, the LSC

20

at Castellanos voted to request that the Principal

21

of Cardenas would serve over both schools.

22

August 22nd, 2017, the Principal of Cardenas began

23

serving over Castellanos.

24

2017, both LSCs requested a full consolidation of

On

And then on November 2nd,

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 9
1

both schools, right?

2

Are we all on the same page?

Some key facts and figures now.

Cardenas

3

currently serves 555 students.

Castellanos

4

currently serves 601 students.

The attendance areas

5

for Cardenas and Castellanos will be unaffected

6

since both schools serve both attendance areas.

So now I'm going to pass it back to
Cristina.

Thank you very much for your attention.

MS. CARRETO:

So after that presentation, now

10

we're going to open it up to public comment.

11

want to remind you, please, that when I call on your

12

number -- you received your little number outside,

13

so when I call that number, please go up to the

14

microphone next to it because it's important for you

15

to say your name and your school for the people that

16

are taking notes today.

17

I just

the proposal because throughout these 12 years I

7

have seen how the children coming out of Cardenas,

8

which is a Level 1 school, go to other schools, and

9

this school is losing those students.

Why?

Because

10

there's no follow through up until 8th grade.

11

they look for better opportunities mistakenly.

12

So

So when we propose this consolidation of

13

both schools, what we are doing is giving our

14

children the opportunity for them to have a good

15

education from the kindergarten all the way to 8th

grade.

What can I tell you?

I have a mix of

feelings.

17

we're very happy because we have the opportunity to

ask for a principal who we really have a lot of

trust in.

20

stepped down, this is now an opportunity but truly

21

to take the name of Castellanos away.

say I have mixed feelings.

Castellanos for me is a good school, and

But because the principal who was there

that are very positive about the school and the

3

school environment.

4

parents are saying, and I'm very happy when they say

5

such good things about all of the principals and the

6

teachers and the success that the students have had.

7

I've heard many comments

I support 100 percent what the

Listening to the proposal since last

8

year, I think the first meeting was here in

9

December -- I'm sorry, November.

What concerns me

10

is that right now the positions won't be affected

11

for the year 2018-2019 as was highlighted during the

12

presentation and then the counseling and the case

13

managers for students will also not be affected for

14

the year 2018-2019.

15

But my worry is beyond that.

The school

16

should have a certain level of staffing, office

17

workers and counselors.

18

consolidation of these schools?

19

becomes only one principal, so then what happens to

20

the budget for that principal?

21

What will happen after the
That principal then

Also what I'm also worried about is that

22

this consolidation is happening very fast.

23

going to be three meetings in January while

24

consolidations in other parts of the city have taken

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

There's

 January 9, 2018
Page 13
1

place through a process that is much more than a

2

month.

3

It's taken up to two years.
Other worries that I've heard from

4

parents or the other things that concern me, I would

5

like it to be a longer process where there are more

6

people present.

7

That's it.

MS. GONZALEZ:

12

the area of CTU.

13

Right now I

I am also one of the vice presidents of

I do have questions.

My questions are

14

what is going to happen with the LSC and

15

Castellanos?

16

LSC?

So both schools are going to have one

17

Another question is the building, the old

18

building in 24th at Central Park, the annex which is

19

next to Cardenas, this building is not permanent,

20

right?

21

is it going to continue using this building?

22

So what is going to happen to it?

Cardenas,

The other question is are there

23

assurances or is there something in writing that the

24

teachers, all the staff in both schools, they are

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 14
1

not going to be losing their jobs, their positions?

2

Because they're working with your children.

3

know the community.

4

They

My other question is what is going to be

5

happening to the services for community schools that

6

they have at Castellanos and if those programs will

7

continue if these proposals is approved.

Thank you.

I am a

mother of kids in second grade in Cardenas, and I am

17

here because I'm in support of the proposal of the

good idea.

20

kids don't struggle from going from one school to

21

the other.

22

is at Level 2 and Cardenas is at Level 1.

23

think that it would be a great academic change.

24

think it would help a lot.

It's a really great opportunity so that

Not only that, the school, Castellanos,

9

I just want to say that I am here on

10

11

this merger with Castellanos.

12

Cardenas for 17 years.

13

with Dr. Feiwell.

14

taking our school from nearly on probation or almost

15

on probation to a Level 1 plus school.

16

it's part of the hard working teachers we have there

17

too, but he is a phenomenal leader and will give you

18

whatever you need to support you to do your job and

19

to be the best teacher that you could be.

20

I've been working at

I think 12 of them have been

He's an amazing leader.

He's

Of course

As teachers, we're also looking forward

21

to getting to know the staff here at Castellanos and

22

working together.

consolidation of the schools Cardenas and

community, but I am also a representative of the

17

CTU.

18

the parents, the teachers are saying.

19

in favor or against, but I am here to mention

20

certain things.

21

I am a teacher.

I do not live in the

I am very interested in what the community,
I'm not here

I have been working for CPS for 30 years,

22

and in this 30 years I have seen that the resources

23

for schools have lowered.

24

concern is that if the community will be still --

So my question, my

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 17
1

will be able to demand strongly the resources if

2

they don't come down, they are not lowered.

3

I imagine that you do have a secretary at

4

each school that should continue in the next years

5

because when a kid is sick, when a kid falls, when

6

something happens, when mom has to call and ask for

7

something, there should be someone that could talk

8

to her.

9

Also we live in a city with violence.

We

10

need our social workers.

11

We need a PE teacher, music teacher.

12

resources that now I imagine the school has them,

13

but they should continue to have them.

14

have heard is that there won't be a warranty that

15

those things will be in place for next year.

16

believe that CPS, if this is going to go forward,

17

then there should be some warranties for the future

18

indeterminately.

19

We need our counselors.
All of those

And what I

So I

Thank you.

20

MS. CARRETO:

Any speakers 11 through 15?

21

MS. PICURO:

Am I going to reach this mic?

22

Good night to all of you.

23

all here together for our children, our community to

24

support the principal and all the teachers who are

I'm very happy that we're

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 18
1

taking care of us, who are helping a lot of our

2

kids.

3

And I am in favor of the proposal that

4

has been made because if our principal at Cardenas,

5

he is able to help out to be at both schools, then

6

let's support him.

7

Let's support the proposal.

8
9

Let's support the principal.

Because I have three kids.

Three have

been at Cardenas, and they have also been at

10

Castellanos.

11

have the same teachers, if the principal, if we see

12

that he's capable of working on both schools, let's

13

support the proposal.

14

because we have the same number of teachers, of

15

students, and they are being used by our kids.

16

need to have the same funding.

17

I think the proposal is good.

If we

The funds should be the same

We

So we all have to be together as a

18

community so this school goes up academically as

19

Cardenas is.

20

of you.

21
22
23
24

So I am in favor.

Good night to all

11

They came out from Castellanos/Cardenas, and we have

12

had a teacher who have pushed our kids to continue

studying.

14

ago I proposed for the consolidation of the schools.

15

Dr. Feiwell told me what do you think about that?

This is an idea who gave me, one of the principals

that we have from the principals.

When we did this, practically

Our next step was to talk to CPS.

That's why I want to make it clear that

4

maybe for some of you it was very fast this process,

5

but the first thing that has to happen is that we

6

have to unite as schools.

7

parents say, the kids that come from Cardenas, they

8

also come from Castellanos.

9

And as all the other

That's the first thing, as parents, we

10

want the best education for kids.

11

Those of us are here asking for these things.

12

That's a reason why I want to make it clear that the

13

process has been a little bit fast, but I disagree

14

with many parents that the changes could be a little

15

bit shocking for kids, also for parents, but in this

life all of us have changes, evolution.

But I fully support this consolidation

for a couple of reasons.

We have a saying, students

want our students to be successful whether they're

going to high school, college, career readiness,

14

families and our parents and our students to have a

15

strong curriculum from pre-K all the way through 8th

16

grade and to have the same expectations over the

17

course of their entire educational career and most

18

importantly allows our parents to have a peace of

19

mind that their children are going to be well taken

20

care of from the minute they enter school till the

21

minute they leave 8th grade.

22

This allows our

I know there's lots of questions that

23

that all the supports are in place for the students,

whether it's through the special ed services or

I'm still in support of it as long as

UNIDENTIFIED MEMBER:

I don't truly think

3

that -- two minutes is not enough to express

4

everything that you think.

5

hearing somebody say, that they're afraid when our

6

kids come from Castellanos to Cardenas.

7

because we have a lot of fear because people say a

8

lot of things, this or that will happen, there will

9

be crime.

So a little bit I was

We live in Little Village.

Yes,

This is

10

something that we in our community are living

Do we want it to change?

Yes.

13

with this proposal because we know this principal.

I want that teacher to stand up because they are an

19

example for us also, and they work with us.

We love what we have.

MS. CARRETO:

That's why we're here.

I just want to note that I know

21

we say that two minutes is not much time, two

22

minutes is not a lot of time, but it's because in

23

other meetings sometimes we have tons of people that

24

want to make comments, and so that's why we're just

Speaking

And I just want to say I'm in full

Anytime I've had a talk

10

Cardenas, he's always, as he said, put students

11

before the adults, as it should be, because all of

12

us who got into teaching got into teaching because

13

of the students, right, because we wanted to make a

14

difference.

15

And for a long time those of us at

16

Cardenas never really knew what happened to the kids

17

at Castellanos, which was kind of hard, because

18

we've seen them since 3, 4, 5 years old and then we

19

say good-bye to them at 9, and we just don't know

20

because there wasn't a really good bridge between

21

the two schools.

22

And for me it's not about a name change

23

or anything like that.
