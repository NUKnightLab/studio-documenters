3.
While the CHA’s primary obligation is to its legal leaseholders, it affords limited job
and housing opportunities to non-residents.

Joseph Watkins

Metra and construction contractors have made
agreements with CHA to hire Section 3 residents. Does
this mean that life-long residents who are not on the lease
or are not lease compliant and who are born and raised in
CHA will not be able to get jobs in the development?
What is CHA doing to provide adequate housing and jobs
for non-compliant residents?

Jobs
Under the Section 3 Program, non-CHA residents are eligible for jobs with CHA
contractors if they meet low-income standards; however preference is granted to
lease-compliant CHA residents. Section 3 applicants are divided into three priority
groups. First preference is awarded to lease-compliant residents living at locations
where contractors are stationed. Second preference is granted to lease-compliant
residents living at sites neighboring the location where a contractor is stationed. If no
applicant in either of these two groups demonstrates adequate qualifications for a job,
preference is then extended to low-income earners living in the City of Chicago.
Housing
The CHA obtained $2 million in federal subsidies to fund 200 units of transitional
housing available to non-leaseholders living on CHA properties. The first 80 such
units should be ready for occupancy before the end of 2003.
