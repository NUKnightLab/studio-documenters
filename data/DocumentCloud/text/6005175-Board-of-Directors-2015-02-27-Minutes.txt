Director Collens presented the Meeting Minutes and reviewed the metrics with Douglas Elwell, Deputy CEO of
Finance and Strategy. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Wiese requested that the Board receive a report on the number and type of positions that are contractually
provided to CCHHS1. Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, responded that those services are provided
on an “as needed” basis; he stated that the administration would be happy to take a look to see the amount of effort
being done, but it would be nearly impossible to do a report on the number of individuals who come in on any given
day. Mr. Elwell added that some of the contracts are paid based on the vendor accomplishing a task, and do not
specify the number of people involved. Director Wiese stated that perhaps Mr. Elwell’s example can be the
exception; she noted that this subject really does impact on the Human Resources Committee and its goals;
receiving this information also helps paint the picture about how CCHHS is getting things done if it is missing
1,000 people (based on the number of vacancies).

JOHN .IAY SHANNON, MD

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

COOK COUNTY HEALTH HOSPITALS SYSTEM
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
February 27, 2015

 

Recognition

- Thank you to dozens of staff who went above and beyond during the Super Bowl Blizzard to ensure that
services to our patients were uninterrupted. From buildings and grounds to laboratory employees, from nurses
to dietary, the extraordinary commitment that was demonstrated is greatly appreciated. Many staff slept on site
to ensure appropriate coverage and others braved the roads to work their shifts.

- Ann Sikora-Jackson is a Stroger Hospital emergency room physician assistant who has volunteered as a clinical
preceptor for the Rush University PA Program. She has been honored by the Rush University PA Program as
Preceptor of the Year. Always seeking ways to improve the care we deliver, Ann has created a curriculum and
developed a lecture series which includes a SIM Lab to help develop future physician assistants in Emergency
Medicine. Simulation can facilitate students to become more active participants in their own learning -
connecting theory and the practice environment.

The Health Information Management Systems Society (HIMSS) created the Electronic Medical Record (EM R)
Adoption Model to advance the delivery of patient care via information technology. The criteria is based on an 8
step scale (Level 0 to7). Each step has a clinical measurement which must be met by implementing a technology
solution within the EMR. But importantly the clinical staff must demonstrate they are utilizing these solutions
within the EMR. Just yesterday (2/26/15), the leadership and clinical staff in collaboration with IT was
interviewed by HIMSS and based on the electronic physician/nursing documentation, clinical decision support
rules, computerized physician order entry (CPOE), Closed Loop Medication Administration and Radiology
Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS), Stroger Hospital achieved Stage 6. At this time, just 46
hospitals in Illinois have achieved Stage 6.

In HIMSS words, ?reaching Stage 6 is a result of focus, good direction and a steadfast commitment from
leadership. Stage 6 institutions have established clear goals for improving safety, minimizing errors, and
prioritizing IT implementations.?

The achievement of HIMSS Level 6 and successfully attesting for Meaningful Use Stage 2 demonstrates the
overwhelming success of as a national leader in transforming health care delivery by adopting health
information technology to improve patient safety, patient quality and clinical outcomes.

The team has been led by Dr. Tom Mason, Katina Daher, Marty Grant and Donna Hart.

On Saturday, February during a friendly indoor soccer game, one of our residents, Dr. Harry Fuentes, went
into sudden cardiac arrest. His life was saved by two of our chief residents, Drs. Juan Munoz Pena and Richard
Nunez Lopez. Trained in advanced cardiac life support, they remained calm and ultimately shocked Dr. Fuentes
with an available Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) to return him to a healthy heart allowing for
transport to Rush. Dr. Fuentes continues to recover and looks forward to returning to work.

Recognition continued

- A family that has been part of the Stroger Level NICU family since February of 2014 sent a recent note that
stated: ?We're so happy to be celebrating his first birthday and we wanted to share with you. We don ?t have (our
nurse) Paweena here to take his pics, but there are still some good ones to show his joyful growth while at NIC 
and well beyond those early remain grateful that you were there for us and for all the families whose
babies are in your care.?

Representing the baby?s care team today are:

Patricia Kling, APN Dr. Prashant Malviya, NICU Fellow

Dr. Alok Rastogi, Attending Physician Dr. Janardhan Mydam, NICU Fellow

Dr. Tessy Joseph, Attending Physician Eulalee Walters, RN, Discharge Planner
Paweena Glapajone, RN Maria Digiacomo, RN, PEDS Surgical Nurse
Dr. Philip Dray, Ophthalmologist Virigina Perez, Physical Therapist

Omar LaBlanc, Developmental Specialist

Activities and Announcements

Five responses to the Phase 1 RFP for the Central Campus Redevelopment project are being evaluated by
leadership. Peter Daniels, Debra Carey and Dr. Claudia Fegan are part of the evaluation team that will
select a development team to design, develop and manage new outpatient clinical and administrative space.

- One additional case of measles has been confirmed in suburban Cook County bringing the total to 14. These
cases include three adults and 11 infants. Of these cases, 12 are associated with a child care center in Palatine.
continues to investigate the cases and conduct contact tracing.

 

The Justice Health Initiative has been recognized by the Hospital Charitable Services Awards, a national program
sponsored by Jackson Healthcare recognizing hospitals whose commitment to their community goes beyond
"community benefit" and "free care'' and has led to innovative efforts to improve community health and
increase access to healthcare education and services. The Justice Health Initiative enrolls detainees at Cook
County Jail in Medicaid. Just this week, we surpassed 10,000 approvals for Medicaid enrollments initiated at
intake to the Cook County Jail.

As part of CountyCare?s Managed Care Community Network requirements, there will be a CountyCare Enrollee
Advisory Committee (EAC) meeting on March 23rd at Provident Hospital located at 500 E. 51St Street in Chicago.
The EAC meeting allows CountyCare Health Plan members a forum to speak and provides our members with an
opportunity to have an open dialogue with us on what works/what we?re doing well, what doesn?t work, and
how we can improve our services. Additionally, CountyCare Provider Town Hall Meetings are scheduled for
March 20, June 26, November 13, 2015. These meetings provide an open forum for CountyCare providers to
interact with the CountyCare team and address high level issues and strategies.

Legislative Update
Local

On February 11, 2015 the Cook County Board approved an amendment to the Performance Based Management and
Budgeting Ordinance. The amendment incorporates zero-based budgeting principals into the County?s budgeting
process. Quarterly Reports will require year to date budget information on expenses and revenues and analysis of any
significant variances and impact on performance goals, as well as corrective measures to eliminate any budgetary
shortfall by year end, if applicable. The ordinance, as amended, is effective March 2015.

State

On Wednesday, February 18, 2015, Governor Bruce Rauner made his FY2016 Budget Address to the Illinois General
Assembly. Contained in his proposal are approximately $1.43 in cuts impacting the state?s Department of Health and
Family Services (HFS) including cuts in Medicaid rates and services as well as eligibility reductions and savings assumed
as a result of enhanced program integrity around redetermination. The proposal contains an increase in resources for
the Inspector General to combat fraud as well as operational savings to HFS. The proposed budget contains cuts to the
Illinois Department of Public Health, including the AIDS Drug Assistance Program and the Illinois Breast and Cervical
Cancer Program. participates in both programs. Additional proposed reductions impact the Department of
Children and Family Services, alcohol and substance abuse programs, disability programs, and family and community
service programs. The budget proposal will now be considered in the General Assembly, with the expectation of a final
approved budget before the end of the current state fiscal year, June 30.

Federal

On Wednesday, February 24, 2015, Dr. Shannon was part of a National Association of Counties delegation that
met with Senator Durbin to discuss issues of concern to Illinois counties including the preservation of Medicaid funding.
Later in the day, Dr. Shannon presented at a Capitol Hill Briefing on Medicaid and the County Role in Local Health
Systems. Discussion focused on the various healthcare services counties provide and the importance of Medicaid
funding to those respective systems.

is closely monitoring discussions in Springfield and Washington, DC. around key revenue sources such as
Medicaid, Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH), and the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) payments.
Any reductions to these reimbursement mechanisms would negatively impact moving forward; significant
reductions in these revenue sources would require alternative funding sources to sustain current levels of healthcare
services provided by
