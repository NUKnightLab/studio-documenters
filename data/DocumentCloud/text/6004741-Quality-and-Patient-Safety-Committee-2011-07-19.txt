Report from System Chief Clinical Officer
A. Report on Medical-Surgical Nurse Staffing and Patient Satisfaction in Hospitals within Cook County
(Attachment #1)
Roz Lennon, System Chief Clinical Officer, provided an update regarding the following subjects.
Ms. Lennon informed the Committee that staff is in the process of drafting and reviewing a Request for
Proposals (RFP) for service excellence support, for a three-year period of time.
With regard to staffing issues, Ms. Lennon informed the Committee that there are fifty nurses from Oak Forest
Hospital that have now moved or are in the process of moving, mainly to Stroger Hospital; she stated that
fifteen of those fifty nurses are going to be located in the Emergency Department at Stroger Hospital. She
provided examples of issues that have affected nurse staffing. She stated that Oak Forest Hospital was proposed
to be a limited- hour urgent care facility; it is now proposed to be a twenty-four hour urgent care facility, so
staffing needs will need to be adjusted for this change. She provided additional information regarding the
review of current and future staffing needs throughout the System; she added that discussions on this subject as
it relates to the 2012 Budget are currently ongoing. She stated that a number of new positions are planned to be
requested, with a focus on the medical-surgical areas.
Chairman Ansell noted that three issues regarding nurse staffing were raised during public testimony. The first
issue was relating to the PPC Committee; there seems to be some disagreement over whether or not tasks have
been accomplished. The second issue was relating to hand-offs; these hand-offs appeared to be driven
somehow by a staffing issue. The third issue was relating to Emergency Department staffing at Stroger
Hospital.
Antoinette Williams, Chief Nursing Officer of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, provided
information on the PPC Committee and hand-off issues. She stated that monthly meetings are held with
management and the National Nurses Organizing Committee (NNOC). She stated that one of the concerns
expressed by the PPC Committee relates to hand-offs within the organization. She has requested that all of her
divisions provide to her their process for hand-offs; Cerner is building a page so that the nursing staff will be
able to electronically access and share this information.
Chairman Ansell requested that the Committee receive a progress report on these issues at the next Committee
meeting.
Dr. David Goldberg, President of the Executive Medical Staff of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County,
presented the Report on Medical-Surgical Nurse Staffing and Patient Satisfaction in Hospitals within Cook County.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.

Report from System Director of Quality and Patient Safety (continued)
Ms. Farrell presented the Report on Value-Based Purchasing. During the Committee’s review of the
information, Ms. Merryweather noted that some of the measurements are based upon all payors; however, the
penalties relate to Medicare dollars. Ms. Driscoll noted that currently, value-based purchasing relates to
Medicare, but this will soon extend to Medicaid.

presented his report for Oak Forest Hospital. He noted physician and nurse staffing challenges experienced
during the transition period. He provided an update on transfers, inpatient services, employee health
services and the Against Medical Advice (AMA) Report. Dr. Hussain noted that the response from the
ambulance transport service company, ATI, has been outstanding; it was decided that ATI would no longer
need to be on stand-by physically on the premises, because their response time is so rapid.
Dr. Pierre Wakim, President of the Executive Medical Staff of Provident Hospital of Cook County,
presented his report for Provident Hospital. He stated that the Executive Medical Staff and Organized
Medical Staff held their meetings on July 12th; he added that a Joint Conference Committee Meeting was

provided on the Obstetrics/Family Medicine transfers to Stroger Hospital; he noted that there is a committee
at Stroger Hospital that is working on through-put and on the subject of opening up more beds. An update
was provided on the Centers of Excellence for chronic illnesses and childhood obesity.
Dr. Goldberg presented his report for Stroger Hospital. He referenced a presentation made to the Committee
within the last few months, regarding the Trauma Unit; he stated that this presentation provided a good
example in which doctors and nurses are working very well together. He stated that a plan was recently
presented to move back towards a unit-based model within Stroger Hospital, so that patients would be
housed in more geographically-defined regions; he noted that this will help increase the possibility of people
working more collaboratively with each other across the disciplines.

Comments
• Key findings – patient satisfaction correlates with
nurse staffing in Cook County hospitals
– JSH performing above the regression line

• Limitations:
– Satisfaction a global hospital measure, nurse staffing
specific to med-surg units
– Nursing staffing may be a marker of other health
system issues that impact satisfaction
– Other possible unmeasured variables:
• Patient (ethnicity, poverty)
• Hospital (image, training, organizational culture)

Comments
• Appropriate staffing of JSH may improve
patient
ti t satisfaction
ti f ti and
d quality
lit
– To move to excellence, we need to manage
staff increases, aiming for high standards

• Thanks to our nurses for their hard work
under difficult circumstances!
• I hope we can share these observations
with our nursing colleagues

Other Observations Using Public
Data Sources
• Productive:
– CCHHS “market share” of keyy clinical diagnoses
g
– Source IDPH Hospital Report Card

• Small, mission focused, modest local subsidy:
– CCHHS compared to other public hospitals
– Source NAPH Annual Report

• Good steward of resources:
– Less Medicare spending in the last 6 months of life, more time in
hospice and less in ICU
– Source Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care

• Financially constrained:
– Relatively flat spending over time with lags behind inflation
– Source Cook County budgets

2010, A Look Back...

Page 2

Every year, the Cook County Department of Public Health
(CCDPH) sets out to report on significant activities and accomplishments from the year before. The
purpose of the annual report is to
summarize our work for the residents of suburban Cook County, our
partnering agencies, elected officials
and funding agents.

ways for people outside of public health to
understand and relate when we tell our public
health story. At its core, the business of public
health is about prevention. It is the age old
dilemma of public health: how do you visualize or explain something that you prevented
from occurring? Our communicable disease
programs prevent outbreaks of serious illness
every year and yet most of our residents are
unaware of these accomplishments.

Throughout 2010, CCDPH
staff worked through a strategic
planning process that will be unveiled in 2011. During this process,
one of the many areas highlighted
included the need to do a better job
engaging our residents by defining
the important role public health
plays in their day to day lives. It
can be challenging to find different

Sometimes, you can hold the work we
do in your hand which makes it a little easier.
School nurses can hold on to Healthwise, a
communicable disease and health information toolkit we created to assist them during
the school year. Or, you can see and touch the
mosquito traps we set throughout suburban
Cook County to track and prevent West Nile
Virus in our communities.

Yet, our work does not always result
in something physically tangible. For example, we work to support policy changes
that promote strong public health such as the
Smoke Free Illinois Act. Many public health
departments and other organizations worked
together to pass the legislation that eliminated smoking indoors in public places. All
the work that went into that does not necessarily add up to something you can hold
in your hand – it’s not a shovel we used to
dig a trench or a crane we used to install a
street light. What it does add up to are proven public health benefits for our residents.
Non-smokers aren’t exposed to unhealthy
second-hand smoke in public and smokers
are encouraged to smoke less. There is so
much work we do to protect and promote the
health of suburban Cook County; it can be
challenging to put it into words.

The 2010 annual report is another step
in helping our community members have a
better understanding of the important work
being done in our agency and of what public
health looks like in their communities.
 
 
Take a look around your place of business or your community. Where do you see
public health? What is public health to you?
We are going to continue to ask these questions throughout 2011. Watch for it and help
us tell the story of public health.

Public Health Student Nurse Rotation
 
2010 was the first year for the
Cook County Department of Public
Health (CCDPH) to become a clinical training site for nursing students.
This effort is part of a strategic commitment to help develop a competent
public health workforce.
 
To begin, a team of 10 CCDPH
public health nurses developed a
community health curriculum and
corresponding training materials to
provide nursing students with their
public health field experience. Saint
Xavier University was the first institution of higher learning to partner
with CCDPH for this program.
 
Page 4

 

Throughout the 2010-2011 academic year,
CCDPH public health nurses mentored the
12 students during their clinical rotation
through the CCDPH Southwest and West District
Offices.
 
Formal
evaluations were
conducted and
students reported
that the public
health nurses
challenged them
to increase their
knowledge and provided them with diverse
experiences in the community setting. Pub-

lic health nurses reported an increased sense
of professional satisfaction in being able to
develop the next generation of public health
practitioners. With this feedback, CCDPH
plans to expand the student experience to
include the CCDPH North and South District
Offices and include other academic partners.

Public Health Policy Development
The Cook County Department
of Public Health (CCDPH) has staff
who work to advocate for or against
laws, rules and regulations that impact public health.
The public health work being
done each day is many times what
drives the public health policy development efforts. This could mean one
of two things. We either identify a
problem in public health that could
be prevented if we enact a new public health policy or strengthen an
existing one. Or, we see a piece of
proposed legislation that, if enacted,
would have a negative impact on the
health and safety of suburban Cook
County residents.
Two good examples of this
occurred in 2010. Early in the year,
CCDPH communicable disease conPage 6

or not something will impact public health.
Sometimes legislation is proposed that seeks
to weaken a public health regulation. As the
2010 spring legislative session commenced, a
piece of legislation (HB5917- SB3377) was introduced that would have provided reciprocity for individuals who have a food service
manager certification from another state. For
many years, Illinois has been recognized by
public health professionals as a leader in food
safety because of the rigorous training requirements in our state food code. If this bill
became law, it would have have dramatically
reduced the hours of required training for
individuals seeking this credential in Illinois
from fifteen to seven.
As a state certified local public health
department, we investigate approximately
300 foodborne illness complaints and at least
25 serious outbreaks of foodborne disease in
suburban Cook County each year. Nationally,

trol staff investigated an outbreak of Hepatitis
B and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
at a long term care facility in suburban Cook
County. Throughout the investigation it became clear that the outbreak could have been
prevented, or the spread could have been limited, if better communicable disease screening
requirements were in place for patients being
processed into long term care facilities.
CCDPH policy and communicable disease staff drafted legislation (SB2601)requiring
long term care facilities to verbally screen
patients upon admission to determine if a
patient is high risk for certain blood-borne
diseases. Anyone identified to be at higher
risk was to be offered Hepatitis B immunization and laboratory testing for Hepatitis C
and HIV. The legislation was adopted, signed
into law and became effective in 2011.
Policy development staff carefully monitor proposed legislation to assess whether

www.cookcounypublichealth.org

www.cookcounypublichealth.org
Page 31 of 79

it is estimated that 350,000 hospitalization
and approximately 5000 deaths are attributed
to foodborne disease outbreaks. In many
cases, the primary cause of the outbreak was
related to unsafe food handling practices, including: inadequate hand washing, improper
heating or cooling of hazardous foods, and
bacterial cross contamination of food products.
Reducing the number of hours food
handlers would receive in food safety education would only add to the potential for
foodborne disease outbreaks. CCDPH policy
development staff worked closely with other
regional and statewide public health associations to defeat this legislation.
Through active participation in the
legislative process, CCDPH is able to play an
important leadership role in ensuring that
laws are enacted and maintained to protect
public health.

Alliance for Healthy & Active Communities
 
CCDPH convened a group
of partners who are community
health advocates throughout suburban Cook County to form
the Alliance for Healthy
& Active Communities
(AHAC), or the Alliance, to
focus on chronic disease
prevention efforts. AHAC
works to change policies and environments to
support healthy living in
suburban Cook County.
The Alliance envisions a

During this session
CCDPH representatives provided an overview of the Suburban Cook County jurisdiction, its unique challenges and
CCDPH’s vision of community
engagement and collaboration.

 
CCDPH began utilizing and developing
a web-based Comprehensive Emergency Management Program tool to increase coordination of planning and response efforts within
CCDPH and in suburban Cook County communities. The goal is to have local planning
teams integrate this tool into their municipalities’ public health planning efforts as a way to
share information, keep plans up to date and
build overall local and regional capacity to
respond to a public health emergency.

Staff went to 10 schools, specifically in areas of economic need
as identified by the ratio of students
who receive free or reduced lunch.
The program educated approximately
550 4th and 5th grade students on
tobacco advertising, addiction and
consequences.

ACRONYMS, ABBREVIATIONS & DEFINITIONS
Active TB: (see TB Disease)
BCG: Bacille Calmette Guérin, a vaccination given to persons, usually infants, in countries where TB is common. BCG is NOT used in the United States.
Extrapulmonary TB: A person with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection outside of the lungs, the pleural
space, and the larynx (voice box). A person with extrapulmonary disease can also have pulmonary TB (see
below).
LTBI: Latent Tuberculosis Infection; a person with TB infection who is not contagious.
MDR-TB: Multi-drug resistant TB. MDR-TB is defined as TB resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, the two most
important first line anti-tuberculosis medications.
Pulmonary TB: A person with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of the lungs, pleural space or the larynx
(voice box). A person with pulmonary TB can also have extrapulmonary TB.
QFT-G: QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test, a blood test used to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This test cannot distinguish persons with LTBI from persons with TB disease. In contrast to the TST (see below), QFT-G
can distinguish persons with either LTBI or TB disease from persons who may have received BCG vaccination.
QFT-G has greater specificity than TST.
TB: Tuberculosis
TB Disease: A person with TB infection who is contagious to others; a person with TB disease can have pulmonary TB, extrapulmonary TB, or both.
TST: Tuberculin Skin Test, a test whereby purified protein derivative (PPD) is injected under the skin in the
forearm. Persons with TB infection react to the PPD which results in a bump (induration) where the PPD was
injected. Qualified healthcare personnel can measure the size of the bump and determine whether the test is
positive or negative. The TST cannot distinguish persons with LTBI from persons with TB disease. The TST
cannot distinguish persons with TB infection (LTBI or TB disease) from persons who may have received BCG
vaccination (such as persons born overseas).
XDR-TB: Extensively drug resistant TB. XDR-TB is defined as MDR-TB plus TB that is resistant to any fluoroquinoline plus resistance to one of the three injectable drugs (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).

OVERVIEW
Epidemiologic Summary
•

Ninety three (93) new cases of TB were reported in suburban Cook County in 2010. This represents a
rate of 3.7 cases per 100,000 population, and a 7% decrease in the number of cases reported in 2009
(Table 1).

•

Nine of eleven (82%) municipalities with three or more cases were located in the North District (Tables
8 and 9).

•

Municipalities with the highest TB case counts included Des Plaines (n=8), Niles (n=6) and Skokie
(n=6) (Table 8).

•

Asians/Pacific Islanders and hispanics/latinos accounted for 73% of all new TB cases in 2010 (Table 2).

•

The top three countries of birth for foreign-born cases were Mexico (32%), India (31%) and the Philippines (12%) (Table 3.)

TB Burden in Foreign-born Persons
•

The proportion of TB cases in foreign-born persons increased from 60% in 2001 to 70% in 2010 (Figure 2).

•

In 2010, 65 foreign-born persons with active TB immigrated from 17 different countries (Table 3).

•

Three countries accounted for 73% of all foreign-born cases: Mexico (n=21; 32%), India (n=20; 31%)
and the Philippines (n=8; 12%) (Table 3).

•

Among foreign-born persons diagnosed with TB in 2010, 80% arrived in the U.S. 5 or more years prior
to receiving a diagnosis of TB disease (Figure 4).

Drug Resistance
•

No cases of MDR-TB were identied in 2010 (Table 5).

Coinfection with HIV
•

All TB cases tested for HIV in 2010 (n=72) were negative (Table 6).

Directly Observed Therapy
•

In 2010, 94% of patients with pulmonary TB received DOT (Figure 5).

Completion of Therapy
•

For TB cases diagnosed in 2008, the most recent year for which data on completion of tuberculosis
therapy are available, 94% of persons with TB disease who were eligible* completed treatment (Figure
6).

•

Among persons diagnosed in 2008 who were eligible* to complete TB treatment within 12 months,
88% of cases did so. This is slightly below the Healthy People 2010 goal of 90% (Figure 6).

* Eligible cases are persons who were alive at the time of TB diagnosis and did not die during therapy, and excludes persons with TB resistant to rifampin and pediatric
cases (<15 years) with a diagnosis of meningeal, bone/joint, or miliary TB.

* Persons with HIV who receive a TB diagnosis are defined as having AIDS.
† Cells with small counts (1Ͳ4) have been suppressed. 

Table 6. Testing for HIV among reported cases of TB increased from 23% in 2001 to 77% in 2010. Among TB
cases with HIV testing results in 2010, none was coinfected (i.e., had HIV infection and TB infection). Persons
with TB and HIV coinfection are classified, by AIDS surveillance case definition, as having AIDS.

 Annual Tuberculosis Surveillance Report, 2010

Cook County Department of Public Health

TECHNICAL NOTES
Surveillance Methodology
Healthcare providers and laboratories in suburban Cook County are required to report the following results
within 24 hours: (1) sputum or tissue smears positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFBs); (2) cultures positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis; (3) mycobacterial drug susceptibility results; (4) any other tests positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition, confirmed TB cases must be reported to CCDPH within 7 days.
TB case reports are entered into I-NEDSS and provide the basis for the information presented in this report.
This report includes all cases of tuberculosis reported during the year in which the case was confirmed. Confirmed TB cases who may have moved into suburban Cook County from another jurisdiction are not reflected in
the data presented herein; such cases are counted in the jurisdiction that reported the case. Likewise, confirmed
TB cases reported in suburban Cook County who may have moved out of suburban Cook County are included
in the data presented herein.
Reported TB Case Rates
Suburban Cook County, Chicago and Illinois TB rates between 1993-1999 were calculated using 1990 census
data. Suburban Cook County, Chicago and Illinois TB rates between 2000-2010 were calculated using 2000
census data. National TB rates were calculated using national intercensal estimates.
