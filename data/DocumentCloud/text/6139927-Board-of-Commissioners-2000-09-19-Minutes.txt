PROPOSED RESOLUTION

Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
WILLIAM R. MORAN, County Commissioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the current procedure for taxation of mobile homes as compared to framed homes creates an
unfair burden upon framed homeowners; and
WHEREAS, those in mobile homes benefit by paying less for government services, most importantly
education in the local schools; and
WHEREAS, School District 172 contains approximately 1,200 mobile homes and only 260 homeowners
in framed homes; and
WHEREAS, this concentration of mobile homes within School District 172 has left the District with less
money per pupil; and
WHEREAS, counties within Illinois collect revenue from residents of mobile homes under the Mobile
Home Local Services Tax Act (3 5 ILCS 515/1 et seq.); and
WHEREAS, the Mobile Home Local Services Tax Act does not apply to counties with a population over
2,000,000 (35 ILCS 515/9.1); and
WHEREAS, areas with a high concentration of mobile homes will benefit from an increase in local taxes
provided for mobile homes in Cook County.

2870

NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, AS FOLLOWS:
I.

From the date of adoption of this Resolution and until a review of taxation of mobile homes, there
shall be a moratorium on creating a new mobile home park or expansion of an existing mobile

Commissioner Hansen asked ifthe County had determined a use for the old Cermak Building?
Michael LaMont asked for leave to have Bill Huffman answer the Commissioner's question.
Bill Huffman stated that the old Cermak building is inside the secured parameters of the Department of
Corrections and it is currently being used by the Department of Corrections to house women. Women
leave the facility during the day and return overnight. He said the women are out in the community
during the day, which opens up more beds in the secure facilities of Division IV.
Mr. Huffman further stated that Facilities Management did some minor painting and decorating in the
facility, and floors two and three are being used for sleeping quarters.
Commissioner Hansen asked how many beds have been installed in the old Cermak Building?
Bill Huffman responded that he would have to request the information from the Department of
Corrections.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the County Board approved the change?
Bill Huffman stated that there was an evaluation done of the facility for long-term use, which came to the
Construction Committee and is still being evaluated. In the meantime, no money has been put into the
old Cermak Building except about ten thousand dollars that was used for painting the facility. He further
stated that the recommendation that came from the Department of Corrections was to use the building for
administrative purposes, but because of the overcrowding and the need for more female beds, only the
areas already defined for overnight occupancy are being used until a recommendation is made to the
County Board regarding the use of the facility.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the Commissioners should receive a memorandum when the County
changes occupancy in terms of activity in any building where the County holds title to the real state.
Bill Huffman stated that the committee would receive a memorandum from Director Velasco of the
Department of Corrections.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if the use of the old Cermak Building is part of the court consent decree to
free up space in the current jails?

2974

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 19, 2000
Michael LaMont stated that by using the old Cermak Building allows inmates who were sleeping on the
floor to sleep in beds.
Commissioner Silvestri asked how many beds were at Cermak when it was a medical facility, and are
there individual rooms or wards?
Bill Huffman stated that they are open wards and there are some isolation rooms. In response to the
number of beds, he stated that if he were to guess, he would say about fifty beds.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if there has been discussion regarding a permanent use of the old Cermak
Building?
Michael LaMont stated that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy has not had discussions with the
Department of Corrections as to whether the facility will be used permanently. The discussions have
centered around the temporary use of the old Cermak Building.
Commissioner Silvestri asked how many divisions are housing women?
Bill Huffman stated that Division IV houses women along with some sections in the South Campus.
Commissioner Silvestri asked how many women are being housed in Division IV?
Bill Huffman stated that the Commissioner's questions should be answered by the Department of
Corrections. Mr. Huffman stated that he would get the infonnation from the Department of Corrections
to respond to the Commissioners.

WHEREAS, for 60 years Social Security has provided a strong, simple, and efficient form of basic
insurance against the adversities of old age, dependency, and disability; and

WHEREAS, Social Security protects more than fifty-four percent of the population aged 65 and over
from living in poverty, ninety-eight percent of children under age 18 if a working parent dies, and seven
and a half million Americans with disabilities; and

WHEREAS, Congress currently has proposals to shift a portion of Social Security contributions from
insurance to personal investment accounts for each wage earner; and

WHEREAS, Social Security cannot fulfill its protective function if it must also create and manage
millions of small risk-bearing investments. For these protections to be strong, they must be insulated
from economic uncertainty and be backed by the entity best capable of spreading risk-the American
government; and

WHEREAS, the costs to administer Social Security are less than one percent of the benefits in contrast to
higher costs of administering private accounts. The resulting expense and the cost of converting each
account to an annuity upon retirement would consume much of the profit, or exacerbate the Joss, realized
by each participant; and

WHEREAS, Social Security, our largest and most fundamental insurance system, should not be
splintered into individualized stock accounts, thereby creating an array of winners and losers and
conve1iing part of our retirement system into a national lottery.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Members of the Cook County Board
of Commissioners, do hereby respectfully urge Congress not to privatize Social Security and threaten the
vital protections that Social Security provides; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of the Resolution be spread upon the official
proceedings of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, and that a copy thereof be transmitted to the
President and Vice President of the United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the
Minority Leader of the House, the Senate Majority Leader and the Senate Minority Leader, and to the
Illinois delegation to the Congress of the United States.
