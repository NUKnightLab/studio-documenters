 The Investigation Path: Intake
Each investigation begins with intake. Intake involves the notification and
collection of enough data to begin the investigatory process. CountyCare’s
modes of intake of allegations of a potential case that is identified as fraud,
waste, and/or abuse are as follows:
•
•
•
•
•

Hotline call
Customer Service call
Algorithms identifying aberrant trends in billing
Data mining
Report via email or direct call from staff, provider, or
subcontractor
• In-person meeting or reporting

Intake

Audit & Compliance Committee of the Board I September 20, 2018

 The Investigation Path: Planning
Our PIUs plan after a report or hotline call is received. It’s determining who
needs to be contacted, what data range must be researched, what reports need
to be obtained or run, and what facts need to be developed.
At the core of an investigation are facts. In analyzing the relevant facts, our
Program Integrity Units address the following:
• The starting point/root cause of the issue
• Applicable rules and regulations that govern this area
• Conduct telephone interviews, an on-site visit, or a desk audit

 The Investigation Path: Root Cause Analysis

Then, CountyCare’s PIUs conduct a Root Cause Analysis to determine the origin
of the reported issue.
A benefit of a Root Cause Analysis being performed is to ensure that issues
arising from hotline calls or reports are not only investigated to their full
potential, but that the source of the suspected fraud, waste, and/or abuse is
identified, corrected, and prevented from occurring in the future.

Audit & Compliance Committee of the Board I September 20, 2018

 The Investigation Path: Corrective Action
Once an investigation is complete and a root cause analysis has been
conducted, corrective action helps to ensure mitigation of future occurrences
of suspected fraud, waste, and/or abuse by a practitioner, provider, or member.
This can involve:
• Collection of overpayments from provider or held from future
payments
• Provider education and remediation
• Payment Suspension/Withhold or termination from CountyCare’s
network
If it’s determined that an investigation warrants referral to Illinois HFS-OIG,
CountyCare Compliance works with its PIUs to gather all facts, data, and
summaries to submit a referral to HFS-OIG via secure online portal.
