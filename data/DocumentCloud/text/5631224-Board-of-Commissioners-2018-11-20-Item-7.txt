Background
CHA has administered the FamilyWorks program since 2009, to ensure that residents have access
to comprehensive social service support not otherwise available through the City of Chicago.
Resident Services oversees performance-based contracts with FamilyWorks providers; each
contract includes key metrics established based on the demographics of families within their
assigned service areas. Contract oversight includes regular performance reporting, performance
reviews with agency leadership, quality assurance reviews of participant files and an annual
participant satisfaction survey of more than 3,000 CHA residents. The seven (7) contractors were
procured through a competitive procurement in December 2014; each are assigned to a regional
service area or specific housing development.
Historically, Resident Services, through its FamilyWorks program has provided case management,
workforce development, housing support, health and wellness, education and other supportive
services to CHA residents. FamilyWorks is the cornerstone program by which all CHA sponsored
events and programs run through. During the next contract term, the FamilyWorks service
providers will continue providing targeted services to address individual resident needs, however
a family-centered coaching model will be more strongly incorporated. Family-centered coaching
focuses on the whole family. A key aspect of the family-centered coaching model empowers the
participant to take the lead to accomplish goals, while staff provide the necessary support.
Family-centered coaching recognizes that methods, such as case management or motivational
interviewing are needed for coaching to be effective for a family, however the goal is to allow
the participant to drive the work, while receiving coaching and support.
FamilyWorks utilizes a targeted services model focused on outreach to families who have the
greatest need for services. Utilizing data-driven metrics and analysis, CHA continues to refine the
service model for FamilyWorks. Accordingly, during the next contract term FamilyWorks will have
a tiered model for outreach and services, including outreach to families living in scattered site
housing and those who await their Right of Return as part of the Relocation Rights Contract. In
2019, CHA plans to continue to enforce the approved MTW activity requiring all residents who
are in Safe Harbor or not compliant with the work requirement to participate in FamilyWorks
services.

In addition, five (5) of the seven (7) FamilyWorks agencies will oversee and operate CHA’s Digital
Resource Centers. FamilyWorks providers will also implement CHA’s Summer Youth Employment
2

 Program for more than 1,500 CHA youth, which is part of the Mayor’s One Summer Chicago
Initiative. Overall more than 9,000 households will have access to services through FamilyWorks.
With this intention and targeted focus of meeting individual needs, while using a family-centered
approach, FamilyWorks services focus on addressing Resident Services’ four primary goals: (1)
Foster Economic Independence; (2) Increase Earning Power, (3) Support Academic Achievement,
(4) Enhance Stability and Quality of Life, and (4) Foster Economic Independence.
