COMMISSION ACTION

the Professional Services contracts to the Commission should be reviewed. The scope
of work should have the exact verbiage that was in the original Request for Bid.

overlaps the Executive Director’s responsibilities.

COMMISSION ACTION CONT’D
The motion passed unanimously.

Approval for the Removal and Installation of Condenser Pumps at the Main
Library
The Facilities Department contacted the Heating and Cooling Maintenance and Repair
Contractor, Johnson Controls, to provide a quote for replacing the condenser pumps at
Main Branch. The pumps are a component of the cooling system and are no longer
functioning. Additionally, the repair of these pumps are outside of the scope for regular
maintenance and repair of the system. The quote submitted by Johnson Controls on
June 11, 2019 estimated the cost of the repairs at $81,994.00. Given the cost, the
Procurement Department completed a quick bid for Labor, Materials and Equipment for
the Removal and Installation of the Condenser Pumps. The emergency repair cost
requires an amendment to the FY2019/2020 Capital Outlay budget.
An Invitation for Bid (IFB), IFB-CL-1927, was posted on DPL’s website and sent to the
MITN (Michigan Inter-Governmental Trade Network) on June 13, 2019. The solicitation
period was from June 13, 2019 until bid closing at 2:00 p.m. on June 25, 2019, at which
time the bid documents were no longer available for download. The bid was
downloaded from the MITN website by fifteen (15) contractors. Seven (7) companies
attended the mandatory walk-thru and two companies submitted a bid on the project, as
follows:

In addition, the Finance department is requesting approval to increase the FY2019/2020
Capital Outlay budget by $77,000 to cover the emergency repair. If approved, the fund
balance would decrease to $25,010,008.
NOTED

Main Branch. The coils of the AHU Units, E-1A and E-3 in the basement and Print
Shop of the building. The coils are a component of the cooling system and are no
longer functioning. Additionally, the replacement of these coils are outside of the scope
for regular maintenance and repair of the system. The quote submitted by Johnson
Controls on June 11, 2019 estimated the cost at $198,850.00. Given the cost, the
Procurement Department completed a quick bid to provide labor, materials and
equipment for the replacement of AHU chiller coils at Main Library. The emergency
repair cost requires an amendment to the FY2019/2020 Capital Outlay budget.

Approval of the Roof Repair at Main Library –New Edition
The roof on the new edition of Main Library is the original roof installed in 1963. Due to the age
of the roof, additional repairs to the numerous leaks and holes would be a futile effort. The
Facilities Department is seeking approval of a contract to provide Labor, Materials and
Equipment for the replacement of the roof. The Procurement Department identified the
cooperative agreement under OMNIA Contract #14-5903 (formerly US Communities) by which
DPL would partner with Garland Roofing Company to complete the project. Under the
agreement, Garland Roofing Company would provide an initial assessment, materials,
engineering services and oversee the construction management to ensure proper installation of
the Garland Roof Replacement system. Because of the state of the roof, DPL desired that bids
include a completion date prior to November 15, 2019. The cost of replacing the roof would
require an amendment to the FY 2019/2020 Capital Outlay Budget, as it was not a part of the
original budget.

the removal and installation of condenser pumps at Main Library. The Invitation for Bid (IFB),
IFB-CL-1930, was posted on DPL’s website and sent to the MITN (Michigan Inter-Governmental
Trade Network) on June July 1, 2019. The solicitation period was from July 1, 2019 until bid
closing at 2:00 p.m. on July 17, 2019, at which time the bid documents were no longer available
for download. The bid was downloaded from the MITN website by sixteen (16) contractors. Six
(6) companies attended the mandatory walk-thru and five (5) companies submitted a bid on the
project. DPL requested each company to submit a bid on the roofing replacement utilizing Cold
