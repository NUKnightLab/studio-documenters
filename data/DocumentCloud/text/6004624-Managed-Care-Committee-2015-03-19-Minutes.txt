Report on CountyCare Health Plan (Attachment #1)
A. Metrics
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, reviewed the Report on the CountyCare Health Plan.
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, and Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of
Strategy and Finance provided additional information.
The Committee received an update on the plans to take the call center activities in-house. Dr. Shannon stated
that the administration is going back to the Finance Committee on Friday with a modest extension of the
current contract. He noted that things got a little held up in some areas while working through the transition
with a couple of the internal parties involved in bringing the services in-house.

Report on CountyCare Health Plan (continued)
Mr. Glass provided an update on the subject of auto-assignments and the issue involving the “fair share”
distribution of new members to CountyCare and the other health plans. He stated that the CCHHS
administration has a standing meeting with representatives from the State that takes place every two (2)
weeks; in that meeting, this issue has been brought up. The representatives from the State continue to tell the
CCHHS administration that the State’s algorithm is working correctly, and the CCHHS administration
continues to debate it. He noted that, at this point in time, the majority of the auto-assignments are done;
another big lift is expected in the month of April, but not much is expected after that. Chairman Lerner
encouraged Dr. Shannon to try to get on the Governor’s calendar to further discuss the apparent inequity, as
he would prefer to leave no stone unturned when it comes to these kinds of issues1.
During the discussion of the information contained on slide 12 of the presentation regarding membership by
key provider group, Director Junge inquired regarding the 8% drop in CCHHS/ACHN members between
December 2014 and March 2015. Mr. Glass stated that, although the percentage dropped, it was a
proportional shift in the population; the number of actual members increased. As the plan has grown in lives,
and as the Family Health Plan membership has grown from 6,000 in December to 64,000 in March, the vast
majority of that membership is assigned into the MHN/ACO network. Chairman Lerner inquired whether
there is a goal as to how the administration would like to see this distributed in the future. Mr. Glass
responded that this has not yet been considered, but it is a good idea to think about. Chairman Lerner stated
that this should be part of the strategic direction, because it leads to the kind of conversations that the
Committee is having here, and will clearly come up at the Board Meeting2.
During the discussion of the information on pharmacy cost savings, Mr. Glass provided additional
information relating to Hepatitis C cost savings. The administration has put in a prior authorization process
related to the diagnosis of Hepatitis C; this eliminates the need for a liver biopsy and requires individuals
who are looking to initiate Hepatitis C treatment to first come in, have a Fibroscan (state-of-the-art
technology), and work with the infectious disease doctors before that prescription goes into play.
With regard to the information on slide 14, Director Gugenheim inquired regarding the priority population of
top 1% utilizers3. Mr. Glass stated that he will obtain further information on that subject to provide at the
Board Meeting next week.
During the discussion of slide 15, Chairman Lerner noted that there is a lot of discussion in literature about
narrow versus broad networks. There are pros and cons and consequences to each strategy; certainly given
CountyCare’s large market in the state, this is something that should be considered and strategically
discussed4.
With regard to the subject of member satisfaction, Mr. Glass stated that CountyCare is required to annually
survey its members and receive feedback from them. The survey will be going out in April, so that data may
be ready by June.
