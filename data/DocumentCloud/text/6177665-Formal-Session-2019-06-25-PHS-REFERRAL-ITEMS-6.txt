RE: CANADIAN NATIONAL RAIL LINE CONRAIL

Both Canadian National and Conrail have tracks in the 3rd District that are in desperate
need of repair. The tracks below are a traf?c hazard and are causing damage to personal
vehicles as residents attempt to navigate these rail crossings.

1. Canadian National Rail Line East Outer Drive north of East Seven Mile
2. Conrail - Conant south of Jerome Ave and north of East McNichols
3. Conrail - Gratiot south of Conner Ave and north of French Road

Please work with Wayne County to strongly encourage Canadian National Rail to repair
the above railroad crossing. In addition, please contact Conrail and see how we can
support their efforts to repair the Gratiot crossing that traverses the MDOT rights-of-way.

I am also requesting LPD research the tools available to the City of Detroit via the federal
government to compel action for a resolution to this problem, as it seems CN Rail is
unwilling or unable to maintain their railroad tracks. Please reach out to my office at
313?224-1198 with any questions.

RE: Private Property Damaged by City Tree

 

A resident reported severe damage done to their home located at 1442 Livernois after a tree
crashed onto the front of their home several years ago (approx. 2014 or 2015). GSD workers were
trimming and removing trees they had marked the previous week on Livernois Ave. When they
skipped the marked tree in front of 1442 Livernois, the resident was informed that they would
return the following Monday to address this tree. However, the tree was never serviced and fell
onto the home within a month of their initial service ofthis block of Livernois. The roof and porch
were significantly damaged- this story was covered by a local news station (images included). The
resident does not have home insurance. Given the circumstances leading up to this issue, we
request the City be held accountable for the damages incurred by the resident?s property. Please
feel?free to reach out td my office is you have additional questions.

RE: 8062 Homer Street

 

The resident at 8062 Homer Street initially reported a raw sewerage back up (Claim #18-377) in her
basement in September 2017 shortly after she reports her alley collapsed. Despite several of her neighbors
experiencing the same overflow issues as well as a plumbing representative who has inspected the
property every year from 2009-2017 claiming an issue lies in the alley, DWSD has denied the resident?s
Claim contingent upon the provision of additional documentation. My office would like to request:

1) An additional inspection on the pipes within the alley as well as the findings of the report

2) What additional documents beyond a signed statement from the resident's plumber, a petition of
neighbors verifying their basements continually flood, and photos documenting the resident?s flood
basement, damaged alley, and items that sustained damage from flooding are need to process the
resident?s claim?

Below are photos documenting the alley damage, basement flooding, and general flooding of Homer Street
on the resident?s block when it rains. If you have any questions, please contact my office. Thank you.
