WHEREAS, recently members of the Cook County Board of Commissioners have
called into question the use of Cook County’s wireless network during Board and
Committee meetings for political purposes; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Ethics was queried on said matter,
specifically pertaining to an incident that occurred on Tuesday, November 17, 2009
during the County Board meeting where a political message was sent from the floor
of the Board Room during the meeting using the Twitter website; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Ethics opined on this matter and concluded that the use
of the County’s wireless internet for said purpose may be construed as a prohibited
political activity and a misuse of County owned property under Sections 2-571 and
2-576 of the Cook County Ethics Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, the Ethics Board also recommended that said use be discontinued in
the future; and
WHEREAS, presently Article III, Division 2 concerning Rules of Organization does
not address the issue of using social networking sites and electronic
communication devices during deliberations of the County Board; and

matter may undermine transparency and the public confidence in Cook County
government, the Board of Ethics also recommended that the use of social
networking sites and other like electronic communications should be addressed in
the framework of the Rules & Administration Committee; and
WHEREAS, Article III, Division 2, Section 2-108, (g) (2) states: The Board may
grant members of the public leave to speak on items pending before the Board; and
