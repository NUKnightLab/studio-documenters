INDEPENDENT REPORT

To the Board of Directors of
Chicago Infrastructure Trust
Chicago, Illinois

We have audited the accompanying ?nancial statements of Chicago Infrastructure Trust (the
?Trust?), a nonpro?t organization, which comprise the statement of ?nancial position as of
December 31, 2015 and the related statements of activities and cash ?ows for the year then ended
and the related notes to the ?nancial statements.

Management?s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these ?nancial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this
includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation
and fair presentation of ?nancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.

Auditor ?5 Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these ?nancial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the ?nancial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the ?nancial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor?s judgment,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the ?nancial statements, whether
due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control
relevant to the entity?s preparation and fair presentation of the ?nancial statements in order to
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness ofthe entity?s internal control. Accordingly, we express
no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of signi?cant accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the ?nancial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suf?cient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the ?nancial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the ?nancial position of Chicago Infrastructure Trust as of December 31, 2015 and the changes
in its net assets and its cash ?ows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

Report on Summarized Comparative Information

The financial statements of the Trust for the year ended December 31. 2014 were audited by other
auditors. whose report dated August 14, 2015. expressed an unmodi?ed opinion on those
statements. In our opinion, the summarized comparative information presented herein as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2014, is consistent, in all material respects, with the audited
?nancial statements from which it has been derived.

CHICAGO INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015

NOTE 1 NATURE OF ACTIVITIES

Organization: The Chicago Infrastructure Trust (the "Trust?) was incorporated as a non-pro?t
organization on April 24, 2012 under executive order of the Mayor and City Council resolution. The
Trust operates exclusively for civic and charitable purposes in the Chicago Metropolitan area and is
a tax exempt entity pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

The Trust assists the people of the City of Chicago, the City government and its sister agencies in
providing alternative ?nancing and project delivery options for transformative infrastructure
projects. To accomplish this, the Trust hopes to structure innovative ?nancing strategies and attract
capital from diverse groups of investors. The Trust also hopes to achieve and demonstrate real risk
transfer to third-party investors, and to stimulate cross-agency ?nancing while creating ef?cient
capital structures.

The Trust was established in 2012 under the support of the City of Chicago, who agreed to supply
the initial funding to commence operations. The initial funding was set at $2.5 million in grants,
after which the Trust was expected to procure alternative sources of revenue. For the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014 grants from the City of Chicago were the Trust?s primary source of
revenues.

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Accounting: The ?nancial statements of the Trust have been prepared on the accrual basis
of accounting and, accordingly, re?ect all signi?cant receivables, payables and other liabilities.

Basis of Presentation: The Trust presents its ?nancial statements in accordance with the accounting
guidance for nonpro?t entities. Under this guidance, the Trust is required to report information
regarding its ?nancial position and activities according to three classes of net assets: unrestricted net
assets, temporarily restricted net assets, and permanently restricted net assets. Furthermore,
information is required to segregate program service expenses from support and fundraising
expenses.

Use of Estimates: The preparation of ?nancial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the ?nancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents: The Trust considers cash on deposit at bank(s) to be cash equivalents.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued

Revenue Recognition: Grants received are recorded as unrestricted, temporarily restricted or
permanently restricted support, depending on the existence and/or nature of any donor restrictions.
Conditional promises to give are not recognized until they become unconditional: that is, when the
conditions on which they depend are substantially met. Service revenues are recognized at project
completion.

Grants Receivable: Receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, if any.
Management's estimate of the allowance is based on historical collection experience and a review of
the current status of grants receivable. It is reasonably possible that management?s estimate of the
allowance will change. There was no allowance against grants receivable at December 31, 2015 and
2014.

Capitalization and depreciation: Fixed assets are recorded at cost. Improvements are capitalized,
while expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed. The assets are depreciated over their
estimated service lives. The estimated service lives of the assets for depreciation purposes may be
different than their actual economic useful lives.

 

Estimated

Useful Life Method
Furniture and ?xtures 5 years Straight-line
Machinery and equipment 3 years Straight-line

Impairment of long-l ived assets: The Trust reviews its property for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the
fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the
difference. No impairment losses were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015 and
2014.

Prepaid Exgenses: Advance payments for expenses related to subscriptions and insurance policies
are classi?ed as prepaid expenses.

Net Assets: The Trust classi?es its net assets, and revenue based on the existence or absence of
donor-imposed restrictions as follows:

Unrestricted net assets: Net assets that are not subj eet to donor-imposed stipulations.

 

Temporarily restricted net assets: Net assets represent resources for which use has been
temporarily restricted by the donor as to its usage or by the passage of time. When a donor
restriction has been satis?ed, temporarily restricted net assets are reclassi?ed to unrestricted
net assets.

CHICAGO INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued

Permaaeatiy restricted net assets: Net assets represent resources that are limited by donor-
imposed stipulations that neither expire by passage of time nor can be ful?lled or otherwise
removed by actions of the Trust. The Trust had no permanently restricted net assets during
the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Leases: Lease expenses are recorded based on the payments required by the lease agreement.
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the lease
payments be straight-lined over the life of the lease; however, the effect of using actual lease
payments is not materially different from the results that would have been obtained under the
straight-line method.

Income Taxes: The Trust has applied for and received a determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service to be treated as a tax exempt entity pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code and did not have any unrelated business income for the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014. Due to its tax exempt status, the Trust is not subject to income taxes,
but is required to ?le and does ?le tax returns with the IRS and other taxing authorities.
Accordingly, these ?nancial statements do not re?ect a provision for income taxes and the Trust has
no other tax positions which must be considered for disclosure. Income tax returns ?led by the Trust
are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years. While no tax
returns are currently being examined by the Internal Revenue Service, tax years since inception
remain open.

Comparative Financial Information: The ?nancial statements include prior-year summarized
comparative information. Such information does not include suf?cient data to constitute a
presentation in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, such
information should be read in conjunction with the Trust's ?nancial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2014, from which the summarized information was derived.

Functional Allocation of Expenses: The costs of providing various programs and other activities
have been summarized on a functional basis in the Statement of Activities. Accordingly, certain
costs have been allocated among the programs bene?ted, as well as administrative functions.

Reelassi?eations: Certain amounts in the December 31, 2014 Financial Statements have been
reclassi?ed to conform to the current presentation.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015

NOTE 3 CASH DEPOSITS

The Trust maintains its cash and cash equivalents in bank deposits and is insured within limits of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. At certain times during the year, cash balances exceed the
insured amounts. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the uninsured bank balance was approximately
$217,100 and respectively. The Trust has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The
Trust?s management believes it is not exposed to any signi?cant credit risk on cash and cash
equivalents.

NOTE 4 LEASE COMMITMENTS

Facilities: The Trust entered into a three-year operating lease beginning August 1, 2014 and ending
July 31, 2017, for of?ce space at 35 East Wacker Drive, Suite 1450, Chicago, Illinois in the amount
of $2,558 per month, which escalates annually on August 1. Rent expenses for the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled $32,661 and $12,789, respectively.

Equipment: The Trust also leases of?ce equipment under one operating lease for total annual lease
payments of approximately $6,624 and one capital lease, both with initial lease terms in excess of

one year.

The operating lease expense for of?ce equipment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014
totaled $6,624 and $2,760, respectively.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014 capital lease asset balances are as follows:

 

 

 

2015 2014
Leased of?ce equipment 48,642 48,642
Less accumulated amortization (21,619) (5,505)

Amortization expense 16,114 5,505

 

Future minimum lease payments under these are as follows:

NOTE 5 CONCENTRATIONS

A substantial portion of the Trust's revenue was received from the City of Chicago. Substantial
revenue is de?ned as revenue earned from any source that is in excess of 10% of the total revenue of
the Trust. For the period ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, earned from the City of
Chicago was 93% and 87%, respectively, of total revenue. Should the City of Chicago discontinue
funding the Trust, and the Trust not receive other awarded grants, the Trust will require additional
sources of ?nancing.

NOTE 6 GRANTS

During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the City of Chicago awarded grants in the
amount of $2,585,000 and $1,000,000, respectively. Of the 2015 grant, $1.3 million is committed
for the year 2016. Furthermore, this commitment is subject to the City?s appropriation.

Grants are subject to grantor audits, which could result in claims against the Trust for disallowed
costs or noncompliance with grantor restrictions.

NOTE 7 TEMPORARILY RESTRICTED NET ASSETS

Temporarily restricted net assets totaling $153,103 and $0 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014
respectively, are available for the Trust as de?ned in the grantor?s agreement.

NOTE 8 UNCERTAINTIES

During 2015, former consultants, contractors and employees asserted in writing that they were owed
amounts for various past due fees and expense reimbursement. As of the date of this report, certain
of the claims for such past due amounts were paid by the Trust and certain other claims remained
pending, for which an accrual has been established.

NOTE 9 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Management has reviewed and evaluated subsequent events through October 18, 2016, the date the
?nancial statements were available to be issued and determined that there were no signi?cant
subsequent events to be recognized and/or disclosed in these ?nancial statements as required by
generally accepted accounting principles.
