During the discussion of the information on slide 24 regarding the System-wide payor mix, Dr. Shannon noted that
the System’s rate of uninsured got to a modern nadir of 38% in 2016; that rate has been creeping up and is a concern.
Data suggests that the uninsured rate went up nationally by 1.5% from the end of 2016 to the end of 2017. It is not
known whether this is an exaggeration of the national trend, or is due to other reasons. Chairman Hammock
requested that staff provide a deep dive on the subject in the months to come, to provide a better understanding of
what is going on.
Director Reiter, seconded by Director Richardson-Lowry, moved the approval of the
Minutes of the Meeting of the Finance Committee of April 20, 2018. THE MOTION

March 23, 2018 Committee Meeting Minutes, as amended

Chairman Hammock presented the Meeting Minutes for the Board’s consideration. Dr. Shannon provided an
overview of the reports that were presented at the meeting.
Director Richardson-Lowry referenced written testimony from Dr. King provided earlier in the meeting regarding
the City of Chicago-Cook County Intergovernmental Agreement for psychiatry/telepsychiatry services. She asked
Dr. Shannon to speak on the subject as it relates to quality.
Dr. Shannon stated that this matter was a consideration based on several factors. First, space availability was a
consideration – the System is very space constrained. Staff looked carefully at the distribution of patients that are
served and where they live; as it turns out, the patients who had been historically getting their care in the Fantusbased psychiatry specialty clinic are largely clustered on the West Side and South Side of Chicago. In the long run,
the administration plans to have dedicated space centrally located to enhance services for some of the reasons to
which the public speakers alluded. To enhance the services on the Central Campus, the administration will make
sure that access to care is being improved through more integration within the primary care centers; ideally, as
capacity is built up in the model community health centers, like the ones being developed in Arlington Heights and
North Riverside, there would be space for those types of specialty services to be provided there.
Dr. Shannon indicated that the System is probably going to be like every other organization trying to meet those
needs as effectively as it can using technology. If there is an ability to get more effective use of the finite resources
- actual psychiatrists – then the administration will try to see how can they can take that precious resource and use it
most efficiently across the County, by telepsychiatry, where it is applicable. He noted that great advances have been
seen in its use in correctional health.
Director Richardson-Lowry requested that the Board receive reports on the progress being made, both with regard
to the need to introduce the technological component, but also, given the human needs on that front, informative to
know how the System is progressing, where the problems are, and how the System is engaging in the community.
Related to human resources, if the System is moving those services into the community, she is sensing that there will
at least be a staffing need, if not a cross-training need, and she is interested in how that will be handled. Her fear is
that if these things are not handled wholistically, the System is going to inherit this problem in the jails, emergency
rooms, substance abuse clinics, etc.
Director Munar, seconded by Director Thomas, moved the approval of the Minutes of the
Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting of April 20, 2018. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

• Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Reporting System Program

• Leading Causes of Infant Mortality
• Birth 2016: Infant Mortality According to Mother’s District of Residence and Race/Ethnicity
Director Richardson-Lowry referenced earlier comments by Dr. Mason regarding data points that are available for
APORS on outcomes; she requested that he provide those to the Board electronically.
Director Driscoll commented that the data presented, particularly around the black and white gap and infant
mortality, continues to shock her; she stated that this data needs to inform the maternal and child health programs
System-wide. The organization needs to look upstream at providing more than medical care for pregnant women;
they should continue to try and provide more support to the families who deliver their babies and stay here in the
System. She added that that medical intervention has done so many things, but still the gap has not closed.

During the presentation, Director Junge noted that one (1) of the triage sites does not have Naloxone available; she
urged the administration to facilitate distribution of Naloxone at all sites. Mr. Elwell agreed, and stated that staff are
working to make that happen.
Director Driscoll inquired regarding the System’s community partners; when patients are referred to community
partners, how does the System get back or exchange clinical information to wrap care around the patient? Mr. Elwell
responded that there are various ways; he will provide an answer to that question following the meeting.
Director Munar stated for the record that he is delighted that the System is recruiting a behavioral health leader. He
is curious to understand what the unmet need is – the answer involves a combination of looking at the data around
patient screening, what is the numerator and denominator, and what that data reflects. He is also interested in learning
more regarding the patient experience using the regional networks. Director Richardson-Lowry stated that she hopes
that the person selected as the new behavioral health leader is someone who is not just an administrator, but also has
the appropriate medical background.
Chairman Hammock stated that the Board looks forward to tracking progress on this subject; he requested that the
administration determine the best way to incorporate metrics on this subject, and present them regularly to the Board
or to a Committee.

Re:

City of Chicago-Cook County Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) for Psychiatry/Telepsychiatry
Services

Dr. Shannon and Mr. Elwell have accurately reported that currently there is only one FTE City employee
psychiatrist serving the City’s five mental health centers. It was suggested that therefore a CDPH-CCHHS
intergovernmental agreement was needed to “fill the void” in City clinic psychiatry services.
It is inaccurate and unfair, however, to create the impression that only one psychiatrist has been serving
City residents at the five City-run mental health centers. In fact, in addition to the one City employee,
there are currently four (4) non-City employee psychiatrists who have been serving at the City clinics for
the past one to two years. Two of the psychiatrists have been serving for longer than two years. Please
see the monthly CDPH clinic psychiatry schedules, covering the past year, displayed on the attachment.
CDPH administrators told the Community Mental Health Board of Chicago that the IGA will provide the
City the equivalent of 2 FTE psychiatrists or about 80 hours of coverage per week or one day more of
coverage than the City clinics are currently providing with in-person care. As such, the IGA does not
appear to offer much additional psychiatry coverage. Rather than “filling the void” it simply replaces inperson care with care via television screens and it does so at a much higher cost to taxpayers.
The City pays its psychiatrist $109 per hour and pays the temp agency $175 per psychiatrist hour.
Through the IGA the City will pay CCHHS $250 per hour.
We wonder why CCHHS has contracted with the telepsychiatry vendor but has not used the vendor (or
telepsychiatry) in any of its own voluntary community-based health centers.
CCHHS has suggested that the use of telepsychiatry would be temporary until it could “staff up” with
CCHHS employed psychiatrists. But when this happens City residents will be asked to change
psychiatrists once again. The IGA isn’t guaranteed or designed, then, to provide for more stable or
continuous doctor-patient relationships.
Persons currently served and who attend our Community Mental Health Board meetings tell us they
want in-person care.
The City should continue to recruit and hire its own psychiatrists and increase the salary offered. The
City should maintain its current in-person psychiatry services and perhaps consider supplementing, not
supplanting current in-person care with telepsychiatry. Other in-person staffing alternatives should be
considered first such as employing advanced practice psychiatric nurses and physician assistants.
The County and the City need to develop a vision for clinical psychiatry care.
Thank you for your attention.
