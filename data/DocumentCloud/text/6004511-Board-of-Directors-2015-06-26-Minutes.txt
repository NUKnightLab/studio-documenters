iii. Meeting Minutes

Director Gugenheim presented the Meeting Minutes and reviewed the Metrics. Dr. Shannon reviewed the Focus
Area Presentation regarding Patient Experience. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the presentation on Patient Experience, Director Junge inquired regarding whether the
Patient Experience Council includes representation from the unions. Dr. Shannon responded that he will find out
and provide an answer; the Council’s membership includes front-line staff, who are union members, but he is
unsure whether union leadership is included in that membership.
Director Collens stated that, with some surveys, there are special efforts made to sample the non-respondents to see
if they are likely to respond in a different way than those who responded to the survey; he asked whether this was
done. Dr. Shannon stated that he was unsure; he will find out and return with an answer.
Director Wiese inquired whether there is some instrument that would provide a measurement of how the staff and
doctors would answer the questions posed in the patient survey. Dr. Shannon responded that the administration has
not administered those patient surveys to its staff; he noted that a great deal of feedback is regularly received from
the staff, although not in a scientific or comprehensive fashion. Chairman Hammock stated that, in industry, there
are engagement surveys for employees; perhaps in the future this ought to be considered.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Junge, moved the approval of the Minutes of the
Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting of June 16, 2015. THE MOTION CARRIED

Board and Committee Reports
C. Human Resources Committee Meeting, June 19, 2015 (continued)
Director Wiese presented the Meeting Minutes; Gladys Lopez, Chief of Human Resources, reviewed the Metrics
and Focus Area Presentation. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
At the June 19th Human Resources Committee Meeting, Ms. Lopez noted that Director Junge inquired regarding the
net gain in nursing. She stated that, when the data was presented, the net new for this year was 20. Director Junge
asked what that number was last year; the net new last year at this time was -68, so progress is being made this year.
During the discussion of the information on the Average Time to Hire, Director Marsh inquired whether data can be
tracked regarding the number of potential recruits who withdraw from the hiring process before they can be hired,
because they have been hired elsewhere. Ms. Lopez stated that tracking this data may be possible; she will look
into the question further.
Also discussed at the June 19th Human Resources Committee Meeting was the subject of CCHHS Retirement Risk.
At the meeting, it was noted that reciprocity is not factored into the data; a question was raised regarding the
potential impact that this could have on the data that was presented. Ms. Lopez stated that, upon further review, the
Pension Board does not have a list of those employees whose benefits may be affected by reciprocity; the Pension
Board only becomes aware of the service accrued through reciprocity when the employee begins the process to
retire. Chairman Hammock asked Ms. Lopez to have the question addressed again. He believes that the Pension
Board’s actuaries are expected to calculate that into their overall liability; they could be substantially understating
their liability if they do not have records of that somewhere.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Lerner, moved the approval of the Minutes of the Human
Resources Committee Meeting of June 19, 2015.
THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.
D. Finance Committee Meeting, June 19, 2015
i. Metrics (Attachment #4)
ii. Meeting Minutes
 Proposed Transfers of Funds
 Contracts and Procurement Items (detail was provided as an attachment to the Board Agenda)
Director Collens presented the Meeting Minutes and reviewed the metrics with Mr. Elwell. The Board reviewed
and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the Metrics, Chairman Hammock inquired regarding in the last three (3) measures listed,
regarding Inpatient Days, Outpatient Clinic Registrations and Emergency Room Visits. With regard to Inpatient
Days, Mr. Elwell stated that, with managed care and with greater effort on the outpatient side, it was expected that
this would decrease; however, the census is dropping faster than anticipated. With regard to Outpatient Clinic
Registrations, he stated that he is closely watching this measure, because it is not tracking with the industry. With
regard to the decrease in Emergency Room Visits, he stated that it was expected to drop over time, but they have
dropped pretty significantly. He is not overly concerned with that; it is expected that, if CCHHS does a better job in
terms of its primary care medical homes, then emergency visits are likely to drop. Chairman Hammock commented
that the long-term revenue success will be driven by those bottom three (3) measures going in the right direction.
He asked Mr. Elwell to identify some national or regional charts that will provide additional information on industry
trends and transition effects, to reflect what’s happening in the industry.

Board and Committee Reports
D. Finance Committee Meeting, June 19, 2015 (continued)
Director Lerner inquired further regarding the decrease in Inpatient Days. Mr. Elwell stated that the decrease is
somewhat generalized; he noted that there is a very high census in Med/Surg. Director Lerner presumed that the
administration is starting to do contingency planning, in terms of reducing elective expenditures and elective capital,
etc.; he suggested that the subject be included as an agenda item for discussion at the Finance Committee, with a
report for the full board. Director Collens concurred; he added that the Finance Committee currently has a more
immediate concern, which is next year’s budget.
Director Wiese inquired whether the Board can receive a report regarding the actual number of days that patients
are waiting to see a specialist; she noted that this issue could be driving away market share. Mr. Elwell stated that
he believes this information can be provided.
Director Collens, seconded by Director Lerner, moved the approval of the Minutes of the
Finance Committee Meeting of June 19, 2015. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Legislative Update

Local

On June 17, 2015 the Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors of the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System convened for the purpose of the considering the nomination of candidates to fill the remaining
vacancy on the Board created by the resignation of Reverend Calvin Morris in August 2014. The Nominating
Committee forwarded the names of three candidates to President Preckwinkle for consideration. Once the
President selects a candidate, the name will be submitted to the Cook County Board for consideration.

Pursuant to the Cook County enabling ordinance which created the independent Hospital Board, the Nominating
Committee is comprised of the following fourteen organizations: Association of Community Safety Net Hospitals,
Civic Federation of Chicago, Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago, Chicago Department of Public
Health, Chicago Federation of Labor, Chicago Medical Society, Chicago Urban League, Cook County Physicians
Association, Healthcare Financial Management Association, Health and Medicine Policy Research Group, Illinois
Public Health Association, Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council, Midwest Latino Health Research Center and
the Suburban Primary Healthcare Council.

State

The Illinois General Assembly is currently operating in "overtime? session; legislation now requires a 315ths
majority of both chambers to pass.

Prior to the end of regular session on May 31, 2015, the House and Senate passed several budget bills authorizing
FY16spending, including which concerns the Illinois Medicaid program. 53788 enacts a 2.25% rate
reduction for many Medicaid providers; hospitals, and other providers are excluded from this rate cut. In
addition to making other changes to the Medicaid program, 53783 codifies Accountable Care Entities (ACEs) and
Care Coordination Entities 

Budget bills authorizing FY16 spending were recently sent to the Governor, who has 60 days to take action. If the
Governor does not act during this period, the bills become effective on day 61. Within the 60 days, the Governor
can veto the bills outright or proceed with an amendatory veto, meaning he can make minor changes or strike out
certain sections of the respective bills. The House and Senate may override a gubernatorial veto with a 3/5ths
supermajority vote and may override an amendatory veto with a simple majority.

At this point in time, it is unclear whether Illinois will have a budget in place when the FY16 fiscal year starts on July
1. The Illinois Department of health and Family Services (HFS) has said that they have little to no ability to pay

providers and managed care plans for services in the FY16 fiscal year without appropriation authority.

Federal
On June 25, 2015 the United States Supreme Court ruled in the King v. Burwell (No. 144-114}. The Court affirmed
the decision of the Fourth Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals preserving nationwide tax subsidies for

insurance purchased under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System at both the State
and Federal level.

Statement on King v. Burwell Ruling
June 25, 2015

"As the CEO of Cook County Health 8: Hospitals System, I applaud the Supreme Court?s decision to uphold the federal
subsidies that millions of Americans rely on to purchase affordable health insurance.

This is yet another legal victory that recognizes and upholds the spirit of the ACA, the most comprehensive health care
legislation since the creation of Medicaid and Medicare. The ruling is a critical triumph that reinforces the early and
most important success of the ACA: broader health care coverage for Americans.

As a result ofthis ruling, more than 232 000 illinoisans will be able to keep their subsidies and their health insurance,
ensuring continuity of coverage for this population with historically few insurance options.

 

While this success will protect coverage for manyour fight. As a society, we must work to expand
access to health coverage for the countless number of people who remain uninsured despite the ACA. Until then, 
will continue in its mission, as it has for nearly 180 years, to serve all who need care regardless oftheir insurance status
or ability to pay.?

Obamacare ruling 'a relief,? Cook County health official says

June 25, 2015

BY STEFAN-O ESPOSITO

The man in charge of the Cook County Health Hospitals System
greeted the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to back federal subsidies for
Obamacare with a sense of relief Thursday.

Had the nation's highest court killed those subsidies, it could have meant
a huge increase in Cook County patients unable to pay their medical bills,
said the system?s CEO, Dr. John Jay Shannon.

    

I 
Dr. John Jay Shannon, CEO of Cook County Heaiih Hospital's
System, said the Chan-racers ruling was 'a rebel} . 
For every Institution, for us to a greater degree, it will be a relief,

Shannon said. ?One of the signal achievements of the Affordable Care Act was the increase in the number of
people in the country who have insurance through Medicaid expansion or through buying insurance on the
market place."

In 2013, Cook County?s charity care costs totaled about $500 million, Shannon said. One year later. those costs
had dropped to $340 million.

?This is directly related to the Affordable Care Act," Shannon said.

Without the federal subsidies, those charity costs would have likely returned to pre?Obamacare levels or higher,
Shannon said.

That would have come at a time when Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle is trying to drum up
interests in a 1 percent sales tax increase to help pay county bills.

On Thursday, Preckwinkle, unsurprisingly, applauded the high court's ruling.

?President Obama's Affordable Care Act has been a godsend to those of us in the public health business,"
Preckwinkle said in a statement. ?Thanks to the ACA, we are moving toward long-term financial sustainability
for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System. More than 130,000 patients are now enrolled in CountyCare.
the county?s managed Medicaid plan, greatly exceeding our 2015 enrollment goal of 156,000. Now, for the first
time in its history, our health system has more insured patients than uninsured patients.?

Statewide, some 232,000 people have federal health subsidies through Obamacare, typically in the form of a
tax credit, officials say. The tax credit averages about $211 a month per enrollee.

Shannon said ruling didn?t particularly surprise him.

?To me, this seemed like a desperate attempt of ideologues to try to reverse the overall intention of the
Affordable Care Act.? he said. ?They are looking for any chink in the armor they can find. I am glad the Supreme
Court saw through that."

Editorial: Obamacare ruling good for America

Obamacare is here to stay, and America is the better for it.

in a convincing 21?page decision in the case of King v. Burwell, a 6-3 majority of the U.S. Supreme Court
demonstrated clear-eyed legal reasoning and simple common sense. The Court did Republican critics of
Obamacare a big favor, though they won't admit it. Most important, the Court stood up for 17 million Americans
who now get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. That includes 6.4 million people who could have
been dropped immediately.

Thursday's ruling is a victory for the poor, the young and the sick. It is a victory for our nation's efforts to control
the overall cost of health care. It is a victory a day to give a sigh of relief? for the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System and other urban medical centers that care forthe poor, which depend heavily on Obamacare
to pay their bills.

Thursday's ruling solidifies not only President Barack Obama's legacy. but also that of Supreme Court Chief
Justice John Roberts, who crafted a majority opinion that put the law above partisan quibbling. The justices in
the majority shot down the strongest remaining legal challenge to the ACA and, in so doing. made it far harder
politically for a future Congress and president to repeal it. As Obama said Thursday, the law "is here to stay."

The likelihood now is that GOP critics will continue to lambast the Affordable Care Act, but they are spared the
difficultjob of coming up with an alternative and won?t have to shoulder the blame for millions of Americans
getting dumped from the health insurance rolls.

Dissenting from the Court's majority view were three justices Scalia, Thomas and Alito whose legal
reasoning barely rises above talk radio "gotcha." They fixated on four words in the law ?established by the
state? and made no effort to put those words into the law's clear larger context. But, as Roberts said for the
majority, Congress obviously intended federal subsidies for lower income Americans to be available through
every state's Dbamacare exchange, whether that exchange was set up by the state or run by the feds. At worst,
Congress was guilty of ?inartful drafting."

Without the subsidies in every state, Roberts wrote, the Affordable Care Act would fall into a ?death spiral."

"Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets,? Roberts wrote, "not to destroy
them.?

The ACA is, of course, not perfect. Its cost-savings predictions have fallen short, and specific provisions, such
as paying a fee for each individual medical service, merit revisiting. This is where the debate now should turn -
to improving, not bowdlerizing a landmark law that, quite literally, is saving American lives.

Among health care groups, muted applause for Obamacare ruling
June 25. 2015

By Kristen Schorsch

In Illinois hospitals, insurers and health care associations applauded the U.S. Supreme Court's decision today to uphold
subsidies that consumers use to buy plans on the health insurance exchanges.

But many also caution that the battle to preserve pieces of federal health care reform. commonly referred to as
Obamacare, isn't over.

"Because of these subsidies, more than 230.000 low- and moderate?income are able to afford health insurance,
ensuring that they have access to the health care they need when they need it.? the Illinois Hospital Association. an
influential lobbying group based in Naperville. said in a statement. "These now receive more than $49 million a
month in subsidies (nearly $600 million on an annualized basis}.?

?We are pleased that the hundreds of thousands of Illinois residents who have been able to obtain health coverage
through Get Covered Illinois under the Affordable Care Act will continue to receive financial help to pay for their
coverage,? Get Covered Executive Director Karin Zosel said in a statement.

?We remain focused on providing an array of affordable products and services to our members and the market." Mike
Deering. a spokesman for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois. the state's largest insurer. said in a statement. ?We also
will continue to lead on patient-centered health care delivery reforms that promote innovation. value. and improve the
quality of care for our mem bers.?

Said the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council, a hospital trade group. in a statement: ?This ruling tremendously
benefits the patients and communities our members serve. and we believe this momentous decision creates a healthier
Illinois."

The council sponsored Land of Lincoln Health, a new type of insurer made possible under the Affordable Care Act that
offers plans on the Illinois health insurance exchange.

?The ruling is a critical triumph that reinforces the early and most important success of the ACA: broader health care
coverage for Americans." Dr. John Jay Shannon. CEO of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System. said in a
statement.

Cook County Health, one of the largest public health systems in the nation. launched CountyCare under the ACA. Now
one of the largest Medicaid managed care plans in the Chicago area, CountyCare had nearly 130,000 members as of
May. according to the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services. which oversees Medicaid.

?We are delighted that this issue is resolved and coverage is protected for those we serve who put their faith in a system
that truly works.? Sandra Bruce. CEO of Chicago-based Presence Health. the largest Catholic hospital network in Illinois.
said in a statement. ?We hope that the focus now turns to enhancing coverage and care. rather than leaving those in need
without an alternative."

REFORM BATTLE FAR FROM OVER

Avalere Health. a Washington, D.C.-based consultancy that analyzes the Affordable Care Act. said that while the ruling
preserves tax credits. the battle over federal health care reform is far from over. In fact. it's likely to ?reignite? as part of the
2016 presidential race. Elizabeth Carpenter. director of Avalere. said in a statement.

?Congress is still likely to consider repeal of the medical device tax and the Independent Payment Advisory Board. as well
as changes to the employer mandate and the Cadillac Tax." Carpenter said in the statement.

The public exchanges need to focus on boosting enrollment and attracting younger. healthier enrollees to ensure a variety
of affordable plans, Avalere Senior  v'ice President Caroline Pearson said in the statement.

Pols will keep talking about Obamacare?but it's here to stay
By Greg Hinz June 25, 2015

Democrats are offering list bumps and high ?ves while simultaneously jumping for joy.

Republicans are mumbling something about wait till next year?when they're saying anything at all.

That's the political reaction to today?s US. Supreme Court ruling upholding a central tenet of the Affordable
Care Act (better knovvn as Dbamacare): the ability of the feds to subsidize premium payments for people who
purchase health insurance through the federal exchange when their state doesn't offer its own exchange.

Typical was the exchange of statements between US. Rep. Bob Dold. a Republican and the man trying to
unseat him and get his old job back next year, Democrat Brad Schneider.

ACA "has made historic progress toward creating a better health care system for all Americans. . . .I applaud
the Supreme Court for continuing this progress." Schneider said. 'With Obamacare now having been upheld
multiple times by the Supreme Court and having survived countless attempts at repeal by congressional
Republicans. including Bob Dold. it's time to move forward and work to improve this law instead of engaging in
endless. counterproductive political games."

Responded Dold: ?While l've never questioned the good intentions of those who brought us the ACA. the
partisan process by which it was rushed through Congress produced a law that continues to drive up premiums
and deductibles. . . .The Supreme Court's decision today in no way ends Washington's responsibility to
implement the serious. bipartisan reforms to the law that are needed to drive down costs. restore access to care
and make health care work for everyone."

KIRK, DURBIN
Then there were these dueling press releases from Illinois' US. senators:

?The Supreme Court historically upholds the president's signature law. so today's ruling is not surprising."
Republican Mark Kirk said- "i believe there is still room to advance bipartisan reforms of this law to keep health
care costs down and expand access to care."

?Memo to the non-stop critics of the ACA: Stop trying to kill this program and work to make it stronger."
Democrat Dick Durbin thundered. "The Supreme Court's decision protects the health insurance of 240,000
Illinoisans and 5.5 million Americans nationwide. America will not return to the days when millions were
uninsured and the cost of health care was out of control."

Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. whose budget depends heavily on expanded Medicaid
payments from the health care law. credited Obamacare with saving local taxpayers $200 million a year.

"Thanks to the ACA. we are moving toward long-term ?nancial sustainability for the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System." she said in a statement. with 130.000 patients now enrolled in the county's managed
Medicaid program.

But GOP presidential hopeful Rick Santorum. a former senator. voiced a common reaction among
conservatives.

"Today?s ruling by the Supreme Court is yet another reminder that if we are to rid our nation of Obamacare once
and for all, we need to elect a conservative president prepared to lead on day one. As president. I will be
committed to repealing the monstrosity of Obamacare and replacing it with a patient-centered program."

Actually. I agree with Santorum?in part.

Page 81 of 144

 

The court challenges are over. Done. Obamacare is the law, and the courts aren't going to change that.

But I doubt elected politicians will act to radically change it. either. As the number of people in the system rises
well into the millions?end as even some Republicans say they:r want to keep features like a ban on insurers
clinging those with pre-existing conditions?it?s increasingly obvious that this program is not going to be
repealed. Or, I suspect. signi?cantly altered, though some tweaks are needed.

As the Chicagoan who is president put it in the White House this morning. after a century of talk about national
health care and dozens of efforts to repeal the ACA. the act "is here to stay."

12:45 p.111. update? One more piece of reaction. this from Rep. Tammy Duckworth, one of the Democrats
running to oppose Sen. Kirk next year:

"The Supreme Court's decision is a major win for my constituents," she said in a statement. "Members on both
sides of the aisle need to come together to continue building on the gains made through the ABA, ?xing the
parts that need improvement and ensuring that all Americans have access to affordable and quality health
insurance. Endless litigation in the courts and countless votes to repeal the law is a partisan and wasteful
exercise that does not serve the needs of my constituents."

4:15 pm. update? ill give the last word of the day to Schneider. commenting on Dotd's comment.

From a statement: "While Bob Dold talks about bipartisan solutions. his record shows a long history of siding
with all the other Republicans in Congress to repeal. defund, or dismantle Ubamacare more than thirty times?
including three times in the past few months . . . Despite the unrelenting effort of Republicans. including Bob
Dold, to undermine and misrepresent this law. the Supreme Court has yet again af?rmed its legal status."

Minister's wife worries that court ruling could threaten her family's health
insurance

June 25. 2015

By Bob Herman

Kristen Clark remembers the days when buying health insurance used to be not only complex but also prohibitively
expensive. lot of times. it's like paying a second mortgage." she said.

The looming US. Supreme Court ruling threatening to wipe out premium subsidies in up to 37 states could force Clark
and millions of other Americans to experience those days all over again.

Clark. 31. her husband. and their two daughters live in Delaware. Ohio. just north of Columbus. She is a stay-at-home
mom. and her husband is a minister earning a modest income. This year. they bought coverage on Ohio's federal
exchange from lnHeaith Mutual. the state's not~for-profit co-op insurer created under the Affordable Care Act.

Her family is relatively healthy, Clark said. Like most people. she wants health coverage tor her children and to protect
against worst-case scenarios. The plan they bought had all of their doctors in network. They received a subsidy under the
ACA. which cut their premium by about half. to less than $400 per month. ?It helps having a subsidy because we
can afford it a whole lot easier." Clark said.

The Supreme Court is scheduled to issue its decision in King v. Bunvelfthis month. and those premium subsidies are in
danger. The plaintiffs argue that premium tax credits are only available through "an exchange established by the state"
and not through the federally run exchanges. The Obama administration argues that the law read in its entirety makes
clear that subsidies are allowed in all states.

 

SNAPSHOT OF OHIO EXCHANGE PLANS
I Catastrophic: 2.385

Bronze: 62.121

Silver: 101.585

Gold: 20.584

Platinum: 2.192

Total: 1 88.86?

Percent receiving subsidies: 85.3%

Average subsidy: $255

Ohio is one of 3? states using the federal marketplace. It's questionable whether its Republican-controlled government
would be willing to establish a state-run exchange it the Supreme Court kills the subsidies.

A loss of subsidies in these states could throw the entire individual health insurance market into chaos. Premiums for
exchange plans would jump on average across the country. according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. An
estimated 6.4 million people who live in states using the federal marketplace would lose subsidies and most would be
expected to drop coverage because it would no longer be affordable.

Page 83 of 144

 

Clark said she and her family would do whatever they could to keep their insurance. But adding hundreds of dollars to
their bill would be a big burden. ?When you're already living on one income, that would not make it easy to do,"
she said.

Jesse Thomas, CEO of lnHealth Mutual, the plan chosen by Clark and her husband, said about half of his plan's 22,000
members bought plans through the federal exchange. More than 80% of Ohio's exchange enrollees receive premium tax
credits. Overall, Ohio has about 189,000 exchange enrollees, 85% of whom receive subsidized coverage.

Thomas believes his company has iniected a new source of insurance access and competition for Ohioans looking for
health coverage. Now the King case has created major uncertainty for people who want to keep their health plans. "If you
have BID-plus percent that rely on those subsidies, it's going to have an impact," he said.

Many hospital and medical leaders have warned that tossing the subsidies would
plunge the system into chaos. Dr. Jay Shannon, CEO of Cook County Health and
Hospitals System, said charity care at his safety net system in Chicago has dropped
the past two years under the ACA coverage expansion. Without premium subsidies,
charity care would likely bounce back to previous levels. Many people would fall into
the category of being too poor to afford health insurance but not poor enough to be
eligible for Medicaid.

"i can't imagine both at the personal level and at the state level how the Supreme
Court could imagine that working out for the good," Shannon said. ?That's
unbelievably cruel."

Legal experts are split on how the high court will rule. Flenee Lenders, a law professor at Suffolk University and former
deputy general counsel at HHS, predicted a 6-3 victory for the government, but with no majority opinion. Chief Justice
John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy may uphold the subsidies for different legal reasons than the four liberal
justices, she said. That could create additional political uncertainty about the future of the subsidies.

In the just-as-iikely scenario of the subsidies being invalidated, Lenders sees a destructive effect on lower- and middle-
income Americans. don't think the (ACA) is perfect, but I think it has given a lot of people the opportunity to have some
health insurance. which gives them some peace of mind.? she said.

Clark was not aware of the King v. Burweii case until she was interviewed Thursday by Modern Healthcare. She and her
family are in the process of moving. and it hasn?t been a priority for her to keep up with Supreme Court news. Now
knowing what's at stake, she expressed concern. "It would definitely affect us," she said. ?it would add a whole lot more
stress."

3 hDSpital CEOs forecast the King v. Burwell decision, healthcare in 2017
Written by Molly Gamble (Twitter Google+} 

The CEOs of MemorialCare Health System, Ochsner Medical Center and Cook County Health and Hospitals each agreed about the
likely outcome of King v. Burwel], although their perspectives differed about healthcare legislation under a newly elected president in
2017.

As part of the Becker's Hospital Review 6th Annual Meeting in Chicago, Tucker Carlson, moderator and Fox News correspondent,
posed some questions about the outcome ofthe Supreme Court case and what healthcare legislation may come up under a new
president in 2017.

Thoughts on the outcome of?ng v. Burwe?

Dr. Barry Arbuckle: ?l'd be shocked ifthe government lost the case. I think it'll be a 6-3 vote, not even a 5-4. Chieflustice John
Roberts had the opportunity last time to interfere with the ACA, and he didn't. Ifi?m wrong, I think it'll take about 24 hours for states
using the exchange to call up their attorney generals to say they will outsource the exchange."

Robert Wolterman: think [the lawsuit] is irrelevant as well. I think the button's been pushed on the rocket and it's been launched. I
agree with Barry: Regardless ofthat decision. I don't see much of an impact or much ofa change on what is already happening and
how systems have already reacted."

Dr. John Jay Shannon: have to agree. We talked a lot about things not working right, but if you look at the
numbers of 14 million to 18 million more Americans who weren't insured three years ago having insurance
now, while that's not a magic solution it is an absolutely minimal requirement and a step in the right direction. I
don't think the president or HHS administrator is being coy when they say they don't have a plan B. It is
inconceivable to have a plan 

Hopes and onticipotr?ons for healthcare registration in 26?! 17 under a new president

Dr. Barry Arbuekle: was ?abbergasted [legislators] got the SGR taken care of. was amazed. What they didn't touch, which I?m
surprised about, is they should move to site-neutral payments. They could have easily done it to offset some expense of SGR. They
didn't. and I don't know why. That would force care into the right venue at the right price."

Robert Wolterman: "Not paying us for readmissions. There is not one administrator who thinks we should generate additional pro?ts
when we do not take care of patients or get people sick. I think keep pushing us and keep holding us accountable for outcomes. I think
that's the direction the government will continue to evolve in. and it's a hard argument to be against."

Dr. John Jay Shannon: "The wish list would be to see Medicare and Medicaid flex muscles on good
purchasing. The other thing we need to get outside of healthcare delivery. Nutritional options, safety,
education levels, housing those do not fall under traditional areas [of healthcare]. Anything that helps us
partner with housing and other agencies would be very helpful."

King vs. Burwell manifesto: 45 key points

Written by Tamara Rosin (Twitter Google+l 

The verdict on Supreme Court case King 12. Burweii is expected by the end ofJune. The case will determine the legality ofa
fundamental aspect of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and a ruling in favor of the plaintiff would have profound or

what many cell disastrous effects on millions of American's ability to pay for health insurance. The outcome ofthe case could
potentially unravel the PPACA altogether.

Here are 45 things to know about the case.
Background

l. Plaintiff'Davicl King is one of four individuals behind the challenge. The other three are Douglas Hurst. Brenda Levy and Rose
Luck. The four live in Virginia. which did not set up its own exchange. Although they are not the only people to challenge the PPACA
many people in similar situations in other states did the same the Supreme Court decided to take their case.

 

2. King challengers argue the IRS regulation that allows subsidies to be provided to people within a certain income bracket in all states
through the federal insurance marketplace HealthCaregov is illegal because the language ofthe law stipulates only states that set up
their own insurance exchanges can offer subsidies.

3. The Obama administration contends the language of the law clearly states subsidies are available through all exchanges. regardless
of whether they are federal or state~run, and that the challenge is politically motivated.

4. in early November 2014. the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear King lawsuit and arguments took place in early March.
Who is David King?

5. David King is a 64-year old Vietnam War veteran. resident of Fredericksburg. Va. who works as a limo driver earning an annual
income of 339.000. according to the Business Times.

 

6. Mr. King didn't want to buy health insurance. and ifhe weren?t eligible for the subsidies which require compliance with the
individual mandate he would be exempt from the requirement. Mr. King told Politico insurance would be "unaffordable" to him
under the health law ifnot for the subsidies.

7. Mr. King and his fellow plaintiffs ?led the lawsuit based on what they argue was a misinterpretation of four words in the law:
"established by the State.? The plaintiffs' suit argued this wording means subsidies were only allowed for people purchasing healthcare
on state-run exchanges, according to the international Business Times.

8. Mr. King's lawsuit was one of four similar cases challenging the tax subsidies in Obamacare. All were ?led in 20l3.
What is at stake ifthe Supreme Court strikes the federal subsidies?

9. lfthe Supreme Court rules in favor of King, PPACA subsidies for 6.4 million people in 34 states using the federal marketplace
would be eliminated.

Ill. The it) states with the most people currently receiving premium tax credits are on the federal exchange. These include:

 

1. Florida 1.32 million people

Page 86 of 144

 

Texas 332,334 people

North Carolina 458,738 people
Georgia 412,335 people
348,323 people
Virginia 285,938 people

Illinois 232,371 people
Michigan 228,333 people

. Missouri 1913553 people

19. New Jersey 122,345 people

manometer?

1 I. A ruling in favor ofthc plaintiffwould mean there would be approximately 8.2 million more uninsured people. according to a
February from the Urban Institute. The 8.2 million estimation includes the roughly 6.4 million people who would be losing tax
credits for marketplace coverage, 1.2 million people purchasing non-group coverage without tax credits and 445.001} enrolled in
Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program.

12. Under current implementation of the law, the Urban Institute estimated billion would be spent in 2016 on healthcare for
individuals who receive subsidies for coverage. Ifthe subsidies are eliminated, the newly uninsured would spend $5.3 billion on their
medical care directly, and $12 billion in uncompensated care would potentially be provided for them if historic rates of
uncompensated care persist. In total, healthcare spending for this population would drop 35 percent ??orn billion to 3 I713 billion
ifthe Supreme Court sides with the plaintiff.

13. 1f the Supreme Court strikes the subsidies, nonpro?t hospitals Would see signi?cant their credit. according to Moody?s
Investor's Service. Such a ruling would cause the uninsured rate in the 34 states without their own exchanges to increase, which would
lead to higher rates of uncompensated care. the report said.

 

14. Hospitals in states that have not expanded Medicaid would be hit hardest by the an elimination of subsidies. "To date. hospitals in
these states have experienced small improvements in payer mix through a reduction in exposure to self-pay." according to Moody?s. 1f
the subsidies are blocked by the Supreme Court, hospitals in these states "will lose the small payer mix gains, while continuing to
absorb [ACA-related] reimbursement cuts.? according to Moody's.

The Obama administration does not have a backup plan

15. HHS Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell sent a to Congress in February stating the Dbama administration does not have a
contingency plan ifthe Supreme Court rules in favor ofit'ing. "We know of no administrative actions that could, and therefore we have
no plans that would. undo the massive damage to our healthcare system that would be caused by an adverse decision," Ms. Burwell
wrote, according to The Hill.

16. White House spokesman Josh Earnest there is "no easy if the subsidies are eliminated, "particularly when you consider
how dif?cult it has been for common?sense pieces oflegislation to move through the Congress," according to The Hill.

17. Ifthc plaintiffs succeed, Democrats in Congress will likely try to pass a one-page bill to amend the law?s text to ?x the ambiguities
that initiated the case. However, Mr. Earnest's comments suggest the White House is not con?dent this would work, according to The
Hill. At the same time, House and Senate Republicans both have commissioned groups to work on drafting response plans.

18. President Obama called King v. Harwell an "easy case" and said "it's important for us to go ahead and assume that the Supreme
Court is going to do what most legal scholars who've looked at this would expect them to do." He also said the high court "probably
shouldn't even taken up [the easel," in response to a reporter's question following the G7 Summit in Krun. Germany.

19. When the reporter asked him why he doesn?t have a plan B. the president answered, "Well, you know, 1 want tojust make sure that
everybody understands that you have a model where all the pieces connect. And there are a whole bunch of scenarios notjust in
relation to healthcare, but all kinds of stuff that I do, where if somebody does something that doesn?t make any sense, then it's hard to
And this would be hard to fix. Fortunately, there's no reason to have to do it. It doesn't need ?xing. All right?"

20. Although the White House has not taken action to prepare for a loss in court, many physicians have begun devising their own
backup plans ifthe subsidies are lost and their patients lose healthcare coverage. These plans include sending patients to Free clinics,
negotiating with pharmaceutical companies for discounted drugs, stocking up on free drug samples. encouraging patients to ?nd out if
they are eligible for Medicaid or other insurance programs and scheduling primary care appointments and procedures while patients
still have insurance.

Legal experts' and leading health system forecasts

21. Amy E. Sanders, an associate with the law firm of Bass. Berry 3: Sims. believes the decision could go either way. "It?s a really
close case." she Becker's Hospital Review."Both sides have very strong arguments. While she suggests the federal government
might be more likely to win. the plaintiffs have a compelling argument. Ms. Sanders said there are a lot of conflicts and ambiguity in
the subsidies and exchange provisions throughout the PPACA. Overall. she believes King v. Barwell is not a constitutional law case
but a question of how the PPACA was interpreted.

22. Paul H. Keckley, managing director in the Navigant Healthcare practice, told Becker-{r Hospital Review he believes the Supreme
Court will rule against the plaintiffs. "i think the intent ofthe law will prevail rather than the letter ofthe law." he said. Mr. Keckley
believes the fact that the IRS acting as the agent ofthe government and concluding that the subsidies were accessible to both
HealthCaregov and state exchange enrollees is what will drive the high court's decision. He projects a 6-3 ruling.

23. Joel Ario. managing director of Manatt Health Solutions and prior Director of the Of?ce of Health Inaurance Exchanges at HHS.
thinks the case hinges on whether the justices take external factors into account. such as the possibility of disrupting the marketplace
and making health insurance unaffordable for millions of Americans.

Alter arguments. he said the case is looking more promising for the government. The reason for this: Justice Anthony Kennedy's
concern about the consequences of the vote in the marketplace. "If he's paying attention to the consequences of the case in the
marketplace. [Justice Kennedy] will decide for the government." Mr. Arie said. However. he added. "It may be the plain language
dictates the result. and [Justice Kennedy] will feel he doesn't have the ability to pay attention to the consequences."

24. Barry Arbuckle. president and CEO of MemorialCare Health System in Long Beach. Calif. ml. "I'd be shocked ifthe
government lost the case. i think it'll be a 6-3 vote. not even a 5-4. ChiefJustice John Roberts had the opportunity last time to interfere
with the ACA. and he didn't. lfI'm wrong. I think it'll take about 24 hours for states using the exchange to call up their attorney
generals to say they will outsource the exchange."

25. Robert Wolterman. CEO of Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans. agreed with Dr. Arbuckle. think [the lawsuit] is irrelevant
as well. I think the button's been pushed on the rocket and it's been launched. I agree with Ban-y: Regardless ofthat decision. I don't
see much of an impact or much of a change on what is already happening and how systems have already reacted."

26. On a similar note, John Jay Shannon, MD. CEO of Cook County Health Hospitals in Chicago, said, 
have to agree. We talked a lot about things not working right, but if you look at the numbers of14 million to 18
million more Americans who weren't insured three years ago having insurance now. while that's not a magic
solution it is an absolutely minimal requirement and a step in the right direction. I don't think the president or
HHS administrator is being coy when they say they don't have a plan B. It is inconceivable to have a plan 

The Supreme Court Justices' different views on the case

27. Thejustices presiding over King v. Brim-ell are deeply divided on the matter. After nearly an hour and a halfof oral arguments in
the hearing March 4. Justices Elena Kagan. Sonia Sotomayor. Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg "all seemed like solid votes
for the federal government. defending the subsidies." while challengers "could clearly count on votes" from Justices Antonin Scalia
and Samuel Alito. according to live coverage of the arguments from SCOTU Sb log.

 

28. Shortly after the hearing. Justice Anthony Kennedy has said he sees "a serious constitutional problem" in the idea that Congress
would force states to set up exchanges or run the risk oftheir residents losing tax credits. According to [We coverage. during opening
arguments for both the plaintiffs and the government. key focus in both portions continued to he Justice Kennedy. who at multiple
times raised concerns about the constitutional consequences if the challengers' reading of the prevails." according

to the l-l'hll Elr'eel Journal.

29. During the hearing. the plaintiffs? lead attorney "barely got a dozen words out" before Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg interrupted him
to ask about the plaintiffs' standing and their ability to show they had been harmed by the subsidies. Liberaljustices continued to
dominate the questioning in the ?rst 20 minutes, according to 

30. Justices Alito and Scalia seemed to acknowledge the calamitous consequences that would result follow a ruling against the states.
by suggesting ways to alleviate it. Justice Alito reportedly said the high court could put off its ruling to allow time to adjust. and
Justice Scalia reportedly said Congress would take action and ?x it. according to the blog

i I. Chief Justice John Roberts asked some questions but did not convey a clear indication of which side he was leaning toward.
Justice Anthony Kennedy indicated through his questions that he was leaning more toward the government.

The American public largely supports subsidies offered in all states

32. A Inajoritv of the American public 56 percent wants the Supreme Court to uphold the subsidies, while 39 percent want
subsidies reserved for individual state marketplaces. according to an Associated Press-Gt?K poll. If the court strikes the subsidies, 5 
percent of total poll respondents want Congress to amend the PPACA to allow subsidies in all states, while 44 percent want the
subsidies to only be available in states with their own insurance marketplaces.

33. Two-thirds of Democrats want the government to continue offering subsidies in all states, compared to 31 percent of Republicans,
according to the poll.

34. Survey respondents indicated the public does not have much faith in the Supreme Court on this issue. with 48 percent of total poll
respondents indicating they are not con?dent the court will determine a ruling based on ?objective interpretations of the law?1 over
their personal opinions on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as a whole. Fewer 39 percent said they are moderately
con?dent the justices can disregard personal beliefs. and just ID percent are very or extremely confident they can

Other healthcare organizations' stance on the issue

35. Some of the healthcare industry's major organizations submitted ??iend-of?the-court briefs in King v. Bur-well. In January, the
American Hospital Association, the Federation of American Hospitals. the Association of American Medical Colleges and America?s
Essential Hospitals argued in a brief that removing subsidies to residents of states without their own exchanges "would be a disaster
for millions of lower- and middle-income Americans."

36. Trinity Health also submitted a brief. The Livonia. Mich-based system supports subsidies in all states. Ifthe court decides to
withdraw the subsidies, Trinity Health said it wants the court to delay the implementation until the end ofthe plan year, according to
the system?s friend?of-the-court brief. That would give Congress an opportunity to amend the law if necessary.

37. Nashville, Tenn-based Hospital Corporation of America also supports subsidies in all states. HCA made national headlines

after areuinu= in its brief that the petitioners' legal theory in the case would lead to "absurd consequences." The hospital operator
pointed out that since receiving subsidies. many exchange patients are relying on care administered in emergency departments less and
seeking care in outpatient settings more than the uninsured population. It suggests this proVes "care is being provided in more
appropriate and cost-effective settings."

38. America's Health InSurance Plans. the chieflobby for the insurance industry, argued in its briefthat eliminating the subsidies in
states using the federal exchange "would leave consumers in those states with a more unstable market and far higher costs than ifthe
PPACA had not been enacted." according to The l-i?m?l Street Jom'nol.

39. Additionally, deans and more than 30 faculty members from schools of public health and public health programs across the
nation submitted a brief that looked at the case from a patient care angle. They argued eliminating the subsidies would "put millions of
people at risk for illness and death that could have been prevented or managed with the appropriate medical care."

Other healtheare leaders are attempting to create a back-up plan

40. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (lit-Ky.) said congressional Republicans will have a backup plan ifthe Supreme Court
strikes the subsidies, but declined to discuss the details until a decision is reached. "We'll have a plan that makes sense for the
American people." Sen. McConnell said during an interview with The Joe Elliott Show June 8. "lfthe plaintiffis successful it will
require some addressing ofthe issue. and ifthat were to happen we'll be ready to announce our proposal." He added that the PFACA is
"a terrible law. but we are where we are."

41. At the annual National Governors Association meeting in Washington, D.C.. in February, the fate of the healthcare subsidies was a
major topic ofdiscussion. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D). chairman ofthe NGA, told Bloomberg there is a lot of uncertainty
regarding the alternatives if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the plaintiff. He said governors were exploring whether states that
have established their own exchanges could cover residents of states that did not.

42. Insurance and health officials from about I6 or states gathered in Chicago in early May for a private 24-hour meeting to further
discuss options ifthe Supreme Court eliminates the subsidies.

Page 89 of 144

43. Insurance and health representatives it is unlikely most of the states using HealthCaregov could set up their own exchanges
quickly enough to maintain their residents' tax credits. participants of the meeting told The Wall Street Journal. Although some
officials talked about potential solutions, such as leasing an exchange From the federal government or a state that has one. they believe
the obstacles could be too complex to be successful.

44. Additionally, participants in the private meeting in May indicated little con?dence that their respective state governors. legislatures
and insurance commissioners would all agree to establish an exchange ifthe Supreme Court rules in favor of King. and they
questioned how they could accomplish this before the subsidies would disappear, according to the report.

45. Kevin Counihan. CEO of HealthCaregov. said states would not be able to immediately create their own insurance marketplaces if
the Sapreme Court rules in favor of the plaintiff. Creating a health insurance exchange is a "very, very complex activity" that cannot
be completed in a few months. and exchanges created this summer would certainly not be ready for the next enrollment period
beginning in November. Mr. Counihan said during a day-long pane] for health insurance exchange representatives in early May.

 National Trends in Behavioral Health
Importance of Mental Health. Untreated depression and other serious mental illness have both a negative financial and 
health impact; early identification and access to treatment for these disorders can lead to improved outcomes.
Integration. Health systems and communities are realizing an integrated behavioral health strategy is essential to 
achieving the Triple Aim (improving patient experience of care, improving the

populations and reducing cost).

)
Behavioral health care is becoming more accessible and connected to the broader health care system 
Health Disparities. Other factors such as race/ethnicity, income level, geographic location, and insurance status are key 
determinants of disparities in both physical and behavioral health across populations and specifically within the 
populations served by CCHHS. Amid the focus on the health disparities of adults and youth with behavioral health 
di d
disorders, state and federal policy makers have paid particular attention to quality and coordination of care.

Managed Care. Reimbursement to and by managed care organizations is incentivizing, using bonus payments or sharing 
savings across providers, attention to the holistic health care needs of individuals through improved care coordination 
across primary care, behavioral health, and other specialty providers.
Diversion. As community‐based mental health services have been challenged to meet the service needs, many believe 
law enforcement departments and jails have become de facto service providers to persons with behavioral health 
disorders. Jail diversion programs have emerged as a viable alternative to the criminalization and inappropriate criminal 
detention of individuals with mental health and substance use disorders. In addition, several models for addressing re‐
entry into the community following incarceration have been found helpful in reducing recidivism for these individuals.

 Specific Recommendations for
Developing and Expanding Integrated
Care
1.

Conduct a Provider Function Assessment—Examine the functions that are currently being provided on care teams across providers. 
In addition identify the additional functions that CCHHS desires in an integrated care model (e.g., screening, registry tracking, health 
promotion, brief intervention, psychiatry consult). 

2.

Re‐align Provider Time—Establish re‐alignment of provider time to maximize providers practicing at the top of their license. 

3.

Brief Intervention— Reorient social work staff and psychologists to provide brief intervention rather than traditional 40‐60 minute 
therapy, to spread resources across a far larger population and implement issue/problem specific behavioral change. 

4.

Re‐vamp SBIRT—Provide SBIRT with fidelity to the model and train a broader group of staff in the model, facilitating expanded 
services to a broader population, enabling SBIRT team members to be the referral source for individuals needing specialty services. 

5.

Workforce and Training—Evaluate workforce readiness, provider preferences, and training as provider functions are re‐aligned. 
Commit resources to address needs will be critical to success. 

6.

Reimbursement— Actively pursue improved billing process for many of the services outlined for the PCMH care manager can be 
reimbursed as well as other services that behavioral health providers will perform in the stepped care model,. 

7.

Emergency Department Services‐Crisis Intervention— Address concerns regarding the current arrangements for behavioral health 
services in the ED (use of multiple different resources and processes to meet patient mental health and SUD needs and lack of 
psychiatry oversight and access to the full record for consults performed by Thresholds) and integrate behavioral health services

Summary
and
d Next
N t St
Steps
National, state, and local environmental factors have led to a gap in needed mental health and 
substance use disorder services for residents in Cook County leading to high utilization of emergency
substance use disorder services for residents in Cook County, leading to high utilization of emergency 
and inpatient services, contributing to increased costs and less than desired health outcomes. 
Recognizing the need for more access to behavioral health services combined with CCHHS’s role as a 
safety net provider for Cook County, it is essential for the system to expand its integration of 
b h i lh l h
behavioral health services and develop access to needed specialty services for individuals with 
i
dd l
d d
i l
i
f i di id l i h
chronic and persistent mental illness and emerging or existing substance use disorders.
Successful achievement of this goal will result in improved outcomes for patients and reduced costs 
to both CCHHS and the Cook County Jail. This initiative will not be without its challenges. However 
y
g
CCHHS also brings strengths through existing resources and partnerships to support success.
This strategic initiative will require a multi‐year commitment, including dedicated staff and facility 
resources.
