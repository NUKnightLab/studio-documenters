PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
REQUIRING A TWO THIRDS MAJORITY VOTE OF THE BOARD TO ENACT ANY NEW

order to protect them from controversial votes being used to raise or create new taxes without broad
public support, and
WHEREAS, the burden of new and increased taxes that falls on the shoulders of Cook County residents

should not be left to a simple majority vote, and
