 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
November 5, 2009
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on October 1, at 2:00 p.m. The meeting was held at
33 N. LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

Ben Weese

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

2800 N. Milwaukee
(Milwaukee-Diversey-Kimball Avenue District – 35th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed conversion of a 6-story masonry commercial building to include
ground- floor retail, a 2nd-floor community arts center, and 28 upper-floor
affordable residential units. The project includes new ground- floor
storefronts and other exterior alterations; refacing existing signage; and
additions of a 7-story masonry stair tower, a 2-story masonry retail
addition along Milwaukee Avenue, and a 1-story masonry retail addition
along Diversey Avenue

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
Historic Building Rehabilitation:
1. Based on a historic rendering, a historic photograph, and the physical
evidence of the original storefront configuration, the proposed groundfloor storefronts and sign band, including the ground- floor corner
storefront display window, is approved as proposed;
2. Existing and proposed window details and storefront details shall be
included in the permit plans for Historic Preservation staff review and
approval. Replacement samples of the decorative spandrels, cast stone
pier caps at the parapet, limestone units, and mortar shall be reviewed
and approved by Historic Preservation staff prior to order and
installation. The mortar color, profile and composition shall match the

 historic condition. The paint removal and/or cleaning product
specifications shall be reviewed and approved by Historic Preservation
staff;
3. The large existing projecting sign along Milwaukee is proposed to be
retained and refaced for signage for the second- floor community arts
center, and a new small projecting sign, matching the size of the
current ground-floor projecting sign, is to be located near the new
Payless tenant retail entrance. All signage details includ ing final color
scheme, attachment details, sizes, lighting and material descriptions
shall be reviewed and approved by Historic Preservation staff. The
large projecting sign to remain must be retained and refurbished in
place, and no additional projecting signs on the historic building will
be allowed in the future;
New Additions:
4. The colors of the masonry cladding of the new 7-story rear stair tower
shall be two closer tones of beige, rather than the stark contrast of the
proposed dark brown and light beige, so that the addition is as visually
neutral and simple as possible. A sample of the ground- face masonry
units shall be reviewed and approved by Historic Preservation staff;
5. The proposed mechanical louvers for 2814 N. Milwaukee shall be
recessed behind a decorative grill to improve their appearance and
reduce their visibility from the street;
6. A full building section of the street- facing facades for the two new
additions shall be included in permit plans for review and approval of
Historic Preservation staff. The articulation and depth of the reveals of
the piers, recessed spandrels and window/storefront systems are all
important aspects of the designs in order to achieve design
compatibility in context with the historic building; and,
Demolition:
7. As part of the demolition permit application for the two existing
buildings at 3418 W. Diversey and 2814 N. Milwaukee adjacent the
historic building, an engineer’s report shall be submitted to Historic
Preservation staff for review and approval to address any protection
and stabilization measures that may be necessary to protect the
landmark building. The report should also address the demolition
contractor’s proposed sequencing and any impact from the proposed
geothermal drilling.

2.

11270 S. Champlain
(Pullman District – 9th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed construction of a new two-car, wood- frame garage at the rear of
a corner lot

 Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The garage may be clad with either wood clapboard sid ing or smoothfinish fiber-cement siding. The siding shall incorporate vertical end
boards at the corners of the building and wide-board trim around the
garage door and service door;
2. Should the owner decide to use wood siding, the Committee
recommends tha t the owner paint the garage the historic Pullman
colors. Should fiber-cement siding be used, the siding is
recommended to be painted the historic Pullman colors or the color of
the siding shall match the historic Pullman colors as closely as
currently available, to be reviewed and approved by Historic
Preservation staff;
3. Specification sheets or catalog cut sheets for the paneled garage door
and service door shall be submitted to Historic Preservation staff for
review and approval prior to order and installation; and,
4. The Committee recommends that the applicant relocate or consider
installing a window on the south façade to add some visual interest to
the wall from the street.

3.

1103 N. Hoyne
(Ukrainian Village District – 32nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed determination of whether a two-story, masonry, rear accessory
building would be considered contributing or non-contributing to the
landmark district

Action:

The Committee unanimously found preliminarily that the 2-story masonry
rear accessory structure at 1103 N. Hoyne is a non-contributing building to
the Ukrainian Village District due to major alterations and lack of historic
integrity. Changes include removal of the front façade face brick; infill of
window openings on the west and east elevations; changes in windows
openings (arched brick lintels modified to flat steel lintels) on the secondstory of the west elevation; major reconstruction of the parapets on all
elevations, as well as possibly major changes to the roof; major
reconstruction of the south elevation, including installation of a new
garage door; and a lack of any historic ornamental features.
This preliminary determination relates only to the non-contributing status
of the rear accessory structure. Any future proposal for this property will
require Committee review and approval.

 4.

6718 S. Constance
(Jackson Park Highlands District – 5th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed replacement of clay-tile roof with asphalt shingle roofing

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed, the existing clay-tile roof may be replaced with
“Victorian Red Slateline Shingles” by GAF. A permit shall be
obtained for the roof replacement; and,
2. Any repair or replacement of the exposed rafter tails and soffit shall be
in kind, matching the material, sizes and details of the existing.
Details of work to the dormers, soffit and exposed rafter tails shall be
included with the permit application.

5.

1646 N. Leavitt
(Wicker Park District – 1st Ward)
Proposal:

Violation: Revisions to approved one-story rooftop addition, including
increase in height rooftop addition from previously approved and north
and south parapets. Rooftop addition built contrary to approved permit

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. Penthouse and Parapet Modifications:
i.
As proposed, the applicant shall reduce the height of the rooftop
addition to no taller than 9’-2” in height as measured from the roof
deck (37’-6” above grade) except that the portion of the addition
housing the elevator and mechanical space may be no taller than
10’-7” above the roof deck (38’-11” above grade);
ii.
As proposed, the north and south parapets may be increased in
height by a maximum of 2’-10” at the lowest end (32’-6” above
grade), gradually tapering off to the original height at the east
(front) as shown on the drawings, resulting in a “level” parapet.
New brick shall match the size, color, and appearance of existing
common brick and any new mortar shall match the color, type,
finish and joint size and profile of the historic mortar. A brick
sample shall be submitted for Historic Preservation staff review
and approval prior to order and installation;
C. After completion, the applicant shall provide a surveyor’s report
verifying that the penthouse and parapet modifications have been
constructed in accordance with the maximum allowed heights
indicated on the permit plans and a letter of certification of same
from the applicant; and,

 2. As submitted, railings shall be constructed only around the “apron”
area west of the penthouse and shall not be visible from the public
right-of-way. As proposed, the remaining portion of the roof is to
have no other railings and the existing construction railings shall be
removed.
6.

633 W. Belden
(Mid-North District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Violation: Revisions to one-story roof-top addition and related alterations
built contrary to approved permit (Continued Review)

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The roof-top addition may retain its existing location and footprint of
12’-10” wide by 17’-9” long by 10’-0” tall, further provided that the
roof of the stair enclosure shall be sloped, as proposed, to minimize
visibility (new front knee wall height of maximum 4’-10”, with roof
slope shown);
2. As proposed, the east parapet wall shall be reduced back to the original
height between the chimney and the front façade, to align with the top
of the front cornice;
3. As proposed, the railing mounted to the top of the front cornice and the
planted evergreens shall be set back from the front façade a minimum
of approximately 7’ to align with the leading edge of the existing
chimney;
4. The existing gutter and downspout installed between the chimney and
the front façade along the east parapet wall shall be eliminated; or
relocated further back along the east wall; and,
5. A project schedule, subject to Historic Preservation staff review and
acceptance, outlining the timeframe to remedy the violations shall be
submitted to staff no later than November 30, 2009. The schedule
shall include the following dates: permit application submittal, permit
issuance, start of construction, and date of completion.
Regardless, the remedied work should be completed within no more
than a 6-9 month time frame. Please note that failure to remedy
violations under the building code and landmarks ordinance may be
subject to fines assessed on a daily basis for the period that the
violations have existed.
