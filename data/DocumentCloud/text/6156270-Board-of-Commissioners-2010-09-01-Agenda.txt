(c)
Minority and women's businesses have contributed significantly to the economic
development of the community, and played a similar role in increasing employment, including that of
minorities.
(d)
Various Federal, State and local legislative bodies and governmental agencies have
adopted affirmative action programs in order to eradicate the practice of racial, ethnic and sexual
discrimination in the award of public contracts.
(e)
The County has heretofore adopted a Minority Business Enterprise Ordinance to ensure
that minority and women's businesses are provided full and equal opportunity to participate in County
contracts.
(f)
The Supreme Court of the United States in City of Richmond v. Croson, 488 U.S. 469
(1989), has enunciated certain standards which are necessary to maintain effective affirmative action
programs in compliance with constitutional requirements.
(g)
The County is committed to implementing its affirmative action program in conformance
with the United States Supreme Court's decision in City of Richmond v. Croson.
(h)
In furtherance of this commitment, the Cook County Board directed the County staff and
its outside consultants to conduct an investigation into the scope of any discrimination in the award of and
participation in County contracts as well as in the metropolitan Chicago economy, the extent to which
such discrimination or the effects thereof has denied and continues to deny minority and women's
business enterprises equal opportunity to participate in County contracts and to recommend the
appropriate affirmative action steps to be taken to eliminate any such discrimination and its continuing
effects.
(i)
Pursuant to the County Board's direction, the County staff and its outside consultants

consultants and having conducted public hearings and received the testimony of witnesses, makes the

(1)

Minority and women's businesses continue to be awarded prime contracts and
subcontracts in dollar amounts that are disproportionately lower than the availability of
such businesses willing and able to perform County contracts.

(2)

The County's procurement practices in the past have contributed to the above identified
underutilization of minority and women's businesses on County contracts.

ITEM #7 cont’d
(3)

Minority and women's businesses continue to be disadvantaged by discriminatory
practices in the local construction industry and economy when competing for County
contracts and in seeking subcontracting opportunities on such contracts.

(4)

The County was a passive participant in the discriminatory practices of businesses which
discriminate against minority and women's businesses by entering into contracts with
such businesses.

(5)

Despite its good faith efforts and implementation of previous affirmative action
programs, minority and women's businesses remain at a competitive disadvantage in
competing for County contracts and subcontracts.

(6)

Race and gender neutral measures or affirmative action programs without numerical
goals have not and are not likely to eliminate the competitive disadvantage of minority
and women's businesses in participating in County contracts due to discrimination in the
local economy.

(7)

The numerical goals for the participation of minority and women's businesses in County
contracts are commensurate with the availability of minority and women's businesses
willing and able to perform County work.

Sec. 34-28177. Implementation.
(a)

Contract goals.

(1)

To achieve the goals stated in Section 34-280, the Purchasing Agent, except as provided
in Subsection (a)(2) of this section, shall include in the bid specifications a requirement
that each contractor commit that Minority Business Enterprise and Women's Business
Enterprise participation in the contract will equal at least 25 percent (30 percent in the
case of construction contracts) and ten percent, respectively, of the total dollar value of
the contract.

(2)

The Contract Compliance Administrator shall evaluate the applicability of the Minority
Business Enterprise and Women's Business Enterprise goals to a specific contract. Where
the Contract Compliance Administrator, in consultation with the Purchasing Agent and
the user Departments, determines that the established goals are not appropriate for a
specific contract because of its particular requirements, the Contract Compliance
Administrator shall set an appropriate goal for the contract, based upon the availability of
Protected Class Enterprises which are capable of providing the goods and/or services
required by the particular contract, the past level of Protected Class Enterprise
participation in similar contracts, the specifications of the contract and any other criteria
adopted by the Contract Compliance Administrator.

(3)

The applicable goals for a specific contract shall be designated in the contract
specifications.

(b)

Contractor responsibility and requirements.

(1)

As a precondition to selection, each contractor shall submit with its bid a completed and
signed utilization plan which lists the names, addresses and contact persons of businesses
intended to be used as Protected Class Enterprises on the contract, the type and scope of
work or service each business will perform and the dollar amount to be allocated to each
Protected Class Enterprise. Such listing shall not be duplicative (e.g., two or more entities
each listed as performing 100 percent of the same work or service). Within three business
days following submission of bids, a bidder shall submit its letters of intent to Protected
Class Enterprises listed on its utilization plan, provided that no substitutions shall be
permitted prior to bid award. Each contractor's utilization plan shall commit to Protected
Class Enterprise participation equal to or greater than each of the applicable Protected
Class Enterprise goals, unless the contractor requests a partial or total waiver of the
requirement that it file a utilization plan or achieve a particular goal for Protected Class
Enterprise participation by submitting with the filing of its bid a signed waiver request
form.

Notwithstanding its compliance with any other requirement of County ordinances and
contract specifications, no bidder or offer or shall be awarded an eligible contract unless
the Contract Compliance Administrator has approved its utilization plan or granted a
waiver on the contract. Such utilization plan shall be designed to meet the applicable
Minority Business Enterprise and Women's Business Enterprise goals set for such project
and shall be incorporated into the contract.

(3)

A contractor may achieve the applicable Protected Class Enterprise goals by its status as
a Protected Class Enterprise or by joint venture with one or more Protected Class
Enterprises or by subcontracting a portion of the work to one or more Protected Class
Enterprises or by purchase of materials or services from one or more Protected Class
Enterprises or by the indirect participation of Protected Class Enterprises in other aspects
of the contractor's business such as through a Mentor/Protege agreement as provided
herein (in accordance with applicable guidelines and provided that such Protected Class
Enterprise indirect participation may not be credited toward goal attainment on more than
one contract subject to this article) or by any combination of the above, subject to the
following guidelines:
a.

Joint ventures. Where a contractor engages in a joint venture to satisfy its
affirmative action commitment, the Contract Compliance Administrator shall
review the profits and losses, initial capital investment, actual participation of the
joint venture partners in the performance of the contract, and other pertinent
factors to determine the amount of credit to be granted for the joint venture
toward attainment of the applicable Minority Business Enterprise and Women's
Business Enterprise goals. The Contract Compliance Administrator may review
all records pertaining to joint venture agreements before or after the award of a
contract in order to assess compliance with this article. A contractor shall receive
credit towards achievement of the applicable goals in proportion to the
percentage of the contract to be performed by the Protected Class Enterprise,
provided that the Contract Compliance Administrator may deny or limit
Protected Class Enterprise credit to a contractor where the Protected Class
Enterprise joint venture partner is found not to be performing a commercially
useful function or not to have duties, responsibilities, management control or risk
with respect to the joint venture commensurate with or in proportion to its joint
venture ownership.

ITEM #7 cont’d
b.

Subcontracts. A contractor may count toward its Protected Class Enterprise goals
only expenditures to Protected Class Enterprises that perform a commercially
useful function in the performance of a contract for work actually performed or
materials supplied by the Protected Class Enterprise. To determine whether a
Protected Class Enterprise is performing a commercially useful function, the
Contract Compliance Administrator may evaluate the amount of work
subcontracted, industry practices, whether the Protected Class Enterprise has the
skill and experience to perform the work for which it is being utilized and other
relevant factors. Consistent with normal industry practices, a Protected Class
Enterprise subcontractor may enter into second tier subcontracts. However, if a
Protected Class Enterprise contractor or subcontractor subcontracts a
significantly greater portion of the work of the contract than would be expected
on the basis of normal industry practices, the Minority Business Enterprise or
Women's Business Enterprise shall be presumed not to be performing a
commercially useful function.

c.

Manufacturers and suppliers. Where a contractor utilizes one or more suppliers
to achieve its Protected Class Enterprise goals, such Protected Class Enterprise
supplier participation may be 100 percent credited toward goal attainment where
the Protected Class Enterprise supplier manufactures the goods supplied or where
such Protected Class Enterprise supplier owns or operates a store, warehouse or
other establishment (and related distribution equipment) in which it maintains,
consistent with industry standards, an inventory of the materials or supplies
required for performance of the contract for sale in the normal course of business.
The participation of a Protected Class Enterprise supplier who acts as a broker
(i.e., who performs no manufacturing or warehousing) shall be credited toward
the applicable Protected Class Enterprise goals at a rate equal to ten percent of
the payments to such Protected Class Enterprise broker.

d.

Protected Class Enterprise prime contractors or joint venturers. A Minority
Business Enterprise or Women's Business Enterprise contractor may count its
own participation toward the achievement of the applicable Minority Business
Enterprise or Women's Business Enterprise goal, respectively, but such a
contractor will be required to meet all other applicable goals by joint ventures,
subcontracting or purchase of materials or services. Where a contractor is a
business owned and controlled by minority women ("M/WBE") or where the
contractor utilizes a M/WBE in a joint venture, as a subcontractor or a supplier,
the contractor may count the M/WBE participation either toward the achievement
of its Minority Business Enterprise or Women's Business Enterprise goal but not
both.

e.

Mentor/protege agreements. Where a contractor enters into a written agreement
("mentor/protege" agreement) with a Protected Class Enterprise to improve or
develop certain aspects of the business of the Protected Class Enterprise, such an
agreement may be evaluated by the Contract Compliance Administrator to assess
appropriate credit toward the Protected Class Enterprise goals of the contractor.
The contractor and Protected Class Enterprise shall remain separate and
independent business entities under the agreement. The mentor/protege
agreement may provide for the contractor to assist the Protected Class Enterprise
in such areas as technical aspects of its business, improving financial
management, or providing on-the-job training. No such credit shall be available
unless:
1.

The Protected Class Enterprise provides a commercially useful function
in the performance of its agreement with the contractor;

2.

The agreement is in writing and is submitted to the Contract Compliance
Administrator before the award of the contract; and

3.

The agreement clearly defines the respective responsibilities of the
contractor and the Protected Class Enterprise and includes specific,
measurable goals to be attained by both parties through the performance
of the agreement. Upon recommendation by the Contract Compliance
Administrator, the Contract Compliance Committee shall determine the
amount of credit to be counted toward the applicable goals of this
division. The Contract Compliance Administrator shall require the
contractor to submit periodic reports summarizing the progress of the
execution of the mentor/protege agreement, and shall notify both parties
of any deficiencies in performance. In order to qualify for credit, the
mentor/protege agreement must coincide in duration with, or not be for a
shorter length of time than, the contract between the contractor and the
County.

(4)

Where a contractor seeks relief from all or part of a contract's goals, the contractor shall
submit with its bid a proposal or request for a waiver.

(5)

A contractor's submission of a utilization plan which commits to a Protected Class
Enterprise participation goal equal to or greater than the applicable goals shall not
provide a basis for a higher bid, an increase in contract price or later change order.

The Contract Compliance Administrator shall review each bid or offer to determine if the
contractor has included in its submission a completed and signed utilization plan which
meets the Protected Class Enterprise goals for the contract, and approve or reject the plan.

(2)

The Purchasing Agent, at the direction of the Contract Compliance Administrator, shall
declare the bid or offer nonresponsive where the Contract Compliance Administrator
determines that a contractor:

(3)

a.

Failed to submit with its bid a completed utilization plan;

b.

Failed to identify in its plan sufficient Minority Business Enterprises and/or
Women's Business Enterprises by name, scope of work and dollar value of work

meet the applicable Protected Class Enterprise goals and whether a total or partial waiver
of a goal should be granted. Good faith efforts, as defined herein, shall include, but are
not limited to, the following:
a.

Attend any prebid conference conducted by the County to acquaint contractors
with Protected Class Enterprises available to provide relevant goods and services
and to inform Protected Class Enterprise's of subcontract opportunities on the
contract;

b.

Review lists of available Protected Class Enterprises maintained by the County
and other State and local governments and agencies prior to the bid opening to
identify qualified Protected Class Enterprises for solicitation for bids;

c.

Advertise, not less than 15 calendar days before the bid opening date, in one or
more daily newspapers and/or trade publications, for bids by Protected Class
Enterprises for subcontracts or the supply of goods and services on the contract;

d.

Make timely written solicitations of available Protected Class Enterprises
identified on the County's list as providing relevant services for bids for
subcontracts or the supply of goods and services; and provide Protected Class
Enterprises with a convenient and timely opportunity to review and obtain
relevant plans, specifications or terms and conditions of the contract to enable
such Protected Class Enterprises to prepare an informed response to a contractor
solicitation;

of the U.S. Department of Commerce and where the contractor seeks a waiver,
make timely notice of the need for Protected Class Enterprise subcontractors to
an appropriate community and minority and women's business organization
identified as an assist agency with respect to this article.

(4)

A contractor seeking a total or partial waiver shall, in accordance with guidelines issued
by the Contract Compliance Administrator, be required to submit evidence of its good
faith efforts to achieve the applicable Protected Class Enterprise goals and in support of
its reasons for seeking a waiver. Performance of all the actions set out in Subsection
(c)(3) of this section by the contractor shall create a rebuttable assumption that the
contractor has made good faith efforts to meet the applicable Protected Class Enterprise
goals. The determination of the adequacy of a contractor's good faith efforts will be
evaluated on the basis of the contractor's actions as of the date of the bid opening.

(5)

The Contract Compliance Administrator may grant the waiver request of a contractor
based upon the following criteria:
a.

Sufficient qualified Protected Class Enterprises capable of providing the goods or
services required by the contract are unavailable despite the good faith efforts of
the contractor;

b.

The specifications of and the reasonable and necessary requirements for
performing the contract make it impossible or economically infeasible to divide
the contract into sufficiently small tasks or quantities to enable the contractor to
utilize Protected Class Enterprises in accordance with the applicable utilization
goals;

a good faith effort to meet the applicable goals and/or comply with the provisions herein,
including, but not limited to, failing to timely submit the required letters of intent or other
information request and/or has not otherwise met the requirements for a total or partial
waiver, the Purchasing Agent may declare the contractor nonresponsive and reject the bid
and reject any waiver request which may have been filed.

(8)

Where the Contract Compliance Administrator determines that the utilization plan
submitted by a contractor is false or fraudulent, the Purchasing Agent shall reject the bid
or, if such a determination is made after the bid award, the contract may be forfeited and
canceled.

(d)
Subcontract requirements. Within 30 days after demand, the prime contractor shall
furnish fully executed copies of all protected class subagreements and these shall be reviewed by the
Contract Compliance Administrator and submitted to the Contract Compliance Committee of the County
Board. Subsequently, the prime contractor shall obtain and submit a copy of all Minority Business
Enterprise or Women's Business Enterprise related subtier contracts on demand.
(e)

Review of contract performance.

(1)

The Contract Compliance Administrator shall review the contractor's efforts during the
performance of the contract to achieve its Protected Class Enterprise commitments as
stated in its utilization plan. If the contractor meets or exceeds its stated goals, it shall be
presumed to be in compliance. Where the Contract Compliance Administrator finds that
the contractor has failed to achieve its stated goals or otherwise has failed to comply with
the requirements of the division, including failure to provide any documentation required
by the Contract Compliance Administrator, has not satisfactorily demonstrated good faith
efforts, and/or has deviated without authorization from the compliance related portions of
the contract as originally approved, the Contract Compliance Administrator shall report
findings to the Contract Compliance Committee.

(2)

The Contract Compliance Administrator may establish such requirements for periodic
contractor reporting on the fulfillment of its goals and its utilization of Protected Class
Enterprises as the Contract Compliance Administrator determines appropriate and
necessary for effective enforcement of this division. A contractor also shall be required to
provide the Contract Compliance Administrator any additional requested compliance
documentation within 14 days of such request.

Protected Class Enterprise bid and target market programs. To address more specifically
the barriers to Protected Class Enterprise participation as prime contractors in County work, the Contract
Compliance Administrator may direct the Purchasing Agent to institute the following special Protected
Class Enterprise bidding provisions, following determination of the appropriateness of such provisions.

(2)

In connection with the award of a contract subject to competitive bidding on which a
Protected Class Enterprise has bid and where the Protected Class Enterprise meets the
following criteria:
a.

It is bidding on the item in question for the first time; and

b.

It never has successfully bid on a Cook County purchasing contract, the Contract
Compliance Administrator may, at the opening of the bids on the item, compare
the Protected Class Enterprise bid with the lowest bid, and, if the Protected Class
Enterprise's bid is closely competitive as defined by guidelines to be established
by the Contract Compliance Administrator with that of lowest actual bids, direct
the Purchasing Agent to declare the Protected Class Enterprise the successful
bidder. A Protected Class Enterprise may use this procedure only once to become
the successful bidder on any particular item. Thereafter, the Protected Class
Enterprise must be totally competitive in terms of price to be the successful
bidder.

The Contract Compliance Administrator shall develop and coordinate a target market
program as follows:
a.

The Contract Compliance Administrator shall review the availability of Protected
Class Enterprises providing various goods and services and shall identify for
inclusion in a potential program for bidding among Protected Class Enterprise
firms certain commodity areas with sufficient Protected Class Enterprise
availability to ensure that the County receives a competitive price. The Contract

Compliance Administrator will institute the following procedures:
1.

The Contract Compliance Administrator will notify the Purchasing
Agent of identification of those commodity codes appropriate for a target
market program;

2.

To the extent practicable, the Purchasing Agent, with the aid of the
Contract Compliance Administrator, shall divide procurement in the
designated commodity areas into economically feasible sizes to facilitate
bids or offers from Protected Class Enterprises and shall designate
contracts to be offered under the target market program;

3.

The Purchasing Agent shall offer Protected Class Enterprises the
opportunity to bid on such contracts in a limited competition;

4.

All standard County rules for bidding will then become effective and,
provided that at least three Protected Class Enterprises bid or make an
offer on the contract, the lowest responsive and responsible bidder
among the Protected Class Enterprise firms will receive the contract;

5.

In the event less than three Protected Class Enterprises bid or make an
offer on the contract or if there is no responsive bid or offer received
from a responsible Protected Class Enterprise, the Purchasing Agent
shall rebid the contract not subject to the target market program.

Participation in the target market program shall be limited to Minority Business
Enterprises, Women's Business Enterprises and joint ventures consisting
exclusively of Minority Business Enterprises, Women's Business Enterprises or

Protected Class Enterprise subcontractor for any labor performed, furnished, or tools,
machinery, appliances, fuels, provisions or supplies of any sort or kind used or consumed
upon, in or on account of the work for ten days after payment for same shall become due,
then the County shall have the power and authority to pay such indebtedness, and the
amount so paid shall be retained out of the money due or to become due the contractor.
The County Comptroller may refuse to make the payment hereinafter specified to the
extent of such indebtedness, until satisfactory evidence in writing has been furnished that
the indebtedness has been discharged. In any such case, the Purchasing Agent is hereby
authorized and empowered by the contractor to ascertain the amount due or owing from

All Department heads who may employ the professional services of accountants, attorneys,

or services procured through sole source agreements shall implement this article and compliance
programs in a "best effort" manner. In lieu of the requirements set forth in Section 34-281(b), all
providers of such professional services or goods or services are to be notified that:
(1)

In the case of term contracts (annually or for more than six months), they are to maximize
the use of Protected Class Enterprises or individuals as subconsultants or subcontractors.

(2)

In the case of contracts instituted on an as-needed basis or lasting less than six months,
they are to submit to the County affirmative action plans and goals and maximize the
number of women and minority professionals in their firm who participate in various
County projects.

(3)

In both of the above cases the internal affirmative action plans and goals of the providers
shall be submitted to the Contract Compliance Administrator and shall be reviewed
against the provider's actual affirmative action achievements and shall become a part of

WHEREAS, this policy creates problems because the need for ongoing medical treatment after parole

WHEREAS, among juveniles detained youth present with higher rates of substance abuse, acute
illnesses, sexually transmitted diseases, unplanned pregnancies and psychiatric disorders; and
WHEREAS, among adult populations the present policy of terminating Medicaid and SSI
disproportionately affects the mentally ill and indigent; and
WHEREAS, terminating SSI and Medicaid benefits forces these individuals upon release to reapply for
benefits, an intensive and time-consuming process in which they often go without treatment for extended
periods of time when they leave the system; and
WHEREAS, adopting a policy to suspend, rather than terminate, SSI and Medicaid benefits would help
to alleviate the gap for needed benefits for those reentering the community; and
WHEREAS, federal law does not require the termination of benefits, and in a letter to all state Medicaid
directors from May 25, 2004, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services “encouraged all states to
suspend and not terminate Medicaid benefits while a person is in a public institution” so that the
individual may begin to receive benefits immediately after release; and
WHEREAS, the states of Florida, Oregon and Minnesota have all moved to revise their policies to
suspend rather than terminate an individual’s Medicaid or SSI status when they enter a public institution.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that President Todd Stroger and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners does hereby urge the Illinois General Assembly to act swiftly to revise state policy and
move to suspend, rather than terminate, Medicaid and SSI benefits so an individual shall continue to be
eligible upon release from a public institution; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this Resolution be forwarded to the Illinois General
Assembly.

WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII Section 6(a)
of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and perform any function
pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, our core mission is public safety, welfare and healthcare to the indigent. Dwindling
resources from the State and Federal government put a serious stain on the taxpayers of Cook County;
and
WHEREAS, we recognize the declining state of our national economy and its direct impact on our ability
to secure the necessary revenue to adequately fulfill our mission; and
WHEREAS, the President’s recognition of the need to stimulate the economy cannot go unappreciated
however, the magnitude and complexity of our economic crisis demand that we maximize the use of
every dollar by focusing less on give-a-ways and more towards greater opportunities for employment; and
WHEREAS, investing in projects that serve a dual purpose by using the same dollar to accomplish our
economic goals while at the same time addressing some of the most critical problems facing our nation
such as, unemployment, the impact of drastic climate changes, antiquated infrastructures, the over
dependency on foreign oil and the frequent occurrence of natural disasters; and
WHEREAS, all of these issues are critical to the growth and the vitality of our country and public safety
therefore, it is critical that we seek ways by which to solve multiple problems by using the same dollar.
Investing stimulus dollars in projects that empower people to support themselves would move us further
towards achieving the goals of economic stability.

Commissioners call upon the President of the United States and Congress to carefully consider
reinvesting stimulus money to critical public works projects; and

ITEM #14 cont’d
WHEREAS, more than 284,000 senior citizens in Cook County benefit from the Senior Citizen
Homeowner’s Exemption each year, a valuable and important form of property tax relief; and
WHEREAS, the Senior Exemption can reduce a senior’s property tax bill by several hundred dollars,
with 2008 tax bill savings ranging from $158 to $823; and
WHEREAS, in tax year 2007, the Cook County Assessor’s Office stopped requiring seniors 65 years or
older to apply annually for the Exemption and therefore saved additional processing and mailing costs;
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Assessor took this step in order to make the process easier for seniors to
avail themselves of the Exemption since no one gets younger; and
WHEREAS, the Assessor re-verifies the Exemption whenever a deed transfer occurs on a property
receiving the Exemption; and
WHEREAS, the Exemption has no income requirement and requires only that the taxpayer be 65 or older
and own the house that is their principal residence; and
WHEREAS, legislation recently passed by the General Assembly now requires seniors to reapply every
year for the Exemption, creating an unnecessary obstacle for them; and
WHEREAS, this requirement was mandated only for Cook County and does not apply to any other
assessor’s office or county office in Illinois; and
WHEREAS, this requirement will place an unfunded mandate on the County and require the County to
expend unnecessary funds for publications, mailings and administration of the Exemption during an
economic period where any and all unnecessary expenses to taxpayers should be taken under high
consideration; and
WHEREAS, every time a major change in an exemption application process has occurred it has resulted
in confusion and missed property tax savings, especially for those exemptions specifically targeted for the
senior citizen population.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urge the
General Assembly to promptly reconsider this onerous provision imposed upon the senior population of
Cook County and remedy this unnecessary provision by enacting further legislation allowing for the
Assessor to maintain the practice of verification they have installed which allowed for automatic renewal
of this valuable property tax relief for Cook County senior citizens.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On July 14, 2010, it became apparent that the Operation of Automotive Equipment Account 565445 would require an infusion of funds in order to meet the fuel consumption requirements for
operation of the Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management vehicle fleet. The
original request was calculated based on the operation of fewer vehicles. Due to an increase in the
number of operated vehicles, a shortfall in funds for fueling the vehicle fleet was identified. At this
time the balance in the account is $6,365.00. The balance 30 days prior was $6,365.00.
On July 14, 2010 it became apparent that the Books, Periodicals, and Publications and Publications
and Data Services Account 565-353 would require an infusion of funds to renew subscriptions to
various publications. At this time the balance in the account was $132.00. The balance 30 days
prior was $132.00.
On July 14, 2010, it became apparent that the Office Supplies Account 565-350 would require an
infusion of funds in order to cover the administrative obligations for the remainder of the fiscal
year. At this time the balance in the account is $4,258.00. The balance 30 days prior was
$4,258.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 565-190 was identified as a source of transfer due to the allowance of employee travel to
various Homeland Security conferences, exercises, and trainings being reimbursed through the
Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program.
Account 565-225 was identified as a source of transfer due to the increase of individual interaction
of the Cook County Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management with each of
the 128 Municipalities in Cook County and the subsequent reduction of mailings, thereof.
Account 565-579 was identified as source of transfer due to a surplus of computer operation supply
inventory.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
There will be no impact to any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligation as a
result of transfer.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
A surplus in the transfer accounts exists due to the charging of allowable costs to the Department’s
grant funded programs.

CONTRACT ADDENDUM continued
ITEM #23 cont’d

Reason:

Linebarger Goggan's contract which was originally approved by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners on September 8, 2005 and renewed by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners on June 19, 2007 and July 21, 2009, expires on September 18, 2010. This
extension would allow the Department of Revenue to complete its County-Wide Debt
Collections Request for Proposal (RFP) that has been developed with the assistance of
representatives of the Revenue Department, Clerk of the Circuit Court, Bureau of
Administration, Office of the President, Office of the State's Attorney, Sheriff’s Office,
County Clerk and the Cook County Health & Hospitals System. The extension will provide
time for receipt and evaluation of response proposals as well as time to recommend and
receive approval to negotiate and execute a contract with a qualified vendor or vendors.
The contract will continue to allow Linebarger Goggan to pursue collection matters referred
to it in writing by any County Agency, which would include the Cook County Health &
Hospitals System, the Offices of the Separately Elected Officials and Departments under the
jurisdiction of the Cook County Board President; however, the contract shall be amended to
reflect (1) "collection services for Cook County" instead of "collection services for the Office
of the President;" (2) allow the Department of Revenue and the Office of the State's Attorney
to manage said contract; and (3) require Linebarger Goggan to seek appointment as a Special
Assistant State's Attorney prior to sending out a collection letter or referencing the possibility
of legal action.
Neither the contract amendment or extension prevents the County or Cook County Board
from exercising an earlier termination period nor does it prevent the County from engaging in
services for collection services with any other agency or agencies. The expiration date of the
current contract is September 18, 2010.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contingency Fee Basis 25%. Contract extension: September 19, 2010
through March 18, 2011.

COOK COUNTY LAW LIBRARY
AUTHORIZATION TO AMEND A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED CONTRACT
ITEM #45
APPROVED AS AMENDED
Transmitting a Communication from
BENNIE E. MARTIN, Executive Law Librarian, Cook County Law Library
requesting that the Board of Commissioners approve, as amended Contract No. 10-41-77 with Innovative
Interfaces, Inc., Emeryville, California, to lease its Millennium system which was previously approved by
the Cook County Board of Commissioners Committee on Finance on March 25, 2010, and
subsequently approved by the Cook County Board of Commissioners on April 6, 2010.
The amendment is indicated by the underscored and stricken language.
305673

Transmitting a Communication from
BENNIE E. MARTIN, Executive Law Librarian, Cook County Law Library
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with
Innovative Interfaces, Inc., Emeryville, California, to lease its Millennium
system, an automated integrated library management system, and for services
from the company associated with installation of the system, including project
management, software configuration, training, implementation, consulting, data
loading and maintenance services.
Reason: The Millennium system will replace the existing system, which was
installed in 1992, and is no longer supported by its vendor, and is
inadequate for the Library's needs. The new system will integrate the
library's processes for acquisition, check-in, cataloging, and payment
of library materials, not all of which are currently automated. It will
also produce a web-based, online public access catalog of the library's
holdings.
Innovative Interfaces, Inc. was selected through a Request for Proposal
(RFP) process per County requirements. This vendor can fulfill the
specialized automation requirements of a large county law library,
migrate the bibliographic data for this large collection from the current
system to theirs, and grow with the changes in the legal publishing and
legal research worlds to continue to meet the needs of the Cook County
Law Library and its patrons. Innovative Interfaces, Inc. has worked
with other county law libraries.

ITEM #46
APPROVED AS AMENDED
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 9, 2010 from
NANCY L. JONES, M.D., Chief Medical Examiner, Office of the Medical Examiner
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $20,000.00 $20,500.00
from and to the accounts listed below.
Reason:

More pathologists are receiving training compared to previous years, so we need to cover
their staff training expenses. Due to an increase in investigators and the caseload, the costs
for travel have also increased. This year, there has been an increase in the number of cases
that have not arrived in the office within 4 days, therefore requiring ambulance services. This
year, we have seen an increase in the number of deliveries for the office. Given the need for
maintenance and repairs to the aging fleet of vehicles, there have been a number of costs
associated with the Medical Examiner vehicles.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
For all transfers, the account used for the source of the transferred funds was identified based on an
account balance over $30,000.00 where the portion of that account’s budget that was already spent
was approximately 50% or less. Therefore, close to half of the budget remained at the end of the
3rd quarter of the fiscal year. Additionally, future costs were taken into consideration.
Based on a financial analysis of each account to determine if sufficient funds are available for the
remainder of the year, it was determined that Account 222 has a surplus balance due to an
overestimate in expenditures on a pending contract at the time of budget preparation.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
There should not be any delays, cancellations, etc., in the account that funds will be transferred
from.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The amount in this account was originally budgeted due to an approved purchasing contract that
was in progress; the problems that we were having with the vendor had not been resolved.
Therefore, we were preparing for the possibility of using 2010 budgetary funds to draft a new
contract.

requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $35,000.00 from and to the
accounts listed below, for the purchase of stenographic paper and the repair and replacement of office
equipment.
Reason:

The office supplies account for the judiciary, budgeted at $94,020.00, is primarily used for
the purchase of specialized stenographic paper for court reporters' stenograph machines. The
budget was developed based upon a case price of $43.65. However, in 2010 the price
substantially and unexpectedly increased by 33 percent to $58 per case. As such, the
department requests an additional $30,000.00 for the account. The maintenance account for
the Office of the Chief Judge, with a budget of $17,600.00 is used for mail machines, water
coolers, fax machines and other minor equipment such as typewriters. An additional
$5,000.00 is requested based upon current expenditure trends.

On or about June 1, 2010 in conjunction with our monthly budget review process, it became
apparent that additional funds would be necessary for expected purchases. On that date the
unencumbered balances in account 300-350 and 310-440 were $36,995.00 and $8,895.00,
respectively. One month earlier, on May 1, 2010, the unencumbered balances in account 300-350
and 310-440 were $38,332.00 and $9,728.00, respectively.

The court's jury fees account is proposed based upon expenditures to date, which are less than
expected. For the six (6) months ended May 31, 2010, jury fee payments total $1,581,299.00, or

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally

The transfers are needed to meet the departments' advertising and court reporting needs for

printing costs of Personal Issue Tickets (Traffic Citation Tickets) for the City of Chicago
Police and the various suburban police agencies. Printing costs for Personal Issue Tickets are
