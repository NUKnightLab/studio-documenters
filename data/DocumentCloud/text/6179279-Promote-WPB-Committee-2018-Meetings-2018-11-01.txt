1. AH will change the RFP date for our 2018 annual report so it can be voted on by the Commission
in December.
2. Committee reviewed SSA/Chamber PR contract with the Silverman Group – they have been
successful in many press releases for our projects and programs in the past, including: the Hebru
Brantley mural, the WPB Ambassador Program and our Orange Planters. Both SSA and Chamber
have been satisfied with their work so far.
3. Illuminight has received approval from 32nd Ward to move forward with the bike lights on the
606. The money for this project was motioned in 2017.
4. SSA staff has been revising the grant applications and will continue to simplify them and
eventually uploading them to be a google form.
a. EC suggests we add language to the application that reminds applicants of the
committee’s discretion.
b. Application should have a question to determine what category the grant falls within.
5. Committee discussed the “Get Off in WPB” campaign. There were questions about the choice of
colors and lack of SSA logo on the proposed images.
a. Committee agrees that there needs to be consistent branding throughout all
committees’ programs.
b. RD suggests we consider newly branded banners to match the billboards.
Motion 1: RD motions to approve to continue our PR contract with the Silverman Group in 2019 and to
pay for half of their services in conjunction with the WPB Chamber of Commerce, which totals $1,500
per month with a grand total $18,000 for the year from line item 1.09 (PR/Media Relations). 18-1101
