PROPOSED RESOLUTION

Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
MIKE QUIGLEY, County Commissioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the present Cook County property assessment and taxation system is spread out over four
different offices: Assessor, Auditor, Clerk and Treasurer; and
WHEREAS, this division of authority means that no single official or office is accountable for the
overall functioning of the system; and
WHEREAS, under the current system many taxpayers often do not know where to tum for assistance;
and
WHEREAS, confusion surrounding the property assessment and tax system has led to situations in
which taxpayers, through no fault of their own, face the loss of their property or the accumulation of
substantial fines; and
WHEREAS, under the existing structure many property tax records must be kept in several offices
simultaneously and updates to data are not always shared between offices; and
WHEREAS, consolidation of property tax functions under one office would create greater efficiency in
staffing and recordkeeping, saving money on both personnel and information systems and reducing the
amount of time needed to process data; and
WHEREAS, a single property tax administration office has been supported by interested citizens and
civic groups for nearly a century, with the earliest known expression of such support coming from the
Bureau of Public Efficiency in 1917; and
WHEREAS, two of the County's own advisory panel s, the Home Rule Study Commission in 1976 and
the Revenue Study Committee in 1988, have proposed a single office for property tax administration; and
WHEREAS, other major counties have begun streamlining their property tax infrastructure in pursuit of
greater accountability and more efficient operations; and
WHEREAS, Pierce County, Washington, combined the offices of assessor and treasurer in 198 1; and

1194

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 20, 2004

2003; and
WHEREAS, Summit County, Ohio, created a new County Fiscal Officer m 2002 by merging the
treasu rer's and auditor's offices; and
WHEREAS, Cook County, by eliminating unnecessary division of labor and vesting property tax
administration in a single official, wi ll become a leader in government innovation and efficiency; and
WHEREAS, Illinois Senate Bill 71 7 will create the elected office of Cook County Tax Administrator to
assume the property-tax-related functions of the Cook County Assessor, Treasurer, Clerk and Auditor,
and will eliminate the office of Cook County Assessor, beginning with the 2006 election; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County urges the
lllinois General Assembly to pass Senate Bill 717 creating a Cook County Office of Tax Administration

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 20, 2004

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property
Assessment Classification 6b which provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level
for an industrial facility; and
WHEREAS, the County Board of Commissioners has received and reviewed an application
from Four Seasons Realty Holdings, LLC and the Resolution from Bridgeview for an
abandoned industrial facility located at 9934 South 76th Avenue, Bridgeview, Cook County,
Illinois, Property Index Number 23- I 2-400-028-0000; and
WHEREAS, Class 6b requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period of
qualifying abandonment in cases where the industrial facility has been abandoned for less
than 24 consecutive months upon purchase; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has detennined that the building was
abandoned for five months at the time of purchase and that special circumstances are present.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners
of the County of Cook, State of Illinois, that the President and Board of Commissioners
indicate their approval for the filing of an application for a Cook County Real Estate
Classification 6b abatement incentive to the company for an abandoned industrial facility
located at 9934 South 76th Avenue, Bridgeview, Cook County, Illinois, under the provision
for abandonment of Jess than 24 months; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to
forward a certified copy of this Resolution to the Office of the Cook County Assessor.
Chainnan Collins noted that there were a number of 6bs that were not being considered today because the
parties had not been notified.
Commissioner Maldonado asked whether there was any infonnation regarding the type of business and
whether it is going to be relocating or starting from scratch at this location.
Robert E. Welsh, Madigan & Getzendanner, identified himself as the representative of the applicants,
Four Seasons Heating, Ventilating and Cooling. He explained that they fabricate heating and cooling
equipment, and distribute these items wholesale throughout the Chicagoland area. He further explained
that they are cu1Tently located in Bedford Park, Illinois; they looked at a number of locations within and
outside Cook County, and have decided to relocate in Bridgeview.
Commissioner Maldonado asked how many employees the fim1 has.
Mr. Welsh responded that they employ 160, and anticipate adding I 0 pennanent and approximately I0
part-time employees after the move.
Commissioner Maldonado asked whether the existing employees have been given the opportunity to
move with the finn at the same rate of pay.
Mr. Welsh responded in the affirmative.

1269

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 20, 2004
Commissioner Maldonado explained the reason for his question: an industrial laundry company was
moving into an incorporated area of Mt. Prospect. They went to the Assessor's Office to apply for a tax
break. Just before they moved they tenninated 40 employees. They informed these employees that if
they wanted to re-apply as new employees, at $5.50 per hour, they were welcome to, and that this was the
only way they would be rehired. More than half of these people had been working for the company for
over 20 years. Commissioner Maldonado decried that fact that this company received a tax break of
$1. 75 million, and voiced the hope that perhaps the ordinance could be amended to close this type of loop
hole. Commissioner Maldonado clarified that if the request for exemption is in an incorporated area, the
applicant does not have to come before the County Board, but applies directly through the Assessor' s
Office.
Chainnan Collins voiced her commitment to closing this loop hole through an amendment at the next
meeting. She also noted that in the next meeting she would have a progress report on the 6bs that had
been awarded.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that he would draft the amendment.
Gwendolyn Clemons, Director, Department of Planning and Development, noted that there are staffing
and processing issues in the Assessor's Office that must be taken into consideration in the drafting of an
amendment.
Chainnan Collins noted that the fiscal affairs of the County are not the business of the Assessor's Office
but rather that of the County Board's.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that all applications for 6bs go through the Assessor's Office, even if
they come to the Board first, and that the Assessor's Office does not have any authority to block the
applications which involve a situation like the one mentioned earlier.
Chainnan Collins asked whether most of the 160 employees live in Cook County and whether there
would be 10 new full-time and 10 new part-time positions added.
Mr. Welsh responded in the affirmative.
Ms. Clemons stated, regarding the 6b abandonment issue, that she hoped any amendment would address
the 90-day turnaround period, so that the Board would have enough time to review applications before
their expiration date.
Commissioner Gomrnn voiced her concern that "mom & pop" businesses should benefit from the 6b
program.
Commissioner Maldonado noted that there are falsifications that take place, where the entities who say
they live above their businesses do not in fact live there.
Chainnan Collins noted that there are three 6b applications to be reviewed in the next meeting.
Commissioner Goslin stated, referring to the "mom and pop" tax situations, that there are several tiers of
taxation, specifically, one tier applies to people who lived above their business, and another tier applies to
people who do not live above their business, but who have tenants there. Commissioner Goslin noted that
he thought some of the fraud occurs when people claimed to belong to one tier when they really belong to
another.

contract was to cut the walls part-way down and to rebuild them, but when the contractors began the work
they realized that there was still unstable brickwork that went down to the roof level ; and because of that
the parapet walls need to be rebuilt from the roof level and tie it into the roof.

solutions to help our nation's troubled youth; and

Cook County Highway Department; and

highway system at its third fonnal meeting in 183 1. In 1840, County Government spent a total of $99.00

dollars of road improvement projects throughout the region, including bridges and overpasses that
represent critical transit points for people and products in the region; and

applied throughout America to solve many of the nation's most challenging needs; and

good within Cook County, and to praise those programs and individuals who have made progress and
innovation available to all within the community.

focused on the "bottom line" have played a large part in attaining the high bond ratings that Cook County
Government has enjoyed during his years as Comptroller; and
WHEREAS, in an age when "creative accounting" has gotten totally out of hand, producing scandal after
scandal and destroying supposedly-strong companies, Mr. Chambers' bottom li ne approach has helped
the County's Department of Finance to effectively plan ahead, knowing that its current fiscal status is
sound, as opposed to distorted; and
WHEREAS, when asked about the nature of his job, Chambers responded " If you do the job right, no

scandal do; and
