D. – Consent Agenda
Dale Miller referred to Item No. BC2019-601 and commented that overall travel expenses have increased
over the past year, rather than decrease, as travel was targeted for budget reductions by the
administration and recommended that a formal process be developed for a 2020 spending plan for travel
where the departments would need to prioritize their travel needs to garner more cost control over travel
expenditures. Dennis Kennedy stated that he would relay that message to the County Executive.
Nan Baker referred to Item No. BC2019-599 and asked what is the amount of the commission received by
the County Commissioners Association of Ohio Service Corporation, in comparison to prior years and
asked if the overall savings justify the cost; and asked if the consumption is expected to remain steady
throughout the term of the agreement, with the expectation of a similar commission to be paid. Dale
Miller asked why this item was listed under the Consent Agenda section rather than under New Items for
Review section, as he viewed this energy participation agreement as an item of special significance. Andria
Richardson, Clerk of the Board of Control stated that it was her initial intent to list this item under New
Items for Review, but consulted with the Law Department, who recommended this item be placed under
the Consent Agenda. Mr. Miller advised Ms. Richardson that she does have discretion as to where items
are placed on the agenda, as there are no set legal rules for placement of items on the agenda.

 There were no further questions. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve items BC2019-599 through – 602;
Dale Miller seconded, the consent items were unanimously approved.
BC2019-599

joint energy purchasing programs with County Commissioners Association of Ohio Service Corporation
