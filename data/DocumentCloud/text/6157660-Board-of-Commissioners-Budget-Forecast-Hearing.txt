Cook County Preliminary Forecast
UPDATE
July 12, 2017
Toni Preckwinkle
President, Cook County Board of Commissioners

 Executive Summary
This supplemental attachment is intended to provide an update on expected changes to the FY2018
Preliminary Forecast and proposed budgetary course of action for the remainder of FY2017.
•

On June 30, 2017, a temporary restraining order was granted preventing the collection of the
sweetened beverage tax. Revenue from the tax is critical to both balancing the FY2017 budget
and developing the FY2018 budget. The impact to FY2017 is a loss of revenue of $67.5 million
and a loss of $200.6 million in FY2018.

•

On July 6, 2017, the State of Illinois passed a balanced budget. Unfortunately, there are negative
impacts to the County’s FY2017 and FY2018 budget totaling $21 million:
•

A permanent 2% reduction to Cook County Home Rule County Retailers’ and Service
Occupation Taxes. Approximate impact to Cook County: $14 million annually

•

Carve out of Personal Property Replacement Tax (PPRT) for community colleges and local
health centers. Totaling a 9% carve out from distribution. Approximate impact to Cook
County: $5 million

•

Reduction in income tax portion of Local Government Distributive Fund by 10%.
Approximate impact to Cook County: $2 million

•

To combat this shortfall in a fiscally responsible manner, Cook County is enacting a 10% holdback
against the last quarter of projected year-end FY17 expenditures that may result in position
eliminations, non-personnel reductions, cancellation of capital equipment purchases and
exercising termination clauses in County contracts.

•

The 10% holdback across the General Fund is expected to reduce expenditures by $49 million
while a similar holdback across the Health Fund is expected to lower spending by $13.4 million
through position eliminations and other reduced expenditures. An encumbrance review and sweep
of unspent dollars will further decrease the FY17 gap by $6.5 million.
