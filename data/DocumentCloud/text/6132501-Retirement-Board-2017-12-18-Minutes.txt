(PA99-0905) which changed the COLA date of birth from prior to 1/1/1955 to prior to 1/1/1966.
Therefore, as he died prior to the date of new legislation, he did not receive the COLA based on the

Mrs. Ahern, re-stating the details outlined and include the 35-day language, so she may file an

Administrative Review if she believes necessary.
