MS. DARLING:

Good morning, everybody.

7

Thank you all for being here.

I realize that

8

scheduling end-of-year meetings is very

9

challenging.

And so, Jim, we appreciate that for

10

your first meeting you are able to participate at

11

least by phone.

turned out conflicted with City Council and so we

And originally this meeting we

So I appreciate you

As you know we are attempting to work

17

with you and your offices to get meeting dates

18

for first or second quarter next year.

19

priority will be to make sure that we hear our

20

audit as soon as it is ready.

21

at some April meeting dates.

22

conflicts with some people's spring break so we

23

are trying to get everybody -- a date that works

24

for everybody or at least as close as we can to

Our

So we are looking

So if you haven't already, please continue

to work with Patty on scheduling.

3

you who have been participating in that tough

4

scheduling process, we appreciate it and we'll

5

try and get some dates finalized very soon.

6

And to many of

So I wanted to give a special welcome

7

as we start our operations update to our two

newest board members.

through a process recently where all of our board

continuing service.

not be more pleased to be working with Jim and

have him on our board.

22

He is taking the board seat that was

Hi, Pete Matuszak with the

City Treasurer's Office.
MS. DARLING:

So thank you and welcome to

14

everybody.

Since we last met we continue to have

15

an extraordinarily busy and productive time for

16

the CIT.

17

deployed between the O'Hare Express Project

18

agreement negotiation and the continuation of

19

assisting CDOT with Smart Lighting.

20

been putting in a tremendous amount of resources

21

and time working on ComEd rebates and ComEd

22

issues with the Smart Lighting Project, managing

23

the procurement around the Public Safety Training

24

Academy which we'll update you on later today,

I would say we are absolutely fully

George has

and launching the procurement for ground-mounted

2

solar.

3

To say this team has been hard working

4

would be an understatement.

I realize I say that

5

every time we meet, but everybody is working very

6

hard.

7

incredibly intense and I am thankful for your

8

support as a board, but primarily to the CIT team

9

who has really been putting a tremendous effort

These past few months at the CIT have been

10

to the accomplishments that we are going to talk

11

about today.

12

I do want to have a brief shout out to

13

Phoebe Downey our project associate.

14

stepped up incredibly to run the Solar

15

Ground-Mount Project and we are incredibly lucky

16

to have Phoebe on our team.

17

brief hiatus as she will be welcoming a new baby

into her family in early January.

19

final countdown and hoping we can have her for a

20

few more weeks until the baby comes, but I know

21

you will join me in wishing her and her husband

22

well on their new arrival in the next few weeks.

23
24

She has

She will be taking a

hard on our year-end financials, the budget

2

issues.

3

early as possible which for a nonprofit can be

4

challenging to get those closed early.

5

has been working with our independent auditor at

6

Benford Brown to get ready to launch our audit as

7

early as possible in the new year.

working on getting that on the schedule and we

So that's

But she is also, in addition to that,

14

been managing our health benefits and open

all the effort she has been putting in.

2

everybody and that kind of covers our brief

3

operations update.

4

And so I just wanted to thank

And, Mr. Chairman, if it's all right

5

with you, I think we should move into the

6

operating budget.

7

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Sounds like a plan.

I

8

think everyone has a copy in front of them and we

9

will have it on the screen.

10

MS. DARLING:

You should have a copy in

11

front of you and you received this also under

12

separate cover in time for you to have a close

13

review of the budget.

14

actuals through October 2018.

15

continue to work hard to provide a lot of value

16

for the city; but we operate very, very lean.

17

work to accomplish a great deal with very little

18

financial resources.

19

These are our unaudited
As you can see we

We

When I came to the organization in

20

2015, the organization was pursuing a great

21

number of small projects and we have grown into

22

an agency that is trusted and relied upon to

23

handle the city's most visionary infrastructure

24

projects.

So we created a great tool for the

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 10
1

city to utilize now and in the future and we

2

continue to serve as a specialized resource.

3
4
5

I am happy to answer any questions
that you may have on the budget.
MS. CAFARO:

Leslie, excuse me.

So the

6

line, first grade line is really total revenue?

7

That's how I should be interpreting it?

8

MS. DARLING:

9

MS. CAFARO:

10

Okay.

And the budget on the

right is the full year budget?

11

MS. DARLING:

12

MS. CAFARO:

13

Yes.

The full 2019 budget.
Got it.

Okay.

So we are

running ahead on expenses?

14

MS. DARLING:

15

MS. CAFARO:

16

MS. DARLING:

We are.
So that's -- and on on revenue?
Uh-huh.

17

grant agreement for 2019.

18

complete.

19

MS. CAFARO:

20

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And we finalized our
That's already

Thank you.
Other questions about the

21

budget?

I know everybody has had a chance to

22

review and probably separately have asked Leslie

23

questions about it.

24

just the package at the end so we'll just keep

Okay.

I think we will do

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 11

going.
MS. DARLING:

Sure.

So for the O'Hare

3

Express System we wanted to give you all an

4

update as to where we are in the progress working

5

towards a project agreement with The Boring

6

Company.

7

As you know, for those of you who were

8

with us last time, we spent a greet deal of time,

9

we invited the Chief Engineer from CDOT, Dan

10

Burke, to join us and had a very good

11

conversation about moving that project forward

12

and we appreciated your support on it.

13

As you recall, this is a

14

design/build/finance/operate/maintain business

15

model and the vendor is taking on the full risk

16

of the project.

17

The Boring Company as the developer of the

18

project and will not rely on any city or

19

government funds for the building or the

20

operations or the maintenance of the system.

21

It will be funded entirely by

As you recall, we asked in our

22

proposal documents for the system to go between

23

downtown and O'Hare in 20 minutes or less and

24

with trips departing every 15 minutes.

And as

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 12
1

has been widely reported and you're aware, The

2

Boring Company has said that they can do the trip

3

in 12 minutes and will depart every 30 seconds to

4

2 minutes.

5

congestion and foster economic growth as the

6

Mayor has spoken about many times, tying the two

7

economic engines of the City of Chicago of O'Hare

8

and the loop together.

9

Obviously the goal is to mitigate

I do want to ask Tom, who has really

10

been doing an amazing job at quarterbacking this

11

whole process, if he could give a quick update on

12

where we are.

13

MR. BUDESCU:

Sure.

Thank you.

So, you

14

know, I think the first thing to remember that we

15

are still currently engaged in an active

16

procurement.

17

this in our previous meeting, but to refresh

18

everybody's memory the CIT on behalf of the city

19

and in coordination with the city issued the RFQ

20

on November I think it was actually 29th, 2017.

21

And I think we went through part of

On February 5th we received 4

22

statements of qualification from interested

23

bidding teams.

24

The Boring Company and O'Hare Express, L.L.C.,

In March we short listed 2 teams,

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 13
1

and both of those teams responded to an RFP that

2

was issued 2 days later.

3

The proposals came in on May 18th.

4

After the evaluation of the proposals, The Boring

5

Company was invited into contract negotiations in

6

June of 2018.

7

The kind of unique aspect of this

8

project that we had two teams bidding on very

9

different technology and approaches to the

10

project, one with an underground tunnel while the

11

other with a surface solution; made us work with

12

the city to come up with a different type of

13

approach to the procurement where certain things

14

on the definition of the commercial and legal

15

framework and the technology and technical

16

specifications were deferred into the

17

negotiations period to be resolved prior to

18

introduction to City Council.

19

have been working with The Boring Company since

20

June.

21

And that's what we

There has been a number of different

22

work strains associated with the project as we

23

have been advancing to better define the

24

transaction and concurrently progress the

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 14
1

technical and regulatory processes to really

2

effectively facilitate the transaction if it

3

moves forward.

4

So from the contract negotiations we

5

have been working with the city and The Boring

6

Company to develop a fully fledged legal and

7

commercial framework to progress to City Council.

8

Given the unique aspects of the project, there is

9

no existing template or precedent to sort of

10

immediately build off of; but we have been

11

working really hard for a while now and we are

12

feeling very confident that the project agreement

13

is getting to the point of refinement and very

14

much will be consistent with the procurement

15

goals and we believe will represent a really

16

exciting opportunity for the city.

17

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Tom, can you remind

18

everyone just sort of big picture; size, scope of

19

the project itself, dollar size and so forth.

20

MR. BUDESCU:

Yes, so I think that's still

21

to be refined, but we're expecting it to be less

22

than a billion dollars.

23

point, a design/build/finance/operate and

24

maintain.

It is a, to Leslie's

So The Boring Company will be

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 15
1

responsible for all aspects of the delivery of

2

the project.

3

And I think the other thing that I'll

4

touch on now that they are taking responsibility

5

for both financially and contractually as well

6

that is a bit unorthodox is the progression of

7

the Federal Environmental Regulatory processes.

8

So often developers that seek to enter

9

into these types of projects will not be willing

10

to put forth the financial resources to progress

11

the project unless there is already an existing

12

certainty regarding the Federal Environmental

13

approvals.

14

fact that we are looking at various different

15

alignments and solutions, the environmental

16

process was deferred until there was actually a

17

better project definition based off of the

18

selection of the winning bidder -- or not

19

winning, but the preferred bidder based off of

20

the initial proposals.

21

In this case, again, stemming to the

As we have been working with The

22

Boring Company, we have commenced the NEPA

23

process with the Federal Regulators and they are

24

the ones that are responsible for advancing that

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 16
1

as well, not just the

2

design/construction/financing and operations of

3

the project.

4

that we have spent a lot of time with CDOT and

5

The Boring Company coordinating the documentation

6

with the Federal Agencies responsible for the

7

regulatory approval.

8
9

So that's been another work strain

So it's been a very busy five or six
months as we kind of progress all these things

10

and want to have a very well-defined project to

11

present publicly to the City Council for their

12

review and consideration.

13

And so the contract negotiation has

14

been a part of that, sort of defining the legal

15

and commercial framework.

16

process has been a part of it.

17

The environmental

Then there is also the other general

18

project design and definition where the city and

19

the CIT have worked in coordination with The

20

Boring Company to provide them really a large

21

scale amount of information on historical

22

geotechnical data in downtown and along the

23

proposed corridors, as-built drawings for various

24

bridges, roads infrastructure, underground

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 17
1

utilities, abandoned freight tunnels.

2

things that we take for granted, but that exist

3

both at the surface and go below it or just below

4

the surface that you never see that sort of feed

5

into the final design and construction of the

6

project.

7

All these

And so it's -- those have kind of been

8

the big three work strains.

And I think we're

9

getting pretty far along in that process thanks

10

to the hard work of The Boring Company; but also

11

CDOT, the CTA, the Mayor's Office and the Law

12

Department and a lot of other partners that are

13

working with us to sort of get all the

14

information we need, get all the questions

15

answered and help progress really the full

16

parameters of this project.

17

So that's kind of where we are right

18

now.

And I think it's been a busy process, but

19

one that I think has provided a lot of great

20

information and I think we hope to advance soon.

21

MS. CAFARO:

MS. DARLING:

with us.

Maybe if some of you could move to the

So we have been talking about this

project for some time, but as a reminder this is

11

a new combined Public Safety Training Academy for

12

both the fire department and the police

13

department and EMT's.

14

our clients at the Department of Fleet and

Facility Management as our lead client, but also

16

with CPD and CFD to design new state-of-the-art

17

training facilities.

18

We will be working with

This is a design/build procurement.

19

At a certain point we looked at a

20

design/build/finance; but we were asked to

21

procure just a design/build by the city.

22

we at this point, as you know, the AECOM Joint

23

Venture and Denise Casalino who is the Senior

24

Vice President of AECOM has joined us, and they

And so

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 19
1

have been invited to move to the next stage of

2

the procurement which is to work with us on a

3

collaborative design process and work to get a

4

defined scope and budget or at least move the

5

scope as far as we can and then bring a project

6

agreement to City Council.

7

for joining us today.

So, Denise, thank you

And then our clients, I would like to
introduce we have Commissioner David Reynolds,

who is the Commissioner of the Department of

Fleet and Facility Management.

12

our client on this, but also our relocation of

15

a lot of time together working on a lot of

16

projects together.

17

both Chief Johnson who is the head of training

18

and Deputy Chief at the Chicago Police Department

19

and also Deputy Chief Josh Dennis and Chief of

has been announced as moving it forward in the

9

next stage of the procurement to talk a little

10

bit about their MBE/WBE team members and

11

commitment and workforce development commitment.

12

Also, as you know, AECOM is also the

13

developer on the 2FM relocation facility.

14

they are working on those three facilities as

15

well and we are going to have an update on that

16

later.

17

give us a really nice update of where we are on

18

that project which has gone very, very well.

19

thank you all for being here.

So we will ask Denise to stay and she can

20
21
22

So

So

George, do you want to talk a little
bit about our procurement process?
MR. MARQUISOS:

Sure.

So this project has

23

been talked about for many years, and the need is

24

really apparent for anyone who's involved at all

Veritext Legal Solutions

in the current facilities that we utilize to

2

train our emergency responders.

3

tasked with coming up with the procurement

4

process and a delivery model that really kind of

5

maximized the benefit to a significant investment

6

by the city.

7

And so we were

And we came up with a somewhat unique

8

process whereby we were going to invite design

9

builders to submit their qualifications and their

10

team, if you will, and what experience they had

11

to deliver these kind of specialized projects;

12

and then we would shortlist them and then invite

13

them to participate in an RFP, but they wouldn't

14

actually be bidding on a particular project.

15

Instead they would work as our partners and they

16

would bring these design expertise to the table

17

and work collaboratively and iteratively with all

18

the stakeholders because we felt that the city

19

really needed some expertise to kind of help

20

define all their needs and then the

21

ideally-suited facilities that could go at this

22

30-acre campus.

23
24

So I am very pleased to report that
that idea, that concept, that was started

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 22
1

probably 18 months ago is now playing out in a

2

way that I think at least I am very happy about.

3

I have been honored and one of the cool things

4

about working at the CIT is I get to witness some

5

of these really intricate and pivotal kind of

6

operations in the city.

7

fortunate enough to listen to some very qualified

8

city folks as to how they prepare our workforce

9

to respond to emergency situations, and they are

And I have been

10

complex and broad and diverse.

11

resident here my whole life, but I never thought

12

of all the things that they are asked to respond

13

to and be trained for.

14

fascinating to understand the curriculum and the

15

unique facilities that they need to provide at a

16

high level.

17

And I have been a

And it's been very

So we are in the process right now of

18

meeting with police and fire and really

19

understanding all their programatic needs, not

20

just now but their strategy for the future.

21

then we have a team of experts that AECOM has

22

assembled in a team who have done tens if not

23

hundreds of projects like this both in the U.S.

24

and around the world.

And

And so I really feel happy

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 23
1

that we have this whole notion of what is the

2

state of the art, what is best practices at the

3

table.

4

we are still in the very preliminary stages of

5

that process.

6

way this is playing out, and I am hoping it's

7

going to yield some very good things for Chicago.

And so it has been a very fruitful, but

8
9

But I am quite excited about the

And I would invite my colleagues, so
that group right there has been very involved in

10

this whole process both in the selection of AECOM

11

and also as we kick off this design development

12

process which is what we are in the midst of

13

doing right now.

14

And the goal is to really come back

15

with a recommendation to the elected officials

16

and the City Council with basically a project

17

vision that says this is what we believe you need

18

and this is what we think should be built in West

19

Garfield Park on this 30-acre campus and this is

20

what we are committing it will cost and not to

21

exceed.

22

And so that's a very tall order, but I

23

think we have the right team in place to kind of

24

deliver on that promise.

MS. DARLING:

So just to address real

2

quickly how we evaluated the teams.

We looked at

3

a number of items before you here from our guests

4

and just so you're aware of what the criteria was

5

that we looked at.

be a very, very thoughtful process where we asked

7

the respondents to discuss their design and

This was what we believed to

11

on their team and if they've worked together with

13

them before.

14

Construction experience, the

We certainly wanted to prioritize the

15

project approach and the site plan.

These are in

16

the beginning stages of course right now, but we

17

wanted to make sure that our partners understood

18

our goals and objectives for our project and that

19

would engage with a collaborative and iterative

20

design process that we believed would be the best

21

way to deliver this project.

22

We looked at pricing commitments.

23

Obviously that always has to come into play.

24

This budget is going to be very tight on this

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 25

project.

So we wanted to work with partners who

2

understood our constraints.

3

And then obviously the additional

4

consideration, but very, very important

5

consideration of diversity participation, track

6

record on MBE/WBE and local hiring on past

7

projects and workforce development.

8

development team is the AECOM Joint Venture and

9

2im Design.

And the

Maybe, Denise, could you maybe

10

introduce and talk a little bit about the members

11

of your team?

12

MS. CASALINO:

Right.

So it's a really

13

diverse team.

14

team coming together to do this.

15

side we have several prominent MBE firms working

16

with us, Architrave and MBE for architecture that

17

actually will be doing in a manner a protégé

18

because they really haven't done these type of

19

facilities before, so these types of buildings.

20

So that's exciting.

21

I think it's going to be a great

2im who is incredible with site design

22

and storm water management and those kinds of

things which is pretty critical at this site.

excited to have them on the team.

It not only has our construction

And the community is something we are

7

really proud of.

We really did some research on

working with the community for this facility and

how important that is going to be.

only workforce development, but just the fact

that this new facility is coming into their

little bit about the project progress so far.

George talked about the RFP process generally,

20

and we have ongoing design development and an

21

ongoing community outreach.

24

So at this point I think we -Alderman Ervin.
ALDERMAN ERVIN:

Yes, I just had a few

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 27
1

questions.

2

JV partners?

3

design side and the construction side in terms of

4

who these partners have?

5

who is the MBE's that you have?

6

them as MBE's?

7
8
9
10

Can you go back to the slide with the
What are the percentages from the

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And on the design side,
What qualifies

Meaning what's their

demographic?
ALDERMAN ERVIN:
MS. CASALINO:

Yes.
So Architrave and 2im are

11

both Hispanic.

RM Chin, I believe RM Chin and DB

12

Sterling -- RM Chin is Asian and DB Sterling I

13

believe is African American.

14

side, Bowa, GMA and Riteway-Huggins are African

15

American and Berglund is a primary contractor.

16

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

17

MS. DARLING:

On the construction

And what percentages?

It's a little soon for that

18

because the pricing isn't quite settled and the

19

budget is settled, but you can address your

20

general percentage commitment.

21

MS. CASALINO:

Right.

Well, obviously our

22

goal is 28 and 8 which we are exceeding very well

23

on our current project.

24

the percentages with Bowa Group and GMA.

We are still working out
We're

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 28
1

trying to, if everything works out, get them each

2

up to 10 percent each in the JV, you know, based

3

on what works financially.

4

And then as far as all the other

5

design subs, you know, we will exceed the 28 and

6

8.

7

break out to yet as we divvy up the design work.

8
9

I'm not sure what those are all going to

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

So on the construction side

is that total none -- as far as the AECOM Hunt

10

portion of it, what portion are you allocating to

11

the joint venture partners in total?

12

MS. CASALINO:

So the way this will work is

13

we're essentially really all -- we will all be

14

subcontracting work, right.

15

majority followed by Berglund.

16

percent each for GMA and Bowa if that commitment

17

can work.

18

So AECOM is the
And then the ten

And then within those goals we will

19

exceed the 28 and 8 of hiring subcontractors to

20

do all this work for MBE and WBE.

21

MR. BUDESCU:

Denise, so to clarify, the ten

22

percent is not the subcontract value.

That is

23

really an ownership or equity stake in the actual

24

construction?

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 29
1

MS. CASALINO:

Yes, right.

2

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

Exactly.

So that's 20 percent.

What

3

is the Berglund and what is Riteway-Huggins?

4

Because you talked about Bowa and GMA.

5

is Berglund and what is Riteway-Huggins?

6

MS. CASALINO:

So what

Let's see, I'm trying to

7

remember.

8

of it, but he's not a percentage of the JV

9

ownership.

10

I believe that Riteway-Huggins is part

He's one of our major subcontractors

that we will have to the JV.

11

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

So why is he up there then

12

as a joint venture partner if he's not a party to

13

the joint venture?

14

MS. CASALINO:

15

as an MBE.

16
17

Well, we just have him listed

He's not part of the JV.

MS. DARLING:

That's just the construction

team.

18

MS. CASALINO:

19

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

Right.

Correct.

So in essence what you're

20

telling us is that of the total JV picture that

21

you are proposing is only 20 percent for MBE at

22

the JV level; is that a fair statement?

23

MS. CASALINO:

24

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

Correct.
Why such a small number?

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 30
1

MS. DENISE:

I mean, we don't want to extend

2

anybody more than they can do.

3

only -- that's one part of the picture.

4

the JV picture, but then there is all the MBE and

5

WBE subs that we will be hiring, that the JV will

6

be hiring which will well exceed that 20 percent.

7

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

I mean, that's
There's

I just think that that

8

number is just kind of low for a JV for a public

9

safety facility in a predominantly African

10

American community to say that 20 percent of the

11

JV.

12

think that you all need to work toward increasing

13

that percentage of ownership in the project.

I just think that's a low number.

14

And I

I actually live in West Garfield Park.

15

So I think that those two companies, one is from

16

the west side, one is not.

17

in the community and have very good track

18

records.

19

20 percent of this is not overall beneficial of

20

this project.

21

your pencils on that.

And I think that for him to have just

23
24

They both have worked

So hopefully you all can sharpen
That would be helpful.

Furthermore, what is the break out of
the design?
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Sorry, before we get into

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 31
1

the design, there was one question that you asked

2

that wasn't answered which is the percentage of

3

the JV that Berglund has.

4

is?

5

MS. CASALINO:

Do you know what that

So we are -- I'm trying to

6

calculate real quick.

7

still have not finalized everything between what

8

we are going to do between the 2 of us, but it

9

will probably be something like 38, 32.

10
11

I'm sorry, because we

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So they are sort of, you

know, you guys are the lead?

12

MS. CASALINO:

Yes.

13

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

14

MS. CASALINO:

15

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

They're near second.

Yes.
And are they in terms of,

16

you know, to the Alderman's question; when you

17

are figuring out the percentage of the other JV

18

partners, presumably Berglund is part of that

19

conversation too?

20

MS. CASALINO:

21

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

22
23
24

Correct, correct.
So it's more than just --

it's not sort of solely in your control.
MS. CASALINO:

Correct, they are a major

partner.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 32
1

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

That's a significant

2

partner that is sort of part of that.

3

wanted to make sure we understood that.

4

before we get to the design side, you mentioned

5

rightfully that there will be significant

6

subcontractor participation.

7

MS. CASALINO:

8

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

9

I just
And then

Correct.
And JV separate and apart

from the JV ownership, right?

10

MS. CASALINO:

Correct.

11

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Do you have a sense of

12

what that sort of mix looks like or what your

13

experience is with that with other projects, what

14

you would expect to see here?

15

MS. CASALINO:

So, yes, let's make it clear

16

that everybody from the JV will be hiring

17

subcontractors to do the work.

18

28 and 8 which we expect to exceed.

19
20
21
22

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And our goals are

The goals for the

subcontractors?
MS. CASALINO:

Well, for MBE/WBE

participation on the project.

23

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

24

MS. CASALINO:

Overall.

So 2FM, we are building the 3

facilities.

2

percent MBE and 16 percent WBE when we finish the

3

project in the next month or so.

4

We are forecasting to be at about 40

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

And when you say MBE, what

5

percentage of that is African American?

Because

6

to Alderman Ervin's point being on the west side

7

being in the East Garfield, West Garfield

8

community; the more faces of color that are

9

African American that we see, the better it is

10

for the outreach that the development team will

11

be doing.

12

African American?

13

And so what of that number will be

MS. CASALINO:

Well, 2FM was predominantly

14

African American especially in Englewood where

15

the big facility is.

16
17

MR. REYNOLDS:

The subs are predominately

African American.

18

MS. CASALINO:

19

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

20

done that.

21

that is when --

The subs, yes.
And I know they haven't

Can you make sure that we know what

22

MS. CASALINO:

23

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

24

Yes, yes.
Sorry, but I interrupted

Alderman Ervin's question about design.

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 34
1

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

And then so you said 38, 32

2

is 70 and 10.

3

that the 10 percent you're going to break up and

4

give to the 2 African American contractors?

5

and 32.

6

Where is the last 10 percent?

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Is

38

He's talking about AECOM

7

Hunt and Berglund, if they are 38 and 32 on the

8

construction side.

9

MS. CASALINO:

Okay.

But that's -- wait.

10

Am I doing my math wrong?

11

it is 10 and 10, and the other 80 percent is

12

being split between AECOM and Berglund with AECOM

13

being the majority partner.

14

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

15
16

Sorry.

So right now

Right, I think it's the

42 and 38.
MS. CASALINO:

I'm doing my math

17

wrong.

18

the breakdown for design right now.

19

remiss if I tried to come up with those

20

percentages.

21

intent is to exceed them like we did on previous

22

design and really do regularly with all of our

23

city contracts.

24

I'm sorry.

Yes, yes.

I apologize.

I do not have
I would be

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

7

MS. DARLING:

Yes.

Commissioner Reynolds, would

8

you mind talking a little bit about your

experience on the process so far.

10

obviously we'll ask the same of Chief Dennis and

Chief Johnson as well.

12

MR. REYNOLDS:

Sure.

Thanks for having me

20

have worked on.

21

on that, the very first project.

22

to continue to report that the energy savings

23

exceed the debt payments year after year after

We were in part involved in the street

2

lighting project.

I like that because my

3

department pays the bills for the streetlights.

4

And so the money savings there is going to be

5

helpful for me.

6

And then the last two that we are

7

talking about more -- well, actually, we are

8

involved in the solar one too, but that's kind of

9

down the road.

The first one, the big one, is

10

the replacement facilities.

garage that was behind Home Depot.

12

really North Avenue and Throop Street.

13

so we were able to sell that property, use the

proceeds not only to build 3 replacement

facilities; but also to upgrade 311 and put money

towards public safety training.

So it was a good

On the MBE/WBE part, what I valued in

20

working with CIT and ultimately AECOM is that

21

they clearly viewed the 28/8 as the floor not the

22

goal.

23

as Denise has said, they're hitting 40 percent

24

MBE and 16 percent WBE on our projects for the

So while that's what we have on the books

garage replacements.

2

Also in there is a significant amount

3

of community hiring, African American apprentice

4

hiring, women apprentice hiring.

5

lot of different commitments that AECOM has met

6

and they're really on track for providing us with

7

a project we're not only proud of because it's

8

our new garages, but also because it did

9

significantly provide opportunities in the

11

Our relationship with CIT has been

great.

They bring an expertise, a way of

thinking and a way of addressing complex issues

14

that is very valuable to us.

15

groundbreaking for the 2FM facility in April and

16

we took the Mayor back there in November, he was

17

somewhat stunned that we had buildings almost

18

the client and have a very defined scope and

we have done some complicated projects in the

DISTRICT CHIEF DENNIS:

Good morning,

12

everyone.

13

I have been involved in different iterations of

14

the Joint Academy Project going back to 2005.

15

this is something that we have been kicking

16

around for a while, but the approach that CIT has

17

taken has been the most fiscally responsible by

18

far and the most comprehensive.

Whatever the process ends up yielding,

we have done.

because our academy was built in the 1960's.

2

was state-of-the-art in the 1960's which was

3

great, but it doesn't necessarily fulfill the

4

needs of a modern public safety agency which is

5

why this is so very much needed at this point.

6

As our jobs become more complex, our training

needs to be more complex.

DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON:

Of course, we would

Good morning, I'm

Deputy Chief Kevin Johnson with the Chicago

15

Police Department.

16

myself.

I was appointed this position in last

17

August.

Prior to that I was the Commander of the

18

11th District and have been Commander of the 5th

19

District.

20

project planning sort of thing, but I wanted to

21

say that we have been working closely with George

22

and his team and AECOM trying to get this

23

together because we have to look towards the

24

future.

Just give some background on

So I am pretty new to this whole

Where we're going, what kind of

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 40
1

training, what best practices can we bring for

2

public safety going not only now, but going into

3

the future.

4

we provide to the citizens of Chicago.

5

Ultimately what kind of service can

Basically with the police department

6

we are looking at three levels of this.

7

recruit, in service, but our promotional as well.

8

And we want to have a wraparound strategy for

9

public safety where we come back, not only to

10

what you learn there, you come back.

11

continual learning phase.

12

Not only

It's a

And in the 21st Century things have

13

changed.

Like Josh said, the training academy

14

was built in the '70s and the facility is just

15

very outdated right now.

16

for in the future, we need to be able to adapt to

17

those things such as CIT, critical incident, less

18

lethal, force mitigation, procedural justice.

19

And at the same time be able to incorporate and

20

have respect for the community where this

21

facility is going to be built.

22

the community in?

23

knowing that this is a facility that we all share

24

in?

And what we're looking

How do we bring

How do we get them involved in

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 41
1

So I think that's one of the most

2

important things we need to look at going forward

3

into what we're trying to do here.

4

show the community that public safety means

5

something, then it lends towards recruitment for

6

both police and fire.

7

see us over there, they want to become part of

8

that.

9

a police officer.

10

Because if we

Because if the citizens

Hey, I want to be a fireman.

I want to be

And they'll bring that back

around and sort of wraparound sort of initiative.

11

So I'm looking forward to it.

We have

12

been working very closely and I'm really glad

13

that we're working with 2FM and the CIT on this.

14

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Thank you.

Josh, a lot

15

of conversation and attention has been I think

16

focussed on the police side of the Public Safety

17

Training Academy.

18

a little more light on some of the 21st Century

19

needs that the fire department has specifically

20

that will be enabled here.

be helpful.

22

I wonder if you can just shed

DISTRICT CHIEF DENNIS:

I think it would just

Absolutely, sir.

3

4

mammoth pieces of apparatus that we bring down

5

the street.

We respond to everyone that calls

We go.

6

But when we go, we go with these

Training our folks to be able to drive

7

that apparatus correctly is something quite

8

frankly we really don't have the capacity to do

9

other than finding vacant parking lots.

And then

10

when we can identify folks that have problems

11

driving this apparatus, we go to simulators.

12

Where do we have these simulators?

13

in a closet in the basement of the fire

14

department.

15

then find space, roll out and use.

16

We have them

We have to then roll out, we have to

As CIT has seen, we're to the point

17

where we hold classes in the cafeteria.

We hold

18

class in hallways.

19

We don't have the capacity to be able to not only

20

train our incoming folks, and Kevin did a great

21

job touching on this, but our incumbent folks.

22

To make sure that the people that we have driving

23

fire trucks, know how to drive fire trucks and

24

aren't going to hit people on their way to

incidents.

2

Another part of simulation is we do

3

simulation now for EMS.

So what we did and with

4

Commissioner Reynolds' help, we took our facility

5

and we built a makeshift bar and a makeshift

6

bedroom and we built a little simulation lab.

7

that people not only from an EMS standpoint, but

8

from a CFD standpoint, from an identification

9

standpoint which has now become a national model,

10

we literally have that again in closets, in

11

backrooms.

So

12

Our makeshift prison yard that we use

13

for simulation also doubles as our weightlifting

14

area which also doubles as our storage area which

15

is also where we keep all the blueprints for

16

every fire department facility.

17

second largest fire department in the United

18

States and this is how we operate.

19

And this is the

CIT has been committed to changing

20

this and, yes, it's more so I think important to

21

us than police because we don't just need

22

classrooms.

your question.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I hope that answers

Yes, very much.

Thank

you very much.
ALDERMAN SCOTT:

So I think what you just

7

said is really important and I hope that the

8

development team is going out to the community

9

and that will be the relations in the front

10

facing piece of this.

11

story that you just told in how this academy is

12

probably more important for fire than it is for

13

not -- it's needed in both.

14

that they can do joint missions together.

15

the climate in which we live today, unfortunately

16

there are more incidents where you both need fire

17

and you need the police.

18

We'll be able to tell the

And it's needed so
And in

But for you to be able to tell a story

19

about how great the need is at the fire academy,

20

there are so many people that focus on what this

21

is going to do and calling this a cop academy

22

instead of a public safety academy that is going

23

to benefit not only both fire and police, but the

24

community in which it will be implemented in.

So

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 45
1

I just hope that when you get the development

2

team together and they get out in the community,

3

they're able to showcase exactly what you talked

4

about and the need that exists not just for

5

police because it is a great need there, but how

6

much that need is for fire as well.

7

DISTRICT CHIEF DENNIS:

Can I answer that,

8

sir?

The second largest fire department in the

9

United States, we have to send people to

10

Champaign, Urbana, to do live fire training

11

before we can put them on the street.

12

even have the capacity to do our own live fire

13

training.

14

MR. MARQUISOS:

I'll chime in.

We don't

The one

15

thing that I was really -- because we are also

16

looking at growth, like where are the needs.

17

I was really stunned by the growth of the

18

emergency medical training, paramedics.

19

it's not just how to respond to all these

20

different kind of, you know, distress incidents;

21

but when you're responding to someone who is in a

22

medical emergency to really have the right

23

facilities to make sure you have everything in

24

that ambulance and how you interact with the

And

And so

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 46
1

police who were there before you and all that

2

kind of stuff is really a vital thing.

3

train that in a scenario-based way is also

4

critical, right.

5

And to

So there is a lot of moving pieces to

6

this and I think it's so obvious once you witness

7

it that you just know that it has to happen.

8
9

MS. DARLING:

And I think it's important to

note, as George indicated and Chief Dennis and

10

Chief Johnson, that these joint training

11

exercises we live in a day and age where we mass

12

shootings, we have terrorism.

13

hope we never have those things of any scale in

14

Chicago, but it is very important that our first

15

responders are prepared for them.

16

joint exercises.

17

well designed to be able to deliver the ability

18

for fire and police to do joint training.

19
20
21

And, of course, we

And those are

And so this facility will be

Other questions?

Anything on public

safety or for us or our guests?
ALDERMAN SCOTT:

I want to say one other

22

thing.

You know, I just think that this is

23

really important.

24

looking for investment.

The west side is always
As a matter of fact, I

Veritext Legal Solutions

wish this was in North Lawndale as opposed to

being in Garfield Park.

2, 300 officers to a community everyday, they are

going to have to have a place to eat.

5

going to have to have a place to drop off their

a place to get their shoes shined.

8

to have to have all of these different things.

9

You know, when you bring

They are

So this investment I think will be

catalytic and help other investments around and

in the area.

12

community, which I don't think has been properly

13

-- I don't think the sentiments have been

14

conveyed about the community and the need for

15

this and the want for this actually.

And it is something that the

16

And so I just, you know, again,

17

implore when we're talking about community

18

outreach and how we are putting up a front face

19

forward, that we are eliminating all of these

20

things and the need and how this is going to be,

21

again, catalytic in what we're talking about in

22

terms of investment and how needed it is in a

23

community like Garfield Park.

24

MS. DARLING:

And as we do meet with the

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 48
1

community, we have tried to spread that message

2

thus far and we will continue to endeavor to do

3

that going forward.

4

AECOM team will bring.

5

outreach as part of their responsibilities.

6

And that's part of what the
And they have community

And I do want to just add that the

7

AECOM Joint Venture at this point is working

8

completely at risk.

9

They may not be paid and

10

11

12

we hope to be able to move forward and bring an

13

agreed project agreement to City Council as soon

14

as we are able.

15

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So they

Do you know is the --

16

Alderman, you might already be on top of this.

17

But to Alderman Scott's point, for the folks who

18

are doing the community work; are they armed with

19

like an impact study or something to the point of

20

like the local economy and impact, is that

21

happening?

22

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

I have not seen --

23

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

Not yet.

24

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

-- an impact study on what

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 49
1

this potentially could do.

2

Department of Planning is looking to bring

3

certain businesses to the Chicago Avenue

4

Corridor.

5

about stuff as simple as do we create a

6

cafeteria?

7

something in conjunction with City Colleges?

8

Those have been some moving parts that have still

9

yet to be defined, but overall we are looking for

We even continue to have conversations

Do we create a restaurant?

10

some economic impact.

11

as yet.

12

I do know the

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

Do we do

It has not been quantified

I would also like to add to

13

that real quickly.

14

Superintendent Johnson about his want for

15

community to be involved in some way, shape or

16

fashion in there being a community room.

17

how, you know, he wants to go out and talk to the

18

community about what it is that they want to see

19

in this community space where officers, both fire

20

and police, are able to engage with the community

21

and kind of just let them know what it is.

22

I have also talked to

And

You know, we talk a lot about officer

23

friendly in this day and age and how officer

24

friendly used to go to each one of the schools,

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 50
1

but, you know, there is nothing wrong with us

2

going out to meet officer friendly in their

3

backyard.

4

And so I know that the Superintendent

5

is very intent on making sure that that happens

6

and getting out in the community and seeing what

7

it is the police can do to kind of foster that

8

relationship and help with that as well.

9
10

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:
MS. CAFARO:

Yes.

Deb.

I just had a question.

I

11

assume the surrounding areas are designated as

12

opportunity zones under the new tax --

13

opportunity zone?

14
15

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

So I don't know

specifically.

16

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

17

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

More than likely.
But I know that like in 24,

18

which is not very far from there, pretty much

19

every corridor is an opportunity zone.

20

MS. CAFARO:

And maybe we could link some

21

private investment in through the opportunities

22

around this to build like an ecosystem of

23

economic activity as you are suggesting.

24

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

Hey, Alderman, do you know

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 51
1

if around and about that area, because I know you

2

are kind of on the board, is it -- has it been

3

designated an opportunity zone in the new tax

4

code?

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

I'm sensing that it is.

15

That's a good question.

Yes.

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

Yes, because this is an

it was not.

MS. CAFARO:

With an anchor investment like

7

this, like the alderman said that will be

8

generating a lot of activity, it would perhaps be

9

bringing in private investment especially given

10
11

federal tax incentives.
MS. DARLING:

We are working currently with

12

the Commissioner of the Department of Planning

13

Development and Commissioner Reynolds and I have

14

attended quite a few meetings on this.

15

specific to opportunity zones, but I have heard

16

the Commissioner of DPD speak on opportunity

17

zones just in the last 24 hours.

18

sure to bring that up to him and to his team and

19

see if there is anything else we can do to work

20

to further get more economic development, but

21

this is $85 million of economic development that

will be going into and that's construction jobs

8

high-level overview and talk briefly about where

we are on the project.

10

We have a couple of a additional projects

MS. DOWNEY:

Yes.

Do you want to give our

So the Chief

11

Sustainability Office, the Mayor's Office and 2FM

12

approached us earlier this year about doing some

13

kind of solar project for the city to help

14

catalyze the solar economy especially in light of

15

the Exelon bill or FEJA, Future Energy Jobs Act,

16

now providing a lot more incentives that would

17

kind of really help to catalyze some solar

18

projects within the City of Chicago boundaries.

19

In particular we were looking at the

20

Illinois Solar For All Project, which if you are

21

unaware of, kind of helps promote smaller

22

community solar projects in low income and

23

environmental justice communities.

24

very good renewable energy credit incentives to

developers, but also provides those communities

2

with low-cost solar subscription.

3

up to a savings of almost 50 percent on their

4

electric bills if they're in a qualified

5

community.

So it would be

had quite a lot of interest.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I'm sorry, for the seven

parcels of land, what is the total amount of land

5

we're talking about?

6

MS. DOWNEY:

It's roughly 30 acres.

All of

7

the sites are close to -- the minimum is about

8

1.7, but we have a site that is almost 10.

9

have a variety of different sizes and I think

10

it's 5 total.

11
12

So we

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

Sorry, I don't have the list with me.
MR. MARQUISOS:

The four wards that are

17

impacted are primarily on the south side.

There

18

is one site that is west side, but this was a

19

process that the Department of Planning kind of

20

led the site selection.

21

find parcels of land that were considered brown

22

fields that really had no plan for future

23

development for the next 15 years.

24

kind of -- and they had to have a certain minimum

So you really had to

So that was

Veritext Legal Solutions

888-391-3376

acreage of 1-and-a-half acres.

2

those criteria together, there just weren't that

3

many parcels that kind of rose to that metric.

4

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

5

MS. DOWNEY:

The lease is 15 years?

25-year lease and they get 15

6

years of incentives upfront.

7

the incentive system works.

8
9

MS. DARLING:

That's kind of how

We have a map that is on our

website, Alderman, and we will make sure that you

10

get that.

11

34, one in 27, 14.

I mean, I know there is one site in

12

MS. DOWNEY:

13

MS. DARLING:

14

So when you put

I think those are the -And 37.

But we will get you

the map.

15

MS. DOWNEY:

A lot of them are kind of

16

around like 120th and 122nd Street in the Pullman

17

area.

18

There are already a couple of them adjacent to

19

that and then there's a couple that are right

20

next to the big MWRD.

Like there is that big Pullman solar site.

21

MR. MARQUISOS:

22

MS. DOWNEY:

The Calumet facility.

The Calumet facility.

Those

23

are kind of like the four bigger sites that we're

24

looking at, but then there is a couple of others

Veritext Legal Solutions

888-391-3376

 Page 59

throughout the city.

2

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

3

MR. MARQUISOS:

Thank you.

And I'll just add the city

4

is being proactive in this initiative as Phoebe

5

noted so that the Illinois Solar For All Program

6

really isn't fully defined yet; but we felt that

7

its mission so aligned with the city's desire to

8

kind of create an opportunity for folks to enter

9

into the clean energy economy, that we wanted to

10

put forth projects so we were ready to be on the

11

list to be considered as soon as that project

12

becomes available.

13

the game in this case and we're looking forward

14

to a successful outcome.

15

MS. DARLING:

So I think we are ahead of

And the RFP, if I could add,

16

we really focussed on a provision of community

17

benefits as critical to this project.

18

just the reduction of electric bills for

19

community residents, but also job training, local

20

assembly of material, etcetera.

21

something we will be looking at critically as we

22

evaluate the proposals that we have received.

23
24

MS. DOWNEY:

So not

And so that's

And, in fact, that's the main

purpose of this project.

Like the city and 2FM

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 60
1

is looking at this more from the community

2

benefit side.

3

going to increase their renewable goals or

4

anything at this point.

5

that big of an effect just because they're

6

smaller sites.

7

catalyze stuff here in the city and get the job

8

training started and to get the community

9

benefits started and then maybe in the future

They're aware that it's not really

It's not going to have

But the goal was to kind of

10

look to bigger sites to do some of the stuff

11

towards their renewable goals as soon as they

12

started that training.

13

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

14
15

So I assume that they're

sort of local labor?
MS. DOWNEY:

Yes, so the Illinois Solar For

16

All Program but also within our RFP we required

17

that everybody provide some kind of job training

18

component to their development.

19

huge amount, but they have to like hire certain

20

people from certain programs under the work

21

created under FEJA in order to qualify for

22

Illinois Solar For All credits.

23
24

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So it's not a

Right, but separate from

the training, the workers on the projects

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 61
1

themselves; are they required to be union members

2

or was there --

3

MR. MARQUISOS:

We haven't gotten to that.

4

We are still reviewing proposals, but the

5

concept, and I think it's important to make it

6

clear; even though this is a solar clean energy

7

project, the goal here is not to reduce the

8

city's carbon footprint.

9

about global warming.

10

Right.

This is not

This is about an economic

stimulus package.

11

Like we believe that that FEJA bill

12

changed the environment for Illinois and we know

13

that there is a ton of solar development

14

happening in this state as a result of that bill

15

and we want to encourage some of that to come

16

into the city and that's what this is about.

17

we are trying to align ourselves with this small

18

portion of the FEJA bill that was Illinois Solar

19

For All which is a community project that really

20

is intended to provide a broad base of benefits

21

to what are called environmental justice

22

communities and that's the part that we're --

23
24

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And

If the city had any other

30-acre projects, there would be a project labor

agreement.

2

MR. MARQUISOS:

3

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

4

Yes.

does that exist here?

5

MS. DARLING:

6

ALDERMAN ERVIN:

7

MS. DARLING:

8

I don't want to -Is somebody online?

There was.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

10

know yet, that's okay.

11

MR. MARQUISOS:

12

MS. DARLING:

13

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

15

I think he dropped

off.

9

14

That's what I'm asking,

If the answer is we don't

We don't know yet.
We don't know yet.
On behalf of Jim and

Ralph I wanted to -MS. DOWNEY:

We are very aware that we have

16

tried to align the RFP and the process as much as

17

possible with what we knew about Illinois Solar

18

For All at the time and more details of that are

19

coming out.

20

requiring anything prohibitive that would prevent

21

anybody from applying for Illinois Solar For All

22

down the road just because that's the only way

23

financially we see kind of it working.

24

So we didn't want to do anything

MS. COOLIDGE:

Can I just ask a general

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 63
1

question?

2

community, how are we reaching those that are

3

looking to be part of the projects that live in

4

the communities?

5

with the --

6

So when we have these projects in the

MS. DOWNEY:

So I think that kind of aligns

That was one of things we

7

requested in the RFP was a community outreach

8

plan.

9

of the other FEJA, there have been quite a few

And within Illinois Solar For All and some

10

like local workforce training projects that have

11

happened and quite a lot of them are in the

12

communities that we're talking about.

13

that is kind of linking those people to the

14

eventual respondent would be part of our goal.

15

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

So some of

So you said 1.5 acres, is

16

that the minimum amount?

17

much land do they require so that it becomes cost

18

effective for the project?

19

MS. DOWNEY:

Or did you say -- how

I mean, really 2 acres, but we

20

did include a 1.75-acre site just because there

21

were others.

22

included in that, then it kind of makes it a bit

23

more feasible and it's very close to another

24

site.

Because there's other acres

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 64
1

MR. MARQUISOS:

The sweet spot is somewhere

2

between three and four acres.

3

really maximize the size.

4

MR. AFFRUNTI:

That's where you

So has anyone thought about

5

using some of the larger buildings like the

6

Merchandise Mart or the old post office for

7

something like this?

8
9

MR. MARQUISOS:

So we looked at a -- so this

is Chicago Solar Ground Mount and we view it as

10

just the toe in the pond if you will.

So we

11

looked at roofs and there was a lot of questions

12

about, you know, are these roofs good for 25

13

years.

14

complexity.

And so there was a whole bunch of

15

And we thought, you know, let's start

16

here.

Let's see where we go.

Let's see how this

17

plays out.

18

a really interesting one and getting subscribers

19

to commit to getting -- at no cost, and then the

20

return is that they are supposed to get a 50

21

percent reduction in utility bills for the next

22

15 years.

23

Can it really happen?

24

to prove out.

Because this community solar model is

That's a pretty significant thing.
So that's what we wanted

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 65
1

So, yes, so if this goes, you're going

2

to see parking lots covered with solar.

3

going to see roofs covered with solar.

4

going to start tumbling in my opinion.

5

MS. DARLING:

You're
It's all

And I think part of the, you

6

know, as Phoebe indicated, you know, part of the

7

goal of the project is to prove that Chicago can

8

sustain solar projects.

9

solar projects in the city except on kind of the

So I don't see a ton of

10

large buildings, Ralph, that you're talking

11

about.

12

of the large big box stores, etcetera.

13

to make sure that the city is the leader and

14

taking available property that we have and

15

converting it to creating green energy and green

16

jobs.

You know, there is solar panels on some

17

We wanted

So while the main goal isn't about

18

reducing our energy bills or meeting our

19

environmental goals for renewable power, it also

20

is a benefit in that area too because we want to

21

model that renewable power is an option and green

22

jobs are an option for the Chicago community.

23
24

MR. AFFRUNTI:

And IBEW Local 134 has built

a whole new training center solely for solar and

wind which brings in more people, good paying

2

jobs.

3

electrician that will just deal with those two

4

items, but it's an important thing for the future

5

to train people.

6

There will be a different kind of

MS. DARLING:

All right.

I know many of you

7

have other items and things to attend, and so I

8

appreciate your patience.

9

just update you on the 2FM replacement

Quickly we wanted to

facilities.

11

As you recall and as we have already

12

discussed today, these were replacing the

13

facilities previously at North and Throop.

14

took the main heavy duty repair facility, the

15

city fueling station and satellite heavy duty

16

repair facility and moved all of these to three

17

different locations throughout the city.

18

heard from Denise about how they have been doing

19

on their MBE/WBE and it's been very successful.

20

We

You

And so in what we believe to be record

21

time, we executed the agreement back in January

22

of this year, broke ground in April.

23

station is already open.

24

September 21st.

The fuel

That opened on

The satellite repair facility

Veritext Legal Solutions

888-391-3376

 Page 67
1

opens in just a couple of days on December 14th.

2

And our heavy duty repair facility will open in

3

January immediately after the biggest part of the

4

snow season.

5

So 2FM will be able to get in there.

6

We toured the facility very recently.

I welcome

7

all of you if you are interested in a tour, we

8

can set one up for you.

9

very, very quickly.

It has come together

The main facility in

questions on that, but that's a quick update

there.

19

It still has a lot

And we look forward to

Happy to answer any

Chicago Smart Lighting, I don't want

20

to belabor this one because we've talked about it

21

a ton, but there have been a lot of progress on

22

converting over 83,000 lights to LED from

23

high-pressure sodium.

24

conversions.

And there is the 2019

And we will have 75,000 LED

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 68
1

conversions for 2019.

2

And then, George, do you want to kind

3

of give a more -- slightly more detailed update

4

on where we're at?

5

our energy efficiency rebates.

6

I especially want to address

MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes, so this is a four-year

7

initiative.

We finished year one.

We are in the

8

middle of year two and it's working out.

9

this project was intended to be an infrastructure

Again,

10

modernization that provided benefits,

11

multifaceted benefits, to the citizens of

12

Chicago.

13

light, more reliable lights.

14

would also serve as an economic stimulus that

15

we're making $150 million investment on our

16

lighting infrastructure and we want to make sure

17

that those dollars are well spent.

18

The one benefit would be higher quality
But also that it

So where are we almost half way

19

through this project?

I think that the two

20

targeted communities on the south and west side

21

are completely done.

22

street, every arterial is converted to LED.

23

There is a lighting management system that gives

24

realtime information about how those lights are

So every alley, every

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 69

performing.

2

just put it this way, we were kind of late to the

3

game to convert to the LED.

4

curve in having a lighting management system that

5

is around the city.

6

And the city I think has -- let's

We were ahead of the

I think the LED conversion has gone

7

really well.

I think the technology we are just

8

now understanding the benefits, the possible

9

benefits, of all this data about our

10

streetlights.

So we are getting folks trained.

11

They are doing analytics.

12

information not just to measure energy

13

consumption, whether lights are on or off; but

14

really to take that data and see if they can

15

refine their troubleshooting efforts to really

16

understand based on reports that they get

17

extracted from this network as to where things

18

are failing and when and how, spikes in

19

electricity.

20

complex than we thought, but I think it's going

21

to yield benefits that we really didn't

22

anticipate.

They are using this

It turned out to be much more

23

Speaking of unanticipated benefits, we

24

have qualified for ComEd rebates far in excess of

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 70
1

what we ever anticipated.

2

even included rebates in its financial modeling.

3

As a back pocket we said that we were going to

4

put in $6 million because that was kind of a

5

reasonable expectation based on the old.

6

This project never

And so far we have achieved $10

7

million and we are -- that only includes those

8

83,000 lights.

9

million in rebates from ComEd over the course of

And we are on track to get $35

10

this project.

That has been a really good

11

outcome and ComEd has been a great partner.

12

we took advantage of kind of a unique period in

13

late 2017 where transitioning from the Department

14

of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to ComEd

15

where there was some very generous rebates, and

16

we modified our installation to maximize the

17

those rebates.

18

streets that really reduced wattage and we got a

19

huge bang for the dollar.

20

invested in streetlights, we got 75 cents back in

21

2017.

And

So we did a bunch of arterial

For every dollar we

So that was a wonderful thing.

22

And, you know, but that's a benefit

23

that we didn't count on; but you do this kind of

24

thing and you open yourselves up for those kind

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

of benefits.
MS. DARLING:

And I want to just add -- I'm

3

sorry to interrupt you, George.

4

been the person who engineered all of that.

5

he was aware of the rebates and made sure that we

6

took advantage of it and drove the process

7

working with our partners at CDOT to make sure

8

that the lights that we were putting in did

9

maximize or the fixtures that we were putting in

10

But George has
So

did maximize those rebates.

11

And so I want to give a lot of credit

12

to George and for the, you know, amount of money

13

we get from the city every year, we have covered

14

that both in savings between Retrofit One and

15

savings from this multiple fold.

16

been a really great thing that has helped assist

17

the project in a great way.

18

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And so that's

George, the original

19

financial model was relying more on the utility

20

savings themselves, right?

21

MR. MARQUISOS:

22

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

23
24

Yes.
How are we tracking with

those?
MR. MARQUISOS:

So another conversation with

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 72
1

ComEd, and I won't bore you with all the details;

2

but in short, part of this project was doing a

3

pole-by-pole visit of every streetlight.

4

now have this new inventory.

5

now been transmitted to ComEd and it becomes the

6

new billing database.

7

set of streetlight billing accounts that go live

8

literally this week.

9

And we

That inventory has

So there is a whole new

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

At the time there was

10

billing without really common, you know, mutual

11

understanding of like what all the lights are and

12

what should be.

13

MR. MARQUISOS:

And in addition to that and

14

ComEd has really kind of stepped up in this

15

regard.

16

light strategy.

17

going to degrade over time because they get

18

dirty.

19

slightly less than their maximum efficiency

20

because we anticipate 15 years from now we are

21

going to have to turn them back up to maintain

22

the same level of light.

23

for that dimming.

24

the nameplate wattage, we're getting a dimming

So we have what's called a continuous
So we know that these lights are

So we are basically deploying them at

ComEd is crediting us

So we're not just paying on

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 73
1

credit as part of our bill.

2

juices, if you will, the savings.

3

So that kind of

And we were shooting for 60 percent

4

reduction when we convert, we are averaging

5

somewhere around 56 percent which is pretty good.

6

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

7

MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes.

So that's all relatively

8

good news.

9

to report on the minority participation, the

10

And then, Alderman Scott, I just want

diversity plan, and how that's going.

11

Again, this is a moving target because

12

we keep issuing work orders and it changes as we

13

spend dollars, but as of November 15th we had a

14

--well, I'll just start.

15

goal was 26 percent of dollars spent going to

16

minority contractors and we are currently at

17

33.25 percent.

18

we're at 7.92 percent.

19

residency requirement, we are at 64 percent.

20

we had 10 percent of those residents had to come

21

from the socially economically disadvantaged

22

areas, we are at 36 percent.

23
24

The overall project

6 percent was the goal for WBE,
We had a 50 percent
And

So these are metrics that are
exceeding our expectations and I think the, you

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 74
1

know, this is an investment that is reaping

2

benefits for the citizens.

3

we're installing are assembled in Chicago.

4

Half the lights that

So it's a good story, right.

I mean,

5

we are creating opportunity.

6

went pole to pole to pole for 7 months, those

7

were all new hires from this socially economic

8

area.

9

those jobs and they got trained in the process.

10

Those folks who

And they were very, very grateful for

So, you know, it's a good story.

11

We continue to deal with -- I'll be

12

quite honest, the response to outages isn't what

13

it should be.

14

realtime information is going to be integrated

15

into the new 311 system.

16

the day we're going to really redefine how CDOT

17

and their department of electric operations

18

really responds to light issues.

We are improving on that and this

19

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

20

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

I think at the end of

That's great.
So you kind of answered my

21

question I was going to ask you about.

I know

22

that there is smart lights and they should be

23

connecting with some kind of interface that kind

24

of allows folks to know when lights are out.

I

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 75
1

wanted to know has that been enabled yet because

2

the response time is not where we would want it

3

to be.

4

MR. MARQUISOS:

5

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

Fair enough.
And has that happened?

6

then when do you think we will have a better

7

response time?

8
9

And

And then secondly there are, and I
know that CDOT is working on this, and wondered

10

is this part of the windfall that we've gotten

11

back.

12

one side of the street is -- one side of the

13

street just has lights, the other side does not

14

and, you know, usually they're kind of one --

But there are some spots on blocks where

15

MR. MARQUISOS:

16

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

Staggered.
Staggered on either side.

17

And when you have the one side and you reduce the

18

height of the light or pole because we now

19

control the dispersement of the light and it's

20

not all around, that there are darker spots on

21

blocks that have that one side.

22

And so what, you know, I know CDOT is

23

working on something.

Is the money that we're

24

receiving, is that helping with that?

And then

Veritext Legal Solutions

888-391-3376

 Page 76

the answer to the question when do we know about

2

the response time?

3

better?

4

MS. DARLING:

5

MR. MARQUISOS:

6

MS. DARLING:

When will that get a little

Let me address if I could.
Sure.
So CDOT is managing working

7

with individual Aldermen on specific complaints.

8

I am happy to provide -- if you have a specific

9

area that you're concerned about.

10

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

Well, no.

They're working

11

with me.

12

receive that rebate, are we using that rebate to

13

kind of help with the offset?

14

I was just wondering if because we did

MS. DARLING:

There are options that are

15

available separate and apart from the additional

16

funds to make sure that you're getting the

17

lighting that you need in your ward.

18

should continue to work with CDOT.

19

So you

And I know that they have worked

20

really hard to make sure through Commissioner

21

Scheinfeld and her deputy -- First Deputy Tom

22

Carney, they worked really hard to set up a

23

program to address kind of a block-by-block basis

24

if there is a specific issue.

And that's, you

Veritext Legal Solutions

 Page 77
1

know, that's all in on the budget and they'll

2

work with you on that.

3

a need -- you know, they'll address your need

4

regardless of whether there is additional funding

5

that comes in.

6

is addressed for you.

There is room to make sure that

7

ALDERMAN SCOTT:

8

MS. DARLING:

9

So I don't think there is

Okay.

Obviously it's a change in the

kind of light that you addressed with the

10

dispersion is different and not the 360-degree

11

light.

12

people getting used to that; but if you have

13

significant dark spots, CDOT is working with

14

Aldermen on that on a situation-by-situation

15

basis.

16

So part of that is an adjustment and

MR. AFFRUNTI:

I have a question.

So when

17

we first introduced this we talked about like

18

lighting up an area when there is an issue in the

19

area like what happened at the hospital last

20

week.

21

we did, how did the first responders -- did you

22

get any feedback from the first responders?

23
24

Have we done that yet somewhere?

MR. MARQUISOS:

And if

So what you're talking about

is because we have a lighting management system,

Veritext Legal Solutions
www.veritext.com

888-391-3376

 Page 78
1

we now have the ability to do this kind of

2

managed lighting and that has not been

3

implemented in any way at this point.

4

MR. AFFRUNTI:

5

MR. MARQUISOS:

Okay.
So aside from the fact that

6

we are doing consistent light levels over the

7

useful life for the light, there is no proactive

8

kind of, you know -- and I think that is

9

something that could not only to light up areas

10

in levels of distress, but also I think there is

11

large areas of the city that don't get any

12

traffic during the night.

13

light levels to save energy because you have

14

predicted analytics to say there is industrial

15

corridors that really have no pedestrian traffic.

16

So those are opportunities as we kind of move

17

forward to kind of get that kind of thing going,

18

but right now that is not in play.

City of Chicago to participate in this program.

2

We have closed loans in 49 out of 50 of the city

3

wards.

4

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Who is the outstanding

6

MS. DARLING:

12.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

5

8

ward?
12.

We can't get 12.

Do you want to tell

George he's leaving money on the table.

9

MS. DARLING:

Right.

So we have closed 281

10

loans to the tune of almost $60 million of

11

economic development in Chicago neighborhoods in

12

helping people buy homes.

13

we only have 12 open loans right now, but a total

14

of just over about $61.5 million.

15

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

16

MS. DARLING:

Yes.

Because of the season

And that's program total?
That's program total.

17

So now we have reached the public comment and I

18

don't think there is any public here.

19

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I don't think we have

any.
MS. DARLING:

We don't require executive

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So I'll entertain --

well, do we have a quorum to adjourn?
