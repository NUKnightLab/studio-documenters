District(s): 14
Summary:

This payment request is for final payment for construction of Camp Reinberg under a

contract that expired on March 23, 2017. Camp Reinberg opened in 2015 with conditional approval from
the Palatine Fire Protection District (“Palatine FPD”) that the seasonal sprinkler system for the four (4)
unheated small cabins in the camp must be winterized even if the cabins are closed in the winter. The cost
to winterize the sprinkler system was significant, so the Forest Preserves requested a waiver to leave the
cabins unprotected during the winter and explore the feasibility of heating the cabins to allow for winter
use.

The cost to heat the cabins and meet the County and local codes proved to be unfeasible, and

additional time was needed to revert to plans to winterize the sprinkler system only.

All work has been

completed, but one remaining defective part must be replaced before final testing and inspection. Payment
would be released upon final inspection and approval of the system by Palatine FPD and receipt of all
appropriate documentation from the contractor.

A motion was made by Vice Chair Deer, seconded by Commissioner Morrison, to recommend
for approval 19-0117. The motion carried by the following vote:
Ayes:

Arroyo, Deer, Britton, Daley, Degnen, Gainer, Johnson, Lowry, Miller, Morrison,
