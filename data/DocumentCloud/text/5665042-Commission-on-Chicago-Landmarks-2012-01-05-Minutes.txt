The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

720 S. Michigan
(Historic Michigan Boulevard District – 2nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed storefront alterations, new exterior lighting sconces and construction
of a new canopy on Michigan Avenue.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The proposed canopy is approved as submitted. Historic Preservation staff
shall review and approve finish samples for the canopy and new entrances;
2. Lighting sconce specifications and attachment details shall be included in
the permit application; and,
3. Signage details shall be submitted for Historic Preservation staff review
and approval.

2.

319 W. Concord
(Old Town Triangle District – 43rd Ward)
Revised Proposal:

Action:

Proposed renovation of the single-family residence including
construction of a new foundation, rear addition with basement, new
dormers and rear masonry garage.

Approved with the following conditions (vote was 2 in favor with
Commissioner Baird against):
1. Report and drawings by a licensed structural engineer addressing how the
historic facades and roof should be supported, braced and protected, in-situ,

 2.

during the demolition of the exterior portions of the building and the
interior structure and the excavation and construction of the new addition
as well as during the foundation work, shall be included on the permit
plans. The report should include recommended measures and sequencing
plan;
As proposed, non-historic siding shall be removed from all elevations of
the existing building. Upon removal of the non-historic siding, Historic
Preservation staff shall inspect and confirm whether any historic wood
siding remains at the north (front) and east facades. Historic siding shall be
retained and be repaired, if possible. Areas beyond repair may be replaced
with new wood siding to match the historic siding in size and profile.
Fiber-cement siding, as submitted, may be used as a substitute cladding
material on the west elevation of the existing building and all elevations of
the existing and proposed additions. This siding shall have a smooth finish
and otherwise match the wood siding in size and profile. Details and
material samples of the existing and proposed siding shall be reviewed and
approved by Historic Preservation staff as part of the permit application;
The second-floor window openings at the front façade shall be restored to
match the historic opening sizes based on the physical evidence uncovered
at the building. The existing two-over-two wood windows may be replaced
with new two-over-two wood or clad-wood windows. The new windows
may be true-divided lite or simulated-divided lite windows matching the
exterior profiles of the existing wood windows. Details of the existing and
proposed windows shall be included with the permit plans;
Details of new trim and window surrounds at front façade shall be based on
any physical evidence that may be uncovered after the removal of nonhistoric siding. Should no evidence be found, the design of these elements
may be based on similar historic properties in the district. Details of the
trim and window surrounds shall be included on the permit plans;
As proposed, the existing 1st floor masonry shall be repointed and repainted. Staff encourages the applicant to consider removing the paint and
leaving the brick exposed to be more consistent with the historic
appearance of the building. Should any replacement of brick be required,
the replacement brick shall match the historic in size, color, texture and
finish. Pointing mortar shall match original in type, color and joint profile;
Any structural repair work proposed to the existing roof to remain shall
maintain the existing ridge and eave heights and roof slopes (i.e., by
aligning the top of any new structural member with the top of the existing
structural member);
As proposed, the existing dormers on the west side of the existing roof
shall be removed to restore the historic roofline of the building; and,
The two new dormers are approved as proposed. The siding on the new
dormers shall be fiber-cement siding painted to match the color of the
roofing material. The siding shall have a smooth finish and otherwise
match the existing wood siding in size, profile, and finish.

 In addition, staff recommends that the Committee finds that the amount of
demolition involved with the project, based upon the submitted information,
does not trigger the requirements of Section 2-120-825 governing the
demolition of 40% or more of landmark buildings.
3.

2 S. Halsted
(Mid-City Trust and Savings Bank Proposed Landmark – 27th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed conceptual review of a 3-story roof-top addition, reconstruction of
the missing cornice, new windows, two new storefront entrances, a new
canopy, and a new projecting sign.

Action:

The Committee voted unanimously to provide the following guidance:
1. The roof-top addition shall be limited to one-story with its maximum height,
as measured from grade to the highest point of the roofline, not to exceed 88’;
2. The minimum setback of any addition from the primary elevations, as
measured from the exterior plane of the street facades shall be no less than
16’4” from the Halsted Street facade and 17’7” from the Madison Avenue
façade. No setback is required from the secondary elevations;
3. The additions must be part of a larger building rehabilitation (i.e., building
envelope and structure, new mechanical systems, code-mandated
requirements) and restoration of the primary facades (i.e., masonry cleaning
and repair as necessary; recreation of the building’s cornice based on historic
photos on the primary elevations, and with all work consistent with the
standards and guidelines); and,
4. A structural analysis and code analysis shall confirm that the roof-top addition
can be done without adversely impacting the building and the proposed
interior designated spaces (including during construction).

4.

2 S. Halsted
(Mid-City Trust and Savings Bank Proposed Landmark – 27th Ward)
Permit Application:

Action:

Proposed 6’ x 60’ non-illuminated vinyl sign mounted on east masonry
parapet

Approved unanimously with the following condition:
As indicated by the applicant, the sign is intended to be temporary and will be
removed as soon as a lease for the building is completed. The applicant shall
provide a written letter to the Commissioner of the Department of Buildings when

Landmarks staff). Any new permanent sign for the building will be approved
only after the subject sign has been removed, and will have to meet the
