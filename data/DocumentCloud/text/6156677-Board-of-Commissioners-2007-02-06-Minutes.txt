PROPOSED ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 58, Article V, Section
164 is hereby enacted as follows:
Sec. 58-164. Motor Vehicles, Seizure and Impoundment.
(a) Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different
meaning:
Owner of record of a vehicle means the record title holder.
(b) Owner liability; exceptions. The owner of record of any motor vehicle that violates any of the
qualified violations as set forth in Section 58-165 shall be liable to the County for an administrative
penalty of $500.00 plus any towing and storage fees applicable under this division. Any such vehicle shall
be subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this division. This subsection shall not apply if:
(1) The vehicle used in the violation was stolen at the time and the theft was reported to the
appropriate police authorities within 24 hours after the theft was discovered or reasonably should have
been discovered; or
(2) The vehicle is operating as a common carrier and the violation occurs without the knowledge
of the person in control of the vehicle; or
(c) Seizure and impoundment. Whenever the sheriff or his agent has probable cause to believe that a
vehicle is subject to a seizure and impoundment pursuant to this division, the sheriff shall provide for the
towing of the vehicle to a facility controlled by the County or its agents. Before or at the time the vehicle
is towed, the Sheriff shall notify any person identifying himself/herself as the owner of the vehicle or any
person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation of the fact of the
seizure and of the alleged violation and of the vehicle owner's right to request a vehicle impoundment
hearing to be conducted under this section. The sheriff may issue rules and regulations related to this
Section for enforcement notification procedures and proper forms necessary for administration of this
Section.

619

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2007
(d) Vehicle impoundment hearing. Whenever the owner of record of a vehicle seized pursuant to this
division makes a request in person and in writing for a vehicle impoundment hearing within 12 hours
after the seizure, a hearing officer of the County shall conduct the vehicle impoundment hearing within 24
hours after the seizure excluding Sundays and legal holidays. All interested persons shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to be heard at the vehicle impoundment hearing. The formal and technical rules of
evidence shall not apply in the conduct of the hearing. Evidence, including hearsay, may be admitted only
if it is a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. If, after
the hearing, the hearing officer determines that there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle is
subject to seizure and impoundment under Subsection (a), the hearing officer shall order the continued
impoundment of the vehicle as provided in this division unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the
County a cash bond in the amount of $500.00 plus any applicable towing and storage fees.
(e) Notification of impoundment; hearing scheduled; failure of owner to appear; determination;
penalty. Within ten days after a vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to this division, the County
shall notify by certified mail, return receipt requested, the owner of record of the date, time and location
of a hearing that will be conducted pursuant to this division. The hearing shall be scheduled and held,
unless continued by order of the hearing officer, no later than 30 days after the vehicle was seized. The
hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer of the County. All interested persons shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines by a
preponderance of evidence that the vehicle violated this Section and that none of the exceptions described
in Subsections (b)(1)--(b)(2) of this section applies, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding the
owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the County for an administrative penalty in the amount of
$500.00. If the owner of record fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing officer shall enter a default order
in favor of the County requiring the payment to the County of an administrative penalty in the amount of
$500.00. If the hearing officer finds that no such violation occurred, the hearing officer shall order the
immediate return of the owner's vehicle or cash bond.
(f) Administrative penalty constitutes debt owing to County. If an administrative penalty is imposed
pursuant to this division, such penalty shall constitute a debt due and owing to the County. If a cash bond
has been posted pursuant to this division, the bond shall be applied to the penalty. If a vehicle has been
impounded when such a penalty is imposed, the County may seek to obtain judgment against the vehicle
or enforce such judgment against the vehicle as provided by law. Except as provided otherwise in this
division, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until:
(1) The penalty, plus any applicable towing and storage fees, is paid to the County, in which
case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is legally entitled to possess the vehicle; or
(2) The vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment or enforce a lien as
provided by law. If the administrative penalty and applicable fees are not paid within 30 days after an
administrative penalty is imposed under Subsection (e) of this section against an owner of record who
defaults by failing to appear at the hearing, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed
of in the manner provided for by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles. In all other cases, if the
administrative penalty and applicable fees are not paid within 30 days after the expiration of time at
which administrative review of the hearing officer's determination may be sought, or within 30 days after
an action seeking administrative review has been resolved in favor of the County, whichever is
applicable, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law
for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles.

620

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2007
Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no owner, lien holder or other person shall be legally
entitled to take possession of a vehicle impounded under this section until the civil penalty and fees
applicable under this division have been paid. However, whenever a person with a lien of record against
an impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the vehicle shall be given
to that person if the person agrees in writing to refund to the County the amount of the net proceeds of
any foreclosure sale, less any amounts required to pay all lien holders of record, up to $500.00 plus the
applicable fees.
Sec. 58-165. Qualified Violations for Impoundment.

requesting approval of payment in the amount of $197,805.00 to McKesson Drug for the flu vaccine.

2007, Contract No. 05-42-525 with Dempsey, Myers & Company, LLP, Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose
of providing consulting and auditing services to the County for the reconciliation of the fire loss at the
Cook County Administration Building.

662

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2007

Reason:

The contract with Dempsey, Myers & Company, LLP, was for a one year term commencing
April 6, 2005, and was for a contract sum of $175,000.00. Of that amount, $59,058.19 has
been expended. The services provided included a complete review and documentation of the
County’s total property loss; extensive negotiations with Continental Casualty Company
(“CNA”) and its auditors; extensive meetings with County representatives to compile

County’s claim. CNA has reimbursed the County a total of $16,246,234.00 for the fire loss.
CNA did not provide a full response to the County’s claim until the fall of 2006. The
remaining disputed issues are significant, with a value of approximately $2,000,000.00 and
will require continued expert assistance from Dempsey, Myers & Company, LLP, in order to
reach a favorable settlement.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract extension: April 6, 2006 through September 30, 2007.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2007
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Elections Subcommittee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Wednesday, January 31, 2007 at the hour of 9:45 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building,
118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following item(s) and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
284401

COOK COUNTY CLERK, David Orr, by Brandon Neese, Deputy County Clerk,
transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with MAJOR
SCALE TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT, INC. (SPECIFICALLY KEVIN
MCDERMOTT AS SENIOR CONSULTANT), Oak Park, Illinois, for support in
implementing the recommendations contained in the report of the Election Review Panel
and for assistance in developing additional capability within the Clerk’s office to support
those recommendations. Mr. McDermott will conduct additional analyses of issues
raised by the report. He will also assist in oversight of Sequoia Voting Systems’
implementation of those recommendations that are the direct responsibility of the vendor,
and will monitor governance of tests and protocols. Additionally, he will continue to
work with the Election Review Panel as it continues in its advisory role to the Clerk’s
office.
Reason:

Major Scale Technology Management, Inc. (Kevin McDermott as consultant)
served as staff to the Election Review Panel established by the County Clerk’s
office after the November 7th 2006 general election. He managed and
coordinated the work of the Election Review Panel and the preparation of the
Election Review Panel’s report. In addition to his specific knowledge of
elections, the problems that occurred with transmission of election results, and
the identified recommendations, he has considerable knowledge of issued
related to technology and operation management.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $50,000.00. Contract period: January 23, 2007 through
November 30, 2007. (524-260 Account). Requisition No. 75240008.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2007 funds.
* Referred to the Elections Subcommittee on 01/23/07.
284416

COOK COUNTY CLERK, David Orr, by Brandon Neese, Deputy County Clerk,
transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with DANIEL
M. MURPHY, Long Beach, California, to develop a new training module for our
election judges and equipment managers; and to establish new training programs,
including developing training manuals for several critical functions pertaining to election
preparation and election day operations. The latter will include assisting our warehouse
staff with developing a structure for providing pre-LAT training, developing and
conducting training for our election day Call Center personnel; and assisting with
development of a new training and operations plan for our Repair Stations.

742

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2007

Reason:

Daniel M. Murphy has knowledge of election operations and experience
developing training programs and materials for election workers in
jurisdictions around the country. He is a professional trainer. Of particular
value to us is the fact that he has worked with other jurisdictions that use
Sequoia voting equipment, and thus he is very familiar with how the
equipment works, and already has experience training election workers on the
set up, use, maintenance and repair of the equipment.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $30,000.00. Contract period: January 29, 2007 through
November 30, 2007. (524-260 Account). Requisition No. 75240020.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2007 funds.
* Referred to the Elections Subcommittee on 01/23/07.
Brandon Neese, Deputy County Clerk provided an overview of the first contract with Major Scale
Technology Management, Inc., with Kevin McDermott as consultant. Mr. McDermott is to function as a
special trainer for the County Election Division, and oversee and direct all the testing done on the election
equipment, which was one of the primary recommendations of the panel.
Mr. Neese then described the contract with Daniel M. Murphy. Mr. Murphy worked with the Clerk’s
office last year and was responsible for putting together the successful equipment manager program. He
will be working with the municipal and township clerks who are doing early voting, with the equipment
managers that will be staffing those sites, and will put together training for the warehouse employees.
Chairman Suffredin asked whether the Clerk’s office would be amendable to an amendment that would
require weekly reports to the Elections Subcommittee on the work performed by these two consultants
while the County prepares for the February 27 and April elections.
Mr. Neese responded affirmatively.
Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Sims, moved to amend Communication Nos.
284401 and 284416 to include language that requires the contracted entities to submit weekly
reports to the Elections Subcommittee members. The motion carried unanimously.
Chairman Suffredin stated that the Elections Subcommittee will convene meetings that will include the
Clerk’s office as the elections get closer, to make sure that all issues are addressed.
Commissioner Beavers asked whether Sequoia ever dealt with cellular transmissions anywhere else in the
United States.
Mr. Neese responded in the negative, and further responded that there is not an election authority besides
Cook County and the City of Chicago that transmits election results from the precinct or from remote
sites.

743

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2007
Commissioner Beavers also asked whether there has been any dialogue regarding combining the County
Clerk’s Elections Divisions and the City of Chicago’s Board of Elections.
Mr. Neese replied that the idea is something that could and should be looked at, and that the Clerk’s
office would be pleased to be involved in such discussions.
Commissioner Murphy asked how the approval of these two contracts would speed up the elections
returns.
Mr. Neese responded that the primary problem experienced on election night in November was the rate of
transmission, both from the precinct and again from the receiving station. This process will be tested
fully and the transmission rate goal is expected to be ninety percent from the precinct. Additionally, there
will be a back up system at the receiving stations which would be done from a wired mechanism.
In response to Commissioner Murphy’s question pertaining to early voting tabulation procedures, Mr.
Neese stated that the cartridges are brought in to the downtown office on the Thursday prior to the
election, they are secured and are held until Election Day, then loaded into the tally system. Mr. Neese
further stated that the early votes and precinct downloads will not take place at the same time.
Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Sims, moved that Communication Nos. 284401
and 284416 be approved, as amended. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Murphy moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Sims. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

AN ORDINANCE FOR THE CREATION OF AN ELECTION INTEGRITY
COMMISSION (PROPOSED ORDINANCE). Submitting a Proposed Ordinance
sponsored by Elizabeth “Liz” Doody Gorman, County Commissioner.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance:

746

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2007
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
AN ORDINANCE FOR THE CREATION OF
AN ELECTION INTEGRITY COMMISSION
WHEREAS, approximately 24 million dollars was appropriated for the Cook County
Clerk to obtain two new electronic voting systems to improve the conduct of our
elections; and
WHEREAS, two elections have now been held using these new electronic voting
systems; and
WHEREAS, these two elections have been fraught with events that are indicative of
mishaps or more in the conduct of the election in general and particularly with regard to
the two new electronic voting systems; and
WHEREAS, the public notoriety given to these mishaps occurring before, during and
after the General Election held in Cook County on Tuesday, November 7, 2006 has raised
grave concerns among the voters and candidates as to whether these elections were fair
and honest; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners appropriates funding for the
conduct of these elections and has an obligation to the taxpayers of Cook County to
ensure that the funds appropriated are expended prudently; and
WHEREAS, it is essential that the Cook County Board undertake an inquiry into the
propriety of the expenditure of these appropriations with regard to the question of
whether the General Election of November 7, 2006 resulted in, among other questions,
the new electronic voting systems allowing each voter to vote for the candidate and
public policy issues of his/her choice and whether these systems allowed the votes to be
correctly counted in the precincts and reported to the County Clerk.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE BOARD OF

284419

COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS, by Todd. H. Stroger, President,
transmitting a Communication, dated January 22, 2007:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with
RICHARD R. BOYKIN AND CRAIG BURKHARDT of Barnes & Thornburg, LLP,
Chicago, Illinois and Washington D.C., whose names I am submitting for consideration
as County Lobbyists. Mr. Boykin and Mr. Burkhardt will serve for a period of one year
beginning February 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007, in the amount of $100,000.00,
plus expenses not to exceed $10,000.00.
Reason:

It is important that the individuals be approved as soon as possible in order to
guarantee lobbying services before the federal government.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $110,000.00. Contract period: February 1, 2007 through
December 31, 2007. (490-260 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2007 funds.
* Referred to the Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental and Veterans
Relations on 01/23/07.
Vice Chairman Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved the approval of
Communication Nos. 283661 and 284419.
Prior to opening up discussion on the two contracts up for approval, Chairman Suffredin introduced
Derek Blaida from the Office of the President. His background includes previous experience with the
Chicago Board of Education as their chief lobbyist, and with the City of Chicago as part of Mayor
Daley’s team in Springfield.

748

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2007
Mr. Blaida provided an overview of the two lobbying contracts up for approval. He introduced Richard
R. Boykin of the lobbying firm of Barnes and Thornburg, LLP, who, along with his partner Craig
Burkhardt, would be the County’s lobbyists in Washington, D.C. to ensure federal representation. Mr.
Blaida then introduced Stephen S. Morrill, who has been on retainer for several years with the County to
represent the County’s interests in Springfield.
In response to questions from Commissioners Goslin and Quigley pertaining to existing County lobbyist
representation in Washington, D.C. and Springfield, Chairman Suffredin and Mr. Blaida explained that
the contract with Barnes and Thornburg, LLP would be replacing an existing contract that expires at the
end of March with Ungaretti and Harris. Ungaretti and Harris’ contract included services specifically
related to intergovernmental transfer issues. Additionally, they were retained to work on changes in rules
and regulations with Speaker Hastert’s office, and to negotiate with Governor Blagojevich’s office.
Susan J. White and Associates, provides lobbying services in Washington, D.C. that are related
specifically to health care issues. Mr. Blaida added that her contract expires in the summer of 2007, and
will be re-evaluated prior to its expiration.
Chairman Suffredin stated that the County had contracts for Springfield representation with Stephen
Morrill and Eugene Barnes. These contracts expired in December of 2006, and Mr. Morrill’s is the only
contract related to Springfield currently being brought before the Board.
Chairman Suffredin elaborated upon the anticipated role and duties that Messrs. Boykin and Burkhardt
would be assuming upon approval of their contract. He stated that they would have a broader role than
Ungaretti & Harris, as they would be helping the County on programs dealing with environmental and
transportation issues, and would be assessing other statutory changes that would be beneficial to the
County. Chairman Suffredin also noted that as Congress is now under Democratic control, the County
has a greater opportunity to open up other programs in addition to health care issues.
Commissioner Quigley voiced his concerns regarding the lack of coherent representation of County
positions on bills and the lack of communication between the County and the General Assembly in
previous years.
Chairman Suffredin explained that Mr. Blaida’s role is to professionalize the operation, and he will be
reporting to the Board periodically. He stated that Mr. Blaida will be coordinating and organizing all
lobbying efforts, and would ensure that communications in this regard are coherent.
In response to Commissioner Quigley’s question regarding improvements to existing lobbying efforts,
Mr. Morrill stated that there would be a focus on timeliness of communication efforts, as it is a consistent
theme in relation to effective lobbying in Springfield.
With regard to improvements to lobbying efforts at the Federal level, Mr. Boykin suggested that the
County develop a federal budget priority list similar to that which the City of Chicago produces and
presents annually.
Commissioner Beavers stated that it is important for the County to develop a Federal priority list; he
emphasized his belief that the County should adopt similar lobbying practices as the City of Chicago.
Commissioners Silvestri and Steele indicated that they were looking forward to a greater coordination and
streamlining of lobbying and communication services with the State Legislature and Congress.

749

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2007
Chairman Suffredin and Commissioners Beavers, Silvestri and Goslin stressed the importance of
representation for the County in order to effectively promote the County’s interests in competing for
funds at the State and Federal level.
Commissioners Beavers, Goslin and Sims also highlighted the importance of the roles of the
Commissioners in current and future lobbying efforts; each related their previous experiences and
involvement in lobbying efforts at the federal level. Some Commissioners expressed interest in
continuing these efforts in a coordinated manner.
Commissioners Gorman, Daley and Collins expressed concern over potential conflicts of interest that may
arise for the contractual lobbyists as a result of positions taken by their other clients.
Chairman Suffredin explained that this concern is addressed within the contracts with the lobbyists, and
one of Mr. Blaida’s functions is to monitor any potential conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of
positions taken by other clients of the contractual lobbyists.
Commissioner Daley indicated that in addition to his concerns over potential conflicts of interest, he also
had concerns over approving these contracts while budget negotiations are still underway. He felt that the
Board should hold off on all contracts such as these until the budget is approved.
Commissioner Collins expressed her concerns about the structure and cohesiveness of the lobbying team,
and remarked that she did not feel that this was a top priority.
Commissioner Beavers expressed his opinion that the County could not afford to be unrepresented in
Washington, D.C. and Springfield.
Commissioner Peraica requested information on dollars expended on lobbying efforts in both
Washington, D.C. and Springfield.
Mr. Blaida answered that the contractual representation is as follows: it includes the contracts before the
committee for Barnes & Thornburg, LLP for $110,000 and for Stephen S. Morrill for $70,000;
additionally, Susan J. White and Associates’ contract which expires mid-2007 and will be re-evaluated
prior to expiration is for $130,000; finally, the County’s contract with Ungaretti & Harris, which expires
March 31, 2007 and will not be renewed, is for $135,000. In response to Commissioner Peraica’s
question pertaining to his own salary in his position as Special Assistant to the President for Government
Affairs, Mr. Blaida responded that his salary is $111,170.
Commissioner Gorman requested information on whether State Senator Ricky Hendon is contractually
representing the County.
Chairman Suffredin replied that he did not believe so, and Mr. Blaida stated that he would confirm the
answer to her question.
Chairman Suffredin stated that he agreed with Commissioner Beavers on the point of lost time and
effectiveness if the County’s interests were not represented in Washington, D.C. and Springfield. He
pointed out that if it is the will of the body to defer these contracts because the budget is not finalized, the
County may lose some funding opportunities that would impact the budget.
Commissioner Silvestri asked Mr. Blaida if the County is currently represented in Springfield.

750

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2007
Mr. Blaida responded that if the contract with Mr. Morrill is not approved, the County’s interests would
not be represented by any outside lobbyist in Springfield, and he alone would need to cover the
responsibilities.
Commissioner Schneider stated that if the Committee voted in favor of these contracts, it could create the
impression that the Board is taking sides with lobbyists over the County’s doctors, state’s attorneys and
police officers. He asked how their efforts would bring more dollars to the County.
Mr. Boykin responded that their efforts will deliver back to the County millions of dollars more than what
they are currently receiving. He pointed out the experience and familiarity with the system that his firm
brings, and also mentioned that the contract dollar amount that his firm negotiated with the County is far
below what is typically received in Washington, D.C. for lobbying services.
Commissioner Peraica called for the question.
Commissioner Collins, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved to defer Communication Nos.
283661 and 284419. Commissioner Butler called for a roll call, the vote of yeas and nays are as
