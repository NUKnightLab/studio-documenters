INDEPENDENT REPORT

To the Board of Directors
Greater Detroit Resource Recovery Authority

We have audited the accompanying ?nancial statements of Greater Detroit Resource
Recovery Authority (the ?Authority?), a component unit of the City of Detroit, which
comprise the statements of net position as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the statements
of revenues, expenses and change in net position and cash ?ows for the years then ended
and the related notes to the ?nancial statements.

Management?s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these ?nancial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America: this includes the design. implementation, and maintenance of internal
control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of ?nancial statements that are
free from material misstatement. whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor?s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these ?nancial statements based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ?nancial statements are free from
material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the ?nancial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor?s
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the ?nancial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor
considers internal control relevant to the entity?s preparation and fair presentation of the
?nancial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of signi?cant accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the ?nancial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suf?cient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion

in our opinion, the ?nancial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects. the ?nancial position of Greater Detroit Resource Recovery Authority as of June
30, 2018 and 2017. and the changes in ?nancial position and cash ?ows thereof for the
years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

Other Matters - Required Supplemental Information

Accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America require that the
management's discussion and analysis schedules on pages 3?7 be presented to
supplement the basic ?nancial statements. Such information although not a part of the
basic ?nancial statements, is required by the Government Accounting Standards Board,
who considers it to be an essential part of ?nancial reporting for placing the basic ?nancial
statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have
applied certain limited procedures to the required supplemental information in accordance
with accounting standards generally accepted in the United States of America. which
consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and
comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries,
the basic ?nancial statement. and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the
basic ?nancial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on
the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with suf?cient evidence
to express an opinion or provide assurance.

Management Discussion and Analysis

GREATER DETROIT RESOURCE RECOVERY AUTHORITY
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
June 30, 2018

The Management of Greater Detroit Resource Recovery Authority. (the "Authority").
provides this narrative overview and analysis of the ?nancial activities of the Authority for
the ?scal year ended June 30. 2018 for the bene?t of the readers of these ?nancial
statements. This management discussion and analysis is intended to assist the reader in
focusing on signi?cant ?nancial issues. provide an overview of the Authority?s ?nancial
activity. identify changes in the Authority's ?nancial position and its ability to address future
decisions. The basic ?nancial statements are designed to provide readers with a broad
overview of the Authority's ?nances in a manner similar to a private-sector business. The
Authority encourages the reader to consider the information presented here in conjunction
with the ?nancial statements and notes taken as a whole.

The Authority is a component unit of the City of Detroit and provides ef?cient disposal of
municipal solid waste.

GASB Statement on Basic Financial Statements

GA SB Statement on Basic Financial Statements Management Discussion and Analysis
for State and Local Governments establishes standards for external ?nancial reporting for
state and local governments. The Authority classi?es its resources for accounting and
reporting purposes into the following three net position categories as de?ned by GASB.

Net Investment in capital assets which consist of capital assets. net of accumulated
depreciation. deferred outflows of resources and reduced by the outstanding balances
of bonds. mortgages, notes or other borrowings. and deferred in?ows of resources that
are attributable to the acquisition. construction. or improvement of those assets. The
Authority has no signi?cant unspent related debt proceeds or deferred in?ow of
resources as of June 30. 2018.

Restricted net position which results when constraints placed on net position use
are either externally imposed by creditors. grantors. contributors. laws or regulations
of other governments or imposed by law through constitutional provision or enabling
legislation.

Unrestricted net position which consists of assets. deferred out?ows of resources.
liabilities and deferred in?ows of resources which do not meet the de?nition of the two
proceeding categories. In the governmental environment. resources are often
assigned or committed to speci?c purposes. indicating that those amounts are not
considered to be available for general operations. In contrast to restricted amounts.
these types of constraints on resources are internal and can be removed or modi?ed.
The Authority?s unrestricted net position has constraints on resources which are
imposed by the board of directors.

GREATER DETROIT RESOURCE RECOVERY AUTHORITY
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

June 30. 2018

The Summary of Net Position presents information regarding all assets and liabilities, with
the difference between the two reported as net position. Over time. increases or decreases
in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the ?nancial position of the
Authority is improving or deteriorating. Net position increases when revenues exceed

expenses.

The Summary of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position presents information
showing how net position changed during the ?scal year. The Summary of Cash Flows
provides additional information about the Authority's ?nancial results. by reporting the

major sources and uses of cash.

GREATER DETROIT RESOURCE RECOVERY AUTHORITY
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
June 30, 2018

The largest portion of the increase in current assets between 2018 and 2017 re?ects the
release of funds previously held as escrow deposits in adherence to the Energy Purchase
agreement between DTE and the Authority. Between 2017 and 2016 the decrease re?ects
reduced Tipping Fees requested from the City of Detroit at the ?scal year ending June 30,
2017. The decrease in Capital Assets in 2018-2017, and 2017-2016, respectively, re?ects
the scheduled depreciation of the remaining capital assets - Steamline and South?eld
Transfer Station Refurbishment, which remain in the Authority's asset pool after the
Authority's option to repurchase the facility was not exercised prior to it's expiration in
2009.

The current liability for 2018 is completely comprised of Accounts Payable. There is no
balance Due to the City of Detroit at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Net position exceeded liabilities by $26,079,182 and $27,044,735 at the end of ?scal years
2018 and 2017, respectively. The change represents a decrease of $965,553 and
$1,133,469 at the end of ?scal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, mainly due to unfunded
depreciation charges.

Summary of Revenue, Expenses, and

 

 

Changes in Net Positions 2018 2017 2016
Total operating revenues 9,681,296 9,563,405 9,826,047
Total nonoperating income (expense) 60,132 8,805 13,678
Total operating expenses (10,706,981) (10,705,679) (10,887,635)
Decrease in net position 5 (965,553) (1,133,469) (1,047,910)

The net increase in operating revenue of $117,891 during 2018 was primarily due to
revenue received from recovered materials recycling and grants from the State of
Michigan for scrap tire removal and disposal. The net decrease of $262,642 during 2017
was primarily due to the reduced Tipping fees requested, compared to 2016 which
included additional requests for repairs and maintenance related to upgrades in the
South?eld Transfer Station infrastructure.

The net increase in nonoperating income of $51,328 during 2018 is primarily due to the
increase in interest earned on current investments. The net decrease in nonoperating
income of $4.873 during 2017 is primarily due to the decrease in interest earned on current
investments. The net Increase of $512,412 during 2016 was primarily due to the increase
in interest earned on current investments.

Page 5

GREATER DETROIT RESOURCE RECOVERY AUTHORITY
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
June 30, 2018

The net increase in Operating expenses of $1.303 in 2018 compared to 2017 is
insigni?cant, and the decrease in operating expenses of $181,958 in 2017 compared to
2016 was primarily due to the increase costs related to repairs and maintenance of the
South?eld Transfer Station during 2016.

Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 354 (4,102,126) 6 2385.397

the receipt of revenues from recovered materials recycling and grants received from the
State of Michigan for scrap tire removal and disposal. Net cash used in operating activities
increased by $1,122,107 in 2017 primarily due to the timely receipt of tipping fees for
payment of 2016-2017 expenses. All debt related obligations were satis?ed in 2009 and
net cash provided by capital and related ?nancing activities show no additions to capital
assets during 2017-2018 and 2016-2017, respectively. Net cash ?ows from investing
activities increased by $3,998,956 in 2018. due to maturity of investments at June 30,
2018. Net cash ?ows from investing activities decreased by $7,609,630 in 2017, due to
the purchase of short term investment.

Commitment
Strategic Planning Process

In March 2008, the Authority approved contracts with HDR Consulting Engineers and
Gershman, Brickner and Batton, Inc. to begin the process of identifying the parameters
necessary to prepare a request for proposal (RFP) for facility operations and the hauling
and disposal of municipal solid waste.

In March 2009, the Authority amended the hauling and disposal RFP to include services
related to the hauling, processing and disposal of bulky waste collected by the City of
Detroit. The Authority received RFPs from 5 entities for the hauling and disposal of bulky
waste, and chose Capital Waste, a Detroit based business and the lowest bid contractor,
for the period beginning July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010, on a month to month basis.
As on July 1, 2010 Capital Waste was replaced by Stansley Industries and J.Fons
Company, both Detroit bases businesses, as the lowest bid contractors for the hauling
and disposal of municipal solid waste, and these contracts continued on a month to month
basis until June 30, 2015. The Authority had commitments from all vendors to extend their
contracts through June 30, 2016. The Authority and its vendors have operated on a month
to month basis under the terms of the June 30, 2016 agreements through June 30, 2018
and has requested Miller Can?eld prepare a resolution for board approval that would allow
the Director to negotiate contracts on a month to month basis through October 1, 2021,
the current term of the Authority?s contract with the City of Detroit. The Authority has
scheduled a tentative board meeting for November 15, 2018 to ratify the resolution and

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Greater Detroit Resource Recovery Authority (the ?Authority"), created August 1984,
is a component unit of the City of Detroit, established by the Cities of Detroit and Highland
Park, Michigan, under Act No. 179, Michigan Public Acts 1947, as amended. The Authority
was established for the acquisition, construction. and operation of a waste-to-energy
facility. The following is a summary of the signi?cant accounting polices followed by the
Authority (an enterprise fund of the City of Detroit):

Basis of Accounting

The ?nancial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting. The
Authority reports as a Business Type Activity, as de?ned by Governmental Accounting
Standards Board Business Type Activities are those that are ?nanced in whole
or in part by fees charged to external parties for goods or services. In preparing the
?nancial statements, the Authority has applied all Financial Accounting Standards Board
statements and Interpretations issued after November 30. 1989, except those that conflict
or contradict GASB pronouncements.

Operating Revenues

The majority of the Authority?s revenues consist of tipping fees received from the City of
Detroit to be used for the hauling and disposal of municipal solid waste, the sale of
reclaimed metal extracted from the waste stream, pre, and post incineration, and revenues
received from positive returns on recycling commodities. The Authority currently has no
other signi?cant revenue stream that would necessitate distinguishing tipping fees for any
purpose other than the hauling and disposal of the City of Detroit?s municipal solid waste.

Operating Expenses

Consist of costs incurred related to the hauling and disposal of municipal solid waste.
Included are the costs associated with the transportation and disposal of municipal solid
waste, bulky material, yard waste, household, hazardous waste, recyclable materials, and
expenses incurred in the daily operations of the Authority.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Authority from time to time during the year covered by these ?nancial statements may
have bank balances in excess of its insured limits. Management has deemed this as a
normal business risk.

Bank Deposits and Investments

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits. and short-term

investments with a maturity of one year or less when acquired. Investments are stated at
fair value, based on quoted market prices.

NOTE 1 NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(Continued)

Accounts Receivable, Net

The Authority carries its accounts receivable at net realizable value less an allowance for
doubtful accounts. Management assesses the collectability of the accounts receivable

Use of Estimates

The preparation of ?nancial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures at
the dates of the ?nancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts reported in the Statements of Net Position for cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because
of the immediate or short-term maturity of these ?nancial instruments.

The Authority accounts for the fair value of assets and liabilities in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codi?cation 820-10
?Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures." ASC 820-10 provides a consistent de?nition
of fair value that focuses on exit price and prioritizes, within a measurement of fair value.
the use of market-based inputs over company-speci?c inputs. A three-level valuation
hierarchy is used for fair value measurements. The three?level valuation hierarchy is
based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs re?ect market data
obtained from independent sources. while unobservable inputs re?ect market
assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the
following:

Level 1 Observable inputs that re?ect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets
or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. quoted prices for
identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived
valuations in which all observable inputs and signi?cant value drivers are
observable in active markets.

Level 3 Model-derived valuations in which one or more signi?cant inputs or signi?cant

value drivers are unobservable, including assumptions developed by the
Authority.

requiring that the Authority attempt to match its investments with anticipated cash ?ow
requirements. Unless related to a Speci?c cash ?ow. the Authority generally does not
directly invest in securities maturing more than 10 years from the original date of purchase.
