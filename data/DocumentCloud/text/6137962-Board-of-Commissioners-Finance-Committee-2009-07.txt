Commissioners; Co-Sponsored by William M. Beavers, Earlean Collins, Joseph Mario

Commissioners.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
HOME RULE COUNTY RETAILERS’ OCCUPATION TAX
WHEREAS, County of Cook is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article
VII, Section 6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution; and
WHEREAS, while other taxing districts within Cook County have consistently increased
their property tax levy on an annual basis, Cook County has not increased its property tax
levy since 1996 and the levy has remained constant at $720 million; and
WHEREAS, in an effort to streamline County government and prevent further economic
hardship on County residents, the Cook County Board of Commissioners implemented
budgetary cuts in the 2007 fiscal year with an on average seventeen percent (17%)
countywide budgetary reduction; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has a structural deficit and due to County Board approved
appropriations and contractual obligations, the Board of Cook County Commissioners
acknowledged the need for additional revenue and increased County revenue in a
manner that would afford adequate funding to maintain essential services; and
WHEREAS, as a home rule county, County of Cook is authorized by 55 ILCS 5/5-1006 to
impose a tax upon all persons in Cook County engaged in the business of selling tangible
personal property; and
WHEREAS, in an effort to address its fiscal responsibilities, effective July 1, 2008, Cook
County increased the tax imposed pursuant to this Home Rule County Retailers’
Occupation Tax Ordinance by one percent (1%) excluding vital goods such as groceries
and medicines as well as vehicles and other titled property; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board’s increase to this Home Rule County Retailers’
Occupation Tax Ordinance, the first increase in over sixteen (16) years equates to an
increase by one penny on the dollar; and
WHEREAS, the increase to the Home Rule County Retailers’ Occupation Tax Ordinance
was considered and approved by the Board of Commissioners in order to prevent the
elimination of vital County services; and
WHEREAS, Cook County now anticipates additional revenue as a result of the federal
economic stimulus plan and negotiations with the State of Illinois regarding the public
health portion of the County’s budget and as a result believes that it would be fiscally
prudent to reduce the increased portion of the Home Rule County Retailers’ Occupation
Tax by a quarter percent (.25%); and
WHEREAS, in addition, on April 7, 2009, a number of Townships had a question
regarding Cook County’s increased sales tax, those Townships voiced their concern and
though such referenda is advisory in nature and not binding, it is good public policy to
provide that the opinions of the voters be acknowledged and heard; and
WHEREAS, reductions greater than a quarter percent (.25%) at this time may
disproportionately affect public safety and the health system, causing layoffs in offices that
include the Sheriff, State’s Attorney, Public Defender, Chief Judge, Clerk of the Circuit
Court and the Cook County Health and Hospital System; and
WHEREAS, a reduction in the increased portion of the Home Rule County Retailers’
Occupation Tax is proposed at a quarter percent (.25%).

WHEREAS, Cook County now anticipates additional revenue as a result of the federal
economic stimulus plan and negotiations with the State of Illinois regarding the public
health portion of the County’s budget and as a result believes that it would be fiscally
prudent to reduce the increased portion of the Home Rule County Service Occupation Tax
by a quarter percent (.25%); and
WHEREAS, in addition, on April 7, 2009, a number of Townships had a question
regarding Cook County’s increased sales tax, those Townships voiced their concern and
though such referenda is advisory in nature and not binding, it is good public policy to
provide that the opinions of the voters be acknowledged and heard; and
WHEREAS, reductions greater than a quarter percent (.25%) at this time may
disproportionately affect public safety and the health system, causing layoffs in offices that
include the Sheriff, State’s Attorney, Public Defender, Chief Judge, Clerk of the Circuit
Court and the Cook County Health and Hospital System; and
WHEREAS, a reduction in the increased portion of the Home Rule County Service
Occupation Tax is proposed at a quarter percent (.25%).
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners
