Agenda Item 6: PEO Performance Review Report from the September 10, 2019 Primary
Election
Election Officials Assistant Manager Peter James stated that the Election went well. There was
one (1) personality issue which will be remedied by moving the worker to another location. The
amount of no-shows was consistent with other elections of scale.
Board Member Chappell asked why some of the election officials did not sign the reports. Mr.
James responded that it was likely the election officials felt rushed and omitted that part. Staff
will focus on this during training for the next election. Twenty three percent of provisionals were
handed out incorrectly, however none of them harmed the voter. This is another area the training
will focus on for next election.
Chairman Hastings thanked Mr. James and the Election Officials Department.

New Business:
New Logo Update:
Deputy Director Soeder reviewed the history of the former Board of Election’s logos. She
explained that most other counties have a similar color scheme of red, white, and blue. Current
opinion is to use a blue and white color scheme incorporating the word VOTE with the “O”
being the state of Ohio.
Board Member Frost asked that we use a neutral color scheme or use red, white, and blue in
order to mitigate any partisan appearance.
Chairman Hastings asked that we inquire into other Boards of Elections’ selection process, and
stated that staff has done an excellent job.
Board Member Chappell stated that she prefers a red, white, and blue scheme.
March 17, 2020 Primary Election Update:
Director Perlatti stated that staff has reached out to call polling locations. Most location issues
have been resolved.
Status of Voter Notify
Director Perlatti stated that Voter Notify is being discontinued because the vendor cannot
efficiently meet the new Secretary of State security standards. Robo calls will be sent out in
place of Voter Notify. Chairman Hastings and Board Member Chappell stated that they hope to
bring back the program at some time, and asked staff to look into finding another vendor.
Adjustment to Absentee Voting Operations
Director Perlatti stated that in house voting operations are now being overseen by the Candidate
and Petition Services Department for practical purposes. The Ballot Department now oversees
absentee voting.
