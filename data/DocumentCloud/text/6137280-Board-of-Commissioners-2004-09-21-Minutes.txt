PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance Amendment sponsored by
CARL R. HANSEN, County Commissioner
The proposed amendment to the Cook County Law Library Ordinance will increase the Law Library
filing fee from $I 0.00 to $13.00. An increase in the price of books has rendered the current $10.00 filing
fee inadequate and believe it is necessary to amend the Cook County Ordinance to utilize the maximum
$13.00 filing fee amount currently allowed by State statute.
It is estimated that said increase would result in an additional nine hundred thousand dollars
($900,000.00) of revenue per year. Said estimate is based on the average number of civil case filings in
the Circuit Court of Cook County, which has traditionally hovered around three hundred thousand filings
per year.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
THE COOK COUNTY LAW LIBRARY ORDINANCE

The expense of establishing and maintaining such library shall be borne by Cook County. To
defray such expense, the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County shall charge and collect a
County Law Library fee of~ $ 13.00, such fee to be paid at the time of filing the first pleading,
paper or other appearance filed by each party in all civil cases, but no additional fee shall be
required if more than one party is represented in a single pleading, paper or other appearance.
The Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County shall commence such charges and collections upon
receipt of written notice from the County Board President that the Cook County Board has acted to
establish and maintain such a law library.
Such fees shall be in addition to all other fees and charges of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook
County, and assessable as costs, and shall be remitted by the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook
County monthly to the Cook County Treasurer, and retained by the Treasurer in a special fund
designated as the County Law Library Fund. Disbursements from such funds shall be by the Cook
County Treasurer, on order of the County Board. The President of the County Board, with the
advise and consent of the County Board, may appoint a Library Committee of not less than 9
