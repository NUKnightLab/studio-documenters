1. The Committee discussed repurposing the recycling cans that were pulled from the streets by
the Clean and Green Committee. They are damaged and covered in stickers, paint, etc. It is very
expensive to strip them and refinish, it would be more cost effective to buy new. Cleanslate will
recycle them.
2. The committee discussed “One Big Thing”
a. The committee reviewed the 6 selections
b. There will be a public display at Jackson Junge, SM says there should be a place online
for people to comment, CR thinks this should be online but they should also have an
opportunity to leave comments at the gallery.
c. The display should be for one month, there should be a meet & greet reception, the
committee can committee money to the space and some food, possibly have some wine
donated.
d. Design for a window vinyl display, SM volunteers to work with Chris on it.
Motion: to fund a reception to celebrate the public display of the six finalists for the
Milwaukee/Wood/Wolcott public art installation at Jackson Junge Gallery in an amount not to exceed
$1,000 from line item 2.06 (public art).
3. Planning for 2017
a. Orange Gnome Project does not need to come out of the public art line, it is
promotional. Is there a way to reactivate the ones that are remaining in the
neighborhood and possibly even move them around the neighborhood temporarily?
b. SM- most impressed with the “cheap tricks”, can we have Collaboraction’s marching
band? Can we curate buskers from the Loop?
c. How can we make the most of the public art line and work with things that are already
happening in the neighborhood, to stretch our dollars further? SM- the 606 installation
is already happening, could we contribute to this, help to make it permanent.
