Total Amount of Transfer: $75,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent 8/3/2018
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The departments will repurpose unused funds that were initially set aside for professional services,
transportation and Salary/Wages. The funds will be transferred from these accounts, as these funds have
been lower than anticipated.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Originally, the department appropriated funds for professional services to assist in real estate transfer tax
audits; we have conducted less than anticipated due to other high dollar value targets, assessments and
10

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

September 12, 2018

Each location of a wireless telecommunication facility within County right-of-way shall meet all of the
requirements of the Ordinance. The decision of the Department of Transportation and Highways to deny
a permit application may be appealed to the Superintendent or authorized designee. The Superintendent
or authorized designee shall hear the request for a variance within fourteen (14) calendar days following
receipt of notice, and the decision shall be the final action of the County with respect to the request for a
variance. Any request for a variance shall be made in writing to the County c/o the Department of
Transportation and Highways, 69 W. Washington Street, 24th Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60602 within fourteen
(14) calendar days of receipt of a decision by the County.
Sec. 66-142. Abandonment and removal.
Any wireless telecommunication facility located within the right-of-way of a County Highway that is not
operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, shall be considered abandoned and the owner of the
facility shall remove same within ninety (90) days of receipt of written notice from the County notifying
the owner of such abandonment. Such notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return- receiptrequested, by the County to such owner at the last known address of such owner. In the case of wireless

installation. The complete responsibility for assuring the support element’s ability will rest and lie entirely
with the permit applicant. In the event the permit applicant’s selected County-owned infrastructure is
deemed inadequate by the permit applicant or the applicant’s consultant, the County will be under no
obligation to augment or create a new element for the installation of the wireless telecommunication facility.
Sec. 66-145. Hold harmless agreement.
It is recognized that the system being created by the wireless telecommunication facilities network requires
an interconnection and complete coverage for the system to function. It is also recognized that during
events, weather conditions, traffic accidents and maintenance and construction operations sometimes cause
damage to roadway facilities within rights-of-way including County-owned infrastructure. Although
replacement, reconstruction or re- installation of this infrastructure is typically accomplished in as
efficiently, timely and economically a manner as possible, there is no defined timeframe in which this repair
work is completed. In the event such incidents occur causing damage to County-owned infrastructure that
have wireless telecommunication facilities mounted or otherwise attached to them, and in the event such
accidents or occurrences cause elements of or the complete wireless telecommunication facility to be
incapacitated, rendered inoperable, made irreparable, or destroyed, the County and its affiliated and

responsibilities for the repair, reconfiguration or replacement of the wireless telecommunication facility
shall rest solely and at the expense of the wireless services provider.
Sec. 66-146. Severability.

Summary: The Alsip Mini Mill manufacturing facility’s use of HUD Section 108 funds will assist in the
generation of approximately $70 million in private capital investment and the creation of 85 jobs related to
the acquisition and conversion of a formerly shuttered paper mill facility that has been closed since 2014
due to economic reasons as the coated paper industry has been on a decline for several years due to
consumers moving from print to electronic media consumption. The closure has negatively impacted local
community residents and commerce in the Village of Alsip and the surrounding area in southern Cook
County. Thus, the HUD Section 108 loan program will serve as a key economic development tool within
Cook County economic development portfolio to support projects such as Alsip Mini Mill to significantly
grow jobs at a faster rate for residents in the southern suburbs of the County.

Journal of Proceedings

September 12, 2018

Budget and Management Services has received all requisite documents, and determined the fiscal impact
on Cook County, if any.
Summary: The Cook County North Suburban Municipal Districts Drug Court Service Enhancement
Program builds upon the court’s capacity to help program participants: assessing needs, offering practical
recovery supports, reducing financial and access barriers to treatment through integration of clinical case
management with health literacy and health insurance assistance, and strengthening client outcomes
through targeted evidence-based medication-assisted and residential treatment services. Enhancement
programs were implemented last year in three suburban drug treatment courts in Cook County: the Fourth
Municipal District (Maywood), Fifth Municipal District (Bridgeview), and Sixth Municipal District
(Markham). This program expands enhancements to the Second Municipal District (Skokie) and the Third
Municipal District (Rolling Meadows). All five of the suburban Cook County drug courts are now
supported by Federal SAMHSA program grants.
The purpose of the program is to increase the number of suburban drug court participants who graduate
successfully and achieve stable recovery and affect the long-term health and safety needs of these
individuals and their communities. Participants in the program will include adult men and women (age 18
and older) who are arrested/charged with new non-violent, drug-related felony offenses and are diagnosed
with substance use disorders.
Project funds are dedicated mostly for community-based case management and treatment services. The
remainder is used for staff, fringe benefits, supplies, training and travel.

The County Board approved a new armored car contract at the February board meeting. In May, an
erroneous credit was discovered that lowered our available funds from $26,946.00 to $8,367.00 This has
been the Clerk’s ongoing balance since that date.

All operating funds were considered. Smaller amounts from several funds were chosen to have the
minimal impact on operations.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
The transfer will have an impact on the printing quantities of tax forms and vital records security paper.
The transfer may also impact and repairs/maintenance of microfilm in Vital Records.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR A HEARING ON THE ILLINOIS BLOCKCHAIN TASK
FORCE REPORT AND THE APPLICATIONS OF ITS FINDINGS TO COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, blockchains offer enormous potential for the storage and maintenance of data and records;
and
WHEREAS, a blockchain is a database that is replicated over a peer-to-peer network that is designed to
achieve consistent and reliable agreement over a record of events between independent participants through
consensus about changes to the state of the shared database; and
WHEREAS, blockchains allow digital information to be distributed, but not copied, making it very difficult
to inappropriately modify the original data. Anything of value, money, titles, deeds, votes, and identity
attributes can be exchanged, stored, and managed securely and privately; and
WHEREAS, there are a variety of potential applications of blockchains to manage the voluminous data
that Cook County manages, including, but not limited to, applications in the Office of the Cook County
Clerk, Recorder of Deeds, Assessor, Clerk of the Circuit Court and much more; and
WHEREAS, on November 30, 2016, the State of Illinois formed the Illinois Blockchain Initiative to
explore how Blockchain could help spur economic development in the State; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Blockchain Task Force was charged by Illinois House Joint Resolution 25, which
was adopted by both houses on June 28, 2017, to study aspects of distributed ledger technology that includes
opportunities and risks associated with using blockchain, different types of blockchains (public and private),
as well as projects and use cases in other states and domains that Illinois could consider utilizing; and

250

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

September 12, 2018

WHEREAS, on January 31, 2018, the Illinois Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Task Force issued a
report on:
1) opportunities and risks associated with using blockchain and other distributed ledger
technologies,
2) the different types of blockchains, public and private,
3) projects and use cases in other states/nations that Illinois could consider,
4) how current state laws could be modified to support this technology,
5) encryption technology, including Illinois’ digital signature infrastructure, and
6) official reports and recommendations from the Illinois Blockchain Initiative; and
WHEREAS, the Task Force found that that blockchain technology and its built-in encryption can facilitate
highly-secure methods for interacting with government and keeping paperless records, increasing data
accuracy and providing better cybersecurity protections for Illinois residents; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that a joint meeting of the Legislation and Intergovernmental
Relations and Technology Committees of the Cook County Board of Commissioners convene to review the
Illinois Blockchain Task Force Report and the possible applications of blockchain technology within Cook
County.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
REQUIRING A TWO THIRDS MAJORITY VOTE OF THE BOARD TO ENACT ANY NEW OR
ADDITIONAL TAX IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, multiple cities as well as states have either enacted or considered a supermajority requirement
for tax increases as it provides residents with another level of protection from unpopular taxes, and
WHEREAS, taxpayers expect reasonable limits, like a 2/3 majority vote requirement for tax increases in
order to protect them from controversial votes being used to raise or create new taxes without broad public
support, and
WHEREAS, the burden of new and increased taxes that falls on the shoulders of Cook County residents
should not be left to a simple majority vote, and
WHEREAS, the process of both increasing taxes and creating new taxes should be agreed upon by a large
majority of those who will be effected by them, and
251

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

September 12, 2018

Sec. 105 (f) is hereby amended as follows:
(f) Majority votes. Except as otherwise provided in these rules, and except for questions for which
a higher majority is required by law, all questions shall be determined by a majority vote of those
Commissioners entitled to vote. Any question which enacts a new form of taxation, or increase in taxation,
shall require a two thirds majority vote of the board in order to pass. A vote of “present shall not be counted
in determining the number of Commissioners voting on a question
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.
