3. Trustee Matters
a. Election Contract Change Suggestion of Tim Walsh
Regina Tuczak, Executive Director, stated that she and Fund staff were planning for the upcoming
trustee elections and met with the election consultants regarding the renewals of their service
agreements. She had asked the consultants if any concessions could be extended to reduce fees for
their services. Mr. Tim Walsh suggested that the fees could be reduced by $2,300 per year if ‘Caller
Services’ at the Post Office were discontinued. With ‘Caller Services’ the Post Office is to certify
the number of the pieces of mail provided daily to the vendor when they arrive to retrieve the PO Box
mail. Recently, the postal employees have been reluctant to provide the certification requested. Mr.
Walsh would be willing to discontinue the services and reduce the fees due from the Fund.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Fitzgerald that the Board approve a
renewal of the services agreement with Tim Walsh & Associates for the elections to occur in 2019
and 2020 and that such agreement not include certain Caller Services as presented. It is further
moved that Fund staff and external Fund counsel negotiate the terms of such renewal agreement and
present the final contract to the Board before it is executed on behalf of the Fund.

4. Benefit Matters

a. Benefit Application Consideration – Office #130505
The Executive Director stated that the member identified by Office Number 130505 had requested
3

 and received four different estimates from the Fund indicating that she would have obtained 30 years
of contributory service by February 28, 2019. The member subsequently withdrew from County
service on February 28, 2019, and applied for an annuity benefit. While processing the application
for annuity benefits, it was determined that due to an error in payroll reporting for service performed
in June, 2000, the member had earned less than 30 years of contributory service. The missing service
had a substantial impact on her monthly annuity benefit. The member did not have unused sick leave
or sufficient accumulated vacation time to be used for the missing service credit. She had retained
other employment and was not able to return to work at the County to perform additional service.
The Board discussed how the error occurred and the audit procedures of Fund staff regarding a
member’s service credit at the time of final annuity calculation. It was also noted that members are
encouraged to extend their employment when possible to allow some leeway should an error in
reporting contributory service be discovered after the member has withdrawn from County service. It
was discussed that it would be prudent, based upon these particular facts, to allow the member to
purchase six days of contributory service.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Goode that the Board approve the
purchase of six days of service credit by the member identified by Office Number 130505 for the
reasons presented and that following such purchase, her application for annuity benefits be processed
and presented to the Board for approval.

5. Legislative Matters
a. SB 1264
The Executive Director reported that SB 1264, regarding the Unclaimed Property Act, passed from
the Senate without exempting the Fund from its provisions. She stated that the Fund’s Legislative
Representative, John McCabe, had reported that the House sponsor for the bill was willing to include
the amendatory language exempting the Fund and that the Senate sponsor would accept the
amendatory language when the bill was returned to that chamber.
b. CCPF-Sponsored Legislation - Updates
It was reported by the Executive Director that SB 1300, regarding the source of funds that the County
may use to pay employer contributions, had passed through the Senate and was before the House.
The trustees discussed the proposed source of funds legislation and whether similar legislation should
be proposed for the Forest Fund. It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee
DeGraff that the Fund instruct John McCabe & Associates to file a similar bill for the Forest Fund to
expand the source of funds that could be used to pay employer contributions in a subsequent
legislative session.

MOTION ADOPTED BY VOICE VOTE

c. County Legislation
4

 The Executive Director reported that the Fund had very recently received the draft of the County’s
proposed legislation from the County’s Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) which provided for actuarial
based funding (“ARC”), changed the composition of the Board, addressed the administration and
funding for retiree health benefits and a few other matters as presented by the CFO at the April Board
meeting. Because the County had only delivered the draft to the Fund and the trustees the day before
the Board’s meeting, she proposed that a special meeting be convened so that there would be
adequate time to review the legislation before any discussions commenced. The Executive Director
stated that the CFO had confirmed that the County had not introduced the legislation and wanted to
work with the Fund and other stakeholders on the proposal.
The trustees discussed that the Fund’s actuary should look at the proposed ARC funding language to
determine whether it would provide the funding levels needed to sustain benefits to the members.
They expressed concerns about how health care benefits would be administered and the level of
funding that the County would provide for such benefits. They also had reservations about changes to
the Board’s composition particularly because the elected members would not retain their majority.
There were questions about the proposed merger of the County Fund and the Forest Fund, whether
benefit changes could be implemented without specific reference in the statute and other matters.
The trustees directed the Executive Director to send a letter to the CFO, the President of the County
Board and each of the Commissioners acknowledging their receipt of the draft legislation, but stating
that the trustees and their consultants needed additional time to review the legislation before
providing a response.
The trustees determined that a Special Meeting of the Retirement Board should be convened on May
10, 2019, at 9:30 am to discuss the legislation proposed by the County. Trustee Goode stated that she
would not be available to attend the Special Meeting at that time.
6. Administrative Matters
a. Approval of Referral of a Matter Pursuant to 40 ILCS §5/1-135
It was reported by the Executive Director that Fund staff had become aware that two annuitants had
falsely represented that they were divorced at the time of their respective retirements. Each received a
refund of spousal contributions, despite being married to one another, at the time they filed their
annuity applications. The Fund learned of the false representations when one of the annuitants died
and the survivor applied for a surviving spouse annuity. A third party reported to the Fund that the
deceased member had been married to another annuitant.
The Fund contacted the surviving spouse and stated that he needed to return the spousal contributions
he had wrongfully received when he had applied for his own annuity benefit. He was also informed
that the refund of spouse contributions paid to his deceased spouse needed to be remitted to the Fund
before he would be eligible for a spouse annuity. She reported that the Fund had received checks in
repayment of the spousal refunds made to each of the annuitants. The trustees were asked to confirm,
based upon the facts and documentation presented, that there was a reasonable suspicion that false
statements had been made to the Fund and should be reported to the Cook County State’s Attorney
pursuant to Section 1-135 of the Illinois Pension Code.
Based on the discussion and documentation provided, it was moved by Trustee McFadden and
seconded by Trustee Goode that the Board find that there is a reasonable suspicion that false
statements or falsified records relating to the refund of spouse contributions were presented to the
Fund and that in accordance with Section 1-135 of the Illinois Pension Code, 40 ILCS 5/1-135 that
the incident be reported to the Cook County State’s Attorney.

b. Contract Extension Approval – CDW
The Executive Director stated that the Fund was evaluating two Statements of Work (“SOW”) from
CDW, one which provided for a continuation of Backup and Recovery Services and the other for
Network Support Services. Both of the SOWs were under evaluation for the services rendered and
fees charged. The Fund had requested and received a proposal for a ninety-day extension of the
Backup and Recovery Services, which the Board was asked to approve. The Executive Director
stated that a report to the Board about an extension of the Network Support Services SOW would be
made at a subsequent meeting after further evaluation had been made.
The trustees discussed the extension of the Backup and Recovery Services SOW and suggested that
the Fund request an additional 90 day extension of its terms.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Nevius that the Board approve the
extension of the CDW SOW for Backup and Recovery Services for 90 days and that the Fund request
an option to extend the SOW for an additional 90 days, if needed, upon the terms presented.

c. PAS RFP Extension Update
The Executive Director stated that she had proposed at the Board meeting on April 4, 2019, that the
implementation of the Pension Administration System (“PAS”) project be postponed to January 1,
2020. Since April 4, 2019, the Executive Director had contacted each of the two finalists and briefly
discussed the new timeframe. Both of the finalists agreed to extend their proposals until January 1,
2020, but stated that it may be necessary to assign new team members due to the extension. She also
reported that a tentative meeting had been scheduled later in May with Stephen James of Linea
Solutions to discuss the scope of their work and proposed future services they might perform once the
project is underway.
d. Hartford Worker’s Comp/General Liability Insurance Renewal
The Executive Director reported that the Fund’s Workers’ Compensation Policy and its General
Liability Policy each expire on May 17, 2019. She stated that Fund staff had reached out to Aon
Insurance, the broker who obtained the coverage, and Harford Insurance to review the policies. The
Board was asked to approve the renewal of the policies, but that any changes to the coverage or
premiums would be reported to the Board after the discussions with Aon and Hartford had been
concluded.

e. Investments Travel Update
The Executive Director stated that there were some inadvertent omissions on the list of conferences
approved by the Board for attendance by trustees and staff at the meeting on January 10, 2019. She
provided a list of additional conferences that could be attended by trustees and Fund staff for approval
by the Board. No change in budgetary amounts is expected due to this change.
It was moved by Trustee Goode and seconded by Trustee McFadden, consistent with the
recommendations of Fund staff that the expenses, including any associated travel expenses, incurred
by any Trustee or Fund staff in attending any of the indicated educational conferences be approved,
provided that the reimbursement shall be in and for amounts that are consistent with the Fund’s
Travel Expense Reimbursement Policy.

Executive Director’s Report
The Executive Director’s report was presented and included a presentation of the controls in place
regarding outgoing wire transfers from the Custodial Account pursuant to a direction letter and other
transfers. She reported that certain changes had been made in the procedures to provide better
controls. It was also reported that a recommendation had been made by the Health Benefits
Committee to allow Fund staff some latitude to make minor exceptions to the policies provided in the
Health Benefits Guide, such as permitting members to submit later personal payments or applications
in limited circumstances. With respect to such proposed policy, the Board requested further
clarification on the scope of anticipated exceptions.
It was reported that the Fund will send annual certification forms to out-of-state annuitants to confirm
continued eligibility for benefits. She noted that in-state annuitants are verified through the Illinois
Department of Public Health and do not require separate certification letters. She also reported that
the annual contribution statements will be sent to active members shortly. Last, Ms. Tuczak reported
that the Fund participated in a compensation survey that was conducted by a consulting firm in
partnership with the Chicago Teachers’ Pension Fund. The Fund will receive a complimentary copy
of the survey upon completion. The Board was reminded of the committee meeting dates scheduled in
May.
