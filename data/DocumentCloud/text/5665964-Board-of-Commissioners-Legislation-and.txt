PROPOSED RESOLUTION

CALLING ON COOK COUNTY TO ASSESS ITS LACTATION ROOMS AND LACTATION
ROOM POLICIES IN AN EFFORT T0 BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF NURSING
MOTHERS IN ITS FACILITIES

WHEREAS, breastfeeding offers proven health bene?ts for babies and mothers, but women often ?nd it
difficult to continue breastfeeding once they return to the workplace; and

WHEREAS, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), among employed
women with children under age 3, approximately 70 percent work full time and one-third of mothers return
to work within 3 months after giving birth, and two-thirds return within 6 months; and

WHEREAS, challenges to breastfeeding mothers include lack of break time and inadequate facilities for
pumping and storing human milk; and

WHEREAS, providing accommodations for breastfeeding offers numerous rewards for the employer, in
cost savings for health care, reduced absenteeism, employee morale, and employee retention; and

WHEREAS, Cook County and its facilities owned or rented are unique in that they must accommodate
county employees, workers who are not employed by Cook County but who perform some of their job
duties in county facilities, as well as members of the general public; and

WHEREAS, many of the challenges facing breastfeeding mothers can be reduced with a small
investment of time, money, and ?exibility; and

WHEREAS, some Cook County buildings and courthouses owned or rented currently have space
reserved for breastfeeding mothers, but some challenges remain, and it is incumbent upon this body to
evaluate existing resources and see where there is opportunity for improvement;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
county shall undertake an evaluation of its current lactation rooms and policies for those rooms, with the
goal of having all public buildings owned, and operated or rented by Cook County with a designated
private room, other than a restroom, for persons seeking privacy to nurse or express milk, including
members of the public where appropriate; and

BE lT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the private room shall at a minimum include an electrical outlet, a
chair, and a lockable door. Windows, if any, in the private room must have a window treatment
appropriate to ensure privacy; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the management of each building shall make all building staff
aware of the room(s) that have been designated for the use of nursing mothers and what the procedure is
should a member of the public request use of the room(s); and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all public buildings owned, and operated or rented by Cook
County post a sign at the building entrance and outside the public restrooms indicating the availability of
the designated room and the procedure for accessing it; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that where a private room cannot be designated without displacing
staff or having to construct a new room within the facility, and where another option that would
reasonably meet the intent of this resolution cannot be identi?ed, an exception to the requirements of this
resolution will be made.

Effective Date. This resolution shall take effect immediately upon adoption.
