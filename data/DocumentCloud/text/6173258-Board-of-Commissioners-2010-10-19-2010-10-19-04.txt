To the Honorable Board of Commissioners
RECOMMENDATIONS
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners (“Board”) approve the draft revisions
to the Admissions and Continued Occupancy Policy/Tenant Selection Plan for Kenmore
Apartments and Pomeroy Apartments, substantially in the form as attached to the
Resolution, and authorize the Chief Executive Officer to approve any final changes to the
ACOP/TSP, Lease, Lease Riders, and bylaws, including, but not limited to, changes based

and authorize the amendment of the CHA Admissions and Continued Occupancy Policy

FUNDING
No CHA Funding is applicable to this request.
EXPLANATION
Kenmore Apartments and Pomeroy Apartments are senior-designated public housing
apartment buildings currently undergoing substantial renovation. For Kenmore
Apartments, CHA is seeking the environmentally friendly LEED Platinum Level
Certification. This certification requires the owner to minimize exposure of building
occupants, indoor surfaces and ventilation air distribution systems to environmental
tobacco smoke. For Pomeroy Apartments, CHA was awarded a HUD Capital Fund
Recovery Competition (“CFRC”) Category 4: Creation of an Energy Efficient, Green
Community Grant. Under this grant, CHA committed Pomeroy Apartments to meet
specific Enterprise Green Communities criteria established in the CFRC Notice of Funding
Availability (“NOFA”) which includes enforcing a “no smoking” policy in all common
and individual living areas of the building. Revisions are therefore required to the
ACOP/TSP and Lease for both Kenmore Apartments and Pomeroy Apartments to adopt a
No Smoking Policy that is enforceable by the residential lease.
The property specific requirements for applicants contained in the ACOP are based on
CHA’s Minimum TSP (Board approved September 21, 2004). A public comment period
was held from September 7, 2010 through October 6, 2010. A public comment hearing
was held on September 14, 2010 at the Ella Flagg senior building. Notice for the 30-day
comment period was published in the Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Defender, and Hoy

 newspapers, as well as posted on the CHA website and on site at the following Office(s):
CHA Administrative Office and Central Advisory Council. Consideration was given to
any forthcoming comments prior to finalizing the documents.
Draft Revisions to the Admissions and Continued Occupancy Policy (ACOP/Tenant
Selection Plan (TSP))
Article IV. Leasing Polices is amended to add the following No Smoking Policy:
The premises to be occupied by resident and members of resident’s household have been
designated a smoke-free living environment. Resident and members of resident’s
household shall not smoke anywhere in the unit rented by resident, or in the common areas
of the building where the resident’s dwelling is located, including but not limited to the
lobby, reception areas, vestibule, hallways, elevators, stairwells, community rooms,
bathrooms, laundry rooms, and offices. Additionally, no smoking is permitted within 25
feet of the building’s entry ways, porches and patios. This policy applies to all residents,
guests, visitors, service personnel and employees.
Article XIII. Definitions of Terms Used in This Statement of Policies is amended to add
the following definition of smoking:
Smoking - for purposes of lease enforcement of the No Smoking Policy set forth in
Article IV of the ACOP, means inhaling, exhaling, breathing, or carrying any lighted
cigar, cigarette, pipe, or other tobacco product or similar lighted product in any manner or
in any form.
Draft Revisions to the Lease Agreement:
Lease Part 1. Terms and Conditions Section 8. Resident’s Obligations is amended to add
the following obligation to the resident and authorized members:
To comply with the No Smoking Policy pursuant to Article IV of the Admissions and
Continued Occupancy Policy (ACOP)/Tenant Selection Plan (TSP). Violation of the No
Smoking Policy may result in lease termination.
Lease Part 2. Attachment to the Lease is amended to add:
a “No Smoking Lease Addendum” substantially in the form attached to the Resolution
Lease Part 3. Definitions is amended to add the following definition of smoking:
“Smoking” – for purposes of lease enforcement of the No Smoking Policy set forth in
Article IV of the ACOP, “smoking” means inhaling, exhaling, breathing or carrying any
lighted cigar, cigarette, pipe or other tobacco product or similar lighted product in any
manner or in any form.
It is therefore recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve the proposed draft
revisions to the ACOP/TSP, Lease, Lease Riders and bylaws for Kenmore Apartments and
Pomeroy Apartments and authorize the amendments of the CHA Admissions and
Continued Occupany Policy (“ACOP”) to add the final form of said TSP, Lease and Lease
