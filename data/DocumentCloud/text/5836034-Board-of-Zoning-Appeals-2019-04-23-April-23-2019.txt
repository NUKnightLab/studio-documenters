Crystal Mitchell seeks dimensional variances to establish a 3,492

square foot building along with accessory parking APPROVED w
conditions in BSEED 130-18 (effective date February 1, 2019) in a

dimensional variance requests for matters that are beyond the
scope of Buildings and Safety Engineering Department ten percent
(10%) administrative adjustments and for a variance from the
required location of off-street parking facilities or the amount of
off-street parking facilities required, or both, where, after
investigation by the Board, it is found that such modification is
necessary to secure an appropriate development of a specific
parcel of land, provided, that any such modification will not be
inconsistent with other requirements and general purpose of this
Zoning Ordinance; per section 61-14-2 (change of use); thirty-five
(35) off-street parking spaces are required – nineteen (19) are
proposed and the proposed use requires a neighborhood petition
of 67% of the people owning property, residing or doing business
within 500 radial feet of the subject property have no objection to
this proposal, therefore variances are required by the BZA.
