TRAFFIC WARNING SIGNS ANDIOR SIGNALS:

South Fairfield Avenue and West 43rd Street; All Way Stop Sign, Stopping All
Approaches. Not Recommended. West 43rd Street is a collector roadway with higher
volumes than South Fairfield Avenue, a residential street. Stop signs on streets with
higher volumes such as West 43rd Street tend to increase rear-end crashes, increase
congestion, and create a false sense of security for pedestrians that every vehicle will
stop. Due to the intersection's proximity to the traf?c signal at South California Avenue,
a stop sign will be unexpected for motorists. CDOT does not recommend installing an
All Way Stop Sign at this intersection -- (17-06343933) [Or2017-538]

South Whipple and West 47th Street; All Way Stop Sign, Stopping All Approaches.
West 47th street is a major collector roadway with significantly higher volumes than
South Whipple Street, a local street. Stop signs on streets with higher volumes such as
West 47th Street tend to increase rear-end crashes, increase congestion, and create a
false sense of security for pedestrians that every vehicle will stop. Additionally, due to
the intersection's proximity to the traffic signal at South Kedzie Avenue to the west, a
stop sign would be unexpected for motorists. CDOT does not recommend installing All
Way Stop Sign at this location -- (17-07156736) [Or2017-540]

North Central Park Avenue and West George Street; All Way Stop Sign, Stopping All
Approaches . Not Recommended. North Central Park Avenue is a major collector
roadway with significantly higher volumes than West George Street, a local residential
road. Stop signs on streets with high volumes such as North Central Park Avenue tend
to increase rear-end crashes, increase congestion, and create a false sense of
security for pedestrians that every vehicle will stop. Due to the intersection's proximity
to the traffic signal at North Milwaukee Avenue, a stop sign will be unexpected for
motorists. Additionally, stop compliance is particularly low at T-intersections. CDOT
does not recommend installing an all?way stop at this intersection (17-05288406)
