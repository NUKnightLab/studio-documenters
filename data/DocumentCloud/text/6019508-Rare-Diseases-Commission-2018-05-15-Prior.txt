Uniform Prior Authorization form for Medicaid MCOs and Commercial
Insurers
____________________________________________________________________________
This bill would create a task force that would develop a one-page uniform prior
authorization (PA) form for prescribers. Currently, MCOs and commercial insurers have
multiple PA forms so that prescribers must not only complete different forms for each
MCO and insurer. They must also find out which specific form for different medication
classes they must use for each particular patient.

To contact the MCO or insurer to find out which PA form must be used takes
approximately 15-20 minutes.
The PA process requires a lot of time on the part of prescribers which takes away
time from seeing patients. Completion of the PA form requires up to 40 minutes.
Here are a few examples:
o A child and adolescent psychiatrist, who sees Medicaid child and adolescent
patients, must complete 20 prior authorizations a day. He has to hire a staff
person just to do the prior authorizations each day.
o An addictions psychiatrist spends 2 hours each day on PAs for medication
assisted treatment medications.
When patients are denied coverage of their medications, they will go off their
medications if they cannot afford to pay for the medication out of pocket. If they do
not have their medications, they may decompensate and require hospitalization or
experience even worse outcomes including death.
Many MCOs and insurers have been requiring medical records to support the PA.
This is unethical and a violation of a patient’s privacy rights. The bill would
prohibit MCOs and insurers from requiring medical records to support the PA.
Requiring the response to the PA within two business days will help prevent
patients from decompensating or possibly overdosing for persons with opioid use
disorders.
The bill would allow PAs to be effective for one year so that the prescriber would
not need to do several PAs during the year as those PAs are unnecessary.

Please support HB 5769 as it will help patients get the care they need and it will help
patient safety. For any questions, please contact Meryl Sosa at msosa@ilpsych.org.
