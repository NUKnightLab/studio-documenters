III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
During the discussion of the proposed requests to increase and extend contracts for nurse agency services, Ms.
Lopez provided an update on recruitment efforts. Dr. Raju noted that the System loses approximately twenty
to thirty nurses per month for a variety of reasons, including retirement. In response to Director Hammock’s
inquiry regarding the percentage of the attrition that is due to retirement reasons, Ms. Lopez stated that she can
provide this information at the next meeting1. Additionally, Director Hammock inquired regarding the cost
differential between temporary and permanent staff. Mr. Cookinham responded that, in some cases, it is hard
to determine; he offered to come back at a future meeting with a comparison of the costs. Following
discussion, it was indicated that, since a comparison was done in the past, another comparison would not need
to be done at this time.
Errata was provided by Ms. Besenhofer for request number 6. She stated that the transmittal should reflect that
the term of the contract is thirty-six months (not twenty-four months). During the review of the transmittal,
Director Hammock inquired whether the contract was being retroactively executed back to January 1, 2013.
Ms. Besenhofer responded that she will find out and provide a response2.
Director Ramirez, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 7. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Any items listed under Sections III and IV

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided an update on the Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver
Demonstration Project/CountyCare.
Mr. Glass stated that the data for November are mixed. On November 16th, all of the CountyCare application
assistors transitioned to the Application for Benefits Eligibility (ABE) System; this is the State’s new on-line
application system . This transition, as in any transition to a new technology, resulted in a drop in productivity
as the users learn the new system and gain confidence on how to use it best. In just two weeks, however,
improvement has already been seen.
As a result of this information system transition, the number of daily applications initiated in November
dropped to an average of 338 per day. At the end of November, just over 125,000 applications had been
initiated year-to-date; this represents an increase of nearly 8,000 from the month before.
As in months past, the majority of applications (65%) continue to be initiated through the call center, the oncampus application assistors and other program vendors; 29% have been initiated from the CountyCare
network partners; with the remaining 6% initiated from work within Cermak Health Services, which is located
in the Cook County Department of Corrections.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update on CountyCare (continued)
On November 30th, over 92,000 applications had been submitted to the Illinois Department of Human Services
(DHS) for processing. Of these, CCHHS has received verification that 61,020 have been approved as
CountyCare members; this membership is 5,000 higher than the FY2014 budgeted membership of 56,131.
In November, the State processed an average of 543 applications per work day. This, coupled with the decrease
in applications submitted, brought the backlog of applications to an estimated 23,800; this represents a
decrease of nearly 4,000 pending applications from the month prior.
Mr. Glass noted that he will be giving a full overview of CountyCare at the December 13th Board Meeting.
Director Hammock, seconded by Director Ramirez, moved to receive and file the
report. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

V.

Report from System Director of Supply Chain Management
A. Report of emergency purchases (Attachment #2)
Ms. Besenhofer presented the report of emergency purchases. The Committee reviewed the information.
For the Committee’s information, Elizabeth Reidy, System General Counsel, provided an overview of the
County’s Procurement Code as it relates to emergency purchases; emergency purchases are those purchases
made under an emergency situation regardless of the dollar amount.
Director Hammock, seconded by Director Ramirez, moved to accept the report of
emergency purchases. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

VI.

Report from Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #3)
A. Financial Reports – through October 2013 (Attachment #4)
Mr. Cookinham presented the Financial Reports through October 2013, and provided a presentation regarding
improving financial reporting. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Mr. Cookinham’s presentation included information on the following: CountyCare Revenue; Non-Operating
Revenue; Financial Initiatives; and Income Statements. Discussion was held on the subject of improving the
usefulness of the financial reports.

CountyCare Contracting Transmittal Cover 
Prepared for: CCHHS Finance Committee December 2013 Meeting 
Steven Glass, Executive Director Managed Care 
 
Background 
In the next several months, CountyCare will undergo significant transition from operating under the 1115 
Waiver to a fully‐functioning managed care entity. In addition, CountyCare plans to migrate its back‐office, 
provider and member services, contracted mental health/substance abuse (MH/SA) network, and pharmacy 
benefits management (PBM) services to a new, single vendor through a currently active RFP process.  
 
For CountyCare to achieve this level of work, staff will be asking the CCHHS Finance Committee and Board of 
Directors (BOD) to review a significant number of contract recommendations during this time period.  
 
Transition Overview 
With the RFP review for a new TPA vendor underway at this time, it is necessary to extend, and in some cases 
amend, the agreements in‐place with existing providers. These extensions will allow CountyCare staff to work 
with the to‐be‐selected new TPA vendor on developing a formal transition plan that mitigates risk for 
CountyCare members and contracted network providers in the transition. The new vendor is expected to be 
presented at either the December or January Board Meetings for review. 
 
December 2013 Contract Requests 
At this time, staff are presenting four transmittals requesting contract extensions/amendments in support of the 
transition plan.

Re: Emergency Purchase

has placed an emergency order. This memo serves as notification, as required in
Section 2.8 of the Procurement Policy adopted by the Board on April 9, 2009.

This purchase was required to allow time for the completion of our proper due diligence. The
scope of work currently being provided for security services at Provident Hospital has been
under review. The recommendation being vetted is to reduce the scope of work currently being
performed with no negative impact to the safety of our patients and staff.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at
or 312-864-4798.

 Overview
•

CCHHS’s operating revenue is lagging mainly due to the delay in 
CountyCare application approvals This is a cash flow issue that we expect
CountyCare application approvals. This is a cash flow issue that we expect 
to resolve itself in 2014 when the state catches up. These revenues fall 
into three areas:
– PMPM from date of application
PMPM f
d t f
li ti
– Fee‐for‐service for CountyCare members 
– Administrative fees

•

Total operating expenses YTD are 4.7% under budget. Total October 
operating expenses were in excess of the budget by 29% in the following 
categories Supplies Purchased Services and Other and Utilities CCHHS
categories: Supplies, Purchased Services and Other, and Utilities. CCHHS 
bases its reporting on when the County Comptroller’s Office actually pays 
the bill.  This process creates timing differences from period to period 
when making comparisons of actual expenses to the budget.

exceeded the budgeted number of applications for the 1115 waiver 
program and it is expected that all of the budgeted capitation 
revenue will be collected for all approved applications. 
• In addition to the capitation revenue, there is additional revenue 
that can be billed as Medicaid fee for service for a retro period 90
that can be billed as Medicaid fee for service for a retro period 90 
days prior to the application.  This revenue can be billed when the

will be received in 2014.

• Non–Operating revenue in October was below budget for the 
month due to an adjustment in the estimate for sales taxes.  
j
The County Comptroller’s Office re‐allocated sales taxes and 
cigarette taxes.  This change will be favorable in the future to 
CCHHS because the collection cycle for cigarette taxes is
CCHHS because the collection cycle for cigarette taxes is 
shorter than sales taxes.   
• Non‐Operating Revenue YTD is behind budget by less than 
2%.  It is expected that by year end CCHHS will collect the full 
amount of the tax support from the County

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended October 31, 2013. This discussion focuses
on the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current month.
It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of the
CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Starting this fiscal year 2013, we have added the 1115
Waiver. Collectively, these entities provide primary, intermediate, acute, and tertiary
medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to pay. The Bureau of Health
Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2012 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and Cook County Board Officials
collaborated to cut Medicaid costs, help county taxpayers, and transform Cook County’s
hospital system by jump-starting national health care reform in Cook County. In October,
2012 the federal governmnent approved the 1115 Medicaid Waiver for Cook County,
allowing CCHHS to enroll more than 115,000 individuals who will be eligible for
Medicaid in 2014 into a Cook County network with no cost to the state of Illinois.
An 1115 Waiver allows the Cook County’s Health System to early enroll certain
uninsured patients into Medicaid. Specifically, these are patients who are not currently
eligible for Medicaid, but who will be eligible in 2014 under the Accountable Care Act.
Many of these individuals are patients who already are being treated by our system
without compensation. The Waiver is funded entirely by the federal government.

 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the eleven months with overall
revenue of $827,947 and overall expenses was $927,312.
Net Patient revenue for the eleven months was $529,875.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
EHR incentive program revenue was $7,075.
Other revenue was $5,717. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
General
As compared to November 30, 2012, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
October-2013 reduced by 19 to 103 days. Additionally, there was a 2 day decrease in this
figure, as compared to the previous month’s figure.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage, including 1115 waiver
and MANG applications;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Total billed accounts grew by $23.152M (7.9%) as compared to the November-2012
balance. As compared to the previous month, this figure decreased by $2.950M (-0.9%).
The decline in this figure indicates an increasing number of accounts are completing the
collection process, which includes charity care and bad debt write-offs.
6
Page 33 of 63

 The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of October-2013 increased by
$0.402M (4.6%), as compared the November 30, 2012 balance and decreased by
$1.609M (-14.9%), as compared to the previous month’s balance. This decrease
indicates that more inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the
previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of October-2013 decreased by $0.170M (-0.1%) as
compared to the November 30, 2012 balance. This figure fell by $14.991M (-8.8%)
compared to the previous month’s total.
The decrease in this number indicates more accounts had the collection process
completed than in the previous month and that a greater number of accounts are being
removed from active accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity
care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
up on the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts decreased by $0.985M (-5.7%) by the end of
October-2013, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2012.
This balance was $1.692M (11.5%) larger than the previous month’s balance. This
7
Page 34 of 63

 change indicates that fewer outpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as
compared to the previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.

Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of October-2013 grew by $23.322M
(16.8%), as compared to the balance as of November 30, 2012. This figure is $12.041M
(8.0%) greater than last month’s figure.
The growth in this figure indicates that fewer Out-Patient accounts had their collection
and write-off related activities completed, as compared to the prior month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

The above data does not include bad-debt write-offs; it includes only the amounts
written-off directly to charity care.

Operating Expenses at the end of eleven months was $927.312M broken down as
follows:
Salaries and Wages - $466.461M
Benefits - $126.587M
Supplies - $103.608M
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $180.040M
Insurance - $10.761M
Depreciation - $31.122M
Utilities - $8.734M

Page 35 of 63

 Nonoperating Revenue was $281.387M. The largest portions of this are attributed to
cigarette tax in the amount of $119.244M and property tax in the amount of $72.571M.
Sales tax revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the
underlying sales transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois Sales Tax represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet
received from the state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales
transaction to the receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

Notes:
- ER Elopes are patients who leave without being seen by a physician.
- "Medicaid-Pending" assumes 30% of the Self-Pay accounts accepted by the eligibility vendor will be successfully converted to Medicaid accounts.
- The "Payer Type" represents the financial class in which the patient presented to CCHHS; it is not necessarily the final financial class for the patient, especially for Self-Pay patients.

(This data does not include Immediate Care Visits. It includes ER data only.)
Notes:
- ER Elopes are patients who leave without being seen by a physician.
- "Medicaid-Pending" assumes 30% of the Self-Pay accounts accepted by the eligibility vendor will be successfully converted to Medicaid accounts.
- The "Payer Type" represents the financial class in which the patient presented to CCHHS; it is not necessarily the final financial class for the patient, especially for Self-Pay patients.
