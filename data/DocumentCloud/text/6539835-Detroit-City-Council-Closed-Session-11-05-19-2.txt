Dear Detroit City Council,

Detroit Horse Power is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonpro?t founded in 2015 with the
following mission statement:

Detroit Horse Power uniquely addresses two persistent problems facing the Motor City:
the shortage of opportunities for metro Detroit?s vulnerable populations (especially
children) and the abundance of vacant land. Through riding and caring for horses in a
safe and enriching space, program participants learn valuable skills that set them up
for future success. Our facility, built on repurposed vacant land, will contribute to the
city?s renewal and be a center for community events and equestrian services.

To expand the impact horses can have on kids and communities in Detroit, we are
preparing for our annual gala on November 15, 2019. The event will be held from
6:00?10:00pm at The Roostertail and feature cocktails, a strolling dinner, raf?es,
silent auction, and an educational program. All proceeds from the event will go to
support our youth development programs for Detroit?s young people in the year
ahead.

In order for the State to process our charitable gaming license, we are requesting that
you approve a resolution recognizing Detroit Horse Power as a nonprofit
organization operating in the community and that you support our application for a
charitable gaming license. Please let me know if I can answer any questions or provide
additional documentation for you to consider during this process.

I appreciate your time in reviewing this request. Thank you for the vital work you do
to advance our city.
Sincerely,

David M. Silver
