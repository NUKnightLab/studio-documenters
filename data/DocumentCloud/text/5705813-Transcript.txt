·1· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· All right.· Thank you for
·2· coming.· We'll convene this meeting.
·3· · · · · · · · ·I'll call the roll.
·4· · · · · · · · ·Alderman Tunney.
·5· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Here.
·6· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Alderman Austin.
·7· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· Present.
·8· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Director Holt.
·9· · · · DIRECTOR HOLT:· Present.
10· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· And Andy Mooney is present,
11· so we have a quorum.
12· · · · · · · · ·We don't intend to take too much of
13· your time today because we had an earlier meeting
14· that at least three of the members were able to
15· attend.
16· · · · · · · · ·We did go through a lot of the
17· material then.· We didn't take any formal actions,
18· but we did go through a lot of these materials.
19· · · · · · · · ·So unless you have some questions,
20· Alderman Austin, that you would like to ask on the
21· prior material, I think we'll just refer to it now
22· and make it part of the record.
23· · · · · · · · ·So let me recognize Lois Scott, who
24· is joining us, too, as a member of the board.

·1· · · · · · · · ·So why don't we go through -- unless
·2· there is an objection, if we could go to item No. 5
·3· on the agenda, which is the consideration of the
·4· Near North Health Service Corporation project.
·5· · · · · · · · ·So Tony?
·6· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· Thank you.
·7· · · · · · · · ·So the first project up on the
·8· docket today for consideration is a federally
·9· qualified health center/standalone clinic on the
10· west side at north avenue and Kostner in the west
11· Humboldt Park neighborhood.
12· · · · · · · · ·This is a 26,500 square-foot LEED13· Gold new construction facility.· It will have 21
14· exam rooms as well as a number of specialty
15· services, so radiography, ophthalmology, and
16· dental, all under one roof as part of an integrated
17· medical home service delivery concept.
18· · · · · · · · ·Also some healthy food aspects to
19· this project, an extensive rooftop garden that will
20· be open to patients and the community at large, as
21· well as a cooking demonstration kitchen.· So lots
22· of intent to provide healthy foods access and
23· educational outreach out of this facility in a very
24· high diabetes neighborhood.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

 ·MEETING, 06/04/2013
Page 4

·1· · · · · · · · ·And then also there is community
·2· meeting space baked into the facility as well; it
·3· will be open for neighborhood groups and residents
·4· to come and convene, for community affairs.
·5· · · · · · · · ·It's in a deeply distressed census
·6· tract.· The median family income in this location
·7· is just about half of the Chicago regional median.
·8· · · · · · · · ·Here's a context map and aerial
·9· photo.· So the project is in an existing shopping
10· center that's anchored by a Menards facility.· And
11· there is Aldi next door, and then a few out-parcels
12· that are not yet developed.
13· · · · · · · · ·So this facility is being built in a
14· parcel that was sold to it by Menards and is
15· fronting on Kostner Avenue across the street from
16· the neighborhood.
17· · · · · · · · ·So the sponsor is Near North Health
18· Service Corporation, which is a multi-site
19· federally qualified health care center, clinic
20· operator, that dates back to 1966.· They currently
21· have eight facilities in Chicago.· Their flagship
22· is right near the old Cabrini-Green site at
23· Clybourn and just north of Division, but they also
24· serve the west side and the south side fairly

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

 ·MEETING, 06/04/2013
Page 5

·1· extensively.
·2· · · · · · · · ·So currently they serve about 40,000
·3· patients.· And the average is two to three visits a
·4· year per patient, so about a hundred thousand
·5· visits annually for that patient base.· They have a
·6· much higher uninsured patient population than some
·7· of their counterpart FQHC networks.· 40 percent of
·8· their patients are covered through Medicaid, and
·9· then 4 through Medicare.
10· · · · · · · · ·So 74 percent of their clientele
11· live below the federal poverty level.
12· · · · · · · · ·So this facility is a net expansion
13· of their network.· They currently have a leased
14· space on Chicago Avenue that was -- that this place
15· was going to replace, but they actually had so much
16· demand at the Chicago Avenue space that this is
17· going to be a net new facility, and they'll leave
18· the leased facility on Chicago open.
19· · · · · · · · ·The projected community impacts from
20· this facility include serving ten thousand patients
21· per year in the first year, and growth after that;
22· a very integrated package of services, including
23· referral services to other specialty care that's
24· not available on site, as well as extensive

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

 ·MEETING, 06/04/2013
Page 6

·1· ancillary services on site.
·2· · · · · · · · ·Dental care and ophthalmology are
·3· particularly high-need services in low income
·4· communities in Chicago, and so this facility would
·5· include those on site.· And then also a lot of
·6· attention given to a high diabetes population in
·7· the neighborhood, and a lot of the features in the
·8· facility to address that.
·9· · · · · · · · ·Then three full-time nutritionists
10· and four full-time diet clerks to work on the
11· health and wellness aspects of the healthy foods
12· for the patient base.
13· · · · · · · · ·Employment impacts.· There's 34
14· full-time employees, 27 of them new to the network,
15· at an average hourly wage of $22.59.
16· · · · · · · · ·Half of those roughly would require
17· less than a bachelor's degree, so good job
18· accessibility in that portion.· And then Near North
19· has a strong track record of hiring extensively
20· from the neighborhoods surrounding their
21· facilities, so they are targeting at least 50
22· percent hiring of that type.
23· · · · · · · · ·They are a green facility to be
24· certified LEED-Gold.· They have a very extensive

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

 ·MEETING, 06/04/2013

·1· geothermal heating and cooling system, and then an
·2· highly accessible green roof that is going to be
·3· part of the rooftop gardening component.
·4· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Can I ask -·5· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yes.· Please.
·6· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Maybe it's -- I've been
·7· looking at so many numbers over the last two weeks,
·8· I want to make sure that I get your percentages
·9· right.
10· · · · · · · · ·On the uninsured, am I -- how many
11· people have insurance?
12· · · · MR. SMITH:· So -13· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· I mean, outside of the
14· Medicaid and Medicare.· I didn't completely
15· understand that line.
16· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· So 56 percent of their
17· patients have no insurance.
18· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· 56 percent -- nothing.
19· · · · MR. SMITH:· Right.
20· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· But they're -- they would
21· be eligible for Medicaid.· No?
22· · · · · · · · ·That's why I wanted to clear that up.
23· · · · MS. SCOTT:· Could be undocumented ...
24· · · · MR. SMITH:· Right.· And/or single men have a

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

 ·MEETING, 06/04/2013
Page 8

·1· higher threshold of qualification for Medicaid than
·2· women with children do, and so they do have a
·3· significant amount of that population.
·4· · · · · · · · ·This is -- FQHC, as part of the FQHC
·5· designation is that you have to serve whoever walks
·6· in your door, regardless of the ability to pay.
·7· · · · · · · · ·And so Near North receives
·8· Chapter 330 funding from the U. S. Department of
·9· Health and Human Services to compensate in part for
10· that dynamic.· They do anticipate that a lot of
11· their patients that are currently uninsured are
12· going to be newly added to Medicaid after the
13· Affordable Care Act gets implemented, at least by
14· 2014.
15· · · · MS. SCOTT:· What is the revenue stream?
16· · · · · · · · ·Is it primarily -- is that
17· 50 percent federal government/50 percent state?
18· · · · MR. SMITH:· I believe it's primarily
19· Medicaid.· That's the dominant revenue stream for
20· them.
21· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· And was it the health care
22· center that determined that this was a high
23· diabetic area?· Who determined that?
24· · · · MR. SMITH:· I'm not sure where the --

 ·MEETING, 06/04/2013
Page 9

·1· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· I mean, I'm asking because
·2· you used it three times.
·3· · · · · · · · ·So where did you get that analysis
·4· from?
·5· · · · MR. SMITH:· We have received that information
·6· from the Near North network.· We haven't
·7· independently verified the diabetes level of the
·8· neighborhood.
·9· · · · MS. SCOTT:· Okay.· Because their ratio of
10· uninsured is lower than mine at the Roseland
11· Hospital.· So that's the reason why I'm asking,
12· because we have already been determined as a high
13· diabetic area, as well as high blood pressure.
14· · · · · · · · ·So who made that determination is
15· the reason why I'm asking.· You know, mine is more
16· than 56 percent.· So if mine is in trouble -- so
17· I'm trying to understand what is it that they're
18· doing besides management that would give them that
19· designation.
20· · · · MR. SMITH:· I don't think there is a specific
21· designation related to diabetes that they enjoy.
22· · · · · · · · ·I do know that federally qualified
23· health centers -- part of the tradeoff for the
24· patients that they have to serve is that they also

·1· receive enhanced Medicaid reimbursement rates for
·2· the same procedures, as compared to a hospital
·3· would.
·4· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· Plus they are a health
·5· center, and we're a hospital.
·6· · · · MR. SMITH:· Right.
·7· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· All right.· That's for now.
·8· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· And back on the uninsured,
·9· we haven't resolved this issue on the Affordable
10· Health Care Act for people that are not residents
11· or citizens.
12· · · · · · · · ·I mean, we have not -- I mean, I
13· believe -- I hope -- there is going to be some at
14· least interpretation, some clarification with the
15· immigration bill, if it ever hits the floor, Senate
16· floor, whatever, or the President's signature at
17· some point.
18· · · · · · · · ·I'm just -- the Affordable Health
19· Care Act -- there are so many unanswered questions.
20· And the time is looming to -- for anyone to make
21· decisions about enrolling, and, you know, blah,
22· blah, blah.
23· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· And why did they lose their
24· lease at the former facility?· Was it that they

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 ·MEETING, 06/04/2013
Page 11

·1· needed more space or something?· Or what ...
·2· · · · MR. SMITH:· I believe so, yeah.
·3· · · · · · · · ·We don't -- we don't have a lot of
·4· details on what caused the lease to be lost.
·5· · · · · · · · ·But they were -- they intended to
·6· expand.· They did receive a federal grant from
·7· HRSA.
·8· · · · MS. SCOTT:· So this is a part of their
·9· expansion.
10· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yes.
11· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Do you want to go over the
12· financial?
13· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· So the proposed sources
14· for the financing include that federal grant from
15· HRSA that I mentioned.· HRSA is a subunit within
16· Health and Human Services that specifically deals
17· with federally qualified health centers, and so
18· they make capital grants to new facilities like
19· this, as well as operating grants.
20· · · · · · · · ·So HRSA grant funds are also a
21· feature in the PCC Wellness deal and the Chicago
22· Family Health Center deals that CDF has previously
23· worked on.
24· · · · · · · · ·And then about $5 million in senior

·1· debt.· They're in the final stages of discussion
·2· with both JP Morgan Chase and MB Financial about
·3· that senior debt component and are likely to select
·4· one of those two providers.
·5· · · · · · · · ·The tax credit equity would come
·6· from JP Morgan Chase.· The tax credit pricing is
·7· very favorable on this deal.· It's 80 cents per
·8· dollar tax credit, a new record for CDF.
·9· · · · · · · · ·And the total allocation that CDF
10· would be proposing to use here is $11.45 million,
11· so generally just a little bit more than $3 million
12· of net benefit out of a $13.7 million project.
13· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· So we're going to provide
14· the maximum, or the majority, if we're providing 11
15· out of 13.
16· · · · MR. SMITH:· Well, so the tax credit
17· allocation -18· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· So we are providing them
19· three.
20· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yes.· The net benefit is 3,
21· right.
22· · · · MS. SCOTT:· The face amount is 11.4.
23· · · · · · · · ·But they can only go out in the
24· market and get three.

·2· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· All right.
·3· · · · MS. SCOTT:· We see the same banks all the

·5· groups, you know.· Same banks.
·6· · · · · · · · ·MB Financial, wherever they are,

10· · · · · · · · ·If not, could I have a motion,
11· please.
12· · · · ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· Motion to pass.

17· · · · · · · · · · · (Chorus of ayes.)
18· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Thank you.
19· · · · · · · · ·We'll take the second project.
20· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· This one has been in
21· discussions with CDF and the City of Chicago for
22· quite some time.· I believe 2007 might have been
23· the initial encounter.

·1· project sponsor.· They are a social service
·2· organization on the west side in the Garfield Park
·3· neighborhood.
·4· · · · · · · · ·And the proposed project is actually
·5· two buildings kind of wrapped in a single project.
·6· · · · · · · · ·The FamilyPlex is the larger
·7· component, which is new construction of a 42,500
·8· square foot LEED-certified facility to expand their
·9· programs for homeless and low income families,
10· including a leased space for a very small kind of
11· mini-clinic operated by the Lawndale Christian
12· Health Center.
13· · · · · · · · ·And then the Joshua Center is a
14· rehab project across the street, a 9,500 square
15· foot space to expand their homeless women's program
16· and food pantry program.
17· · · · · · · · ·So the two sites are on the same -18· or very close to each other on West Carroll Avenue
19· in the East Garfield Park neighborhood, an even
20· more distressed neighborhood than the Near North
21· facility is going into.
22· · · · · · · · ·Median family income is about 40
23· percent of the Chicago region average, or median.
24· · · · · · · · ·And the poverty rate is over 50

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

·1· percent, and the unemployment rate is over 23
·2· percent in this particular census tract.
·3· · · · · · · · ·A little project context here.
·4· · · · · · · · ·So there is the project site with
·5· the red star.· So it's a little bit northeast of
·6· the Garfield Park Conservatory, and a little bit
·7· west of Kedzie Avenue.
·8· · · · · · · · ·The sponsor, Breakthrough Urban
·9· Ministries, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, very much
10· East Garfield Park focused.· They date back to the
11· early nineties when they started out as purely a
12· homeless services organization providing a drop-in
13· shelter.· Today they have a much broader spectrum
14· of services, including transitional housing,
15· employment training, health care service
16· coordination for homeless and at-risk adults.
17· · · · · · · · ·And then the FamilyPlex would be
18· dramatically expanding their services to children
19· and families in the neighborhood.· So early
20· childhood education, subsidized rate day care, a
21· fitness center, and a cafe would be key components
22· of the FamilyPlex.
23· · · · · · · · ·So in terms of trying to quantify
24· the impact, 4,000 patients a year is the projected

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 ·MEETING, 06/04/2013
Page 16

·1· service level for the Lawndale Christian
·2· mini-clinic.· Youth education would expand to
·3· almost 400 students, from just over a hundred.
·4· · · · · · · · ·And so they would offer preschool
·5· and enrichment programs, ranging from pre-K all the
·6· way to up high school, to assist with college
·7· preparatory readiness.· And they would dramatically
·8· expand their fitness center to -- over fourfold,
·9· minor expansion to their homeless services, and
10· then expansion of their healthy foods pantry,
11· including kind of a mock grocery store format for
12· that.
13· · · · · · · · ·31 new jobs are projected from
14· Breakthrough Ministries itself, as well as 19
15· positions to be added to the Lawndale Christian
16· Health Center tenant space.
17· · · · · · · · ·Average wage for these jobs is just
18· over $16 an hour with full benefits for any full19· time employees.· And again, a very good
20· accessibility level for these jobs; 31 out of 33
21· positions require less than a bachelor's degree.
22· · · · · · · · ·The facility also is going to be a
23· very green building.· LEED-Silver is projected, a
24· green roof, geothermal system.

·1· · · · · · · · ·In terms of the deal structure, a
·2· bit more complicated than the Near North
·3· transaction.· They are in discussions -- more than
·4· discussions.· They are in the redevelopment
·5· agreement drafting stage with the City of Chicago
·6· for TIF assistance as well.
·7· · · · · · · · ·That TIF financing would be
·8· integrated with a New Markets structure, and the
·9· TIF money and a PNC Bank loan that's monetizing the
10· TIF money would flow through as part of the
11· leverage for the New Markets transaction.
12· · · · · · · · ·The organization itself is putting
13· in over $4 million of their balance sheet cash, as
14· well as fundraising proceeds.· They are also
15· receiving a junior unsecured loan from some of
16· their donors for $1.3 million.· So an array of
17· sources that are being carefully configured to
18· leverage through New Markets.
19· · · · · · · · ·PNC Bank would be the tax credit
20· investor, along with senior lender position, and
21· they will provide up to $3 million -- or they will
22· provide $3 million, not up to -- but $3 million of
23· their own allocation as part of the $16 million
24· total transaction.

·1· · · · · · · · ·So that's about $3.8 million of net
·2· benefit coming from the CDF portion of this deal.
·3· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· So on both of these
·4· projects, we have nutrition, cafe, need for
·5· expertise.
·6· · · · · · · · ·Is there any public-private help
·7· there?· Is there -- you know, I'm thinking, who's
·8· running these cafes?· Who's -- you know, who's
·9· providing the management, and also the education?
10· · · · · · · · ·I mean, there's nutritionists on one
11· of them.· But you have cafes.· And, you know, the
12· first question I have is who's running the place,
13· at least in terms of the food service, because it's
14· really important that you get healthy food and you
15· get it run well and you employ people and you get
16· them trained.· And you get them -- you know.
17· · · · · · · · ·So could we -- do you have any
18· comment on that.
19· · · · MR. SMITH:· I know on Near North that they
20· are hiring -21· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Is there any network with
22· the -- like the Illinois Restaurant Association,
23· saying, hey, here's an opportunity.· Okay?

Page 19

·1· sometimes the restaurateurs want to know how they
·2· can help, how they can -- you know, they have
·3· product.
·4· · · · · · · · ·But, you know, I mean, I think that
·5· it would be interesting, since this is becoming
·6· a -- clearly a focus in our health centers, what

·8· and then providing that training that ultimately
·9· could lead to jobs, better jobs, transition, and
10· healthier people.
11· · · · MR. SMITH:· I don't have a ton of information
12· that's right -- available at the moment about
13· Breakthrough's -- the source of their donation.
14· · · · · · · · ·Is that part of what you're getting
15· at for the food management here?
16· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· It's the private -17· private-public -- I mean, Breakthrough of course is
18· a not-for-profit.· But, you know, there's a lot of
19· expertise in this town in restaurants and food
20· service.· And what are we doing to link
21· communities?
22· · · · · · · · ·And, you know, I think it's -- you
23· know, it could be an attractive project for -- you

·1· doing for the city, besides -·2· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yes.
·3· · · · MS. SCOTT:· It's a very generous community as
·4· well, and they -- they really do a lot.
·5· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Let's find out.· They may
·6· already have some relationships that we are not
·7· aware of.
·8· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· Absolutely.
·9· · · · MS. SCOTT:· A question.· Urban Ministry and
10· the Christian Health Clinic, we've checked all the
11· religious issues, right?
12· · · · · · · · ·We have to be careful.
13· · · · MR. SMITH:· So in the discussions with
14· Breakthrough, there was certainly discussion about
15· CDF's antidiscrimination policy that was adopted
16· last November.
17· · · · · · · · ·For a time they were thinking they
18· would be asking for the board to specifically
19· consider a -- it wouldn't be a waiver, but it would
20· be kind of an accommodation under that existing
21· policy, but in the framework that the board had
22· already adopted.
23· · · · · · · · ·But they've actually backed away
24· from that.· They're willing to fully commit to

·1· every employee in this facility being hired on a
·2· fully nondiscriminatory basis, including religion.
·3· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Okay.· Any other comments?
·4· · · · MR. DESAI:· As far as their organization,
·5· what have they done as far as financial evaluation
·6· of the expansion of the services?
·7· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· They have worked
·8· extensively with the Executive Service Corps, which
·9· is a nonprofit, retired executives, helping them do
10· business planning.
11· · · · · · · · ·So they've done a fairly granular
12· analysis of the different services they would be
13· offering, funding sources for those services, the
14· risk level attached to them, and so they have
15· carefully constructed the revenue stream for this
16· new facility.
17· · · · MR. DESAI:· That's what I was wondering
18· about.
19· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Any others?
20· · · · · · · · ·If not, could I have a motion?
21· · · · MS. SCOTT:· Motion.
22· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· May I have a second?
23· · · · ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Second.

16· the board.· Aarti Kotak, I believe there is,
17· somewhere in here -- I guess it's all the -- is it
18· all the officers?· Or just ...
19· · · · MR. SMITH:· It's two.
20· · · · · · · · ·It's you being renominated as
21· president, and then Aarti being nominated as VP,
22· secretary-treasurer.
23· · · · CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· So I'm happy to leave the
24· room if you all want to talk about me.
