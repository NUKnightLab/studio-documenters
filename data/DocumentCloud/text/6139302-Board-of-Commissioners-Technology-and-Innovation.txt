BUREAU OF TECHNOLOGY .. TRANSFER OF FUNDS.
Transmitting a
Communication, dated March 11, 2010 from R. Steve Edmonson, Chief
Information Officer:
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling
$425,000.00 from Account 545-260, Professional and Managerial Services to
Account 545-441, Maintenance and Repair of Data ProceSSing Equipment and
Software for the coverage of a contract for ground imagery maintenance which
includes acquisition of parcel images, ground control,. data collection and Federal
Geographic Data Committee compliance metadata Board approved on December
15,2009.
•
Reason:   The transfer is needed to cover funding that was originally budgeted for
2009, but due to contract proceSSing, the contract period was moved to
2010.
From Account:
545-260  

Total

$425,00

Total

$425,00

To Account:
545-441  
1.  

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would
require an infusion of funds in order to meet current obligations? What was
the balance in the account on that date, and what was the balance 30 days
prior to that date?
On February 22,2010, it became apparent that the Maintenance and Repair
of Data Processing Equipment and Software Account 545-:441 would require
an infusion of funds in order to meet outstanding maintenance obligations.
At this time, the balance of the account had $422,812.00, not including the
outstanding contract expenditures of $475,650.00.

2.  

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified?
List any other accounts that were also considered (but not used) as the
source of the transferred funds.

 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & AUTOMATION COMMITTEE NOTICE

APRIL 14, 2010
PAGE 4

Account 545~260 was identified as the source of transferred funds because
of the reduction of some of the geospatial projects which was realized via the
Request for Proposal process and cooperative acquisitions on a regional
level.
3.  

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations
that will be deferred, delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in
available spending authority that will result in the account that funds are
transferred from 545-260 Professional Services.
Savings in the account will occur in two ways:
1) Since the County Board authorized us to participate in a regional aerial
orthoimagery project with the seven neighboring counties, the Chicago
Metropolitan Agency for Planning and the United States Geological Survey,
we realized a projected savings of over $300,000.00.
.
2) The department will postpone the upgrade of an existing application,
Mapviewer that County agencies use internally to quickly produce map
displays.

4.  

If the answer to the above question is "none" then please explain why this
account was originally budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated
surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The funding for the contract was originally planned to be incurred as part of
fiscal year 2009. However due to the lengthy process of contract review and
negotiations and the end of the year account closeout, the contract funding
was carried into the 2010 fiscal year budget. The timing of the contract
processing was too late to add the contract into the 2010 fiscal budget and
not finalized enough to have the funds encumbered from 2009.
