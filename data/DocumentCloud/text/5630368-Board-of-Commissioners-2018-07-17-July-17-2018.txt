discussed, voted and recommended for approval the following two items.
On behalf of the Finance & Audit Committee, Committee Chairman Chico presented an Omnibus Motion
for the approval of Items No. 1 and 1A
(Item 1)
The resolution for Item 1 approves the exercise of third and final one-year option term of contract with
Ernst & Young, LLP, effective from November 10, 2018, through November 9, 2019, for firm-fixed fee
compensation in the amount of $911,500, to provide Independent Auditing Services. The CHA is
required to undergo an annual audit in conformity with Generally Accepted Auditing Principles. The
audit is used to determine whether the CHA’s financial data can be relied upon and the requirement
promotes sound financial management, including effective internal control, with respect to federal
2

 awards administered by HUD, state and local governments and not-for-profit organizations. For the past
four years, Ernst & Young has provided high quality auditing services to the Authority and has met
contract requirements as expected of an independent auditor.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2018-CHA-54
the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated July 17, 2018 entitled “RECOMMENDATION TO EXERCISE
THE SECOND-YEAR OPTION TERM WITH ERNST & YOUNG, LLP FOR
INDEPENDENT AUDITING SERVICES.”

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee
to enter into an amendment to Contract No. 11498 with Ernst & Young, LLP
exercising the third one-year option term, effective from November 10, 2018 through
November 9, 2019, to continue providing independent professional auditing services
for a firm-fixed fee compensation amount of $911,500 for the third and final oneyear option term.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE/ Section 3 hiring and insurance requirements.

(Item 1A)
The resolution for Item 1A approves the amended agreement with the New York City Housing Authority
with The Gordian Group to continue to implement, manage, and grow the Section 3 Job Order
Contracting (JOC) Mentoring Program in an amount not-to-exceed $2,000,000 for the original 2.5 base
years contract. When CHA initially contracted with the Gordian Group to facilitate the Section 3 JOC
program the program goal was to execute $30M of construction task orders over the 2 ½ year contract
period. As a result, in March 2018, the CHA gained Board approval to amend the New York City
Housing Authority’s contract with The Gordian Group for a contract value of $5,150,000; due to the
increase in the number of Section 3 Businesses from 46 to 107 and with the growing capabilities of these
businesses, the program has already exceeded its goal by reaching $63M in task orders completed, inprogress or assigned. The program is planned to continue to grow through the end of the contract term
to over $90M. The requested amendment to the Gordian group contract is to support the continued
growth and success of this program.
RESOLUTION NO. 2018-CHA-55

Global Vending Service LLC for beverage and snack vending services per CPS’ Specification Number
16-350060. These will be revenue generating contracts where the vendors will pay CHA a commission
on all vending sales. CHA’s participation in the cooperative purchasing agreements will also allow for
new streamlined revenue generating contracts where the vendors will pay CHA a commission (41%
Beverage; 25% Snack) on all vending sales instead of the previous 15% commission rate, while
providing healthier snack and beverage options to CHA residents. Property Office is seeking to replace
all existing snack and beverage vending machines and expand service to accommodate over 14,000 units
within its senior and family buildings. The CPS Nutrition Support Services Department had conducted
research with the American Heart Association, City of Chicago Healthy Food Program and other entities
to ensure that beverage and snacks in vending machines met federal and district nutrition wellness
guidelines.

(Item 6)
The CHA issued an Invitation for Bid (IFB) in June 2018 to solicit general contractors for the
construction of the Altgeld Gardens Community, Childcare and Library Facility located at 955 East 131st
Street. CHA solicited 30 vendors, 31 assist agencies and 388 Section 3 businesses and Procurement
Infor Rich Client Administration Commodity Codes for Construction Services, General, Construction
Services, New Construction and Construction Mgmt. Services. A total of six responsive bids were
received. A.L.L. Masonry Construction Company, Inc. submitted the lowest lump sum bid.
Accordingly, the resolution for Item 6 approves the award of contract to A.L.L. Masonry Construction
Company, Inc. for the construction of the Altgeld Gardens Community, Childcare and Library Facility
in the firm fixed price of $21,490,184.94 plus a not-to-exceed amount of $1,289,411.00 in contingency
(6%, which is in line with industry standards) strictly limited to potential change orders justified as
discovered conditions or code compliance issues for a total not-to-exceed amount of $22,779,596.00.
The current community space, childcare and library facilities are undersized, outdated and are unable to
provide many of the new educational tools and services that are currently provided in more modern
libraries, community and daycare centers which puts residents of Altgeld Gardens at a disadvantage. By
consolidating all three uses into one new facility, CHA will be able to centralize activities in one
location, maximize synergies and efficiencies in the various uses and provide the residents of Altgeld
Gardens with a world-class, LEED certified facility with the most up to date educational tools and
services. The new facility will be 40,200 total sq. ft. and comprised of a 10,000-sq. ft. CPL branch
library, an 8,200-sq. ft. community center and a 22,000-sq. ft. daycare center with expanded parent and
child programming functions. The planned new 10,000 sq. ft. Altgeld Public Library will provide up-todate CPL library services and functions, namely, free homework help for students, resume and job
seeking help for adults, and programming for seniors. At the same time, libraries are key to bridging the
digital divide, offering high speed internet access, Wi-Fi, computer labs, and going beyond to offer a
digital lab for teens and lending wireless hotspots so that patrons can access the internet at home. The
library will integrate Altgeld/Murray with the surrounding community in a value-added manner as a
resource for everyone. Many of these services are not currently available at the existing 4,000 sq. ft.
library located in the former gymnasium of Carver Elementary School as there is not enough space to
accommodate the programming. The new community center space within the facility will centralize the
existing community activities that are currently taking place across multiple non-dwelling buildings
based on availability. It will afford CHA and its residents access to a consistent location to hold
community activities. The new daycare center will be approximately 22,000 sq. ft., serve 120 children
and provide twelve brand new classroom spaces, a parent resource center and spaces for indoor
recreational programming and after school programming. The goal of CHA’s continued financial
investments in the Altgeld/Murray development is to create a strong, healthy and vibrant community.

 The construction of the Altgeld Gardens Community Center, Childcare and Library Facility represents
another milestone in accomplishing the goals set forth in the Master Plan.
