Election Day

A.

Possible removal of judges of election:

General Counsel Adam Lasker reported that at that time there weren't any requests for
removals, but there was at least one situation being investigated for possible removal.
B.
Possible court action to address late polling place openings:

So far everything seems to be fine. Executive Director Lance Gough already had
investigators dispatched to a couple of precincts to see if they opened on time.
Mr. Gough reported that of the 2,069 precincts, only 1-2 might have had issues
with opening, and investigators are looking into these. Reports show that 79% of
ePOLLBOOKS were up and running, and that 87% of HAATS reported on time.

Election Day

A.

Possible removal ofjudges of election:

1.

General Counsel Adam Lasker requested that the Board order Ms.

Katherine G. Charley, an assigned Democratic Judge of Election in Precinct 26 of

Ward 34 be removed as a Judge of Election. It was reported that Ms. Charley was
abusive and uncooperative with other Judges of Election and the Board's

Investigator. She appeared inebriated and smelled of alcohol. The Principal of the
school where the polling place is located requested that Ms. Charley be removed
from the polling place as students were present and Ms. Charley's behavior was
inappropriate. The Board's Investigator saw, in the first person, that Ms. Charley
was inebriated and abusive.

Commissioner Swain moved to have Katherine G. Charley, Democratic
Judge of Election in Precinct 26 of Ward 34, removed for cause.

Commissioner Kresse seconded the motion. The motion was passed by a
3:0 vote of the Board. The Board signed an Order and Notice of Removal
in open session.

B.

Possible court action to address late polling place openings:
Mr. Lasker provided an update regarding polling places that opened late. He and
others reviewed the help desk entries and further investigated the reports on
"late openings" and found that:

1.
Precinct 3 of Ward 5 had no electricity or heat, but used the backup
power supply on e-poll book to process voters. The proprietor was finally
contacted and the polling place had heat and electricity restored. No voters from
Precinct 3 of Ward 5 were turned away. As such, there is no need for a court

order for this polling place to remain open beyond the scheduled hours.

2.

Precincts 24 and 5 of the 31st Ward (combined polling place). Only 1 judge

of election for Precinct 24 arrived on time, but the election coordinator and

judges from Precinct 5 assisted in setting up both precincts. We should not need a
court order to hold this polling place open beyond the scheduled hours because
no voters were turned away.

3.

Precinct 21 of Ward 18. Four voters could not wait for the polls to be

opened.These voters names were taken, and they each said that they were going
to return to vote by 7:00 p.m. Thus, no voters were disenfranchised.

There appears to be no need for a court order to keep any polling places open for
voting beyond 7:00 p.m.

Chicago Board ofElection Commissioners
A.

Possible removal ofjudges of election:

1.
Board Law Clerk Anabel Abarca requested the Board order the removal of
Ramona T. Alonzo, assigned Democratic Judge of Election in Precinct 35 of Ward
26, as a Judge of Election. Ms. Abarca reported that Ms. Alonzo had violated the

Judges Code of Conduct,to wit, that Ms. Abarca left the polling place and
returned with a person who said that he was a member of a gang,that Ms. Alonzo
was electioneering in the polling place by encouraging voters to vote for
candidate Roberto Maldonado,and that Ms. Alonzo used profanity and
intimidation tactics toward fellow poll workers and made several racist
comments.

Commissioner Swain moved to have a Ramona T. Alonzo, Democratic

Judge of Election in Precinct 35 of Ward 26, removed as a Judge of Election.
Commissioner Kresse seconded the motion. The Board voted 3:0 to order the

removal of Ramona T. Alonzo as a Judge of Election. The Order and Notice of
Removal were signed in open session.

B.

Possible court action to address late polling place openings:
Mr. Lasker provided an update regarding polling places that were late opening.
There is only one precinct for which Mr. Lasker recommends that the Board seek

a Temporary Restraining Order from the Circuit Court requiring the 3'"*' Precinct of

the 45^*^ Ward polling place remain open for voting until 8:00 p.m.
The Board was not initially aware of the late opening because the precinct is in a
combined polling place at Independence Park, and the room was set up and
staffed, but there were equipment issues in the 3^*^ Precinct. The Judges of
Election were unable to open the Equipment Supply Carrier(ESC) until around
6:45 a.m. Once the Judges were able to access the ESC,they had technical
difficulties with the e-poll book (EPB), such that voters could not be checked in

and allowed to vote until around 8:00-8:15. The touchscreen was not functioning
and was replaced at 10:00 a.m. About 10-15 voters were turned away.Some
voters returned, but the status of several other voters is unknown. We are unable

to identify whether or not these voters will be able to return to the polling place
by 7:00;some had indicated that they would not be able to make it back by 7:00,
but might be able to return by 8:00 to vote.

Chair Hernandez stated that this was a reasonable request to give the opportunity
to those who tried to vote, and due to no fault of their own, were not allowed to
vote at that time.

Commissioner Kresse moved to have the General Counsel file an Emergency
Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order to keep Precinct 3 of Ward 45 open for
voting until 8:00 p.m. Commissioner Swain seconded the motion. The motion was
passed by unanimous vote of the Board.

Election Day

A.

Possible removal ofjudges of election:

1.

Board Law Clerk Anabel Abarca requested that the Board order the

removal of Desiree L. Morris, an assigned Republican Judge of Election, in Precinct
9 of Ward 7. Ms. Abarca reported that Ms. Morris had violated the Judges Code of
Conduct,to wit, she argued with fellow Election Judges about the setup of
equipment, and she became angry and made threats toward one of the other

Judges. Ms. Morris was escorted off the premises by a Board Investigator on the
scene, and was told that she should not return to the polling place, but that she

could return to vote if she didn't disrupt the polling place. Two investigators were
on site. There are enough judges present to take over Ms. Morris' duties.

Commissioner Kresse moved to have a Desiree L. Morris, Republican Judge of
Election in Precinct 35 of Ward 26, removed as a Judge of Election. Commissioner
Swain seconded the motion. The Board voted 3:0 to remove Desiree L Morris as a

Judge of Election and signed the Order and Notice of Removal in open session.

Election Day

A.

Possible removal ofjudges of election:

1.
Law Clerk Anabel Abarca presented to the Board the pertinent facts
regarding the request for an Order of Removal of Judge of Election Fannie Mae
Seals, appointed to serve in the 30^^^ Precinct of the 35^^ Ward as a Democratic
Judge of Election. Ms. Seals violated the Judges of Election Code of conduct in

that she arrived late, and was absent from the polling place for several hours;
Election Board records showed that Ms. Seals showed similar behavior during
prior elections.

Ms. Abarca reported that an Investigator was dispatched to the scene and sent
back a report confirming the complaint.

General Counsel Lasker added that we probably will not pay Ms. Seals because of
her lack of work and that Ms.Seals will be noticed by mail.

Commissioner Swain moved to order the removal of Fannie Mae Seals as a Judge
of Election. Commissioner Kresse seconded the motion. The motion was
approved by a 3:0 vote of the Board and the Order and Notice of Removal was
signed in open session.
