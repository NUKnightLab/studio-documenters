Jan Anderson, Director

Detroit Parks and Recreation Division

18100 Meyer Rd

Detroit, MI

Dear Ms. Anderson,

On behalf of The Greening of Detroit, I am writing to offer our full assistance in purchasing and
installing an EPA grant funded in?ltration basin along the southern portion of Eliza Howell Park
north of Schoolcraft Road. This green infrastructure practice will be capable of managing
stormwater pollution by reducing highway runoff by over 50,000 gallons. It is envisioned that
improvements within Eliza Howell Park will be able to capture, store, and infiltrate runoff to
remove sediment that would currently discharge to the Rouge River. The grant calls for planting
50 trees, approximately I44 shrubs, and native seed mix throughout the installation. The costs.
rounding $350,000, are being borne by the group mentioned above. These improvements will take
place from July 2019 May 2020. Our organization has communicated with community
representative Sidewalk Detroit to ensure these improvements are desired. The Greening of Detroit
has budgeted for 200 hours of scheduled maintenance to maintain this site throughout the summer
including mowing, mulching, and vegetation replacement as needed.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

To Whom It May Concern
Eliza Howell Park,

As of June 18, 2019, Eliza Howell Park had been the new project site location for US EPA Grant EPA-RS-
GL2016-UWM, awarded to The Greening of Detroit in partnership with The City of Detroit, MDOT and
OHM.

Environmental conditions at the original project site, Forman Park, excluded it from deeper excavation
required for an underground outlet pipe, as needed for green stormwater installations in the city of
Detroit. The general consensus was to eliminate Forman Park, and evaluate alternative sites. Of the sites
proposed by the City, Eliza Howell Park was chosen based on its closest match to the original intent of
the grant, as well as the potential for a higher level of community engagement for the project.

The original award for the grant was $474,915. With considerable site work leading up to the change of
project site leaves the remaining total value of the project at $374,725.

Re: Urban Watershed Management Implementation (EPA-R5-GL2016-UWM)
Eliza Howell Park Preliminary Credit Narrative

This memorandum is written as a follow up to the most recent memo OHM has prepared for The Greening of
Detroit and The City of Detroit - General Services Department regarding the implementation of Urban
Watershed Management in Eliza Howell Park. The purpose of this memorandum is to summarize the
estimated credits that the City could expect with the implementation of this green stormwater infrastructure
(GSI). both for Eliza Howell Park and the l-96 Service Drive.

DRAINAGE CHARGE CREDIT NARRATIVE

As discussed in the previous memo shared with both the Greening and the City. runoff from both Eliza Howell
Park and the t-96 Service Drive could be treated by GSI constructed in Eliza Howell Park. Details of that
system can be found In the Preliminary Site Plan and Memo attached. In subsequent dialogue with (330. it
was requested that further Information be provided on speci?c Drainage Charge credit this 83! would provide
for both Eliza Howell Part: and the l-Q? Service Drive. represented by GED and the DPW. respectively. A table

Calculations detailing the above statistics can be found in the attached Eliza Howell Drainage Charge
Calculation Work Sheets; Additionally. it should be noted that though the total credit for the GSI is 34.4%. it is
divided based upon the ratio of each entity?s impervious area to the total impervious area. The credit is split
between (380 and DPW at a percentage of 62% and 38%. respectively. It should also be noted that it is
assumed that the DPW does not pay a drainage charge.

Sam Eanes. Fai Foen (The Greening of Detroit)
From: Patrick Droze. P.E.. Zack Hampton (OHM)

Re: Urban Watershed Management Implementation 
Urban In?ltration Basin to Reduce NPS Pollution in the Great Lakes Basin
Eliza Howell Park Preliminary Stormwater Narrative

This memorandum is written as a foitow up to the most recent dialogue OHM has had with The Greening of
Detroit and The City of Detroit - General Services Department (hereafter referred to as the Greening and the
City. respectively) with regard to the implementation of Urban Watershed Management in Eliza Hewett Park.
The purpose of this memorandum is to summarize the preliminary engineering design. preliminary cost
estimate and discuss future environmental and permitting challenges related to the implementation of Urban
Watershed Management in Eliza Howell Park.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT NARRATIVE

In previous discussions with the Greening and the City. OHM introduced a preliminary basin design that
accepted runoff from the I-96 Service Drive and was situated in the southwest corner of Eliza Howell Park.
This basin would then ultimately outlet to the Rouge River.

Since these previous discussions. further investigation has been performed, including a wetland delineation
and deeper research into existing as-built information. As a result. the recommended location of the Urban
In?ltration basin has been moved northwest: at the location of the existing asphalt parking lot. In addition, the
total impervious tributary area from the Service Drive has also been Updated. The mainline sewer within
the service drive is combined, and therefore cannot be intercepted and conveyed to the basin. However. by
intercepting the DPW sewer laterals. a portion of service drive runoff can still be captured. Additionally. with
the revised placement of the basin. a large portion of the interior road of Eliza Howell Park also becomes
tributary to the basin. Updated basin layout can be found on the attached preliminary site plan; updated basin
statistics can be found in the following table:

The resulting preliminary cost for this basin amounts to approximately $175,000. A full item-by?item breakdown
can be found in the attached cost estimate.

WETLANDS IMPACTS

As mentioned in the stennwater narrative, OHM has identi?ed the presence of a wetland in the southwest
corner of the park. extending off the Rouge River. By moving the basin northwest. disturbance to this wetland
can be minimized. This allows the project to avoid required wetland mitigation. which is triggered by a wetland
disturbance of 0.10 acres or higher.

REQUIRED PERMITS
Though the overall permanent impacts to wetlands can be avoided, several permits will still be required. They
are as follows:

Honorable City Council:

RE: Amended and Restated Petition No. 1062 Detroit Department of Public Works
City Engineering Division, request approval of Amended and Restated Resolution
relating to the outright vacation of portions of the following streets: De Buel
Avenue, Heintz Avenue, and Foster Street, Girardin Street and the outright
vacation of certain alleys for the expansion of warehouse facilities for Cedar
Investments, LLC

On October 1, 2019, Detroit City Council approved a resolution relating to Petition No. 1062
submitted by Detroit Department of Public Works City Engineering Division on
behalf of Crown Enterprises, Inc., (?Crown?) which resolution was subsequently recorded in
Wayne County Records on October 9, 2019 in Liber 55325, Page 1213 (the ?Original
Resolution?). It was subsequently determined that the Original Resolution did not include
certain provisions agreed to by CED and Crown and further contained certain scrivener?s errors
with respect to legal descriptions contained therein. Further, Crown?s af?liate, Cedar
Investments, LLC, (?Cedar?) has subsequently acquired fee title to the land adjacent to the
impacted rights of way and is now the appropriate petitioner.

CED, on behalf of Crown, respectfully requests that Detroit City Council adopt the attached
resolution (the ?Amended Resolution?), which Amended Resolution amends and restates and
supersedes in its entirety the Original Resolution.

Amended and Restated Petition No. 1062 Detroit Department of Public Works City
Engineering Division on behalf of Cedar Investments, LLC requesting the outright vacation of
certain streets and certain alley segments as more particularly described in the attached
Amended Resolution, in the area generally bounded by the alley north of De Buel on the north,
vacated Sherwood Avenue on the east, Miller Avenue on the south, and New York Central
Rail Line on the west.

The petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for investigation (utility
review) and report. This is our report.

The request is being made for the proposed development of CEDAR INVESTMENTS, 
warehouse expansion north side of Miller Avenue. CEDAR INVESTMENTS, LLC shall pay
the costs required to abandon and relocate active utility lines in the subject streets and alleys.
Alternatively, CEDAR INVESTMENTS, LLC may grant private easements to existing utilities
to allow them to remain in place while providing access for repairs or replacement.

The request was approved by the Solid Waste Division DPW, and City Engineering DPW.
Traf?c Engineering Division DPW (TED).

DTE Energy Electric objects to the property change. CEDAR INVESTMENTS, LLC
continues to work with DTE to make mutually satisfactory arrangements for removal of DTE
facilities or granting of a private easement.

Detroit Fire Department (DFD) reports involvement but no Objection provided CEDAR
INVESTMENTS, LLC maintains emergency vehicle access to all existing building structures
and hydrants.

Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has no Obj ection to the requested conversion
to easement vacations and outright vacation of alleys, provided certain conditions are met. The
speci?c DWSD conditions and provisions for granting of private easements are included in the
resolution. DWSD reports that there are no water mains in the requested outright vacation of
streets and alleys. The following conditions have been provided: that the sewers and water
mains service no other properties and only service the properties owned by the petitioner, if
not the petitioner must prepare relocation plans for the sewer and water mains signed by a
registered engineer. DWSD will review the relocated plans, and the Petitioner must grant
satisfactory easements for the relocated sewers and water mains where applicable, or obtain
Right-of-Way approval for relocation. The Petitioner is to bear the entire cost of the proposed
relocation plans, including construction, demolition, permitting, inspection, survey, etc.

All other involved City Departments, and privately owned utility companies informed of this
petition have reported no objections to the vacations. CEDAR INVESTMENTS, 
commitment to continue working with all involved public and private utilities to protect their
installations is incorporated in the attached resolution.

I am recommending adoption of the attached Amended Resolution, which Amended
Resolution amends and restates and supersedes in its entirety the Original Resolution, and
further respectfully request that your Honorable Body adopt the following Amended
Resolution with a Waiver of Reconsideration.

certain provisions agreed to by CED and Crown and further contained certain scrivener?s errors
with respect to legal descriptions contained therein. Further, Crown?s af?liate, Cedar

impacted rights of way and is now the appropriate petitioner.

CED, on behalf of Crown, respectfully requests that Detroit City Council adopt the attached
resolution (the ?Amended Resolution?), which Amended Resolution amends and restates and

Division DPW (TED), and City Engineering DPW (CED). The construction Of the
proposed turnaround on Marcus Avenue upon lots 761 835 of Bessenger Moore?s Mt.

RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF RE-ENACTING
THE FEDERAL DACA (DEFERRED ACTION ON CHILDHOOD
ARRIVALS) PROGRAM IN THE EVENT THAT IT IS STRUCK DOWN
BY THE US. SUPREME COURT

By Council Member Castaneda?Lopez

WHEREAS, On September 12, 2017, Detroit City Council unanimously resolved (8-0), through
the attached Resolution in Support of the Federal DACA (Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals)
and the Dreamers, to support the federal DACA program and more than 700,000 ?Dreamers?,
undocumented immigrants to America who arrived here as children and who, although they are
therefore generally ineligible to apply for citizenship, in effect have never known any other home
except the United States; and

WHEREAS, On November 12, 2019, the Supreme Court of the United States heard oral
arguments on the Drearners? challenge to the Trump administration?s ill-conceived discontinuation
of DACA, through consolidated appeals from three cases brought in California, New York and the
District of Columbia, based on alleged violation of requirements of the Administrative Procedure
Act; and

City Council agrees with the decisions of lower courts that the administration
acted improperly when it canceled DACA, and with Justice Sonia Sotomayor?s comment from the
bench that ?this is not about the law, that this is about our choice to destroy lives?; and

WHEREAS, In the event that the Supreme Court reverses the lower courts? decisions, Detroit
City Council strongly urges the administration and Congress to act immediately to reinstate or
create DACA-like protections for children and young adults in the United States; and

WHEREAS, Remedial action to reinstate DACA-like protections for these vulnerable,
?undocumented and unafraid? young people is a matter of the utmost urgency for the protection
of their human rights, as an adverse Supreme Court decision would imminently threaten their
security and ability to continue their lives in the United States, and potentially their lives and safety
if they were deported to dangerous foreign nations where theyr may have never lived and have no
basis of social support; and

WHEREAS, DACA or similar protections should be reinstated or created because immigration
policy should be based on human rights and the nation?s needs for the social, economic,
educational and human contributions these young people bring to the nation, not on mythical
threats to border security, or false claims that immigrants take jobs away from citizens; and

WHEREAS, No human being is ?illegal?, and undocumented US. residents brought here as
children who have never lived as adults anywhere else, who have no criminal records, who are
constructively engaged, contributing members of American society and meet the other strict
DACA requirements, have as much moral and equitable right to live in this country as anyone else;
and

WHEREAS, In publicly, fearlessly and relentlessly persuing protection for their human rights,
these young people have established themselves as outstanding role models for all Americans with
their demands for social justice and dignity; and

WHEREAS, DACA, the Dreamers, and immediate action to protect them in the event of an
adverse Supreme Court ruling, are all directly in the tradition of the best of this country?s history
of racial, ethnic, and economic struggles for social justice; and

WHEREAS, Eliminating DACA would deprive Detroit, Michigan and the nation at large of the
labor of over 700,000 DACA recipients who would lose their work authorizations and therefore
be unavailable to legally work, provide services to their clients and customers, drive (in most
places), or otherwise constructively participate in day-to-day life; and

WHEREAS, The Trump administration should stop treating the Dreamers as a political football,
appealing to xenophobic elements of its political base regardless of the facts and the merits of the
Dreamers? human rights, so that even if the Supreme Court fails to follow the legal requirements
of the Administrative Procedure Act, Congress and the President should act pro actively to prevent
terrible injustices; and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT Detroit City Council strongly urges Congress
and the President, in the event that the U.S. Supreme Court rules against the Dreamers, to reinstate
and/or create protections and a pathway to citizenship, including comprehensive immigration
reform, and protect the human rights of the Dreamers to maintain their residence in the United
States; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT copies of this resolution shall be transmitted to the
Mayor, media representatives, the White House, the State Department, the U.S. Attorney General,
the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Acting Director of
immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Acting Director of the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS), and the members of the Michigan legislative delegations in the United States
House of Representatives and Senate.

RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF THE FEDERAL DACA (DEFERRED
ACTION ON CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS) AND THE DREAMERS

By Council President Brenda Jones

WHEREAS, The administration of President Barack Obama wisely and mercifully adopted the
DACA program for the bene?t of undocumented immigrants to America who arrived here as
children and who, in effect, have never known any other home except the United States
(?Dreamers?); and

WHEREAS, On September 5, 2017, President Donald Trump announced the termination of the
DACA program with a six (6) month time period for Congress to take action to reform United
States immigration law; and

WHEREAS, This latest ill-considered immigration action by the Trump administration is cruel,
arbitrary, racist and deeply unfair to hundreds of thousands of young people who are Americans
in every way except on paper, due to no fault of their own, rather because of actions taken by their
parents decades ago and the outmoded, inadequate and unjust state of the nation?s immigration
laws; and

WHEREAS, Congress should ac? DE (7 Jman rights of the Dreamers and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT Detroit City Council strongly condemns the
Trump administration?s termination of the DACA program, and urgently petitions Congress to act
forthwith to protect the human rights of the Dreamers and other immigrants by reforming US.
immigration law; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT copies of this resolution shall be transmitted to the
Mayor, media representatives, the White House, the State Department, the US. Attorney General,
US. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the members of the Michigan legislative
delegations in the United States House of Representatives and Senate.

PASSED BY COUNCIL 8-0 9/12/17

BY HONORABLE COUNCIL MEMBER RAQUEL CASTANEDA-LOPEZ 3 

RESOLUTION TO SUPPORT THE DRIVE SAFE LEGISLATION

WHEREAS, The mission of the Detroit City Council is to promote the economic, cultural and
physical welfare of Detroit?s citizens through Charter-mandated legislative functions; and

WHEREAS, According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 13 states and the
District of Columbia currently have laws that do not require applicants to provide proof of
US. citizenship in order to receive a driver?s license; and

WHEREAS, On November 5, 2019, Michigan lawmakers, announced the DRIVE SAFE
legislation, a four bill package short for (Safety, Access, Freedom, and the Economy); and

WHEREAS, Senate Bill 631 introduced by state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) and its
companion legislation in the Michigan House, House Bill 5192 sponsored Rep. Alex Garza
(D-Taylor), would amend the Michigan Vehicle Code to require the Michigan Secretary of State
to issue a driver?s license to any applicant who meet the age requirement and can prove
Michigan residency, including immigrants living in Michigan without legal permission; and

WHEREAS, Undocumented immigrants who are prevented access to a driver?s license continue
to experience daily anxiety, toxic stress, and perpetual worry that if they drive without a license,
they are likely to be targeted and/or detained by federal immigration of?cials; and,

WHEREAS, Unrelated to citizenship status, undocumented immigrants have the same hopes,
fears, and dreams as every other member of our community. We acknowledge their humanity
and support them in their struggle for permanent protection, dignity, and respect; and,

WHEREAS, Senate Bill 632 and House Bill 5193, introduced by Sen. Brinks (D-Grand Rapids)
and Rep. Hood (D-Grand Rapids) respectively, would modify PA 222 of 1972, the State
Personal Identi?cation Card Act, to expand access to standard licenses without the legal presence
requirement; and

WHEREAS, If passed, the DRIVE SAFE legislation aims to ensure that standard licenses and
identi?cation cards would be indistinguishable regardless of whether an individual has a proven
legal presence or not. All standard licenses would continue to bear a notation indicating they are
not to be used for federal purposes; and

WHEREAS, On October 31, 2019, MLive reports that the concept of DRIVE SAFE has
received support by Gov. Whitmer. The Governor has expressed to the immigrant rights group
Movimiento Cosecha Michigan that opening up access to driver?s licenses is ?something
that?s important to me, it?s important to our economy and it?s important to the people of
Michigan?; and

. a
Meta mutt mg

WHEREAS, The Detroit City Council is committed to supporting legislation that removes
barriers for housing and employment, in an effort to promote inclusion in all aspects of civic life.
It is projected that these bills would have a broad positive impact. Suggestions are as follows:

. Allow citizens and currently, eligible immigrants who lack the documentation required
by the Secretary of State, to get driver?s licenses and state identi?cation cards.

- Widen the insurance pool and lower costs for all Michigan residents due to unlicensed
and uninsured drivers submitting fewer claims.

0 Promote public safety by ensuring that drivers are trained, screened and tested; law
enforcement will be able to more efficiently and effectively identify individuals they
stop.

0 Increase workforce and economic participation by making it easier for individuals to
travel to work, go to the grocery store or doctor, rent an apartment, access health care,
purchase insurance, etc. BE IT FINALLY

RESOLVED, That the Detroit City Council endorses passage of House bills 5192 and 5193, and
Senate bills 631, and 632. NOW THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, That copies of this resolution be forwarded to the Mayor, the Detroit delegation in
the Michigan Legislature, the Committee on Transportation, Committee on Government
Operations and the Governor.

A RESOLUTION of the Detroit City Council
Designating The City of Detroit as a BEE CITY af?liate.

WHEREAS, the mission of BEE CITY USA is to galvanize communities to sustain pollinators, responsible for
the reproduction of almost 90% of the world's ?owering plant species, by providing them with healthy habitat, rich in
a variety of native plants and free to nearly free of pesticides; and

WHEREAS, thanks to the more than 3,600 species of native bees in the United States, along with introduced
honey bees, we have very diverse dietary choices rich in fruits, nuts, and vegetables; and

WHEREAS, bees and other pollinators have experienced population declines due to a combination of habitat loss,
poor nutrition, pesticides (including insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides), parasites, diseases, and climate change;
and

WHEREAS, pollinator?friendly communities can bene?t local and regional economies through healthier
ecosystems, increased vegetable and fruit crop yields, and increased demand for pollinator-friendly plant materials
from local growers; and

WHEREAS, ideal pollinator-friendly habitat (A) is comprised of mostly native wild?owers, grasses, vines,
shrubs, and trees blooming in succession throughout the growing season to provide diverse and abundant nectar and
pollen, since many wild pollinators prefer or depend on the native plants with which they co-adapted; (B) is free to
nearly ?ee of pesticides, as many pesticides can harm pollinators and/or their habitat; (C) comprises undisturbed
Spaces (leaf and brush piles, unmown fields or ?eld margins, fallen trees and other dead wood) for nesting and
overwintering; and (D) provides connectivity between habitat areas to support pollinator movement and resilience;
and

WHEREAS, integrated Pest Management (1PM) is a long-term approach to maintaining healthy landscapes and
facilities that minimizes risks to people and the environment by: identifying and removing the causes ofpest problems
rather than only attacking the (the pests); employing pests' natural enemies along with cultural, mechanical,
and physical controls when prevention is not enough; and using pesticides only when no other method is feasible or
effective; and

WHEREAS, supporting pollinators fosters broad-based community engagement in environmental awareness and
sustainability; and

NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, THAT the City of Detroit supports the certification of the City of Detroit as a
BEE CITY USA community
