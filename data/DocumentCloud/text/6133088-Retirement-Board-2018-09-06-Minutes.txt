3. Administration Report

Dennis White, Interim Executive Director, complimented the Fund’s staff for their
cooperation during the current transition period. Mr. White stated that as the Interim
Executive Director he had become better advised about the Fund’s procedures for reviewing
and processing invoices based upon procedures adopted by prior Boards. He added that the
budget process is underway and will provide more detail than in earlier years. Mr. White
noted that the EMIC presentation for the Illinois State Senate would be due on September 17,
2018 and that the hearing will be scheduled in October. He also reported that the PAS
finalists had made presentations of their products to Fund staff and that on-site visits would
be conducted to view implementations of the systems the finalists had installed for other
clients.
The trustees discussed the need to develop more specific procurement procedures than the
practices currently followed by the Fund. Legislative Committee’s meetings to discuss such
procedures had not convened due to quorum issues. The trustees discussed that the
procedures for procurement should be developed by Fund staff for the Legislative
Committee’s review and requested that fiduciary counsel provide any samples that might be
instructive. Fund staff was also asked to provide a spreadsheet of all existing contracts for the
next Board meeting.

 4. Benefit Matters
a. Eligibility for Spousal Refunds
Brent Lewandowski, Director, Member Services, stated that the Fund needed direction
regarding a member’s eligibility for a refund of spouse contributions upon retirement.
Specifically, a member had been using the last name of her children’s father as her own, but
denied that she ever married or had otherwise legally changed her name. She claimed that
Social Security had allowed the change on her records without any supporting
documentation. Upon retirement, she requested a refund of spouse contributions because she
had never been married.
The trustees discussed whether affidavits from the father could be obtained stating that he
had never married the member or whether an affidavit from the member would be sufficient.
They also discussed whether other sources could be used such as ADP or the Illinois
Department of Public Health to determine whether the member had been married.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee Goode that Board direct Fund
staff to have the member identified by Office #144233 sign an affidavit that she was never
married and return the matter back to the Board.

MOTION ADOPTED BY VOICE VOTE

5. Disability Update
The Director of Member Services stated that the County physician had declined to provide proof
of disability applications as of August 4, 2018, and that the Fund had been given authority to
retain a physician to provide such services until an agreement with Concentra had been finalized.
He stated that there was no need to retain an interim physician because the agreement with
Concentra to provide the required proof of disability was executed on August 23, 2018, and was
implemented promptly. He added that the initial relationship with Concentra has been positive
and that Fund staff would advise the Board in about six months about the status of the
engagement.
6. Review and Consideration of August 21, 2018 Health Benefits Committee Recommendations

 dependents and other Health Plan members, particularly in regard to the need to enroll in
Medicare, if eligible.
The trustees discussed the coverage provided for wards when an annuitant was appointed the
legal guardian for a minor or a disabled adult and discussed what guidelines should be
adopted for this group.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Fitzgerald that the matter
regarding the guidelines to be adopted for disabled dependent adults be referred for further

for the coalition group, but expected that the final rates would be presented for approval at
the October Board meeting. .

Gary LeDonne, Director, Benefits Administration, reported that the two finalists for the
pension administration system had presented demonstrations of their systems to the Fund

members to see the actual implementations of pension administration systems, but that one
location had been changed since the approval.
