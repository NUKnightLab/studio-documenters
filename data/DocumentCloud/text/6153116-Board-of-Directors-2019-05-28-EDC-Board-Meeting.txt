PROJECTS
Motor City Re-Store: Amendment to Round 3 Awards
Mr. Batton, on behalf of Ms. Pledl, introduced Mr. Gregoire Eugene-Lewis, the Interim Motor City
Re-Store Program Manager, to present the agenda item. Mr. Eugene-Lewis reported that on May
22, 2018, the EDC Board of Directors approved the awarding of grants to certain applicants in
Round 3 of the Motor City Re-Store Program (the “Program”). The Program is a matching façade
grant program for existing businesses in Detroit. The Program consists of two types of awards
that applicants may receive. These awards include a Design Award up to $10,000 for architectural
services and a Construction Award up to $25,000 for improvements to the existing business.

 During the Round 3 application process, Arthur J. Rohde & Company (the “Awardee”), applied to
the Program for a Construction Award. Staff reviewed the Awardee’s application and supporting
materials and determined that the Awardee was to be included in the batch of applicants for
Construction Awards that are approved by the EDC Board of Directors. Based on the Awardee’s
application, staff was to recommend a Construction Award in the approximate amount of $22,000.
However, due to a clerical error, the Awardee was awarded a Design Award up to $10,000. This
Design Award prevents the Awardee from commencing work in accordance with the Awardee’s
application and intent.
Staff recommended the approval of a Round 3 Construction Award to Awardee in an amount not
to exceed $25,000.00. The description below describes the levels of the award and qualifications
of the Awardee.
Arthur J. Rohde & Company

and make it their home.
Scope: Replace signage, resurface front wall along sidewalk, resurface parking lot,
landscape improvements- front building, New railing for porch and replace walkway and
steps.
A resolution approving the staff’s recommendation of a Construction Award to the Awardee was
included for the Board’s consideration.
With there being no questions or discussion, the Board took the following action:
On a motion by Ms. Bruhn, seconded by Mr. Hodge, Resolution Code EDC 19-05-91-88
was unanimously approved.
PUBLIC COMMENT
ADMINISTRATION
Mr. Osei questioned what the latest was on the technology solution. Ms. Kanalos stated that the
program is called Directorpoint. and the Board would be transitioning to electronic board books
possibly at the next meeting. Ms. Jensen advised that they did a beta testing with the DBRA
Board last week and it was fairly successful, and a there were a few kinks that needed to be
worked out. Ms. Forte asked if everyone had signed up for Directorpoint. Ms. Kanalos stated
that there were a couple of EDC Board members that still need to sign up.
