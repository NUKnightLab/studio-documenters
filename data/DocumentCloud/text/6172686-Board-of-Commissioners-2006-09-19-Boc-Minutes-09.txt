The Chairperson thereupon declared said Motion carried and said Resolution adopted.
Commissioner O’Keefe, Chairperson of the Finance & Audit Committee, then presented her
monthly report. Per Commissioner O’Keefe, the Finance & Audit Committee Meeting was held
on Wednesday, September 13, 2006 at 1:00 p.m. at the 626 Corporate Office. The Deputy Chief
Financial Officer and his staff presented the Committee with the Treasury and Cash Flow Report
for the month of August 2006.
Commissioner O’Keefe then introduced an Omnibus Motion for the adoption of Resolutions for
Items A1 thru A4 and A6 discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Finance
and Audit Committee.
(Item A1)
The resolution for Item A1 approves submittal of the Performance Funding System (PFS) to
HUD. HUD uses the PFS to determine a public housing authority’s eligibility for an operating
subsidy. The PFS is applicable to all public housing authority owned units under an Annual
Contributions Contract. The CHA is required to submit a PFS Calculation detailing the total
operating subsidy for fiscal year 2007. Based on the formula established by HUD as a part of the
MTW Agreement, the CHA should request the operating subsidy in the amount of $182,567,020.
This figure was determined by using the formula described in the MTW Agreement. Unlike the
procedure used in prior years, HUD has requested each Authority to submit its PFS Schedule
prior to the release of final pro-rations. This is being done in order to determine the overall need
of Public Housing Authorities. Upon release of the final pro-ration amount, the CHA’s FY2007
Comprehensive Budget will be adjusted accordingly.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-132
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners have reviewed the Board Letter dated September
11, 2006 requesting authorization to submit FY2007 Performance Funding
System Calculation to the Department of Housing and Urban Development and
approval of the FY2007 Performance Funding System Performance Calculation.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners approves the FY2007 Performance Funding System
Calculation and authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute
and submit the Performance Funding System Calculation and all necessary related
documents to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

(Item A2)
The Authority’s Plan for Transformation contemplates large scale capital improvements to
upgrade the Authority’s inventory of public housing units, including, the demolition of
approximately 18,000 obsolete housing units and the rehabilitation and construction of
approximately 25,000 housing units. In connection with the implementation of this Program, the
Authority previously issued its Capital Program Revenue Bonds, Series 2001 in order to fund
Program improvements by leveraging anticipated future capital funding revenues. The entire
Series 2001 Bonds were recently refunded by a new Capital Program Revenue Refunding Bonds,
Series 2006. Although the Series 2001 Bonds were refunded, they will remain outstanding until
the first optional redemption date (approximately six years). Due to the refunding, the CHA has
an opportunity to improve the rating on the Series 2001 Bonds and potentially enhance the
marketability of the Series 2001 Bonds until redeemed. To implement the rating change, the
Escrow Agreement will be amended, primarily to limit certain types of investments. The
amendment to the 2001 Series Bonds Escrow Agreement will not affect the outstanding Series
2006 Bonds. Accordingly, the resolution for Item A2 approves amending the Capital Program
Revenue Bonds, Series 2001 Escrow Agreement and to take such other actions as may be
necessary to obtain a ratings increase.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-133
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated September 11,
2006 entitled “Authorization to Amend the Capital Program Revenue Bonds,

5

 Series 2001 Escrow Agreement and to take such other actions as may be
necessary to obtain a rating increase”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to amend the Capital Revenue Bonds, Series 2001 Escrow Agreement
and to take such other actions (including, but not limited to, the execution of such
further documentation) as may be necessary to obtain a rating increase.

(Item A3)
The CHA must annually renew its insurance coverage for General Liability, Excess Liability,
Public Officials Liability, All Risk Property, Employed Lawyers Errors and Omissions Liability,
Employment Practices Liability and Auto Liability. HUD previously authorized the CHA to
have its Insurance Broker of Record competitively solicit premium quotations on the CHA’s
behalf to procure all necessary insurance coverages. On June 9, 2006, Aon began soliciting
premium quotations from insurers for the CHA’s required insurance needs. Aon directly
solicited 27 insurers and 1 wholesaler. In July 2006 it also advertised the CHA’s request for
premium quotations for the CHA's required insurance coverages in the Chicago Tribune. In
response to the direct solicitations and advertisement, Aon received at least 2 bids for each line
of coverage, except for Excess Liability and Public Officials Liability insurance. Aon received
19 declinations on the various lines of coverages. After reviewing the responses, Aon and CHA’s
Risk Management Department recommend the insurers listed in the below approved resolution to
provide the required insurance coverage for CHA for the period of October 1, 2006 through
September 30, 2007. The recommended awardees are the incumbent carriers with policy limits
and retention levels remaining the same for all lines of coverage except for Property, which was
restructured with deletion of separate policies for Boiler and Machinery and Difference in
Conditions, wrapping it all into an All Risk policy with increased property values reported.
Employed Lawyers Errors and Omissions Liability is a new coverage added to the program.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-134
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners has reviewed the memorandum dated September
11, 2006 entitled "Authorization For The CHA To Award General Liability,
Excess Liability, Public Officials Liability, All Risk Property, Employed Lawyers
Errors and Omissions Liability, Employment Practices Liability, And Auto
Liability Coverage”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to award the following insurance coverage for the CHA for the period of
October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007 for an aggregate amount not-toexceed $1,607,688.00 through its insurance broker of record, Aon Risk Services,
Inc. of Illinois.: (1) General Liability written through Lexington in an amount
not-to-exceed $37,673.00; (2) Excess Liability insurance coverages written
through Lexington in an amount not-to-exceed $226,149; (3) Public Officials
Liability written through Lexington in an amount not-to-exceed $204,867.00; (4)
All Risk Property written through Lexington, RSUI Indemnity, Axis and
Commonwealth in an amount not-to-exceed $981,583.00; (5) Employed Lawyers
Errors and Omissions written through Chubb in an amount not-to-exceed
$22,889.00; (6) Employment Practices Liability written through Lexington in an
amount not-to-exceed $68,721; and (7) Auto Liability written through St.
Paul/Travelers and HARRG in an amount not-to-exceed $65,806.00

(Item A4)
The resolution for Item A4 approves acceptance of an award in the amount of $100,000 from the
MacArthur Foundation. On July 14, 2006, the CHA received official written notice from the
MacArthur Foundation to fund and administer professional development opportunities for
director and executive-level staff. The professional development opportunities will be an
incentive to ensure long-term success in recruiting and retaining the executive leadership that has
played a tremendous role in the ongoing activities and the impact of the Plan for Transformation.
This program will be designed to invest in staff who will directly affect the outcomes of
residents. The training will also impart knowledge of best practices for strategic planning,
6

 analysis, and building strategic alliances across CHA internal and external systems. Participants
will examine their core competencies as managers and directors and learn ways to further extend
the use of their core competencies into various management functions.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-135
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated September 11, 2006 entitled “Recommendation to Accept a
Grant Award from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and
increase the FY2006 Comprehensive Budget”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to accept a grant award from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
Foundation in the amount of $100,000 to provide professional development
opportunities for director and executive-level CHA staff and increase the FY2006
comprehensive budget by $100,000.

(Item A5 – This Number Not Used)

(Item A6)
The resolution for Item A6 approves a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) for 62
administrative and other workers who are members of Local 73. The new CBA has a two year
term and its effective date is January 1, 2006. The CBA maintains the CHA’s merit-based
approach to pay raises for Local 73 members. Consistent with previous labor agreements with
Local 73, the new CBA provides that the minimum and maximum salary levels for job
classifications covered by the CBA will be adjusted annually for inflation. In addition,
beginning in 2007, the new CBA will allow employees who, in the past, received all or part of
their merit increases in the form of bonuses because their salaries exceeded 120% of the salary
midpoint to have their merit increases added to their base salaries. This provision is expected to
impact two or three employees in 2007. Under the newly negotiated CBA, the CHA will no
longer have to pay an hourly “premium” above and beyond the overtime rate to staggered shift
workers who are required to remain on the job and cover a shift when other scheduled employees
do not report to work. The CBA also expressly provides that the CHA can terminate an
employee who is convicted of a felony and that leave provided pursuant to the Family Medical
Leave Act may not be used to procure alternative employment or self-employment. The new
CBA also maintains the CHA’s ability to negotiate with Local 73 members regarding future
increases in medical insurance premiums and it expands the prior employee drug and alcohol
testing provision to include “other acceptable methods of testing” in addition to blood and urine
testing.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-136
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated September 11, 2006
requesting authorization to enter into a Collective Bargaining Agreement by and
between the Chicago Housing Authority (“CHA”) and the Service Employees
International Union, Local 73 (“Local 73”)
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer, or his
designee, to enter into a collective bargaining agreement by and between the
“CHA” and Local 73.

There being no questions or discussion, the Chairperson thereupon declared said Motion carried
and said resolutions adopted. The Finance and Audit Committee report was also accepted in
total.
Commissioner Gates, Chairperson of the Operations Committee, then presented the monthly
report. Per Commissioner Gates, the Operations and Facilities Committee Meeting was held on
Wednesday, September 13, 2006 at 1:30 p.m. at the 626 W. Jackson Corporate offices.
Commissioner Gates then introduced an Omnibus Motion for the adoption of resolutions for
Items B1 thru B5 discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Operations &
Facilities Committee.
(Item B1)
Staff surveyed the scavenger services being provided across the developments and found that the
service and cost varied from development to development, even within the same management
company’s portfolio. Therefore, with expectations of standardizing the performance and the cost
of services being provided by portfolio, property management companies were required to
contract with one waste removal vendor, for all of the sites within its portfolio. WCDC, property
Management Company for the Authority, released an RFP for scavenger services on April 6,
2006. WCDC advertised in area newspapers and three vendors responded to the RFP. Based on
the recommendation of the Evaluation Committee, Waste Management was deemed the most
responsible and responsive bidder and also proposed the best price for the service. Accordingly,
the resolution for Item B1 approves award of contract to Waste Management.
Commissioner O’Keefe recused from voting on the following resolution for Item B1:
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-137
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
memorandum dated September 11, 2006 entitled “Authorization for Woodlawn
Community Development Corporation. to Enter into a Contract with Waste
Management for Scavenger Services at Various CHA Sites”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes Woodlawn Community Development
Corp., property management company for the CHA, to enter into a contract with
Waste Management for Scavenger Services in the amount not-to-exceed
$659,568.00 for a two year base contract term, with a one-year option..

(Item B2)
With regards to Item B2, the Asset Management Department determined that as a Resident
Management Corporation (RMC) with only one site, It’s Time For A Change RMC (ITFAC)
would likely secure better cost savings if its property was paired with the properties of another
management company for purposes of the scavenger procurement. Consequently, the
procurement was conducted with the two management entities’ joint participation. H. J. Russell
and ITFAC released a joint RFP for scavenger services pursuant to which each entity would
enter into a separate contract for its respective properties under management, but bidders would
propose pricing for the entire pool of CHA properties and locations managed by the two
companies. The RFP was released on June 2, 2006 and advertised in the Chicago Sun-Times.
Of the four proposals, Allied Waste’s proposal provided the best price for the desired services.
Accordingly, the resolution for Item B2 approves award of contract to Allied Waste.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-138
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
memorandum dated September 11, 2006 entitled “Authorization for H. J. Russell
& Company and It’s Time for a Change, RMC to Enter into Contracts with Allied
Waste for Scavenger Services at Various CHA Sites”.
8

 THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners approves H. J. Russell & Company and It’s Time for
a Change, RMC, both property management companies for the CHA, to enter into
service contracts with Allied Waste for Scavenger Services in the respective notto-exceed amounts of $334,800.00 and $238,800.00 for two (2) year base contract
periods with one (1) year options serving various CHA properties.

(Item B3)
As part of the Authority’s building consolidation and redevelopment activities, the CHA
demolished several buildings that formed part of the Henry Horner Homes. One of the buildings
demolished was previously used by a not-for-profit organization, the Major Adams Community
Committee, to provide youth and family-oriented programs to the residents of Henry
Horner/West Haven. To ensure that Major Adams could continue to make its programs
accessible to the residents of Horner, the CHA moved Major Adams and its programs to a nondwelling building located at 125 North Hoyne. The CHA requires the services of a design-build
manager to coordinate and oversee every aspect of the design-build project to include assisting
the CHA with pre-construction, planning and design work and construction activities including,
but not limited to, the procurement of a design-builder that will be responsible for the actual
design work and construction at 125 N. Hoyne. The Request for Proposal advertised in area
newspapers and the CHA directly solicited 100 firms by sending them notices of the RFP.
Under the first round of scoring, the Respondents’ written proposals were evaluated and three of
the four Respondents were ranked in the competitive range. The Respondents in the competitive
range were invited to make oral presentations to the CHA for a second round of scoring, through
which Boyle and Associates received the highest final score. Additionally, Boyle and
Associates’ provided the lowest best and final offer. Accordingly, the resolution for Item B3
approves award of design-build management services to Boyle and Associates.

RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-139
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated September 11, 2006 titled “Authorization to enter into a

Barnett Duster Apartments (IL2-005).The new Total Contract Price of Contract
No. 9885 is $1,441,164.00.

(Item B5)
From January through September 2004, HUD conducted an accessibility compliance review of
the CHA’s programs, services and activities, including designated accessible housing units,
associated common areas, on-site management offices, housing programs, and non-housing
programs and activities. As a result of the infractions found during the review, the CHA entered
into a Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA) with HUD as of May 1, 2006. The VCA will
last the duration of seven years over which time the CHA must progressively certify that 5.3%
and 2.1% of its units are accessible for individuals with mobility impairments and individuals
with sensory impairments respectively. One of the provisions of the VCA requires that the
CHA contract with a qualified, independent third-party architectural or engineering firm, which
will provide certification to HUD of the accessibility of all units that the CHA produces as
accessible for individuals with disabilities and all the non-housing programs/common areas
associated with our housing portfolio. The CHA must submit to HUD the name of the qualified
respondent by October 1, 2006, for its approval. The selected respondent must begin work by
November 1, 2006, and the CHA must begin to submit certifications to HUD by August 1, 2007.

 Managing Director of Resident Services and her staff presented the Committee with an update on
Higher Education and Scholarships.
Commissioner Young then introduced a Motion for the adoption of the Resolution for Item C1
discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Tenant Services Committee.
(Item C1)
The resolution for Item C1 approves exercising the first one-year option of Contract No. 0663
with LR ABLA LLC to provide Community and Supportive Services to families relocating to the
Roosevelt Square Community extension. In September 2004, the CHA Board authorized the
CHA to negotiate and enter into a two-year base term contract with LR ABLA, the master
developer for the Roosevelt Square community, to provide CSS to CHA residents who selected
Roosevelt Square as a permanent housing choice. Services are specifically designed to address
site specific criteria and the barriers a family may face in meeting the screening criteria. The
requested additional funding for the option period, when added to the remaining balance
available at the end of the base term of the Contract, will allow LR ABLA to continue servicing
the 125 families who moved into the redeveloped Roosevelt Square community in FY2006 as
well as the 695 families being screened for move-in.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-142
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated September 11, 2006, entitled “Recommendation to exercise
the first one-year option of Contract No. 0663 with LR ABLA LLC to provide

Square Community”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to exercise the one (1) year extension option of Contract No. 0663 with
the LR ABLA LLC. for community and supportive services at the Roosevelt
Square Community (“Contract No. 0663”) for the period of October 1, 2006
through September 30, 2007, and to increase the funding in an amount not-toexceed $1,056,893.00 adding it to the balance that is left over from the current
contract base term amount. The new total not-to-exceed contract amount of
Contract No. 0663 will be $3,718,041.00.

The resolution for Item C2 approves the form of lease and Admissions and Continued
Occupancy Policy to be used for the Henry Horner Homes Phase IIB Rental development to be
known as Westhaven Park Apartments Phase IIB, and any subsequent Westhaven Park rental
development. It is understood that the developer has an interest and desire to implement its own
lease forms and policy that encourages consistent community standards for the effective
management of its mixed-income developments. The lease and policy have to accommodate
various aspects of the multiple types of tenants and characteristics of a mixed-income
transaction. The property specific requirements for applicants contained in the admissions and
11

 continued occupancy policy are derived from the amended Horner Consent Decree, court orders,
financing requirements and CHA policies.
In addition, pursuant to a Memorandum of
Agreement with plaintiffs’/HRC’s counsel, which is being amended to cover this transaction, the
owner entity may seek to defer public housing applicants who do not meet certain financing and
other requirements from housing at Westhaven Park Apartments Phase IIB Rental. The approval
of this item is required at this time to facilitate the closing of this development transaction. These
documents have been subject to negotiation among the CHA, the Developer, the owner entity’s
Property Manager and the Horner Resident Committee. A public comment period was held from
August 17, 2006 through September 18, 2006. A public comment hearing was held on August
21, 2006 at the 1st Baptist Congregational Church. Notice for the 30 day public comment period
and comment hearing was provided to the public and consideration will be given to the
comments prior to finalizing the documents.
