Mrs. Mondowney reported that on Wednesday, October 2, 2019, DPL staff gathered at
Main Library for the 2019 Staff Development Day. The theme for the day was, “We Love
What We Do.” The morning’s featured speaker, actor and author Hill Harper,
encouraged staff to continue to bring their best efforts and positive attitudes to the
Library on a daily basis. Part of the day’s program included workshops and the
recognition of new employees and milestone staff service anniversaries. She thanked
the exceptional team of volunteers who helped to make the day a resounding success.

COMMITTEE ON BUILDINGS

Approval for Air Compressor Replacement at Main Library
A request was made by Administration to replace two air compressors that are currently
inoperable. The two existing 15 HP Quincy air compressors which serve the pneumatic
HVAC control system have failed after elapsing their useful service life.
Minutes were approved at the November 19, 2019 Commission Meeting

 6

These air compressors open and close valves, dampers, and actuators throughout the
Main Library, and are critical to support hot water usage and control of steam flow for
heating the Main Library.
Johnson Control, our current service provider for emergency heating and cooling
repairs, has provided a proposal to replace both existing compressors with the
following:




(2) Sullair Model ST1109RD, 15 HP Full Feature Shop-Tek Rotary Screw Air
Compressor
(2) Sullair Model SXTH0125Z, Coalescing Post Filters
(2) Sullair Model SulliPro100, Oil Water Separator

To streamline the procurement process, DPL is recommending using the approved
contract pricing from Contract #030817-JHN on Sourcewell, a cooperative in the State
of Minnesota. In the past, the Procurement Department has been able to utilize
Cooperative pricing in which there has already been a bidding process.
The cost of replacement, including labor is quoted at $46,720.
Approval is requested to contract with Johnson Controls Inc., to replace the existing
inoperable air compressors at a cost not to exceed Forty-Six Thousand Seven Hundred
Twenty dollars ($46,720).

DISCUSSION
Commissioner Bellant stated that he was concerned that the cost of the materials was
too high.
Mr. James Cooper, Representative from Johnson Controls Inc., explained that the cost
of the materials included 1-year parts and labor and a 10-15% cost overrun that would
cover unexpected incurred costs.
COMMISSION ACTION
Commissioner Bellant moved approval. Commissioner Friley supported. The motion
carried unanimously.

Minutes were approved at the November 19, 2019 Commission Meeting

Approval for Heating and Cooling Preventative Maintenance Service for a Three (3)
Year Period
A request was made by Administration to secure a new contract for Heating and
Cooling Preventative Maintenance Services for all Detroit Public Library locations.
In light of current condition of air conditioning at Main, the overall age of the heating and
cooling systems throughout the Library facilities, and to take a proactive approach to
addressing and maintaining these systems, Administration believes this is the best
approach. This type of service agreement increases our capacity to evaluate and
address outstanding issues in a more time efficient manner.
Johnson Controls Inc., our current service provider for emergency heating and cooling
repairs, has provided a full comprehensive proposal for preventative maintenance
services for all Detroit Library facilities. Summary of services and options is attached.
To streamline the procurement process, DPL is recommending using the approved
contract pricing from Contract #030817-JHN on Sourcewell, a cooperative in the State
of Minnesota. In the past, the Procurement Department has been able to utilize
Cooperative pricing in which there has already been a bidding process.
The cost of the first-year preventative maintenance services for all DPL locations is
$140,644, in Year-2 $146,269, and Year-3 $152,120.
Administration is requesting approval to contract with Johnson Controls Inc., for one
year, with an option to renew for two years based on performance for an amount not to
exceed $140,644 in Year-1, $146,269 in Year-2, and $152,120 in Year-3, for a total of
$439,033.
COMMISSION ACTION
Commissioner Bellant moved approval. Commissioner Gray supported. The motion
carried unanimously.

Approval for Renewal of Janitorial Services with LGC Global FM
A request was made by the Facilities Department to secure a new contract for Janitorial
Services for the Detroit Public Library.
This renewal represents the second year of a three (3) year contract with LGC Global
FM. This contract was issued in conjunction with Request for Proposal (RFP), #DPLCL-1901, in which nine (9) contractors submitted proposals on the project, as follows:

documents from LGC Global FM.
The Facilities Department is requesting approval of the contract for an amount not to
exceed $723,000.

COMMISSION ACTION

carried unanimously.

COMMITTEE ON FINANCE
Approval to Enter into a Pricing Agreement with Baker & Taylor to Supply DPL with
Printed Books at Discounted Prices and to Catalog and Process Purchased Items so
they are Ready to be Checked Out by Customers
There is nothing more important to a library than delivering the information and
materials that people want and need in a timely manner. For this reason, the DPL is
requesting permission to enter into an agreement that will make Baker & Taylor DPL’s
primary source of printed books and allow them to supply these items in “check out
ready” form. Acquiring library materials that are ready to be checked out will reduce the
time between when an item is ordered and when it is available to the customer from an
average of 2.5 – 4 weeks to 4 – 5 days.
Baker & Taylor and The Ingram Content Group are the only wholesalers in the library
services industry that are large enough to supply most of the printed books that DPL
wants to acquire.
Minutes were approved at the November 19, 2019 Commission Meeting

Both companies offer libraries discounted pricing based on volume and, for an
additional fee, processing services (cataloging, labeling, etc.) that prepare library items
to be checked out. Items that are “pre-processed” can be shipped directly to branches
and Main Library departments, thereby reducing the time it takes to get new materials
into customers’ hands.
DPL solicited proposals from Baker & Taylor and The Ingram Content Group to serve as
DPL’s principle source of printed books and to supply purchased items in “check out
ready” form. The Public Services Team reviewed the proposals, comparing pricing
structure, per unit processing fees, and payment terms. Baker & Taylor offered DPL a
better value on all three points:
Discount off list price
Processing fee (including
cataloging)
Payment Terms

Based on an anticipated volume of 42,000 printed books purchased in FY2020, DPL will
pay Baker & Taylor:
 approximately $157,500 in processing fees verses $189,000 for Ingram, and
 $900,000 in material costs, verses $919,000 for Ingram.
The 60-day payment window offered by Baker & Taylor accommodates the City’s net 45
payment terms.
Approval is requested to enter into a pricing agreement with Baker & Taylor to supply
new library materials and to “pre-process” those items at the rates specified in their
proposal and summarized above.
COMMISSION ACTION
President Adams moved approval. Commissioner Bellant supported. President Adams
abstained. The motion carried.
NOTED
President Adams stated that this item was not presented to the Committee on Books

INFORMATION ONLY
Fiscal Year 2019 Budget to Actual Comparison
The attached projected statement of revenues and expenditures is an estimate of the
Library’s financial position, comparing the amended FY2019 budget revenues and
expenditures with the actual revenues and expenditures as of June 30, 2019. During the
FY2019 Budget cycle, the Detroit Library Commission approved the use of fund balance
in the amount of $1,062,822. For FY2019, while actual expenditures exceed revenues
by $1,021,760, the excess expenditures were not related to operational expenditures.
The actual Tax Capture expenditures of $2,724,363, exceeded the budgeted
expenditures of $1,298,060. The Library Administration is currently in discussions with
Justin Bahri, Deputy Treasurer of the City of Detroit, to resolve this matter. The FY2018
audited financials reported a beginning fund balance for FY2019 at $27,164,492.

The Detroit Public Library has recorded total revenues of $31,809,415 for fiscal year
2019. Current year property taxes collected is $25,356,903, this is $296,086 above the
budgeted amount of $25,060,817. As of June 30, 2019, $2,559,259 in delinquent real
and personal property taxes has been collected on behalf of the Library. This increase
in revenues is due to back tax payments of many properties being acquired from Wayne
County. The Library received $558,128 in Court penal fines from Wayne County as
well. The State of Michigan made the Renaissance Zone Tax revenue payment of
$1,178,639; this amount is $790,766 less than the budgeted amount of $1,969,405. The
budgeted amount for the FY2019 Renaissance Zone Tax revenue was based on the
FY2018 budgeted totals. The actual Renaissance Zone tax revenue received has been
declining since FY2017.

The increase in the prior year’s property tax collections are positive for the Library. The
Library has received increased payouts for the Library for the Blind and Physically
Handicapped (LBPH), and State Funding. During the FY2019 budgeted year, the Detroit
Library Commission approved the use of fund balance to purchase a new Mobile Library
and complete the repair of the Skillman Branch that suffered water damage.

The actual total expenditures for the Detroit Public Library through June 30, 2019, is
$33,893,997, which is $1,021,760 over the total budgeted expenditures of $32,908,470.

Minutes were approved at the November 19, 2019 Commission Meeting

As stated before, this overage is due to the increase in Tax Captures. Total
expenditures also include the $330,000 payment for the retiree settlement agreement.
Employee salaries and benefits were $16,926,822, $143,112 less than budgeted
expenditures. Pension and Retiree expenditures were $3,420,072, $115,742 less than
budgeted expenditures. Operating expenditures total $10,722,487, which is $109,168
less than the budgeted expenditures of $10,831,655. Only the most critical operational
expenditures were expended (i.e. utilities, insurance, approved repairs and
maintenance items). The operating expenditures are on par with our budget. Please
note that the Capital Outlay account which had expenditures of $1,310,626. Included in
these expenditures are approved renovations for completing the Franklin Branch, Phase
I of the Jefferson Branch renovations, completion of Skillman Branch renovation repairs,
and the purchase of a new Mobile Library.

The meeting was adjourned at 2:40 p.m.
