 (Item No. 1 thru Item No. 6)
Miroslava Mejia-Krug, Chief Financial Officer, presented the Commissioners with an overview
of the six actions relating to the financing of the rehabilitation of the three City State Properties:
Loomis Courts, Harrison Courts and Lathrop Elderly building. According to Ms. Mejia-Krug,
the Board recently approved resolutions ratifying the formation of Loomis Courts, LLC,
Harrison Courts, LLC and Lathrop Limited Partnership with all the related documents necessary
to close the transactions for the rehabilitation of Lathrop Elderly. The amended resolutions and
related board letters authorize an increase in Notes and Issuance of both Tax Exempt and
Taxable Notes. In addition, these resolutions authorize the general partners to deliver on behalf
of the owner, the assignment of a Section 8 contract. The financing resolution for each property
requests an increase in Note Issuance to ensure that any additional changes in transactions can be
properly accommodated.

(Item No. 7)
Per Ms. Mejia-Krug, the resolution for Item No. 7 amends Resolution 2005-CHA-55 adopted by
the Board on April 19, 2005, authorizing the CHA to execute contracts with FHP Tectonics
Corporation for general contractor’s services at Harrison Courts and at Loomis Courts, and with
Friedler Construction for Lathrop Elderly. To secure funding for the rehabilitation of these
developments, the CHA is transferring each of these developments to separate tax credit limited
partnerships. The general partner in each of these limited partnerships is a separate limited
liability company, of which the CHA is the sole member. The financing includes FHA-insured
mortgage loans. As the FHA requires that construction contracts be executed at the closing, the
contracts will be executed by the limited partnerships, with the CHA executing the documents as
sole member of the general partners on behalf of the applicable Owner. Thereafter, any
amendments may be signed by either CHA as sole member or by the designated officers of the
general partners on behalf of the Owners. FHA further requires that a substantial construction
contingency be established. The Resolution for Item 7, therefore, approves an increase in the
not-to-exceed amount of such contracts as follows:
