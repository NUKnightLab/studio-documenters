the diverse interests and concerns of Employees, for participation in the Cook County Charitable Giving
Program, pursuant to a transparent and fair selection process; and
WHEREAS, in January of 2017, the Board authorized an agreement between United Way of
Metropolitan Chicago (UWMC) and Cook County as a third-party administrator to facilitate the provision
of voluntary charitable payroll deductions from employees to selected charities identified by Cook County
and supported by UWMC through voluntary payroll deductions from such individuals’ employee
paychecks; and
WHEREAS, UWMC will continue as the County’s third-party administrator in accordance with the
January 2017 agreement or until otherwise amended or terminated in accordance with the terms of the

TREATMENT
GENDER NON-CONFORMING AND INTERSEX INDIVIDUALS

OF

TRANSGENDER,

WHEREAS, the Trump administration and the Department of Health and Human Services is considering
narrowly defining gender as a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth; and
WHEREAS, The Cook County Board of Commissioners has been informed of this by Commissioner
Kevin B. Morrison and LGBTQ advocates; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Kevin B. Morrison and LGBTQ advocates see this effort as a hateful
attempt to roll back recognition and protections of transgender, gender non-conforming, and intersex
people; and
WHEREAS, This proposed definition would essentially eradicate federal recognition of the estimated 1.4
million Americans who identify as a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth; and
WHEREAS, This proposed definition would erase children who are born with intersex conditions, which
is about 1.7 percent of the population, having been born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn't
fit the typical definitions of female or male; and
WHEREAS, This position makes irrelevant and discounts what transgender, gender non-conforming and
intersex people understand about themselves and discounts what medical providers know and understand
about their transgender, gender non-conforming, and intersex patients; and

Page 12 of 97

WHEREAS, This redefining would force genetic testing to resolve any dispute, denying transgender and
gender non-conforming individuals their autonomy and humanity; and

the Trump administration’s proposed definitions; and
WHEREAS, The Trump administration has already attempted to bar transgender people from serving in
the military; and

WHEREAS, Cook County stands with the transgender, gender non-conforming, and intersex community

essential climate change mitigation role by absorbing over 1,544,000 tons of CO2 annually, and further
restoration projects will help sequester even more CO2; and
WHEREAS, in October 2018, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a new study
of the impacts of global warming, and
WHEREAS, the report’s findings predict ocean rise of an additional 10 cm with 2°C warming compared
to 1.5°C, an arctic free of sea ice in Summer once per decade compared to once per century, complete
eradication of coral reefs compared to a 90 percent decline, and the loss of many more ecosystems, and
WHEREAS, in November 2018, the U.S. Global Change Research Program released the U.S. National
Climate Assessment, which predicted that climate change could reduce the size of the U. S. economy by
10 percent by the end of the century, and
WHEREAS, an estimated minimum 200 million people around the globe would be subject to inundation
from rising seas, and several hundred million more to climate related risks and poverty, and

BOARD AGENDA

January 24, 2019

WHEREAS, the current effects of climate change on Cook County from the warming of over 1°C that
has already occurred include increased flooding, heavier rain and snow storms, and more extreme summer
heat, all affecting the region’s people and economy, and
WHEREAS, the expected future impacts of global warming in Cook County include threats to food
supply from impacts on agricultural crops and livestock; increase of invasive species; wildlife habitat
destruction; extinction of native plant and insect species; increased incidence of pests and diseases;
vulnerability of water supply and decreased quality of water; threats to infrastructure such as roads, rail,
water supply and wastewater management; decreased air quality; threats of global unrest causing
homelessness and immigration and disruption of business supply chains and markets; and, threats to many
natural habitats and species, among others, and
WHEREAS, climate change impacts the low-income and vulnerable more heavily, through poorer air
quality which impacts children, the elderly, and people with asthma and other respiratory and circulatory
illnesses; flooding and heat-related damage to infrastructure which more heavily impacts municipalities
with smaller tax bases to pay for infrastructure repair; and through heat-wave related mortality, which
more heavily impacts the elderly, minorities and lower income populations, and in other ways.
WHEREAS, the IPCC concludes that limiting warming to 1.5°C is possible, but would require global net
human-caused emissions of CO2 to fall by about 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero
around 2050, and
WHEREAS, limiting CO2 emissions to these levels would require change on an unprecedented scale,
including rapid and far-reaching changes in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport and cities, and
WHEREAS, many of the actions required are already underway but would need to accelerate, and action
across all fronts will need to proceed as fast as possible, and
WHEREAS, many of the actions required could either save money and resources, or improve other
aspects of quality of life and our ability to adapt successfully to the climate change that is already
underway.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does hereby
adopt the following goal: to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and to reach net zero
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a plan shall be developed to achieve this goal, and that progress
towards this goal shall be reported publicly by the Cook County Department of Environment and
Sustainability in its annual Sustainability Report, and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that other local government agencies and businesses within Cook
County are urged to join with us in adopting this greenhouse gas reduction goal to counter the most
harmful effects of climate change.

Department of Defense (DoD) work, representing $5.3 billion annually. Reflecting its share of the Illinois
economy, the Chicago metro area accounts for nearly 80% of the DoD’s sales in the state. In addition,
similar to the trend observed for Illinois, the amount of defense sales shows a strong growth trajectory,
having increased nearly 37% in the five year period of 2013-2017. In 2015, over 21,000 jobs in the
Northeast Illinois Region were directly supported by defense sales.

This funding provides essential resources which will allow the Chicago Metro Metal Consortium to build
the competiveness of the defense related supply chain. CMMC, as part of the Illinois Defense Network
will engage and cultivate a network of regional defense related manufacturers, assist companies diversify
and expand their supplier base through matching regional capabilities to prime contractor needs, assist
small and medium business enterprises (SMEs) pitch to prime contractors and connect SMEs to resources
and services.
The reason for this amendment is to identify the correct dates for the grant period in the resolution and
have them be the same as the dates included in the Sub-recipient Grant Agreement.

Summary: Track Group, Inc. will provide electronic monitoring and Global Positioning System (GPS)
services for the Adult Probation Department, the Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department and
the Cook County Sheriff’s Office for youth and adults who are ordered by the court to wear electronic
monitoring devices.

Track Group, Inc. will provide GPS monitoring equipment and services for adult probationers and pretrial
defendants in order to comply with Public Act 95-0773, also known as the Cindy Bischof Law, which calls
for the monitoring of certain domestic violence offenses to be monitored by the Adult Probation
Department Home Confinement Unit as a condition of bail or probation. Offenders are ordered to wear a
GPS tracking device to help monitor compliance with orders to stay away from the complaining witness,
the complaining witness’s home/workplace, or any other protected address specified. There are currently
more than 350 adults under GPS monitoring and 110 victims who carry GPS devices to create mobile
exclusion zones. Effective January 1, 2015, new legislation (Public Act 98-1012, 725 ILCS 5/110-5)
significantly expanded the types of charges required to be considered for GPS monitoring as a condition of
bail.
GPS technology is used by the Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department to monitor high-risk
minors in home confinement as an alternative to secure detention or as condition of release into the
community. These devices are deployed at various points of the judicial process from pre-adjudication

Summary:

It is proposed that $49,449.50 be paid to Wendy Moore in settlement of litigation: Wendy

Moore v. Office of the Chief Judge and the County of Cook, 18-cv-4366. This case is one of two related
cases involving two former employees of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC), pending in
the United States district court for the Northern District of Illinois. Both cases allege discrimination under
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1190 and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. Settlement
agreements have been executed for both cases.
Although the county or the state routinely pays such litigation expenses, both the Cook County State’s
Attorney and the state have represented they will not approve payment in these matters. As such, it is
proposed that the settlement costs be paid from funds appropriated in the budget of the JTDC.

L. Moore v. Office of the Chief Judge and the County of Cook, 18-cv-1948. This case is one of two
related cases involving two former employees of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC),
pending in the United States district court for the Northern District of Illinois. Both cases allege
discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1190 and the Family and Medical Leave Act
of 1993. Settlement agreements have been executed for both cases.
Although the county or the state routinely pays such litigation expenses, both the Cook County State’s
Attorney and the state have represented they will not approve payment in these matters. As such, it is
proposed that the settlement costs be paid from funds appropriated in the budget of the JTDC.

Over the years, Gateway has served as a member of several Cook County Problem-Solving Court teams,
