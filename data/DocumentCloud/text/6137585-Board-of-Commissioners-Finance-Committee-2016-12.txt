PROPOSED INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT
Department: Bureau of Finance
Other Part(ies): County Employees’ and Officers’ Annuity and Benefit Fund (“Pension Fund”), Chicago,
Illinois
Request: Approve the IGA for FY 2017, relative to the County’s proposed additional appropriation to the
Pension Fund, enabled by a portion of sales tax revenue
Goods or Services: N/A
Agreement Number(s): N/A
Agreement Period: From date of execution through 11/30/2017
Fiscal Impact: $353,800,000.00
Accounts: 490-818
Summary: This proposed IGA, already approved and signed by the Pension Fund, would reflect the County’s
commitment to appropriate an additional $353,800,000.00 to the Pension Fund. As was stated in the IGA for FY
2016, the agreement requires the Pension Fund to continue its commitment to providing the County Board with
actuarial data and certain reporting on its relative investment performance. This FY 2017 IGA is in the same form
as the FY 2016 IGA, as approved by the Board a year ago, with revisions based on the total amount of the
additional contribution and the payment of that amount over the course of a year. The IGA reflects the undertaking
of the Board and the Board President when the decision was made to increase the sales tax by 1%.
