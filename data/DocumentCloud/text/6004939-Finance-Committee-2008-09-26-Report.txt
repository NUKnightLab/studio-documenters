In response to a question with regard to improving the ability to estimate in order to present the accruals, Mr.
Calkin stated that he will be meeting on the following Tuesday with the Chief Financial Of?cers of the System?s
institutions, the expenditure control department and the accounts payable department to craft a methodology. What
may be necessary is What auditors refer to as an ?out of period search.? This involves physically collecting invoices
from each of the large departments and placing them on a control sheet. This would be used to determine the
accrual until the invoices are paid in the future.

During the discussion regarding non-operating revenues, Chairman Carvalho inquired whether a report of expenses
relative to cash flow could be prepared. In particular, although the Directors have asked that information be
presented in GAAP format, nonetheless the County budgeting and expenditure system is presented on a cash basis,
so Directors also need to see how the System is doing on a cash basis. Mr. Calkin replied that a report exists which
shows encumbrances; he could work towards creating such a report with the additional information'.

Some questions were raised with regard to the current Limit of Liability policy; Mr. Calkin stated that he would
soon be bringing policy revisions to the Committee for their considerationz.

While the Committee discussed issues relative to coding, Director Ansell noted that in January, Recovery Audit
Contractors (RACs) will be coming to Illinois; this program was created to detect and correct improper payments in
the Medicare program. They will be examining short stays.

Mr. Small indicated that starting the following Monday, MedAssets will be evaluating the coding processes.

During the presentation of the July 2008 Financials, Chairman Carvalho noted that a quorum was no longer
present. He stated that the Committee would continue to review and discuss the items, but no action would
be taken by the Committee due to the lack of a quorum of members. He added that the report would still he
presented to the Board indicating the Committee?s review and discussion of the items, however, the items
requiring action would need to be presented to the Board of Directors. These items should be placed on the
Board?s agenda for the meeting of October 3, 2008 for their consideration.

 

Contracts and Procuremegt Apnrov?
Additional information pertaining to these items is included in Attachment 

*These items were reviewed, considered and discussed by those members of the Finance Committee who were
present. However, due to the lack of a quorum, consideration and approval by the full Board of Directors is
necessary. Although the Committee did not take formal action at the meeting, Chairman Carvalho inquired
whether those members present consumed with the recommendation to approve the items presented, with the
exception of those items which were withdrawn. Chairman Carvalho, Directors Golden and O?Donnell stated that
they concurred.

Consideration and Approval of Preposed Fiscal Year 2009 Budget
Cook County Health and Hospitals System

 

Mr. Calkin presented to the Committee a draft proposal for the System?s Proposed Fiscal Year 2009 Budget.

Discussion and review proceeded, on issues including, but not limited to, those with regard 'to ef?ciencies, supply
chain improvements, critical infrastructure needs, staf?ng, employee bene?ts and program additions. Mr. Calkin
and Mr. Small responded to several questions from Directors on the information presented.

During the discussion of critical infrastructure needs, Director O?Donnell inquired whether a plan was in place to
return for the Board?s future consideration in the following ?scal years those needs that do not get funding this
year. Mr. Small stated that the plan would be added.

Chairman Carvalho requested a costfrevenue analysis on ?lling Medicaid prescriptionss. In particular, does the
System make money ?lling Medicaid prescriptions or lose money and if the latter, is it advisable to espancl capacity
rather than re?directing Medicaid patients to other sources?

Afler the presentation, Mr. Small asked the Committee for direction on how to proceed at this point. He noted that
Jarese Wilson, Director of the Cook County Department of Budget and Management, was present.

Ms. Wilson stated that leading the System?s proposed budget into the County?s Budget System, albeit on a
"tentative" basis, would heip with balancing if it were loaded now; the Health System is the only department left
that has not submitted its proposed budget.

Mr. Small stated that the budget could be fully loaded in, pending further Board approval.

Chairman Carvalho, Director Golden and Director O?Donnell concurred on the recommendation to the Board of
Directors and the administration that the proposed budget, as presented as a draft outline at this meeting. be loaded
into the County?s Budget system new, subject to further possible re?nements.

 

New Business

Director Golden provided an update with regard to Strategic Planning eFForts. She indicated that the group has
identi?ed a need for a consultant to work with the Board and the Strategic Planning Committee. This assistance is
needed for the large planning process, particularly to help with the gathering and analysis of information and the
preparations of materials for the meeting in October or November.

Chairman Carvalho suggested that Director Golden work with Mr. Small to prepare a contract to bring back to the
Finance Committee in order to secure such services.

Summary

The operating performance of the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System was below the budget by approximately The lower than
expected operating performance was the result of lower than budget
operating revenue year to date that was not offset by a reduced level of year
to date expenses at the end of July. Revenue was below the budget by
$36,254,987. Operating expenses year to date were below the budget by
$30,334,720 at the end ofJuly.

Operating Revenue

Total operating revenue was below the budget by over 12% year to date at
the end of July. At the end of June year to date revenue was below the
budget by a similar level. Patient fee revenue and revenue from
Intergovernmental Transfers were below budget at the end of July. The
shortfall of fee revenue and IGT revenue were partially offset by a favorable
year to date level of other revenue.

The System management continues to work with .the of?cials of the state
Medicaid program to complete the account reconciliations. It is hoped that
the potential increased revenue from the reconciliations of an estimated 11.6
million dollars would offset a portion of the over 15 million dollar reduction
in the IGT revenue.

The System will continue to work with Medassets to improve the charging,
billing and collection of patient fee revenue. It is hoped that the level of
collections can be increased by the end of the fiscal year. The System
currently projects that patient fee revenue will be below the budget by
approximately 36.4 million dollars at year end.

Operating Expenses

The System?s operating expenses were below the budget by $30,334,720 or
4.3% year to date at the end of July. The favorable level of expenses was at
the end of July primarily the result of lower than planned expenses for
supplies, purchased services, and utilities. Salaries, wages and bene?ts were
over budget year to date at the end of July.

Salaries and Wages ($565,295) or 
Salaries and wages exceed the budget at the end of July. The budget was
spread to the months of the ?scal year on an even basis through out the ?scal

0

year. The impact of summer vacations and the July 4?11 holiday on
replacement time have contributed to the unfavorable variance. The level of
labor related expense will continue to be monitored closely with an
additional emphasis on the use of overtime.

Supplies $8,069,842 or 8.2%

Supply expense continues to be estimated by adding an accrual of 60% to
the actual amounts paid by the county. This method is not ideal and the
System finance staff will continue to explore ways to improve the accuracy
of the estimates for supply expense.

Purchased Services, Rental, and Other $21,194,299 or 21.1%
The same methodology for the estimation of sapply expense is used to
estimate expenses for this category.

Utilities $1,737,062 "or 12.4%

The estimates for utility expense are based on reports of actual payments by
the County for System facilities. The 2008 budget was assigned to periods
without any adjustment for the prior seasonal pattern of expense. It should
be possible next year to provide a better seasonal match of the budget and
actual expense for utilities now that the system receives regular information
from the County.
