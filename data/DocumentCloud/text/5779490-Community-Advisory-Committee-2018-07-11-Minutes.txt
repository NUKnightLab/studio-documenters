Project Introduction
This Plan is intended to replace the Brownfield Plan for the Garfield Area Redevelopment Project
that was approved on October 18, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as the "2006 Plan") and that was
first amended and restated on November 1, 2011 (hereinafter referred to as the “2011
Amendment”). Changes are noted within the individual project descriptions. The Plan includes
multiple projects, each to be developed by different developers (referred to generally throughout
this Plan as the “Developer”). The Developers have agreed that each of the projects benefit the
others, and as such, agree to cooperate with one another to implement this Plan and any future
agreements to be executed pursuant to this Plan.
Develop Detroit Inc. and Preservation of Affordable Housing Inc. were (“POAH”) selected by the
City of Detroit as the developers of four (4) City owned parcels that are part of the Plan. The
second (2nd) amendment and restatement of the Garfield Area Brownfield Plan is being requested
to include the new developers in the Brownfield Plan and to modify the following aspects of the
2011 Plan: scope of Project, Eligible Activities, TIF Table, and Eligible Investment that was
included in the original approvals.
In the 2006 Plan, the projects were as follows:

 •
•
•
•
•

Garfield Manor and York Apartments
E. Forest Art Project
Randora Apartments
Parking Deck I
Parking Deck IL

In the 2011 Amendment, changes to the Plan included:
• Updating the TIF eligible public improvements
• Splitting the Garfield Manor and York Apartments development into two separate
projects
• Updating the status of the E. Forest Art Project
• Removing the eligible MBT investment in the Randora apartment project.
• Updating the plans for the Parking Deck I project
• Removing the eligible activities from Parking Deck II
• Adding 76 E. Forest
• Adding 92 E. Forest
In this 2nd Amendment & Restatement, proposed changes to the Plan include:
• Amending the project description to change what was known as the Parking Deck
I project to the Sugar Hill Redevelopment project.
• Amending and restating the eligible activities associated with the Sugar Hill
Redevelopment project
• Amending and restating the TIF Tables to add the Sugar Hill Redevelopment
project.
• Identifying investment in the Sugar Hill Redevelopment project as Eligible
Investment associated with a Michigan Business Tax (MBT) credit, which is to be
amended.
These changes are described in more detail in the individual project descriptions. Each Project
includes eligible activities and eligible properties and will request, has already requested, or has
already received a MBT credit.
Total investment for the Sugar Hill Redevelopment Project is expected to be approximately
$34,600,000.00. The Developers are requesting $9,639,944.00 in TIF reimbursement under the
proposed Plan.
Property Subject to the Plan
The property comprising the eligible property consists of 20 parcels located within the Sugar Hill
Arts District. The parcels and all tangible personal property located thereon will comprise the
