Background

r

In the 33+ months since CEA won a competitively bid RFP to provide eligibility services for CCHHS,
it has delivered roughly $100M in gross remits, all from the very difficult disability cateqoy
. -.T

a

r

.

-

,

CCHHS has undergone numerous organizational and leadership changes in this brief period but one
fact has been clear to all involved with the revenue cycle and that is, that the eligibility efforts have
been severely sub-optimized
Extremely complicated and inconsistently applied referral processes
Multiple players (both internal and external) involved with varying levels of capability and accountability
Large portions of the patient population not addressed
Etc.

I ;Upon being hired to run CCHHS' revenue cycle in Q2 2008, MedAssets did a diagnostic of CCHHS
$eligibility efforts and realized that numerous best practices need to be adopted to optimize the net
'cash recovered for the System

r

Key to the optimization efforts is the aggregation of accountability for eligibility with one party and the
addressing of all uninsured CCHHS patients...an approach MedAssets first shared with the Board in
late 2008

 Background (cont.)

Chamberlin Edmonds was selected as the eligibility partner to optimize efforts for CCHHS for a
- - :" ... , r . ' , . .
number of primary reasons
r . . .

We have twice been selected by UHC (of which CCHHS is a member) in a highly competitive process to be
the sole eligibility partner... most recently in Oct 2008 for a 5 year period through October 2013
We serve over 20% of the nation's large indigent care safety net hospitals and 25% of the nation's Academic
Medical Centers, all with distinction and strong results
As the nations' largest pure play eligibility company, we uniquely have the experience, capability and capacity
necessary to successfully undertake and complete a project with the scope and size of the one CCHHS is
embarking on
Our demonstrated commitment to CCHHS' success despite, what at times, have been extremely trying
circumstances
Our performance and the tremendous net, incremental value we have delivered in less than three years

Late in 2008 CEA was asked to start developing a plan to comprehensively address CCHHS'
eligibility needs
Those plans have been refined and adjusted a number of times.. .and factor in input from a variety
of sources
Poor historical information regarding volumes and demand have hampered planning efforts throughout

 Eligibility Best Practices
While the best and most effective eligibility programs at acute care hospitals across
the country are customized to address the specifics of the individual hospital/system,
there are a number of consistent practices/components that they share ...we call these,
best practices

Kev Best Practices:
Address the complete patient population, prioritizing resources based on a magnitude of
opportunity in various segments

P Aggregate responsibility/accountability by minimizing the number of players and hand-offs in the
referral process
Make the process personal...
See outpatient population prior to, or at time of service, if possible
Visit with inoatients prior to discharge
b u ~ bonas
~ d with patients and familylfriends
Set expectations for follow-up and required evidence
Use patient advocacy approach

Maximize use of ED1 and IT to ensure timely and complete coordination and information transfer

a

Screen for all programs including charity care at one time, minimizing patient confusion and
fatigue

The Implementation Protocol 7

of new customers, managed by a dedicated functional team with signi?cant experience.
Although is not a new customer, the size/scope of the Go-Forward Plan
necessitates the full use of this specialized approach.

The Implementation Difference

The implementation department operates under the direction of an experienced
operational manager and assigns our most quali?ed and tenured personnel from major
functional areas of the company

Each new customer start-up is managed by an experienced project manager and
interfaces with operations, sales, client services and ?nance departments to
ensure a quick and ef?cient start to operations

Our implementation protocol follows the same process for all programs/customers
irrespective of eligibility programs served

Once the project manager is assigned project planning begins. Key customer staff
members are vital participants in the process

Key features and bene?ts of our proprietary protocol

- Proven project plans evolved over time with use of best practice methodology and
successful outcomes

- Project management approach and discipline with use of MS Project for tasks,
milestones and constraints when indicated

Summary
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System year to date financial
results finished the sixth month of the fiscal year ahead of budget by
$2,949,441. The overall revenue shortfall at the end of the sixth month
was $7,767,769. Expenses were below budget by $10,717,210 or 2.0%.
Note: The budgeted revenue and expenditure amounts used on this
financial statement are pending final publication of the FY 2009 Budget.
Operating Revenue
Fees at the end of May collected from patient services were above budget
year to date by $2,653,739 or 1.8%. The number of Medicare visits is
down this year compared to the same period last year.
Other Revenue at the end of May is below the budget by $798,061 or
22.5%. Prior year revenues included one time payments which was
factored into the 2009 budget.
FMAP and NetDSH are recognized on a accrual basis to Budget.
Total Operating Revenue at the end of May was above budget year to
date by $1,855,677 or 0.8%.
In June 2009, the Health and Hospitals System received a net lump sum
payment from the State of Illinois of $132 million. This lump sum
payment was negotiated with the state as part of the new
intergovernmental agreement between the state and the County. One of
the major features of the new agreement is the lowering of reimbursement
rates for inpatient stays for the system beginning July, 2008. Included in
this amount was a payment of approximately $50 million net for hospital
bills adjudicated after June, 2008. These bills were adjudicated at the
older “higher reimbursement” rates. As a result, the State of Illinois will
be withholding inpatient payments to the three hospitals based on the
newly negotiated rates until this amount is repaid. These amounts were
This information is an integral part of the accompanying consolidated financial statements

withheld beginning in July, 2009 and anticipated that the recoupment
period could last from 4-5 months at Stroger to as long as a year or more
at Provident. A full presentation showing the effect of the new agreement
and its impact on the current and future budgets of the Health and
hospital’s System is planned for the Finance Committee meeting on
September 4, 2009.
Operating Expenses
Operating Expenses at the end of May were below budget by $10,717,210
or 2.0%. This favorable expense performance was due to positive
variances for Supplies, Purchased Services, and Utilities. Salaries and
Employee Benefits were under the budget year to date.
Salaries and Wages – $23,073,323 or 8.1%
Salaries and wages were below the budget at the end of May due to the
FY 2009 Budget not being approved until mid-February which resulted in
none of the new budgeted positions being recruited for.
Benefits - $3,269,490 or 8.1%
The level of Benefit expense is directly related to salary and wage
expense. Benefits for employees are below the budget because salaries
and wages are also below the budget.
Supplies – $2,500,000 or 3.1%
Each of the System facilities supply expenses are below the budget year
to date. The System is using the accrual convention to estimate supply
expense based on the budgeted expenditures minus any documented
savings to date.
In comparison to the prior year, the estimated YTD May 31, 2008 supply
expense of $50,211,387 ($38,019,699 as of YTD May’09) was based on
actual expense taken from the Comptroller’s ledger of actual items paid
by the County. During the preparation of the prior year’s report, there
were no attempts to estimate an accrual for any missing expenses.
This information is an integral part of the accompanying consolidated financial statements

 7

Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $2,100,000 or 2.6%
The year to date level expenses for the System for this category continues
to be significantly below the budget. The method used to estimate
expense is the same for purchased services as is used for supplies.
Similar to supplies, the prior YTD May 31, 2008 estimated purchase
services, rental, and other expense amount of $47,465,365 ($29,712,540
as of YTD May’09) was based on expenses taken from the Comptroller’s
ledgers.

Utilities - $1,874,216 or 17.6%
The estimated System year to date expense for utilities in total is below
budget. The accrual convention to estimate this expense is based on total
YTD bills, paid and unpaid, received by the Cook County Industrial
Engineer responsible for processing the utility bills for the County.
Similar to supplies, the prior YTD May 31, 2008 estimated utilities
expense of $7,123,272 ($6,557,992 as of YTD May ’09) was also taken
from the Comptroller’s ledgers.

Corporation, 7301 N. Lincoln Avenue # 196, Lincolnwood IL 607 12 for
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV %) and Hepatitis Serology Tests at
Stroger and Provident Hospitals.

Justification:
The department wants to change the current instrumentation to the new
technology of Ortho, which is to be FDA-approved, per manufacturer, by the end of year for the
following reasons:

Shorter turnaround time because positive results do no need
to be repeated due to technology's "Intellicheck System"
Cost-savings on reagents, consumables and labor
because of no repeats and technology has "True Random Access"
system. The system allows random specimen feeding into
instrument without having to run quality control samples before
hand. Quality controls are run only at the beginning of performing
shift. Current system is a batch-type system. Quality controls
must be run before any specimens are tested.
The Department of Pathology needs a 7-month extension to wait for this
new technology. In addition, parallel-testing studies required
by accrediting agencies are to be completed before the new instruments
are fully operational.
