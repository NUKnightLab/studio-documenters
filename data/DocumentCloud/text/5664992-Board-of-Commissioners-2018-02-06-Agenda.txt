PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH
WHEREAS, Black History Month provides an opportunity for the residents of Cook County to recognize
the culture, history and talents of African Americans; and
WHEREAS, Black History Month began as "Negro History Week," which was created in 1926 by Carter
G. Woodson, a noted African American historian, scholar, educator, and publisher. It became a
month-long celebration in 1976. The month of February was chosen to coincide with the birthdays of
Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln; and
WHEREAS, in 1976, President Gerald R. Ford officially recognized Black History Month, calling it a
moment for the public to "seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of black
Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history." Since then, the month of February has been
recognized by every President of the United States as Black History Month; and
WHEREAS, the 2018 Black History Month theme is “African Americans in Times of War,” we honor
the African American men and women who have fought and laid down their lives for their country; and
WHEREAS, there have been many African American military units that have contributed to our nation’s
history included but not limited to the Civil War’s Buffalo Soldiers and World War II’s Tuskegee Airmen;
