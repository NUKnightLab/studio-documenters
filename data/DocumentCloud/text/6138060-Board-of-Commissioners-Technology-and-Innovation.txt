AUTOMATED BOARD AGENDA PROJECT. Transmitting a Communication
from Todd H. Stroger, President and David Orr, Cook County Clerk:

Dear Members of the Cook County Board of Commissioners:

President Todd H. Stroger is committed to applying technology to improve
performance and create efficiency in government. The Bureau of Technology's
Vision 2010 Strategic Plan sets forth the guidelines for improvements.

in keeping with this Vision, the Office of the President and the County Clerk are
developing a countywide web-based Automated Board Agenda (ABA) application
to be implemented in partnership with the Bureau of Technology.

The ABA tool in development will allow authorized users to create and submit
automatic transmittals for inclusion on the County Board Agenda eliminating
duplication of efforts and additional traffic on our email and network systems
resulting in a seamless and integrated agenda creation process, with shared
technology, from initiation to final product.

For this to be successful, all elected officials, bureaus and departments of Cook
County government that have business before the County Board must adopt the
ABA system for processing agenda items. Execution of the ABA is scheduled for
the beginning of FY2009 with the December 3, 2008 County Board Meeting.

We are requesting to present a project overview and discuss technology
requirements, training and implementation at a meeting of the Committee on
Information Technology Automation.

*Referred to the Committee on Information Technology and Automation on
June 17, 2008.
