Changes of ownership in licensed locations.
The proposed rulemaking adds a new Section 1800.590 to the video gaming rules [11 Ill. Admin.

provides that licenses issued by the Board are not alienable or transferable, nor are they subject
to attachment. It further provides that location licenses do not descend by the laws of testate or
intestate devolution. This subsection specifically provides the circumstances under which a
licensed location can continue to operate when an owner of the location dies.
Subsection b) establishes detailed requirements pertaining to changes of ownership in locations
and the ability of a new owner to operate video gaming terminals (“VGTs”) in an already
licensed location. Specifically, the subsection provides for notice to the Board when changes in

 ownership occur; and the steps that a licensed location must take in order to continue to operate
VGTs.
