 BACKGROUND

On June 9, 2017 after an RFP process, NOACA awarded a contract to
Markey Group. NOACA has worked with Markey Group over the past two
years to develop:
1. Air Quality Public Education and Outreach Strategy
•
•

Goals, objectives, metrics, and action
Will guide implementation of NOACA’s Regional Strategic Plan and help bring
the region into compliance with EPA’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS)

2. Communication Plan
•

5-1

How NOACA will use communication tools to support the strategy

 BACKGROUND

The purpose of this project is to develop a strategy to provide
information and generate awareness of outdoor air quality
problems and solutions in Northeast Ohio.

5-1

 BACKGROUND

While NE Ohio’s air quality has improved
since the 1970 Clean Air Act, portions of the
region continue to exceed EPA standards
for multiple pollutants in 2018
• Standards exceeded for ozone and
sulfur dioxide
• Ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter
(PM2.5) – most deadly pollutants – have
declined by a smaller margin

Transportation (mobile) emissions have
emerged as primary pollutants
•

Single-occupant vehicle (SOV) rate in
NOACA region has increased over the
last decade to 82% in 2017, higher
than the national average

Mobile emissions contribute to respiratory
disease, heart disease, strokes, pre- and
neo-natal conditions, cognitive issues, and
other health conditions, resulting in missed
days of school and work, and higher medical
costs (especially children and the elderly)
• 28% of air-pollution related deaths in NE
Ohio (2nd largest driver)
• Road transportation air pollution in
Cleveland caused more premature
deaths than homicide or traffic crashes

 BACKGROUND

PUBLIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH STRATEGY MISSION STATEMENT:
NOACA will educate the community about the region’s air quality
challenges and the linkages among air quality, transportation, land
use, and public health.
NOACA will empower individuals and organizations to improve air
quality, in particular through increased use of alternate transportation
modes.
NOACA will advocate for public policies that provide greater
transportation choice, reduce mobile emissions, benefit public
health, create economic opportunity, and enhance quality of life in
Northeast Ohio.

 BACKGROUND

Markey Group and NOACA staff have obtained input via:
• Public focus groups and meetings
• Market feedback tools (informal surveys)
• Market research
• NOACA subcommittee and advisory council meetings

Consultant submitted semi-final versions of both documents
earlier this year
Both documents underwent extensive peer review

 BACKGROUND
Strategy Document Outline – Action Plan
Goal #1: Increase awareness of the air quality challenge in
Northeast Ohio

 Promote awareness of air quality challenge in Northeast Ohio
 Measure Northeast Ohio resident awareness of air quality
challenge

5-1

 BACKGROUND
Goal #2: Educate the community on the causes and potential
solutions for the air quality challenge in Northeast Ohio

 Implement education campaigns to foster conviction, develop
skills, provide role modeling opportunities, and promote
behavior change
 Establish NOACA as a leading resource for air quality
information and guidance in Northeast Ohio

5-1

 BACKGROUND

Goal #3: Empower employers, healthcare providers, and educational
institutions with resources to be air quality champions
 Promote Gohio Commute and Commuter Choice Awards as
employer/employee transportation strategies
 Pilot consulting support for local employers with local transportation
management needs
 Develop and/or adapt content (brochures, videos, fact sheets) for
healthcare providers and education institutions to distribute. Content
should tell the reader why clean air is important and what they can
do to help clean the air
 Meet regularly with hospital, healthcare, and school leaders to share
content, encourage distribution and address concerns
5-1

 BACKGROUND
Goal #4: Promote a culture at NOACA that better integrates air
quality with other programs

 Further develop a culture that promotes air quality at NOACA,
so that NOACA can be a leader in role modeling good clean
air behaviors

5-1

 BACKGROUND
Goal #5: Promote strategies outside of NOACA to change
transportation and infrastructure policy and increase clean air
funding

 Plant the seeds for a potential future public-private partnership
 Provide data to support the case for increased funding for
expanded alternative transportation infrastructure
 Drive down the single occupancy vehicle rate by eliminating the
barrier “Action for cleaner air is not convenient for me”
 Pursue transportation reform by educating and collaborating with
city, regional, state, and federal government agencies and
programs
