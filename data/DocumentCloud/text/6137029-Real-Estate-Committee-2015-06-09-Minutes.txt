PROPOSED LICENSE REQUEST
Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (“the Preserves”), as
Licensor to grant a License to the Village of Oak Lawn and other Municipal Customers of the Oak Lawn
Regional Water System, Grantee, to locate, operate and maintain a water transmission main in the Tinley Creek
Preserves. Permission is now sought, upon satisfactory completion of all due diligence and negotiation of any and
all relevant provisions as determined by the Preserves’ legal department, to enterinto and execute the License. The
request is for approximately 20,060 linear feet of new water main ranging in size from 24-inch diameter to 60-inch
diameter to serve 12 southwest suburban communities. The communities are currently served by a single 40 year
old 48-inch transmission main. The addition of a new 60-inch water transmission line will provide a looped system
to increase capacity and provide redundancy in the event of a failure.
Impacts: The new pipeline will extend through the forest preserves for approximately 3.8 miles and require a
license area of almost 7 acres, but will be routed primarily within an existing disturbed corridor occupied by a
ComEd transmission line. Approximately 1.5 miles of paved trail will be directly impacted by construction.
Fees and Benefits: In addition to the license fee, the Grantee will pay an impact fee for temporary construction
use of 35.6 acres, based on a daily proration of the license fee. Also, the Grantee will rebuild the impacted trail
and approximately 2 miles of adjacent trail in order to avoid patchwork trail segments.
The Grantee will also
provide funding to reimburse the Forest Preserves for the ecologic restoration of 500 acres in the Tinley Creek
Preserves. Finally, the Grantee will also provide funding for a construction management service to monitor
construction for the FPCC. The current estimate of all fee associated with the issuance of this License is
$3,944,795 as indicated below. However, due to the unique size and scope of this project these numbers may
change based upon the length, size and duration of the work being conducted by the Grantee.

EASEMENT REQUEST
Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (“the Preserves”) to grant a
permanent easement to the Cook County Department of Transportation and Highways (CDOTH) at Bemis Woods
for 4.634 acres or 201,858 square feet.
Reason: On 8/24/1928 the Cook County Board directed the Superintendent of Highways to prepare plans for the
improvement and relocation of Wolf Road north of Ogden Avenue. Plans were prepared, approved by the Cook
County Board and by State Highways, and in 1929 construction began, however there is no record of an easement
grant for the road at its relocation. CDOTH is requesting the easement grant to rectify the situation and formally
recognize the easement for public road at its current location.
The easement area is currently improved with a two to five lane roadway with median. The easement will also allow
for construction of a bike path connection proposed by the Village of Western Springs.
The area for the permanent easement is 4.634 acres. CDOTH indicates that no trees are expected to be removed for
this project.
