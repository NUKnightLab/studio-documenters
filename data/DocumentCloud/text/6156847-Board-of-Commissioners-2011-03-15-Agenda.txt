WHEREAS, tuberculosis is primarily an illness that affects the respiratory system it is spread by
coughing and sneezing. Each year about two million people worldwide die from this curable disease; and

WHEREAS, in suburban Cook County treatment and control services are provided by the Cook County
Department of Public Health’s (CCDPH) TB Prevention and Control Unit; and
WHEREAS, an effective TB prevention and control program includes screening, early case
