Strategic Opportunities Committee Members

Re:

June 27th Strategic Opportunities Committee Meeting Information

This memo provides a brief overview of the Strategic Opportunities Committee meeting
on Thursday, June 27th from 1:00-3:00 p.m.
As you know, the purpose of this committee is to recommend strategic direction to the
board and staff of ICJIA. The committee reviews the mandate of the agency as it is
established by law and analyzes the elements of that charge to determine strategies to
accomplish the mandate. It makes recommendations of strategic direction to the board
for review and approval. Once approved, the strategic direction serves as the basis for
policy and programmatic decisions about agency investments as reflected in notices of
funding opportunity and eventually funding of proposals submitted in response to those
notices. One element of the agency’s mandate must be addressed by the committee.
At the meeting, ICJIA staff will facilitate a discussion on the agency’s mandate “to
coordinate statewide violence prevention efforts and develop a statewide plan that
includes public health and public safety approaches to violence prevention in families,
communities, and school” (20 ILCS 390/2). (See attached selections from ICJIA’s
enabling statute related to violence prevention.) This mandate was added to ICJIA’s
enabling statute in 2012, when the agency absorbed the functions of the Illinois Violence
Prevention Authority. While ICJIA has engaged in strategic planning initiatives to help
program its federal formula awards and has done some work to help coordinate violence
prevention activities, it has not developed a statewide violence prevention plan. At the
meeting, the staff will present information on the history and research of violence
prevention programming and on how the agency’s current work is related to violence
prevention. The ultimate goal for the meeting will be to begin to formulate how ICJIA’s
staff and board can use its existing resources to develop a statewide violence prevention
plan.

After the initial roll call, four of the five Committee members needed for a quorum were
present. Chairman Wolff suggested moving to agenda items that did not require a
quorum.
Executive Director’s Report
Director Maki thanked the Committee and Authority staff for their hard work in moving
from plans that had begun in the Strategic Opportunities Committee (SOC) to
implementation. At this point in the cycle, he explained, the SOC would be starting to
look at possibilities for 2018, especially as the Victims of Crime Act recently expanded
eligibility.
Victim-Centered Restorative Justice Research Presentation
The Victim of Crimes Act permits resources to be allocated for restorative justice.
Authority Research Director Megan Alderden explained the context for the use of these
resources and began by clarifying that while restorative justice philosophy has always
included the victim perspective, the victim-centered model is a specific type of
restorative justice that is defined by the desires of the victim rather than by an interest in
diversion of the perpetrator from the criminal justice system. She described three pillars
of victim-centered restorative justice: addressing harms and needs, meeting obligations to
restore the victim, and engaging stakeholders. Victim needs include information about
the crime, the ability to talk about how the crime affected them, empowerment, and
restitution or repair of harm. Dr. Alderden quoted expert Howard Zehr in listing critiques,
which include a focus on offender needs rather than victim needs, intrusion of system
goals (such as a reduction in criminal justice population), and a lack of victim input in the
planning process. She also reported that Zehr’s ideal restorative justice systems would

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Regular Board Meeting
April 27, 2017
Page 2

 have victim involvement at all stages, optional dialogue with the offender, involvement
of the victim’s support network, practitioner training, and take place in a safe
environment. She said research support is mixed, with a meta-analysis of restorative
justice programs finding victim satisfaction and higher rates of offender restitution but
limited by the halo effect and self-selection bias. Dr. Alderden recommended explicit
guidelines, ample oversight to ensure compliance to guidelines prescribed by the Office
of Victims of Crime (OVC), and rigorous evaluation that focuses on victim outcomes.
Dr. Alderden described restorative justice in Pennsylvania, endorsed as victim-centered
by the OVC. Though other states use this process for lower-level, petty, or juvenile
crimes, in Pennsylvania, many violent and sexual crimes are processed through this
system. Dr. Alderden reported that Pennsylvania’s victim advocacy agency runs a victimoffender dialogue process and an apology letter bank.
Meeting attendees commented on barriers to operating this program outside of the
criminal justice system, what will be allowed under VOCA funding, success of
restorative justice in the United Kingdom, overlap between victim and offender
populations, cost and evaluation of the Pennsylvania restorative justice programs, and the
Restorative Justice Community Center in North Lawndale.
Victims of Crime Act Updates
Reshma Desai, Authority Special Projects Program Advisor, summarized recent progress
on VOCA funding opportunities. She said transitional housing grants had been executed,
programs began in March, and funding totaled to $2.1 million. She said legal civil
services applications were being reviewed and requests totaled $7.1 million. A notice of
funding opportunity for unmet needs of underserved populations was planned for release
in May 2017.
According to Director Maki and Ms. Desai, the combination of the new GATA grant
process and new rules on what is allowable under VOCA has challenged the staff to
refine the language used in notices and reach out to the philanthropic community to help
score applications and communicate gaps in what the agency is not allowed to fund.
Justice Assistance Grant Updates
Greg Stevens, Authority Program Supervisor, summarized recent progress on JAG
funding opportunities. Following Budget Committee approval, applications for grants to
support law enforcement responses to narcotics were due in May 2017, and, once scored,
suitable applications will be presented to the Budget Committee in September for a
anticipated program start date in October 2017. Mr. Stevens also described the residential

applications are due June 13, 2017.

After the initial roll call, three of the five Board members needed for a quorum were
present. Chairman Wolff suggested moving to agenda items that did not require a
quorum.
Chairman’s Remarks
Chair Wolff welcomed the group and mentioned that a board’s contributions fall into
three categories: fiduciary, strategic, and generative/creative. She said while the other
responsibilities are often clear, it can be difficult to make time for the generative/creative
function, and it is the Strategic Opportunity’s Committee job to step back and think about
what big-picture intentions for the justice system in Illinois might look like. This meeting
will provide an opportunity for this work.
Executive Director’s Report
Director Maki thanked Chair Wolff for her insight and said his intention for the meeting
was to describe projects that are moving from planning to implementation. He asked for
the members’ feedback on the Authority’s progress and future.
Justice Assistance Grant Updates
Director Maki reported that the Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program had been moved
into a Grant Accountability and Transparency Act-compliant structure. Conflicts between
the state and federal calendars, staffing bandwidth, designing strategic funding groups,
and including research staff were cited as hurdles overcome during implementation.
Goals of delivering statewide benefit through JAG programs have been reached by
incorporating research and information sharing, Director Maki said, particularly with the
inception of the Department of Information and Technology. Competing with the private
sector in recruiting talent has proven difficult, though ICJIA has a history of innovation
in crime-mapping technology, he said.
Chair Wolff encouraged the group to define “statewide benefit,” and give their thoughts
on whether progress had been made toward the goal. Director Maki answered that it did
not have a static definition, but rather was an orientation that the Authority uses to

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Regular Board Meeting
January 27, 2017
Page 2

 interpret research on what the state needs at different points in time. Ms. Campanelli said
the benefit that ICJIA can provide is violence prevention by meeting client needs, such as
reentry programs. Ms. Vollen-Katz added that statewide benefit does not necessarily
mean every citizen profits from every program, but that funding decisions should be
made with intentionality toward learning how to solve a problem so that the knowledge
can be shared.
When Director Maki added that geographic diversity was also a piece of achieving
statewide benefit, Ms. Vollen-Katz said she appreciated the Authority hosting training
and events outside of Cook County.
Mr. Delfino stated that he is seeing progress in including all jurisdictions, but many
southern counties still have unmet basic needs. He said his office has plans to organize a
meeting with new prosecutors who may not know what resources are available to them
and Chair Wolff suggested including ICJIA in the event. Judge Robb suggested Authority
representation at bi-annual state’s attorneys' and public defenders' associations meetings
to discuss how to apply for grants.
Ms. Hora asked about conducting a needs assessment for JAG funding similar to what
was conducted for Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) funds. Director Maki said JAG was
initially set up to address law enforcement equipment needs rather than programs and it
can be difficult to allocate funds to innovative programming or research.
Chair Wolff revisited Ms. Campanelli’s statement on violence prevention as the goal of
the justice system. Mr. Chadd responded that the goal should be achieving accurate
convictions, and Ms. Campanelli agreed. Ms. Vollen-Katz summarized both goals by
suggesting that the common objective is reduced justice system contact. Ms. Desai
reminded the group of the JAG priorities that had been agreed upon in 2016. Judge Robb
suggested that those goals should be discussed regularly in committee meetings.
Director Maki said that percentages of JAG funding will not be set aside for particular
program areas. Though available amounts are indicated in public Notices of Funding
Opportunities, they can be adjusted based on the volume and quality of responses,
especially during this first year.
Ms. Hora suggested the committee could receive a presentation of how the $4.2 million
in JAG funding is divided. Director Maki welcomed future discussions about whether
specific amounts or proportions should be set aside for innovative approaches. He added
that all policies will be taken to the Authority Board for approval.
Director Maki said the committee had moved JAG into a competitive funding structure,
informed by the Research & Analysis Unit’s work. ICJIA also has adopted a no-match

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Regular Board Meeting
January 27, 2017
Page 3

 policy, following guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice. Director Maki also
relayed the recommendation that the Authority follow the GATA structure in offering
three-year grant cycles.
Victims of Crime Act and Violence Against Women Act Updates
Director Maki laid out the anticipated Victims of Crime Act and Violence Against
Women Act funding calendar. He said the first notice of funding opportunity under the
new competitive structure was for comprehensive legal assistance and the next will be for
unmet needs for victims of child abuse, community violence, financial exploitation, and
impaired driving. Ms. Brennan said legal assistance funding has been offered by ICJIA in
the past, but not to this degree ($6 million). She said VOCA guidelines now allow for a
greater range of services to be covered. Director Maki added that the Authority will be
following federal recommendations in centralizing victim services, rather than funding
single legal experts at various locations.
Policy Updates
Director Maki reported that the Criminal Justice & Sentencing Reform Commission
report was released in January and the next Board meeting will include a panel of
Commission members. Chair Wolff asked what the mechanism would be for monitoring
progress on implementing the Commission’s recommendations. Director Maki answered
that it would likely be the combined responsibility of ICJIA, the Sentencing Policy
Advisory Council, and local criminal justice coordinating councils, and that he would be
seeking the input of the Board to assign state-level accountability.
Director Maki reported ICJIA also recently became responsible for coordinating the Sex
Offenses and Sex Offender Registration Task Force. He said the task force is charged
with developing a report on sex offender registration, recidivism, and risk-assessment,
and how Illinois aligns with national best practices in the treatment of people who
commit sexual crimes.
Future Meeting Dates
The 2017 SOC meeting schedule was proposed. The next meeting will be held at the end
of March. The committee then will convene every two months.

May 25, 2016 Strategic Opportunities Committee Meeting Minutes
Motion: Ms. Hora moved to approve the Minutes of the May 25, 2016, Strategic
Opportunities Committee meeting. Ms. Vollen-Katz seconded the motion and it passed
by unanimous voice vote.

Stopgap Budget Discussion
Authority Executive Director Maki said funds made available in the stopgap measure
approved by the Governor would be used to fund programs that had not been funded over
the past year. The Safe from the Start and Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Councils
programs were not funded by the stopgap bull. The Authority is disappointed that these
program were not funded as they have a rich track record. Staff are still sorting through
certain issues before sending official communication to the non-funded grantees.
Designations for most stop-gap funded programs will be presented for approval at the
August 18, 2016, Budget Committee meeting or soon thereafter.
Authority Deputy Director Kurtz said that the Adult Redeploy Illinois program was fully
funded by the stopgap bill, including funding for the prior fiscal year.

Use of Grantees as Pass-Through Entities Discussion
Authority Executive Director Maki said the Authority historically has used lead entities
to handle contracts with sub-grantees. Examples of this include funding to the Illinois
Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault, and
the CeaseFire program at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). This practice has been
in place for many years, is entirely legitimate and used by other state agencies as well,

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Strategic Opportunities Committee Meeting
July 18, 2016
Page 2

 Director Maki said. Authority staff are now reviewing our practice in the light of the
Governmental Accountability Transparency Act (GATA) and the audit of the Community
Violence Prevention Program. A recommendation based on this analysis will be made to
the committee early next year. Committee Members discussed strengths and challenges in
the use of lead entities. Strengths include cost effectiveness and subject matter expertise
while some challenges include potential conflicts of interest and the need to create more
innovation and competition.
A discussion followed on how the state’s Grant Accountability and Transparency Act,
modeled after federal grant requirements, would require grantees to pre-qualify for grant
funds and, therefore, mitigate some of the risks associated with engaging with unfamiliar
grantees. Depending on the outcome of the risk assessment, the Authority may put
additional special conditions in the grant contract. Given that the Authority has been
following the federal requirements, there will be minimal changes to our practices. Staff
will create new policies and procedures where appropriate. Chair Paula Wolff requested
that these changes and additions, along with the summary of the new policies and
processes prompted by GATA, be presented to the committee when finalized.
The committee also discussed the need to increase staff comfort with the use of data and
outcomes. Director Maki stated that the Authority strives to embody data informed and
outcome driven practices and should disseminate this understanding to other state
agencies. To that end, Associate Director Alderden has been tasked with assisting public
safety agencies to develop measurable outcomes for their respective agencies. At a future
meeting, staff could present on the various projects that work towards improved use of
data for outcome driven practices.

Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) Planning Process Discussion
Director Maki introduced Jaclyn Houston-Kolnik, Ph.D, a victimologist hired by the
Authority to manage the new Center for Victim Studies. One of her first projects is
conducting a VOCA statewide victim needs assessment.
Ms. Houston-Kolnik delivered a PowerPoint presentation entitled “VOCA Research
Plan.” The presentation focused on victimization trends and characteristics, crime
victims’ needs, and service gaps (See Attachment A). The presentation highlighted
previously employed and new methods that will access a wider range of victimized
persons which several committee members stated was very important. One important
difference from previous assessments is the collection of original data. To that end, the
consultant group, Aeffect, has begun their high level stakeholder interviews. Members
requested to know the categories of victimization. The high level stakeholder
interviewees represent the following categories: child abuse, domestic violence, elder

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Strategic Opportunities Committee Meeting
July 18, 2016
Page 3

 abuse, DUI related victimization, families of homicide victims, LGBTQ victims, legal
issues experienced by victims, sexual violence and trauma.
The stakeholder interviews will inform in depth interviews with victims, families of
victims, victim assistance providers and victim advocates. Finally, these in depth
interviews will inform an on-line victim survey that will be widely distributed and
available to all victims in English and Spanish.
In addition, committee members noted that the plan to assess victim focused funding
across the state needs to incorporate local funding sources. In response to questions from
committee members, Director Maki stated that the statewide assessment will be complete
by December and that the Authority plans to convene the Ad Hoc Victim Services
Committee first in August and then in December to review and respond to the assessment
report.
Authority staff members also updated the committee on the release of the VOCA
Transitional Housing for victims of domestic violence and human trafficking request for
proposal.

Justice Assistance Grants (JAG) Plan Staff Updates
Authority Research & Analysis Unit Associate Director Megan Alderden delivered a
PowerPoint presentation entitled “Research Plan to Inform JAG and Other Federal
Funding.” (See Attachment A). She said research would focus on drug and substance
abuse, violent crime, criminal justice system practices, and victimization. The VOCA
assessment information discussed above can be folded into this research plan, our larger
agency goals and funding directions. All feedback and information gathered will inform
our planning in an iterative manner to be responsive to the ever changing public safety
landscape.

2016 Research Priorities
• Collect, analyze, and publish data that informs the program needs in local jurisdictions as well 
as the state overall including trends pertaining to 1) crime, 2) risk factors for delinquency and 
criminality, and 3) criminal justice operations and caseloads. 
• Educate and inform citizens and stakeholders about crime and justice issues.
• Identify performance measures based on program logic models, design grantee data reports to 
capture those measures, and use data for determining program effectiveness. 
• Identify evidence‐based programs that fall within Authority funding priorities, and compile 
documentation of critical components of those program models for use by Authority Grants 
staff to determine fidelity to the model in grant application review.
• Provide specific and extensive evaluation support, including cost‐benefit analysis where 
possible, in areas where large allocations of grant funding have been made by the Authority 
including multijurisdictional drug task forces, community‐based violence prevention, 
community corrections, and problem solving courts.
• Conduct applied research studies in priority areas to guide policy, practices and guide funding 
decisions in the state of Illinois and inform policy makers, practitioners, and citizens.
• Partner with other local and state agencies and universities on identifying important topics to 
examine and conducting research and evaluation projects.

July 18, 2016, Strategic Opportunities Committee Meeting Minutes
The minutes of the July 18, 2016 Strategic Opportunities Committee Meeting were not
presented or discussed and there was no action taken due to a lack of quorum.
Lead Entity Policy Core Components
Authority Executive Director John Maki called attention to a memo entitled Questions
and Considerations for Lead Entity Policy Discussion and he delivered a PowerPoint
presentation entitled Lead Entity Policy Discussion that addressed these Core
Components:
1. Criteria for Lead Entity selection
2. Oversight of Lead Entity’s Grantmaking
3. Authority monitoring of Lead Entity’s and sub-grantees
Executive Director Maki said that the Authority has never had a defined policy regarding
the practice of issuing grants to Lead Entities, to be later subgranted out by those Lead
Entities.
Authority Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt explained the unique relationships that the
Authority has historically had with the Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence and
the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault and the Coalitions’ roles as Lead Entities.
He said that these agencies have specialized standards and expertise in their respective
fields that qualifies them to engage in subgrants with partner agencies. ICJIA staff have,
therefore, been able to oversee the administration of the grants employing the expertise of
the lead entities.

Strategic Opportunities Committee Meeting

 Executive Director Maki said that the Lead Entity arrangement can be very cost-effective
since hiring the number of staff necessary to manage these funds directly would be costprohibitive.
Core Component 1: Criteria to select Lead Entities
Primary policy question: What criteria should the Authority establish to determine
whether Lead Entities not designated by statute are necessary for, and capable of,
efficient and effective grant administration?
Executive Director Maki suggested that the first question to ask is whether or not a Lead
Entity is necessary in any given situation.
Mr. Reichgelt said that for federally funded programs potential Lead Entities submit their
policies to Authority staff for review and any agreements that the Authority enters into
with Lead Entities includes federal financial and program guidelines. There are no similar
guidelines governing state funds, although the Grant Accountability and Transparency
Act (GATA) is intended to address this.
Executive Director Maki said that sometimes Lead Entities are established by statute.
Primary policy question: What criteria should the Authority establish to determine
whether Lead Entities not designated by statute are necessary for, and capable of,
efficient and effective grant administration?
Authority Chair Elizabeth Robb said that auditors had concerns of the Authority’s
methods of the disbursal of funds via Lead Entities in the past. The audit called for Lead
Entity policy and procedure development. These policies and procedures will be applied
to all Lead Entities whether or not they are statutorily mandated.
Authority Research and Analysis Unit Director Megan Alderden said that the Authority
has recently revised its Budgeting for Results performance metrics and they will be
applied to state-appropriated funds.
Executive Director Maki said that periodic reviews of Lead Entities for effectiveness and
compliance should be built into the policies and procedures.
Core Component 2: Oversight of Lead Entity’s Grantmaking
Primary policy question: How should the Authority strengthen its oversight of Lead
Entities?

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Strategic Opportunities Committee Meeting
October 27, 2016
Page 3

 A discussion ensued regarding whether or not the use of Lead Entities creates too much
distance between their subgrantees that perform the programmatic work and the
Authority, thereby affecting its ability to provide effective oversight. Executive Director
Maki said that Lead Entities perform vital roles given that the Authority simply does not
have the resources to absorb their work. Authority Special Projects Program Advisor
Reshma Desai said that the Authority collects a lot of data from subgrantees, so it is not
as if Authority staff has no idea what the programs are achieving. Authority Program
Supervisor Ron Reichgelt said that staff regularly meets with Lead Entities such as the
Coalitions and their subgrantees; the Authority is very visible to the subgrantees.
Authority Grant Specialist Maureen Brennan said that the policy under development
should emphasize that the use of Lead Entities would be the exception, not the rule. She
said that Lead Entities such as the Coalitions have a level of clinical expertise above and
beyond the capabilities of the Authority’s grant staff, permitting them to address
program-specific issues with their subgrantees. She said that the draft policy calls for
Lead Entities to have clinical and subject-matter expertise beyond the scope of grant
monitoring; they offer something exceptional and unique.
Jennifer Vollen-Katz said that it is important to ensure that Lead Agencies perform at
consistently acceptable levels from year to year. The Authority staff needs to be able to
evaluate their administrative and substantive performance even though they have the
clinical and subject-matter expertise.
Executive Director Maki said that Authority policy should require Lead Entities should
adopt the Authority’s strategic priorities to qualify for funding.
Core Component 3: How should the Authority monitor Lead Entities’ and SubGrantees’ activity?
Primary policy question: How should the Authority monitor Lead Entities and SubGrantees activity?
Executive Director Maki said that Authority policy should define how the Authority can
monitor Lead Entities’ subgrantee performance.
Strategic Planning Work
Justice Assistance Grants (JAG) Plan Updates
Authority Research and Analysis Unit Director Megan Alderden said staff has moved
toward an iterative research process regarding two JAG – funded areas:

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Strategic Opportunities Committee Meeting
October 27, 2016
Page 4

 1. Violent crime and the implementation of informed/best practices overlaid with
Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) planning so that violent crime is addressed from a
system perspective as well as a victim perspective.
2. Substance abuse issues in the criminal justice system and the implementation of
informed/best practices.
Executive Director Maki said that a draft policy recommendations regarding JAG
matching funds requirements and program funding duration would be forthcoming.
Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) and Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Updates
Executive Director Maki described recent Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) and Violence
Against Women Act (VAWA) activity. He said that the Victim Services Ad Hoc
Committee (VSAHC) had recently met and that committee will work to help establish
spending priorities for VOCA and VAWA. Research to support the VSAHC’s plan is
under way.
Notice of Funding Opportunity / Request-for-Proposals Protocol
Executive Director Maki said that the Federal and State Grants Unit (FSGU) is working
to implement the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA). FSGU is also
working to transition the Authority to a request-for-proposals (RFP) program funding
model.
Policy Updates
Committees and Task Forces
Executive Director Maki said that:
1. The Illinois Criminal Justice and Sentencing Reform Commission will vote on
final recommendations in December.
2. The E-Discovery and Information Sharing Task Force has been working toward a
report that is due in January.
3. The Sex Offenses and Sex Offender Registration Task Force will ramp up activity
as the Criminal Justice and Sentencing Reform Commission winds down. This
task force will examine the registry and ensure that it is aligned with best
practices and manage risk appropriately.
Data-Driven Health and Justice

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Strategic Opportunities Committee Meeting

Page 5

 Executive Director Maki said that the Data-Driven Health and Justice Initiative was
promoted by The White House and it is aimed at helping local jurisdictions use datadriven approaches to reduce reliance on incarceration and strengthen health systems for
people with substance abuse and mental disorders. He said that Authority Program
Supervisor Mary Ann Dyar had led these efforts and delivered a webinar entitled the
Sequential Intercept Model that analyzes when individuals enter the criminal justice
system. This initiative will be the subject of an event in Champaign in December.
Discretionary Funding Working Group
Executive Director Maki said that the Discretionary Funding Working Group helps local
agencies access federal and private funding. Preparations are under way for the next
federal grant cycle. Last year, the group raised about $3 million.
State Programs
Authority Program Supervisor Mary Ann Dyar said that Adult Redeploy Illinois (ARI)
received stop-gap funding that allowed the Authority to pay back SFY16 program
expenses and fund the programs through SFY17. Some administrative funds will be made
available to support training and technical assistance for ARI grantees.
Other Business
None.
Public Comment
None.
