PROPOSED ORDINANCE
COOK COUNTY CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS PROGRAM
WHEREAS, since the mid 1960’s, it has been the policy of Cook County to establish and maintain an

Cook County (“County”) employees the opportunity to contribute a portion of their employment
remuneration to various charitable organizations, including those associated with social, health, and
welfare services; and
WHEREAS, through Cook County Board Resolutions 73-R-238 and 13-R-348, the Board of
Commissioners (“Board”) continued the work of the Charitable Contributions Committee (“Committee”);
and
WHEREAS, the Committee has historically identified charities that operate in Cook County and reflect
the diverse interests and concerns of Employees, for participation in the Cook County Charitable Giving
Program, pursuant to a transparent and fair selection process; and
WHEREAS, in January of 2017, the Board authorized an agreement between United Way of
Metropolitan Chicago (UWMC) and Cook County as a third-party administrator to facilitate the provision
of voluntary charitable payroll deductions from employees to selected charities identified by Cook County
and supported by UWMC through voluntary payroll deductions from such individuals’ employee
paychecks; and
WHEREAS, UWMC will continue as the County’s third-party administrator in accordance with the
January 2017 agreement or until otherwise amended or terminated in accordance with the terms of the
agreement; and
