STAFF REPORT: 7-24-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6237
ADDRESS: 332 WATSON
HISTORIC DISTRICT: BRUSH PARK
APPLICANT: MODDIE TURAY
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 5-28-2019

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

PROPOSAL
The parcel that is located at 332 Watson is an empty lot that is located at the northeast corner of the
intersection of Watson and Brush Street, at the northwest corner. A three-story, ca. 1875 brick home is
located at 311 Watson, directly to the west of the project area, while a ca. 1910, 2 1/2–story brick home
is located at 312 Watson across the street/to the south of the parcel. Empty lots are to the east and north
of 332 Watson.

With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to erect a new 6-unit
building within the project area. Specifically, the building shall be erected as per the submitted proposal
and the following description:
The new building houses three stories, rises 42’-7” in height, and will displays a rectangular
146’-9 ½” x 56’-7 ½” footprint. Despite the parcel’s address, the building’s primary elevation
faces on to Brush Street. As per the submitted site plan, the building’s side/south and front/east
elevation will push towards the limits of the lot line. A 3’-0”-wide landscape strip will serve as
a buffer between these elevations and the sidewalk. A low brick wall to the west/rear of the
building encloses a brick paver driveway that is accessed via the alley. Exterior walls will
display red brick cladding with composite wood and fiber cement panels detailing. The roof is
flat and will be topped with flat roof penthouses that will open upon rooftop patios/decks.
Single wood doors at the front/east elevation will provide primary access to the building interior
space, while overhead metal garage doors are at the rear/west elevation. Windows are fixed and
operable aluminum units.
STAFF OBSERVATIONS
Please see the attached, which outlines the manner in the applicant feels that the proposed design
conforms to the district’s Elements of Design and reflects the character of nearby extant historic-age
buildings. It is staff’s opinion that the proposed design generally conforms to the district’s historic
character in regard to materiality, height, scale and massing. However, a review of the submitted
application’s site plan revealed that the proposed new building’s setback will not be consistent with the
that of the existing historic homes on Watson Street. Specifically, the new building will display a 3’-0”
setback on Watson, while the existing historic-age homes on the 300 block of Watson generally sit back
approximately 20’-0” from the sidewalk. It is noted that the building does face on to Brush Street,
despite the lot’s current Watson Street legal address. A review of the below Sanborn Maps and aerial
which date from 1915, 1921, and ca. 1950 indicate that properties that properties that face on the
north/south streets generally did display minimal setbacks. Finally, a review of the below 2019 aerial
map indicates that the proposed setback for the new building will be consistent with buildings that face
on the district’s north/south streets.

APPLICABLE ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1) Height. Height varies in the district from one (1) to eleven (11) stories. In the area
between Woodward and Brush, the original development was almost exclusively two and
one-half (21/2) story houses. Later changes included the construction of apartment

 buildings among the houses, the majority of which are three (3) stories in height. The
tallest building, the former Detroiter Hotel, is located on Woodward Avenue in the
commercial strip. All other buildings more than four (4) stories in height are located
between Woodward and John R., and generally on or immediately adjacent to buildings
on those streets. East of Brush, the original development ranged from one (1) to two and
one-half (21/2) stories. Later redevelopment includes apartment buildings not more than
four (4) stories tall, most often located on Brush. In the case of the nineteenth century
houses located between Woodward and Brush, the two and one-half (21/2) story height
implies more height in feet than usual, since ceiling heights in these houses are unusually
high.
(2)

Proportion of building's front facade. Buildings in the district are usually taller than wide;
horizontal proportions exist only in incompatible later buildings, except for row house
buildings.

(3)

Proportion of openings within the facade. Areas of void generally constitute between
fifteen (15) percent and thirty-five (35) percent of the total facade area, excluding roof.
Proportions of the openings themselves are generally taller than wide; in some cases,
vertically proportioned units are combined to fill an opening wider than tall.

(4)

Rhythm of solids to voids in front facade. Victorian structures in the district often display
great freedom in the placement of openings in the facades, although older examples are
generally more regular in such placement than later examples. In later apartments,
openings tend to be very regular.

(5)

Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The area between Woodward and Brush
appears to have been developed in a very regular spacing, with fifty (50) foot lots. This
regularity has been disrupted by the demolition of many of the houses, and the vacant
land resulting, as well as the occasional combination of lots for larger structures,
particularly close to Woodward. East of Brush, smaller lots were used in subdividing,
but many buildings stand on more land than one lot, and the parcel sizes are now quite
irregular, as is the placement of buildings.

(6)

Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Most buildings have or had a porch or
entrance projection. The variety inherent in Victorian design precludes the establishment
of any absolute rhythm, but such projections were often centered. On Woodward, the
commercial nature of most buildings and the widening of Woodward has effectively
eliminated such projections.

(7)

Relationship of materials. By far the most prevalent material in the district is common
brick; other forms of brick, stone and wood trim are common; wood is used as a structural
material only east of Brush. Some later buildings have stucco wall surfaces. Originally,
roofs were wood or slate with an occasional example of tile; asphalt replacement roofs
are common.

 (8)

Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is the
low-relief pattern of mortar joints in brick contrasted to the smoother or rougher surfaces
of stone or wood trim. Slate, wood, or tile roofs contribute particular textural values
where they exist, especially in the case of slates or shingles of other than rectangular
shape.

(9)

Relationship of colors. Brick red predominates, both in the form of natural color brick
and in the form of painted brick. Other natural brick and stone colors are also present.
These relate to painted woodwork in various colors, and there is an occasional example
of stained woodwork. Roofs of other than asphalt are in natural colors; older slate roofs
are often laid in patterns with various colors of slate. Original color schemes for any
given building may be determined by professional analysis of the paint layers on the
building, and when so determined are always appropriate for that building.

(10)

Relationship of architectural detail. On the buildings of the Victorian period, elaborate
detail in wood, stone, or sheet metal was common; areas treated include porches, window
and door surrounds, cornices, dormers, and other areas. Later buildings are generally
simpler, but include less elaborate detail in similar areas.

(11)

Relationship of roof shapes. Examples of many roof shapes, including pitched gable
roofs, hip roofs, mansard roofs, and gambrel roofs are present. Different types are
sometimes combined in a single structure, and tower roofs, cupolas, lanterns, belvideres,
monitors, conical roofs are used on various Victorian houses. Flat roof areas in the center
of hip or mansard roofs are frequent. Later apartment and commercial buildings generally
have flat roofs not visible from the ground. The generally tall roofs add height to the
houses of the Victorian period.

(12)

Walls of continuity. Between Woodward and Brush, the houses originally honored
common setbacks which provided for front lawns. Some of the later apartments have not
been set back to the same line as the houses amongst which they were built, thus
disturbing the original line of continuity. On Woodward, the commercial development is
typically at the sidewalk, creating a wall of continuity; this is not entirely continuous due
to parking lots and some buildings set well back. On John R. and Brush, and east of
Brush, buildings are typically placed at or near the sidewalk with little or no front yard.
Where buildings are continuous, a wall of continuity is created.

(13)

Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The major
landscape feature of the district is the vacant land, which creates a feeling that buildings
are missing in the district. Some houses have more than the standard fifty (50) foot lot,
and have wide side yards. Individual houses have front lawns often subdivided by walks
leading to the entrance; lawns are exceedingly shallow or non-existent in the area between
Beaubien and Brush. Side drives are rare, access to garages or coach houses being from
the alleys. The closing of Watson and Edmund Place between John R. and Brush has
created landscaped malls uncharacteristic to the district. Some walks of stone slabs have
survived; others have been replaced in concrete. Sidewalks are characteristically close to
the curb.

 (14)

Relationship of open space to structures. There is a large quantity of open space in the
area, due to demolition of buildings. The character of this open space is haphazard as it
relates to buildings, and indicates the unplanned nature of demolitions due to decline.
The feeling created is that buildings are missing and should be present. On Watson and
Edmund between John R. and Brush, the streets have been removed and replaced with
landscaped malls. The traditional relationship of houses to street has thus become a
relationship between houses and landscaped strip open space.

(15)

Scale of facades and facade elements. In the large houses between John R. and Brush,
the scale tends to be large, and the facade elements scaled and disposed to emphasize the
large size of the houses. Towers, setbacks, porches and the like divide facades into large
elements. On Woodward, the scale ranges from very large, and emphasized by many
small window openings, as in the former Detroiter Hotel, and very large, made up of large
architectonic elements, such as the churches, down to quite small, with large windows
emphasizing the small size, as in some commercial fronts. East of Brush, the scale is
smaller and the detail less elaborate, creating a more intimate setting with the buildings
closer to the street. Later apartments are large in scale with simple but large elements
near the ground and repetitive window openings above, frequently capped by a substantial
cornice.

(16)

Directional expression of front facades. A substantial majority of the buildings in the
district have front facades vertically expressed. Exceptions are some commercial
buildings on Woodward, row houses on John R. or Brush, and some duplexes or row
houses east of Brush.

(17)

Rhythm of building setbacks. Buildings on the north-south streets generally have little or
no setback, while older houses on the east-west streets between Woodward and Brush
have some setback, which varies from street to street, though generally consistent in any
one block. Later apartments and commercial structures in that area often ignore the
previously established setback. Between Brush and Beaubien, setback is generally very
limited, only a few feet, if any, lawn space being provided between sidewalk and building.

(18)

Relationship of lot coverage. Older single family houses between Woodward and Brush
generally occupy about twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) percent of the building lot, not
including coach houses or garages. Later apartments and commercial buildings often fill
a much higher percentage of the lot, sometimes approaching or reaching complete lot
coverage. Between Brush and Beaubien, lot coverage for residential structures is
generally about forty (40) percent, with commercial and later apartment buildings again
occupying larger percentage of their lots.

(19)

Degree of complexity with the facades. The older houses in the district are generally
characterized by a high degree of complexity within the facades, with bay windows,
towers, porches, window and door hoods, elaborate cornices, and other devices used to
decorate the buildings. Newer houses in the northern end of the district and older houses
in the southern end tend to be somewhat simpler than high Victorian structures between

 them; later apartments and commercial buildings tend to more classical decorative
elements of a simpler kind.
(20)

Orientation, vistas, overviews. Houses are generally oriented to the east-west streets,
while apartments and commercial structures are more often oriented to the north-south
streets. The construction of the Fisher Freeway has created an artificial public view of
the rear yards on Winder between Woodward and Brush. The vacant land in the area,
largely the result of demolition, creates long-distance views and views of individual
buildings from unusual angles which are foreign to the character of the neighborhood as
an intensely developed urban area. Garages and coach houses are located in the rear of
residential properties, and are generally oriented to the alley.

(21)

Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. In the Victorian structures, examples of both
symmetric and asymmetric design occur; symmetry is more characteristic of the earlier
houses, while the high Victorian examples are more likely to assemble elements in a
romantic, asymmetric composition. Later houses to the north are more often symmetrical,
especially when derived from classical precedent. Asymmetrical but balanced
compositions are common. Later apartments are generally symmetrical.
General environmental character. The environmental character is of an old urban
neighborhood which has undergone, and is undergoing, considerable change. The original
development, reflected in the Victorian period houses, has been altered by the provision of more
intensive residential development in the early twentieth century, the change in character of
Woodward from residential to commercial at about the same time.

(22)

RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the proposed work is generally in keeping with the district’s historic
character. Staff therefore, recommends that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness
(COA) for the proposed project because it meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation, Standard number 2). The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a
property shall be avoided and 9). New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction will
not destroy historic materials, features and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The
new work will be differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the historic materials,
features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its
environment.
However, staff recommends that the above-referenced COA be issued with the following conditions:
• HDC staff shall be afforded the opportunity to review and approve the final construction
drawings and for the project prior to the issuance of the permit
• HDC staff shall be afforded the opportunity to review and approve any minor revisions to the
approved plan. If staff determines that proposed revision does not conform to the Secretary of
the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and/or the Elements of Design, they shall forward
the application to the Commission for review at a monthly meeting.

Relationship of roof shapes
The townhomes are designed with a flat roof line. The flat tops are given a decent height and are capped in
either a double soldier coursing or spandrel panel. This creates a visually strong building top that is
reminiscent of the corniced flat roof historic homes, specifically 3402 Brush Street. Penthouses are set well

the historic Brush Park District but is also of an added value to the District, and is relevant to today’s time in
technology, material, sensibility and use. The massing and the urban planning of Brush 8 reminisces the
