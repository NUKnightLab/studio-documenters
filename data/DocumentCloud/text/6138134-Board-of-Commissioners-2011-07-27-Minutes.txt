Child Support Compliance a Condition of Continued Employment and Offers of
Employment

9

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
(a)
The County Comptroller shall review the records of the appropriate child support
enforcement agent of the State of Illinois IV-D Child Support Enforcement Program (the "IV-D Agent")
to determine whether any employee has delinquent child support. The review may occur electronically,
and must be performed not less than monthly. If the Comptroller determines that the name and/or address
or other pertinent individual data of any County employee appear within the records of the child support
enforcement agent, and is indicated therein as delinquent or in arrears, the Comptroller shall notify the
appropriate child support enforcement agent of the current employment status of that County employee.
The Comptroller shall comply with all court-ordered wage garnishments pertaining to sums due and owed
by employees of the County for child support.
(b)
Every person who is given an offer of employment with the County shall file an affidavit
with the Bureau of Human Resources disclosing any unpaid court-ordered child support obligations owed
by the applicant, and including the court number of their child support case and the county and state in
which the child support case is pending.
(c)
Where an applicant’s affidavit discloses, or the department of human resources otherwise
determines, that an applicant owes any unpaid court- ordered child support, such applicant shall only be
hired by the County on the condition that he or she establishes one of the following within six months of
the start of employment:
(1)
the applicant has paid to the obligee all child support due under the court order, as
evidenced by a certified court order or official clerk’s record that no support is due and owing; or
(2)
the applicant has entered into a court- approved agreement for the payment of all child
support owed and is in compliance with that agreement; or
(3)
the applicant is not an obligor under a court-ordered child support obligation. Failure to
establish one of the above criteria within six months of the start of employment shall be grounds for
discharge.
(d)
In addition, all new and existing County employees must take all steps within their power
to ensure that an income withholding notice for any current, ongoing child support obligation has been
served upon the County, and amounts are being deducted from their salary or wages in compliance
therewith.
(e)
All County employees must comply with all court-ordered child support obligations as a
condition of employment. Noncompliance shall be grounds for discipline.
(f)
The Bureau of Human Resources is authorized to treat administrative child support orders
in the same manner as it does court-ordered child support obligations under this section and to promulgate
rules and regulations to govern the treatment of such administrative orders. As used herein,
“administrative child support orders” are orders or findings by the Illinois Department of Public Aid (or
any other state agency authorized by statute to so act in its stead), pursuant to Article X of the Illinois
Public Aid Code, 305 ILCS 5/10-1 to 1-022, or any similar statute, imposing child support payment
obligations.
(g)

The Bureau of Human Resources is further authorized to do the following:

(1)

investigate the child support payment records of employees and applicants to determine
compliance with court-ordered child support obligations;

10

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
(2)

provide information on employees and applicants to the appropriate Cook County, City
of Chicago, and State of Illinois governmental entities, to the extent allowed by law, to
assist those offices in enforcement of child support obligations;

(3)

provide the names and business addresses of employees to persons seeking to enforce
court-ordered child support orders and child support withholding notices, and their legal
representatives, to the extent allowed by law, on the condition that such information be
used solely for the purpose of assisting in child support enforcement; provided that the
names and identifying information of persons seeking to enforce child support orders
shall be deemed confidential; and

(4)

promulgate regulations relating to the operation of this section.

immediate consideration.
Commissioners present and voting on a motion to approve a committee report retain the right to
divide their vote with regard to each item contained in the second section of the report, or to request a
separate vote, either by voice or roll call, on such items, regardless of whether the first section has been

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by
JESUS G. GARCIA, County Commissioner
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
POLICY FOR RESPONDING TO ICE DETAINERS
WHEREAS, Cook County is a “Fair and Equal County for Immigrants,” as defined in 07-R-240; and
WHEREAS, there is ongoing confusion regarding the proper boundaries of the relationship between
local law enforcement and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”); and
WHEREAS, this is especially true in the context of ICE detainers, which are issued pursuant to 8 USC §
1226 or 8 USC § 1357(d), and used by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to advise local law
enforcement agencies that DHS seeks custody of an individual presently in the custody of that agency;
and
WHEREAS, 8 CFR § 287.7 expressly provides that ICE detainers are merely “requests” that local law
enforcement advise DHS when the individual is due to be released, and that the agency continue holding
the individual beyond the scheduled time of release for up to 48 hours, excluding weekends and federal
holidays, in order for ICE to arrange to assume custody; and
WHEREAS, due to troubling inconsistencies in ICE policies, many local law enforcement agencies
erroneously believe ICE detainers are mandatory and that local law enforcement agencies are legally
required to comply; and
WHEREAS, ICE detainers are generally issued before a finding of probable cause that an individual is
deportable, and have even been imposed on U.S. Citizens by mistake; and
WHEREAS, ICE detainers are routinely imposed on individuals, including minors, without any criminal
convictions or whose cases are dismissed, but the federal government only reimburses part of the costs
associated with ICE detainers imposed on undocumented individuals who are convicted of a felony or
two misdemeanors and detained for four or more consecutive days if there is a written agreement with the
State or local subdivision of a State, pursuant to 8 USC § 1231(i); and

26

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
WHEREAS, ICE will not indemnify local agencies for costs or liability incurred as a result of wrongful
detainers; and
WHEREAS, it costs Cook County approximately $43,000 per day to hold individuals “believed to be
undocumented” pursuant to ICE detainers, and Cook County can no longer afford to expend taxpayer
funds to incarcerate individuals who are otherwise entitled to their freedom; and
WHEREAS, the enforcement of immigration laws is a responsibility of the federal government; and
WHEREAS, ICE detainers encourage racial profiling and harassment; and
WHEREAS, having local law enforcement participate in the enforcement of ICE detainers places a great
strain on our communities by eroding the public trust that local law enforcement depends on to secure the
accurate reporting of criminal activity and to prevent and solve crimes; and
WHEREAS, by means of this ordinance, Cook County joins states, cities, and counties across the nation
that are informed about the discretionary nature of ICE detainers and refuse to enforce them, except in
situations where federal reimbursement may be available.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter
46 Law Enforcement, Section 46-37 of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
Sec. 46-37. Policy for responding to ICE detainers.
(a)
No individual shall be asked about his/her place of birth, country of origin, citizenship, or
immigration status upon admission or booking to the Cook County Department of Corrections or Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center.
(b)
Local law enforcement shall not facilitate or allow any telephone communication
between an individual and any ICE official without a court order requiring it.
(c)
Any individual who has bondable charges upon admission shall be allowed to post bond
to secure his/her release.
(d)
Local law enforcement shall not comply with ICE detainers unless the following
conditions are met:
(1)

The individual who is the subject of an ICE detainer has been convicted of at least one
felony or two misdemeanors, excluding sealed or expunged criminal records, by the
scheduled time of release; and

(2)

There is a written agreement with the State or local subdivision of a State, pursuant to 8
USC § 1231(i), by which all costs incurred by Cook County in complying with the ICE
detainer shall be reimbursed.

(e)
If the conditions for compliance provided in subsection (d) above are met, then the
individual shall be provided with a copy of ICE Form I-247 and ICE officers will be given up to 48 hours,
excluding weekends and federal holidays, from the time the individual would otherwise be entitled to
release to pick him/her up. If the individual is not picked up by ICE within the 48 hour period, he/she
shall be released.

27

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
(f)
Unless ICE agents have a criminal warrant, they shall not be given access to individuals
or allowed to use County facilities for investigative interviews or other purposes, and County personnel
shall not expend their time responding to ICE inquiries or communicating with ICE regarding
individuals’ incarceration status or release dates.
(g)
There being no legal authority upon which the federal government may compel an
expenditure of County resources to comply with an ICE detainer issued pursuant to 8 USC § 1226 or 8
USC § 1357(d), there shall be no expenditure of any County resources or effort by County personnel for
this purpose, except as expressly provided herein.
(h)
Any person who alleges a violation of this policy may file a written complaint for
investigation with the Independent Inspector General of Cook County.
Effective Date: This Ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
EXPENDITURE REPORT FOR ALL ELECTED OFFICIALS
WHEREAS, like other local and state governments Cook County has been experiencing a budget crisis
for the last several years; and
WHEREAS, as the unit of government responsible for the County’s overall budget it is incumbent upon
the Cook County Board of Commissioners to closely monitor spending throughout the current fiscal year;
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Comptroller currently tracks all spending, including that of all elected
officials and departments, within the County thru the Quarterly Appropriation Trial Balance; and
WHEREAS, in an effort to streamline the information the Comptroller is directed to prepare a separate
report detailing the spending of all County elected officials on a mid-year and year-end basis, and said
reports will have no fiscal impact as the information is already tracked by the Comptroller.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that an expenditure report for elected officials shall be
distributed twice a year encompassing expenditures from December 1st to June 30th and July 1st thru
November 30th; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the expenditure report be distributed no more than 30 days after
the end of the reporting period.

REQUIRING ALL UNITS OF GOVERNMENT IN ILLINOIS TO POST THE WAGES AND

WHEREAS, the State of Illinois has the greatest number of governmental bodies in the nation at nearly
7,000 units of government; and
WHEREAS, it is the responsibility of government to be committed to the highest standards of integrity,
honesty, efficiency and accountability among its officials and employees; and
WHEREAS, it is of tantamount importance that the taxpayers of every unit of government trust that their
officials and employees are at all times working in the best interests of their constituents; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board has passed several “sunshine” measures to work toward a more
open and honest government, including greater disclosure requirements in hiring, posting of employee
wages online and placing the county “check register” online; and
WHEREAS, in fostering greater accountability of the officials charged with the responsibility of
watching over the taxpayers’ best interests, every taxing body in the State of Illinois should be

A RESOLUTION CALLING ON CONGRESS TO FULLY FUND THE
FEDERAL HIGH-SPEED RAIL PROGRAM IN THE 2012 BUDGET
WHEREAS, the Upper Midwest region of the United States is one of the world's largest and most
dynamic economies, but struggles to compete in the global market; and
WHEREAS, the Upper Midwest offers a diverse base of manufacturing, agriculture, academic and
government research, and business services that are often too distant from our cities and from one another
for effective business development and sharing of intellectual capital; and
WHEREAS, the Upper Midwest represents roughly one-third of the population of the United States but
job growth in the region lags behind other regions of the world; and
WHEREAS, our reliance on oil-fueled airplanes and automobiles for intercity travel hurts the Midwest
economy, especially with the rising price of oil; and
WHEREAS, fast, convenient and affordable travel is needed to facilitate a strong and vibrant economy;
and
WHEREAS, an integrated network of 220-mph bullet trains and 90-110 mph regional trains linking cities
and towns across the Midwest would transform the way we travel and do business by making travel more
affordable and better connecting our business, manufacturing, agricultural, and research and development
centers; and
WHEREAS, high-speed trains would strengthen our economy, drive productivity in the region’s existing
commercial arenas, encourage job growth, and help foster potential for business investment,
entrepreneurship, technology development and advanced manufacturing; and
WHEREAS, the investment in a high-speed train network would lower our consumption of foreign oil,
saving nearly 130 million gallons of gasoline a year while dramatically reducing carbon dioxide
emissions into the environment; and
WHEREAS, the construction of a high-speed network would create nearly 300,000 high-quality
construction, engineering and manufacturing jobs; and
WHEREAS, for example, a high-speed train between Minneapolis-St. Paul and Chicago would make the
408 mile trip in 2 hours, 40 minutes with hourly departures each way and a Chicago to New York high-

37

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
speed rail line with branches to Detroit and Washington, DC would potentially serve 60.4 million people
along the 1,075 mile route including 9.7 million people in the Chicago metropolitan area and would take
approximately five hours – the same time it takes to currently travel by air; and
WHEREAS, President Barack Obama has proposed an authorization of $53 billion over the next 6 years
for high-speed and inter-city passenger rail development as part of the Administration’s surface
transportation reauthorization proposal outline in its February budget; and
WHEREAS, President Barack Obama has proposed $8 billion be appropriated in the 2012 budget in
order to accelerate the development of a high-speed rail network and its subsequent benefits; and
WHEREAS, Congress did not fund any part of the high-speed rail program in the FY2011 Continuing
Resolution.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners fully support an integrated network of high-speed trains and expanded Amtrak service as
a key to economic development, job creation, fuel consumption reduction, and massive reduction of
carbon dioxide emissions into the environment; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook County call
on Congress to:
1. Include a program to develop an integrated network of high-speed trains and expanded Amtrak
service in the upcoming federal transportation authorization legislation; and
2. Fully fund the federal high-speed rail program in the 2012 budget; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County
tender copies of this Resolution to President Obama, Vice-President Biden, and the members of the
United States Congress.

STATE’S ATTORNEY, Anita Alvarez, submitting communication advising the County of an
Order of Court for payment to the Transitional Administrator in the matter of Jimmy Doe v.
County of Cook, USDC No. 99-C-3945. This class action litigation was originally brought in
1999 and has subsequently involved the entry of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
between the parties that was approved by the District Court in December 2002 and the entry
of an Agreed Supplemental Order approved by the Court on May 18, 2006. This petition was
resolved by the entry of an Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator (TA) by
the District Court on August 14, 2007. The Board of Commissioners agreed to the entry of
the subject order during its meeting of July 31, 2007.
On June 18, 2008, the District Court entered an order amending this portion of the TA Order
permitting the Transitional Administrator to maintain the OTA funds in a separate account to
pay reasonable costs and expenses of the staff of the OTA. The OTA account was first
funded at $800,000.00 on July 22, 2008 and the District Court entered an order for additional
funds of $500,000.00 respectively on December 18, 2008, April 14, 2009, June 30, 2009,
November 17, 2009, April 7, 2010, August 3, 2010, November 23, 2010 and March 29, 2011.
The Transitional Administrator has now presented invoice payment records evidencing
payments and a balance in the account as of June 23, 2011 in the amount of $106,338.72
which has been reviewed and accepted by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office. The
TA has requested the District Court to enter an order providing for an additional
disbursement of $500,000.00 into the OTA account which was approved by the Court on
June 30, 2011.
Upon approval, the Cook County Comptroller will transfer $500,000.00 from the SelfInsurance Fund to an account managed by the Transitional Administrator account in
accordance with the terms of the aforementioned court order. From July 22, 2008 to date,
inclusive of this court order, $5,300,000.00 has been transferred from the Self-Insurance fund
to the Office of the Transitional Administrator (See Comm. No. 312229).

that minority and women's businesses are provided full and equal opportunity to participate in Contracts.

The Supreme Court of the United States in City of Richmond v. Croson, 488 U.S. 469
(1989), has enunciated certain standards which are necessary to maintain effective affirmative action
programs in compliance with constitutional requirements.
(c) The County is committed to implementing its affirmative action program in conformance with
the United States Supreme Court's decision in City of Richmond v. Croson.
(d)
In furtherance of this commitment, and at the direction of the Board, County staff and
consultants conducted an investigation into the scope of any discrimination in County Procurements, and
in the award of and participation in contracts in the metropolitan Chicago economy, the extent to which
such discrimination or the effects thereof has denied and continues to deny minority and women's
business enterprises equal opportunity to participate in Procurements and to recommend the appropriate
affirmative action steps to be taken to eliminate any such discrimination and its continuing effects.
(e)
Minority and women's businesses continue to be awarded prime contracts and
subcontracts in dollar amounts that are disproportionately lower than the availability of such businesses
willing and able to perform Contracts.

133

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
(f)
The County's procurement practices in the past have contributed to the above identified
underutilization of minority and women's businesses on Contracts.
(g)
Minority and women's businesses continue to be disadvantaged by discriminatory
practices in the local construction industry and economy when competing for Contracts and in seeking
subcontracting opportunities on such Contracts.
(h)
The County was a passive participant in the discriminatory practices of businesses which
discriminate against minority and women's businesses by entering into contracts with such businesses.
(i)
Despite its good faith efforts and implementation of previous affirmative action
programs, minority and women's businesses remain at a competitive disadvantage in competing for
Contracts and subcontracts.
(j)
Race and gender neutral measures or affirmative action programs without numerical
goals have not and are not likely to eliminate the competitive disadvantage of minority and women's
businesses in participating in Contracts due to discrimination in the local economy.
(k)
The numerical goals for the participation of minority and women's businesses in
Contracts are commensurate with the availability of minority and women's businesses willing and able to
perform County work.
Sec. 34-262.

Policy and purpose.

Based on the foregoing findings, the policy and purpose of this division are as follows:

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
(b)
Using Agencies shall cooperate with the CCD in the administration of the
Program, specifically including assisting the CCD with setting Contract Specific Goals and
assisting in the identification of available MBEs and WBEs.
Sec. 34-266.

Contract Compliance Committee.

The Contract Compliance Committee ("CCC") shall be a Standing Committee of the Board,
consisting of seven members of the Board selected as set forth in Chapter 2, Article III, Section 2-105 of
the Code. The CCC shall review procedures, proposed modifications to the Program or this division 8,
and complaints as referred by the CCD or the CPO.
Sec. 34-267.

Program goals.

(a)
The County aspires to the following annual Program Goals: A goal of twenty-five percent
(25%) of the annual total dollar amount of Contracts other than Public Works Contracts to MBEs, and ten
percent (10%) of the total dollar amount of such Contracts to WBEs.
(b)
The CCD, in consultation with the CPO and the Using Agency shall establish Contract
Specific Goals for each Contract. In establishing a Contract Specific Goal, the CCD shall consider the
availability of sufficient Certified MBEs and WBEs for the supplies, materials and equipment or services
required as part of the Procurement.
(c)
No goal shall be treated as a quota nor shall it be used to discriminate against any Person
on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion or sex.
Sec. 34-268.

Certification

The CCD shall Certify only Persons that meet all the following criteria:
(a)
The Person must be either an MBE or a WBE, or must establish that such Person has
individually suffered bias such that his or her opportunities to form and operate a successful business have
been substantially diminished because of race, ethnicity, culture or disability. (b) The Person must be
either an individual who is Socially and Economically Disadvantaged or 51 % Owned by one or more
individuals who are Socially and Economically Disadvantaged.
(1)

The Ownership by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Person must be real,
substantial, and continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of the Person as reflected
in Ownership documents.

(2)

The contributions to acquire the Ownership interest must be real and substantial. If
Expertise is part of the contribution, the Expertise must be of the requisite quality
generally recognized in a specialized field, necessary to the Person’s potential success,
specific to the type of work the Person performs and documented in the Person’s records.

(b)
The Person must be managed and Controlled by one or more Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged individual.
(1)

There must not be any formal or informal restrictions that limit the customary discretion
of the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s). There can be no
restrictions through corporate charter provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any
other formal or informal devices that prevent the Socially and Economically

139

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
Disadvantaged individual(s), without the cooperation or vote of any non-Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged individuals, from making any business decision of the
Person, including the making of obligations or the dispersing of funds.
(2)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must possess the power to
direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Person and to make
day-to-day as well as long-term decisions on management, policy, operations and work.

(3)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) may delegate various areas
of the management or daily operations of the Person to individuals are not Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged. Such delegations of authority must be revocable, and the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must retain the power to hire and
fire any such Person. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must
actually exercise control over the Person’s operations, work, management and policy.

(4)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must have an overall
understanding of, and managerial and technical competence, experience and Expertise,
directly related to the Person’s operations and work. The Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged individual(s) must have the ability to intelligently and critically evaluate
information presented by other participants in the Person’s activities and to make
independent decisions concerning the Person’s daily operations, work, management, and
policymaking.

(5)

If federal, state or local laws, regulations or statutes require a particular license or other
credential to own or Control a certain type of Person, then the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged individual(s) must possess the required license or credential.

(6)

A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside
employment or other business interests that conflict with the management of the Person
or prevent the owner from devoting sufficient time and attention to manage and Control
the Person’s day to day activities.

(c)
Only an independent Person may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An independent Person
is one whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another Person. Recognition of an
applicant as a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that
a Person is independent. In determining whether an applicant is an independent business, the CCD will:
(1)

Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Persons in such areas as personnel, facilities,
equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.

(2)

Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified
Persons associated with non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's independence.

(3)

Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Persons to determine whether a
pattern of exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Persons compromises the
applicant's independence.

(4)

Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified
Persons with normal industry practice.

140

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
(d)
The Person shall be Certified only for specific supplies, equipment, goods or services, or
for types of work in which the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and
Expertise to manage and Control the Person’s operations and work.
(e)
In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the CCD by rule may accept formal
certifications by other entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if the CCD determines that the
certification standards of such entities are comparable to those set forth herein.
(f)
The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the
Office of Contract Compliance. Failure of the Person to seek recertification by filing the necessary
documentation with the CCD as provided by rule may result in decertification.
(g)
It is the responsibility of the Certified PCE to notify the CCD of any change in its
circumstances affecting its continued eligibility for the Program. Failure to do so may result in the PCE’s
decertification.
(h)

The CCD shall decertify a PCE that does not continuously meet the eligibility criteria.

(i)
Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by
the County. The challenged PCE shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be
maintained.
(j)
A Person that has been denied certification or recertification or has been decertified may
protest the denial or decertification as provided by rule.
(k)
A Person found to be ineligible may not apply for certification for six (6) months after the
effective date of the final decision.
(l)
A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for Certification or a Certified
PCE pursuant to procedures established by the CCD. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the
individual challenging the eligibility of an applicant for Certification or a Certified PCE. The burden of
proof shall rest with the complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The
CCD shall be the final arbiter of all challenges. The presumption that the challenged PCE is eligible shall
remain in effect until the CCD renders a final decision.
Sec. 34-269.

Utilization plan; commercially useful function.

(a)
Utilization Plan required. The CPO shall include in Contract Documents for Contracts
covered by this Division, a requirement that a Utilization Plan be submitted which either: (i) commits to
PCE participation equal to or greater than the applicable Program Goals or Contract Specific Goals, or (ii)
requests a waiver of all or a portion of a Program Goal or Contract Specific Goal. The Utilization Plan
shall be in such form and contain such information as is required by the CCD. Failure to include a
Utilization Plan will render the submission not Responsive. The CCD shall review and either approve or
reject the Utilization Plan. For purposes of evaluation a Utilization Plan, only PCEs which perform a
Commercially Useful Function shall be considered.
(b)
Commercially Useful Function. To be considered in meeting Goals, a PCE must perform
a Commercially Useful Function, as determined pursuant to this subsection 34-269(b). “Commercially
Useful Function” means the performance of a distinct element of work required for the Procurement, with
the requisite skill and Expertise.

141

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
(1)

In the case of a Procurement of goods or equipment, ordering from a manufacturer or
distributor for delivery directly to the Using Agency is not a Commercially Useful
Function; provided, however, that to the extent such practice is consistent with normal
industry practices, a PCE subcontractor may enter into second tier subcontracts.
However, if a PCE Contractor or subcontractor subcontracts a significantly greater
portion of the work of the Contract than would be expected on the basis of normal
industry practices, the PCE shall be presumed not to be performing a Commercially
Useful Function.

(2)

In the case of a Procurement of services, a Person which subcontracts with another
Person to perform the services required does not perform a Commercially Useful
Function unless such Person also performs significant supervisory or management
responsibilities. A Broker does not fulfill a Commercially Useful Function. In the case of
a Joint Venture partner, each Joint Venture partner must perform a Commercially Useful
Function.

(c)
PCE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an
extra participant in the Contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of PCE
participation.
(d)
When a PCE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the
Certified PCE and the Person seeking to include that PCE in its Utilization Plan, may present evidence to
rebut this presumption.
(e)
Once a Utilization Plan has been approved, the Contractor cannot make changes to the
Utilization Plan, including substituting PCEs named in the Utilization Plan, without the prior written
approval of the CCD, CPO and the Using Agency. The CCD shall promulgate procedures for changes to
the Utilization Plan.
Sec. 34-270.

Methods to Achieve Goals and Compliance.

A Person may achieve the applicable Contract Specific Goals in any one or more of the methods
set forth below. The same PCE, whether as a contractor, subcontractor or supplier, cannot be utilized as
both a MBE and a WBE on the same Contract.
(1)

PCE as prime Contractor. An MBE or WBE may count its own participation toward the
achievement of the applicable MBE or WBE goal. Such PCE will be required to meet the
other goals by another method described herein. If a WBE is also a MBE, such WBE’s
participation may count toward either the MBE or WBE Goal but not both.

(2)

Joint Venture with one or more PCE. Where a Person engages in a Joint Venture with
one or more PCEs, the Utilization Plan shall include a written agreement at least the
information set forth in subsection 34-384 (ii) 1 through 4 below. The CCD shall
consider the following in determining whether the proposed Utilization Plan satisfies the
Program Goals based upon such written Joint Venture agreement and the Utilization
Plan.
a.

Each Joint Venture partner’s initial capital investment;

b.

The extent to which the PCE’s proposed participation in the performance of the
Contract constitutes a Commercially Useful Function;

142

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011

(3)

Sec. 34-271.

c.

Whether the PCE’s share in the risks and profits of the Joint Venture is
proportional to their ownership interest;

d.

Whether the PCE will have duties, responsibilities, management Control and risk
with respect to the Joint Venture in proportion to its ownership interest;

Subcontracting. A Person may achieve the Contract Specific Goals by means of
subcontracting with, or purchasing from one or more PCEs.
Request for a total or partial waiver; Good Faith Efforts.

(a)
In reviewing a partial or total request for waiver of a Goal, the CCD shall determine
whether a Person has made good faith efforts to meet the applicable Goals and to what extent the waiver
request should be granted. In determining whether a Person has made Good faith efforts, the CCD will
consider whether the Person has taken the following actions:
(1)

Review lists of PCEs maintained by the County and other State and local governments
and agencies to identify qualified PCEs for solicitation for Bids;

(2)

Divide Procurement requirements into small tasks or quantities. This shall include, where
appropriate, breaking out Contract work items into economically feasible units, consistent
with the availability of PCEs, to facilitate PCE participation, even when the Contractor
would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces.

(3)

Adjust any insurance requirements imposed by the Person seeking PCEs, or otherwise
assist PCEs in obtaining any required insurance, where economically feasible, to
encourage participation by PCEs;

(4)

Make timely attempts to contact PCEs providing the type of supplies, equipment, goods
or services required for the Procurement; and provide them with a convenient and timely
opportunity to obtain and review all information concerning the Procurement necessary
to enable such PCE to respond;

(5)

Follow up initial contacts of PCEs to determine if they are interested participating in the
Procurement;

(6)

Negotiate in good faith and on a timely basis with PCEs to enable them to participate in
the Procurement. Evidence of such negotiation includes the names, addresses, and
telephone numbers of PCEs that were contacted; a description of the information
provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting;
and why agreements could not be reached. The Contractor may not reject PCEs as being
unqualified without sound reasons. That there may be some additional costs involved in
finding and using PCEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet
the Goals, as long as such costs are reasonable.

(7)

Make efforts to assist interested PCEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies,
materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate; provided, however, that
such efforts shall not be inconsistent with the requirement that the PCE be responsible for
actually obtaining and paying for such items.

143

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
(8)

Establish delivery schedules which will encourage participation by PCEs, where the
requirements of the Procurement permit;

(9)

Use the services and assistance of the CCD’s staff, the Small Business Administration,
the Office of Minority Business Enterprises of the U.S. Department of Commerce;

(10)

Timely notify appropriate community and minority and women's business organizations
identified as assist agencies of the opportunity for participation in the Procurement;

(11)

Demonstrate to the CCD that no PCE exists with which a mentor/protégé relationship
could be established, as described in Section 34-271.

(b)
In determining whether a Bidder or Respondent has made Good Faith Efforts, the levels
of participation by PCEs set forth in Utilization Plans submitted by other Persons for the same
Procurement may be considered. For example, if the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent fails to
meet the Contract Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average PCE participation obtained by other
Bidders or Respondents, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent made
Good Faith Efforts.
(c)
Where the County requires professional services, the County must be able to call upon
those professionals whose particular training and experience are most beneficial to the County.
(1)

The County sets an annual "best efforts" goal of 35 percent PCE participation for the total
professional services and consulting services utilized by the County.

(2)

A Utilization Plan shall be required, and if a waiver or partial waiver is requested, “good
faith” efforts shall be demonstrated as set forth in Section 34-271; provided, however,
that such Persons shall not be required to attempt to subcontract with PCEs if subcontractors would not typically be utilized for the type of Procurement. In such cases, the
Person shall document the reasons for not sub-contracting in a waiver request.

(3)

The Contractor will endeavor to maximize use of PCEs for supplies, equipment, goods or
services for such Contractor’s business operations not specifically for the Procurement.

(4)

If such Persons is required to have or has an affirmative action plan and goals, such plan
and goals shall be submitted with their Utilization Plan. The CCD shall compare such
plan and goals with the Person’s actual affirmative action achievements and such
achievements may be considered by the County in future Procurements.

(d)
Mentor/protege agreements. Where a Contractor enters into mentor/protege agreement
with a PCE to improve or develop certain aspects of the business of the PCE, the CCD shall evaluate the
effect of such agreement as a factor in determining good faith efforts. The mentor/protege agreement may
provide for the Contractor to assist the PCE in such areas as technical aspects of the PCE’s business,
improving financial management, or providing on-the-job training. To constitute good faith efforts, the
mentor/protégé agreement shall satisfy the following requirements.
(1)

The PCE performs a Commercially Useful Function;

(2)

The agreement shall be included in the Utilization Plan; and

144

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
(3)

The agreement clearly defines the respective responsibilities of the Contractor and the
PCE and includes specific, measurable goals to be attained by both parties through the
performance of the agreement. In order to be a factor in establishing best efforts, the
mentor/protégé agreement must be for a reasonable period of time.

(e)

The CCD may grant a total or partial waiver based upon the following criteria:

(1)

There are not sufficient PCEs capable of providing the supplies, equipment, goods or
services required for the Procurement;

(2)

The Procurement cannot reasonably be divided;

(3)

The price required by potential PCEs is more than ten percent above competitive levels;
and

(4)

Any other factor relating to good faith efforts as set forth in the Person’s Utilization Plan.

Sec. 34-272.

Calculating PCE participation.

In calculating a PCE’s participation, only dollar amounts commensurate with a PCE’s
performance of a Commercially Useful Function may be counted.
(a)
The dollar value of that portion of a Procurement that is performed by the PCEs’ own
forces shall be counted, including the cost of supplies, materials and equipment furnished by the PCE for
the Procurement, whether purchased or leased (except to the extent purchased or leased from the
Contractor or the Contractor's Affiliate).
(b)
The dollar amount of fees or commissions charged by a PCE for providing a bona fide
service, such as professional, technical, consultant, managerial, insurance brokerage or surety services,
shall be counted, provided the fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily
charged for similar services.
(c)
When a PCE is a Joint Venture partner, only the dollar value of the distinct, clearly
defined work performed by the PCE with its own forces, shall be counted.
(d)

Only the dollar value must be commensurate with the work the PCE actually performs.

(e)
One hundred percent (100%) of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained
from a PCE Manufacturer or Regular Dealer shall be counted.
(f)
One hundred percent of the fees or transportation charges for the delivery of supplies,
equipment, materials or goods shall be counted only if the payment of such fees is a customary industry
practice and such fees are commensurate with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(g)
If a PCE ceases to be Certified during its performance on a Procurement, the dollar value
of work performed under a Contract with that Person after it has ceased to be Certified shall not be
counted.
(h)
of a PCE.

Only the dollar amount actually paid to the PCE shall be counted toward the participation

145

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
Sec. 34-273.

Review of contract performance.

(a)
Compliance with Utilization Plan. The CCD shall review the Contractor's compliance
with its Utilization Plan as necessary during the performance of the Contract. The CCD may establish
such requirements for periodic Contractor reporting on compliance with its Utilization Plan as the CCD
determines appropriate and necessary. A Contractor shall be required to provide any additional requested
compliance documentation within 14 days of request by the CCD.
(1)

If the CCD determines that the Contractor has failed to comply with its Utilization Plan,
the CCD shall notify the CPO of such failure. The CPO shall then send notice of default
to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall have such time to cure the default as is
provided in the Contract. If no such period is provided, the Contractor shall have ten days
to cure such default. For purposes of this Section, providing a plan for bringing the
Contract into compliance with the Utilization Plan may constitute a cure, if compliance
cannot reasonably be achieved within the applicable cure period, and if compliance is
achieved in accordance with such plan.

(2)

If a Contractor fails to provide any documentation required by the CCD, the CCD shall
notify the CPO of such failure. The CPO shall then send notice of default to the
Contractor, and the Contractor shall have such time to cure the default as is provided in
the Contract. If no such period is provided, the Contractor shall have ten days to cure
such default.

(b)
Bid and target market programs. To address more specifically the barriers to PCE
participation as prime Contractors in County work, the CCD may recommend to the CPO to institute the
following special PCE bidding provisions, following determination of the appropriateness of such
provisions.
(1)

In connection with the award of a Contract subject to competitive bidding on which a
PCE has bid and where the PCE is bidding on the item in question for the first time; and
has never successfully bid on a Cook County purchasing contract, the Contract
Compliance Director may, at the opening of the bids on the item, compare the PCEBid
with the lowest Bid, and, if the PCE's Bid is closely competitive as defined by guidelines
to be established by the Contract Compliance Director with that of lowest actual Bids,
direct the CPO to declare the PCE the successful Bidder. A PCE may use this procedure
only once to become the successful Bidder on any particular item. Thereafter, the PCE
must be totally competitive in terms of price to be the successful Bidder.

(2)

The Contract Compliance Director shall develop and coordinate a target market program
as follows:
a.

The Contract Compliance Director shall review the availability of PCEs
providing various goods and services and shall identify for inclusion in a
potential program for bidding among PCE Persons certain commodity areas with
sufficient PCE availability to ensure that the County receives a competitive price.
The Contract Compliance Director shall report his/her findings and
recommendations to the Contract Compliance Committee;

b.

Upon a determination by the CCD that such a program is advisable for any
particular commodity procurement, the Contract Compliance Director will
institute the following procedures:

146

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011

c.

Sec. 34-274.

1.

The Contract Compliance Director will notify the CPO of identification
of those commodity codes appropriate for a target market program;

2.

To the extent practicable, the CPO, with the aid of the Contract
Compliance Director, shall divide procurement in the designated
commodity areas into economically feasible sizes to facilitate Bids or
offers from PCEs and shall designate contracts to be offered under the
target market program;

3.

The CPO shall offer PCEs the opportunity to bid on such contracts in a
limited competition;

4.

All standard County rules for bidding will then become effective and,
provided that at least three PCEs Bid or make an offer on the contract,
the lowest Responsive and Responsible Bidder among the PCEs will
receive the contract;

5.

In the event less than three PCEs Bid or make an offer on the Contract or
if there is no Responsive Bid or offer received from a Responsible PCE,
the CPO shall rebid the Contract not subject to the target market
program.

Participation in the target market program shall be limited to Minority Business
Enterprises, Women's Business Enterprises and Joint Ventures consisting
exclusively of Minority Business Enterprises, Women's Business Enterprises or
both. The PCE Contractor on a target market Contract may subcontract up to 49
percent of the dollar value of the target market Contract to subcontractors who
are not Minority Business Enterprises or Women's Business Enterprises.

Prompt payment of PCEs.

If an invoice from a Contractor includes payment for supplies, equipment, goods or services
furnished by a PCE, Contractor shall pay such PCE for such supplies, equipment, goods or services
within thirty (30) days after receipt of payment from the County. The CCD shall investigate any
complaint or charge of excessive delay in payment, and shall report the results of such investigations to
the Contract Compliance Committee and to the County Comptroller. Failure of Contractor to comply with
this Section 34-388 shall constitute a material breach of the Contract.
Sec. 34-275.

Reporting and review.

The CCD shall report to the Board on an annual basis with respect to the following:
(1)

The percentage of the total dollar amount of Procurements for such year actually received
by PCEs;

(2)

The number of MBEs and WBEs available for participation in Procurements, by
category;

(3)

An evaluation of the effectiveness of this division in ensuring equitable participation by
PCEs in Procurements;

147

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011

(4)

An assessment of the continuing need for the Program;

(5)

Identification of any enforcement problems; and

(6)

Any recommendations with respect to modifying or improving the Program, including
discontinuing or modifying Program Goals in those cases where Minority Business
Enterprises and Women's Business Enterprises no longer are disadvantaged by the effects
of discrimination in their participation in Procurements.

Sec. 34-276.

Prohibited provisions.

Any agreement between a Contractor and a MBE or WBE in which the Contractor requires that
the MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
Subdivision II. Participation in Cook County Public Works Contracts
Sec. 34-285.

Short title; incorporation of provisions.

This subdivision may be known and cited as the Cook County Public Works Minority- and
Women-Owned Business Enterprise Ordinance. The provisions of the Cook County Minority- and
Women-Owned business Enterprise General Ordinance are applicable to Public Works Contracts, except
to the extent modified hereby.
Sec. 34-286.

Findings.

(a)
The findings set forth in subdivision I Section 34-261 of this division 8 are incorporated
herein by this reference.
(b)
The requirement in subdivision I that minority- and women-owned businesses (M/WBEs)
be allotted certain percentages of County construction contracts was ruled unconstitutional as applied to
construction contracts in Builders Association of Greater Chicago v. County of Cook, 256 F.3d 642 (7th
Cir. 2001). See also Builders Association of Greater Chicago v. City of Chicago, 2003 WL 1786489,
2003 U.S. Dist. Lexis 23287 (N.D. Ill. 2003).
(c)
The President and the Board of Commissioners of the County of Cook, after considering
(i) evidence presented at trial in Builders Association of Greater Chicago v. City of Chicago, 298
F.Supp.2d 725 (N.D. Ill. 2003) and Northern Contracting, Inc. v. Illinois Department of Transportation,
2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19868 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 8, 2005); (ii) County statistical evidence of continuing
discrimination against Blacks, Hispanics, Asians and women in the County's Procurements; (iii) the
Report title, "Review of Compelling Evidence of Discrimination Against Minority- and Women-Owned
Business Enterprise in the Chicago Area Construction Industry and Recommendations for Narrowly
Tailored Remedies for Cook County, Illinois;" as well as (iv) anecdotal evidence of discrimination against
minorities and women in the County's Public Works Contracts; and (v) receiving and considering written
reports, adopts the following findings as a strong basis in evidence supporting a narrowly tailored,
remedial affirmative action program in Public Works Contracts.
(d)
The County seeks to provide a level playing field and equal access for all prime
contractors and subcontractors to participate in Public Works Contracts;

148

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
(e)
The County has engaged in committee hearings in which the County has heard anecdotal
evidence of discrimination in the construction industry, has commissioned a study on the levels of PCE
participation in Public Works Contracts, has reviewed the report prepared indicating evidence of
discrimination in Public Works Contracts and has considered the evidence in relevant case law; and
(f)
In the absence of application of the Program to Public Works Contracts, the County has
witnessed a drastic decline in PCE in its Public Works Contracts, to levels below the availability of PCEs,
and thus, the County would be a passive participant in a discriminatory marketplace without the
application of PCE goals.
Sec. 34-287.

Policy.

Based on the findings set forth in subdivision I, Section 34-261 and the findings set forth in
subdivision II, Section 34-286, and in addition to the policy set forth at Section 34-262, the policy and
purpose of this subdivision is to establish and implement goals for participation of PCEs in Public Works
Contracts, in accordance with all applicable laws.
Sec. 34-288.

Program goals.

The Program Goal applicable to Public Works Contracts shall be a goal of twenty-four percent
(24%) of the annual total dollar amount of Public Works Contracts to MBEs and a goal of not less than
ten percent (10%) of the annual total dollar amount of Public Works Contracts to WBEs. In establishing a
Contract Specific Goal for Public Works Contracts, the CCD shall consider the availability of sufficient
Certified MBEs and WBEs for each trade required as part of the project.
Sec. 34.-289.

Commercially useful function.

To determine whether a PCE is performing a Commercially Useful Function, the County will
evaluate whether the portion of the work subcontracted to or by a PCE is in accordance with industry
standards. For example, if a PCE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a Contract than would be
expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful
Function. In addition, to perform a Commercially Useful Function, the PCE must be responsible, with
respect to materials, equipment and supplies used in performing its portion of the Contract, for
negotiating price, determining whether quality meets specifications, ordering the material, installing
(where applicable) and paying for the material itself.
DIVISION 9. CONTRACT MANAGEMENT
Sec. 34-300.

Contracts.

(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this Division is to ensure that Contracts in an amount of
$1,000,000.00 or more are performed in accordance with the Contract terms.
(b)

(iv) the aggregate principal amount of the Capital Project Bonds, if any, issued pursuant to this Ordinance
shall not exceed $295,000,000, provided such authorized aggregate amount of Capital Project Bonds, if
any, shall be subject to reduction to the amount necessary to pay the costs of the Capital Projects as may
be hereafter approved by the Corporate Authorities for the Capital Projects, plus capitalized interest, if
any, and costs of issuance. The Bonds shall be designated substantially as “General Obligation [Variable

All or any portion of the Bonds may be issued as Tax Exempt or not Tax Exempt or as Tax
Advantaged Bonds as the Designated Officers shall determine upon consultation with Bond Counsel and
as shall be provided in a relevant Bond Order.
All Bonds shall become due and payable as provided in the relevant Bond Order, provided,
however, that no Bond shall have a Stated Maturity which is later than the date which is thirty (30) years
after its Dated Date.
The Current Interest Bonds and the Variable Rate Bonds shall bear interest at a rate or rates
percent per annum, and any Capital Appreciation Bonds shall have Yields to Maturity, not to exceed ten

Each Current Interest Bond shall bear interest from the later of its Dated Date or the most recent

such Bond is paid, such interest (computed upon the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months)
being payable, subject to the provisions of any Bond Order, on each May 15 and November 15,
commencing on such May 15 or November 15 as determined by the Chief Financial Officer in the Bond
Order therefore.
Each Capital Appreciation Bond shall bear interest from its Dated Date at the rate percent per
annum compounded semiannually, subject to the provisions of any Bond Order, on each May 15 and
November 15, commencing on such May 15 or November 15 as determined by the Chief Financial

set forth in the Indenture therefore. Any Variable Rate Bonds may be made subject to optional or
mandatory tender for purchase by the owners thereof at such times and at such prices (not to exceed one
hundred and three percent (103.00%) of the principal amount thereof) as shall be set forth in the Indenture
therefore. In connection with the remarketing of any Variable Rate Bonds tendered for purchase under
the terms and conditions so specified by the Chief Financial Officer, the President and the Chief Financial
Officer are each hereby authorized to execute on behalf of the County a remarketing agreement with a
remarketing agent or agents, as identified in the relevant Indenture, in customary form at customary fees
used for variable rate financings of the County with appropriate revisions to reflect the terms and
provisions of the Bonds sold as Variable Rate Bonds and such other revisions in text as the Chief
Financial Officer shall determine are necessary or desirable in connection with the sale of the Bonds as
Variable Rate Bonds.
So long as the Bonds are held in Book Entry Form, interest on each Bond shall be paid to the
Depository by check or draft or electronic funds transfer, in lawful money of the United States of
America, as may be agreed in the Representations Letter; in the event the Bonds should ever become
available in physical form to registered owners other than the Depository, interest on each Bond shall be
paid by check or draft of the Trustee, payable upon presentation thereof in lawful money of the United
States of America, or by electronic funds transfer of lawful money of the United States of America, as
may be provided, to the person in whose name such Bond is registered at the close of business on the

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
applicable Regular Record Date, and mailed to the address or transferred to such account of such
registered owner as it appears on the Bond Register or at such other address or account as may be
furnished in writing to the Trustee.

or its proper agent.
The Bonds shall have impressed or imprinted thereon the corporate seal or facsimile thereof of
the County and shall be signed by the manual or duly authorized facsimile signatures of the President and
County Clerk, as they shall determine, and in case any officer whose signature shall appear on any Bond
shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such Bond, such signature shall nevertheless be valid
and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such officer had remained in office until delivery.
All Bonds shall have thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form hereinafter
set forth duly executed by the Trustee as authenticating agent of the County and showing the date of
authentication. No Bond shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose or be entitled to any security or
benefit under this Ordinance unless and until such certificate of authentication shall have been duly
executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate of authentication upon any such Bond
shall be conclusive evidence that such Bond has been authenticated and delivered under this Ordinance.
The certificate of authentication on any Bond shall be deemed to have been executed by the Trustee if
signed by an authorized officer of the Trustee, but it shall not be necessary that the same officer sign the
certificate of authentication on all of the Bonds issued hereunder.
Sec. 4.

Book-Entry Provisions.

The Bonds shall be initially issued in the form of a separate single fully registered Bond for each
of the maturities of each Series of the Bonds. Upon initial issuance, the ownership of each such Bond
shall be registered in the Bond Register in such name as may be provided by the Depository (the “Book
Entry Owner”) and, accordingly, in Book Entry Form as provided and defined herein. Any Designated
Officer is authorized to execute a Representations Letter or to utilize the provisions of an existing
Representations Letter. Without limiting the generality of the authority given with respect to entering into
the Representations Letter for the Bonds, it may contain provisions relating to (i) payment procedures,
(ii) transfers of the Bonds or of beneficial interests therein, (iii) redemption notices and procedures unique
to the Depository, (iv) additional notices or communications, and (v) amendment from time to time to
conform with changing customs and practices with respect to securities industry transfer and payment
practices. With respect to Bonds registered in the Bond Register in the name of the Book Entry Owner,
neither the County nor the Trustee shall have any responsibility or obligation to any broker-dealer, bank,
or other financial institution for which the Depository holds Bonds from time to time as securities
depository (each such broker-dealer, bank, or other financial institution being referred to herein as a
“Depository Participant”) or to any person on behalf of whom such a Depository Participant holds an
interest in the Bonds. Without limiting the meaning of the immediately preceding sentence, neither the
County nor the Trustee shall have any responsibility or obligation with respect to (a) the accuracy of the
records of the Depository, the Book Entry Owner, or any Depository Participant with respect to any
ownership interest in the Bonds; (b) the delivery to any Depository Participant or any other person, other
than a registered owner of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register or as expressly provided in the
Representations Letter, of any notice with respect to the Bonds, including any notice of redemption; or
(c) the payment to any Depository Participant or any other person, other than a registered owner of a
Bond as shown in the Bond Register, of any amount with respect to principal of or interest on, or Maturity
Amount of, the Bonds. No person other than a registered owner of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register

164

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
shall receive a Bond certificate with respect to any Bond. In the event that (x) the County determines that
the Depository is incapable of discharging its responsibilities described herein or in the Representations
Letter, (y) the agreement among the County and the Depository evidenced by the Representations Letter
shall be terminated for any reason, or (z) the County determines that it is in the best interests of the
County or of the beneficial owners of the Bonds that they be able to obtain certificated Bonds; the County
shall notify the Depository of the availability of Bond certificates, and the Bonds shall no longer be
restricted to being registered in the Bond Register to the Book Entry Owner. The County may determine
at such time that the Bonds shall be registered in the name of and deposited with a successor depository
operating a book entry only system, as may be acceptable to the County, or such depository’s agent or
designee, but if the County does not select such successor depository, then the Bonds shall be registered
in whatever name or names registered owners of Bonds transferring or exchanging Bonds shall designate,
in accordance with the provisions hereof.
Sec. 5.

Redemption.

A.
MANDATORY REDEMPTION. If so provided in the relevant Bond Order or Indenture, any
Bonds may be issued as Term Bonds and be subject to mandatory redemption by operation of the Bond
Fund, in the case of Current Interest Bonds or Variable Rate Bonds, at a price of par, without premium,
plus accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption, and in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds at a
price of Compound Accreted Value calculated to the date fixed for redemption, on November 15 (or such
other date as may be provided in the relevant Bond Order) of the years and in the amounts and subject to
such provisions as shall be set forth in the relevant Bond Order. The County covenants that it will redeem
Term Bonds pursuant to the mandatory redemption requirement for such Term Bonds and provide
Pledged Taxes accordingly.
In connection with any mandatory redemption of Bonds as authorized above, the principal
amounts of such Bonds to be mandatorily redeemed in each year may be reduced through the earlier
optional redemption thereof, with any partial optional redemptions of such Bonds credited against future
mandatory redemption requirements in such order of the mandatory redemption dates as the Chief
Financial Officer may determine. In the absence of such determination, partial optional redemptions of
such Bonds shall be credited against future mandatory redemption requirements in inverse chronological
order of such payments beginning with the amount scheduled to become due at Stated Maturity, then the
amount subject to mandatory redemption in the year preceding Stated Maturity, and so on. In addition, on
or prior to the sixtieth (60th) day preceding any mandatory redemption date, the Trustee may, and if
directed by the Chief Financial Officer shall, purchase Bonds of such maturities in an amount not
exceeding the amount of such Bonds required to be retired on such mandatory redemption date and at a
price not exceeding par plus accrued interest. Any such Bonds so purchased shall be cancelled and the
principal amount thereof shall be credited against the payment required on such next mandatory
redemption date.
The County shall provide the Trustee with written notice of such reduction, which notice shall be
given within thirty (30) days after such redemption or purchase, and the Trustee shall promptly give
written notice of the same to the Bondholders, in the manner hereinafter provided.
B.
OPTIONAL REDEMPTION. If so provided in the relevant Bond Order or Indenture, any
Bonds may be redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the County, in whole or in part on any date, at
such times and at such optional redemption prices as shall be determined by the Chief Financial Officer at
the time of the sale thereof. Such optional redemption prices shall be expressed as (i) a percentage of the
principal amount of Current Interest Bonds or Variable Rate Bonds to be redeemed or as a percentage of
the Compound Accreted Value of Capital Appreciation Bonds to be redeemed, provided that such
percentage shall not exceed one hundred three percent (103.00%), plus, in the case of Current Interest

165

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
Bonds or Variable Rate Bonds, accrued interest to the date of redemption or (ii) a “make-whole”
redemption price or (iii) an “extraordinary” redemption price or (iv) any other redemption price as shall
then be customary and appropriate for Tax Advantaged Bonds and as shall be determined by the Chief
Financial Officer at the time of sale of such Tax Advantaged Bonds. The terms and provisions for any
“make-whole” redemption or any “extraordinary redemption” shall be confirmed by the Chief Financial
Officer on such dates and to such parties as shall be necessary to effectuate such make-whole redemption
or such extraordinary redemption. The terms and provisions for any redemption of Variable Rate Bonds
shall be as determined by the Chief Financial Officer at the time of sale of the Bonds and as set forth in a
relevant Indenture, provided that such terms shall be within the limitations set forth in this Section.
If less than all of the Outstanding Bonds of a Series are to be optionally redeemed, the Bonds to
be called shall be called from such Series, in such principal amounts and from such maturities as may be
determined by the County and within any maturity in the manner hereinafter provided.
C.
REDEMPTION PROCEDURE. The Bonds subject to redemption shall be identified, notice
given, and paid and redeemed pursuant to the procedures as follows.
1.

Redemption Notice.
For a mandatory redemption of Term Bonds, unless
otherwise notified by the County, the Trustee shall proceed to redeem the Term
Bonds without any further order or direction from the County hereunder or
otherwise. For an optional redemption, the County shall, at least forty-five (45)
days prior to any optional redemption date (unless a shorter time period shall be
satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such redemption date and of the
principal amount and maturities of Bonds to be redeemed.

2.

Selection of Bonds within a Maturity. Current Interest Bonds shall be redeemed
only in the principal amount of $5,000 each and integral multiples thereof, and
Capital Appreciation Bonds shall be redeemed only in amounts representing
$5,000 Maturity Amount and integral multiples thereof. For purposes of any
redemption of less than all of the Bonds of a single maturity, the particular Bonds
or portions of Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by lot by the Trustee for
the Bonds of such maturity by such method of lottery as the Trustee shall deem
fair and appropriate; provided, that such lottery shall provide for the selection for
redemption of Bonds or portions thereof so that each $5,000 principal amount or
Maturity Amount (as appropriate) of such Bond shall be as likely to be called for
redemption as any other such $5,000 Bond or $5,000 portion. The Trustee shall
make such selection (a) upon or prior to the time of the giving of official notice
of redemption, or (b) in the event of a refunding or defeasance, upon advice from
the County that certain Bonds have been refunded or defeased and are no longer
Outstanding as defined.
Alternatively, if so provided in the relevant Bond Order or Indenture, for
purposes of any redemption of less than all of the Bonds of a single maturity, the
particular Bonds or portions of Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by the
Trustee pro rata based upon a fraction the numerator of which is the principal
amount of Bonds to be redeemed on a given date and the denominator of which
is the aggregate principal amount of such Series of Bonds and of the given Stated
Maturity remaining unpaid immediately prior to such redemption. If the Bonds
are held in Book Entry Form at the time of such redemption, the County shall
direct the Trustee to instruct the Depository to select the specific Bonds within
such maturity for redemption pro rata among such Bonds, which redemption may

166

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
utilize the Depository’s current pro rata pass-through distribution of principal
procedure or similar or substituted procedure promulgated from time to time. If
while in Book Entry Form the Depository has no procedure for pro rata
redemption, then such partial redemption shall be accomplished by lot, as
described above. The County and the Trustee shall have no responsibility or
obligation to insure that the Depository properly selects such Bonds for
redemption.
3.

Official Notice of Redemption. The Trustee shall promptly notify the County in
writing of the Bonds or portions of Bonds selected for redemption and, in the
case of any Bond selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to
be redeemed. Unless waived by the registered owner of Bonds to be redeemed,
official notice of any such redemption shall be given by the Trustee on behalf of
the County by mailing the redemption notice by first class U.S. mail not less than
thirty (30) days and not more than sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for
redemption to each registered owner of the Bond or Bonds to be redeemed at the
address shown on the Bond Register or at such other address as is furnished in
writing by such registered owner to the Trustee. All official notices of
redemption shall include the name of the Bonds and at least the information as
follows:
(a)
the redemption date;
(b)

the redemption price, or for any optional redemption utilizing a makewhole redemption provision, a description of the formula by which the
redemption price shall be determined;

(c)

if less than all of the outstanding Bonds of a Series and of a particular
maturity are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial
redemption of Bonds of a Series within such maturity, the respective
principal amounts) of the Bonds to be redeemed;

(d)

a statement that on the redemption date the redemption price will become
due and payable upon each such Bond or portion thereof called for
redemption and that interest thereon shall cease to accrue from and after
said date; and

(e)

the place where such Bonds are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption
price, which place of payment shall be the office designated for that purpose of
the Trustee.

4.

Conditional Redemption. Unless moneys sufficient to pay the redemption price
of the Bonds to be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee prior to the
giving of such notice of redemption, such notice may, at the option of the
County, state that said redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt of such
moneys by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for redemption. If such
moneys are not received, such notice shall be of no force and effect, the County
shall not redeem such Bonds, and the Trustee shall give notice, in the same
manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such moneys were not
so received and that such Bonds will not be redeemed.

167

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
5.

Bonds Shall Become Due. Official notice of redemption having been given as
described, the Bonds or portions of Bonds so to be redeemed shall, subject to the
stated condition in paragraph 4. immediately preceding, on the redemption date,
become due and payable at the redemption price therein specified, and from and
after such date (unless the County shall default in the payment of the redemption
price) such Bonds or portions of Bonds shall cease to bear interest. Upon
surrender of such Bonds for redemption in accordance with said notice, such
Bonds shall be paid by the Trustee at the redemption price. The procedure for
the payment of interest due as part of the redemption price shall be as herein
provided for payment of interest otherwise due.

6.

Insufficiency in Notice Not Affecting Other Bonds; Failure to Receive Notice;
Waiver. Neither the failure to mail such redemption notice, nor any defect in any
notice so mailed, to any particular registered owner of a Bond, shall affect the
sufficiency of such notice with respect to other registered owners. Notice having
been properly given, failure of a registered owner of a Bond to receive such
notice shall not be deemed to invalidate, limit or delay the effect of the notice or
redemption action described in the notice. Such notice may be waived in writing
by a registered owner of a Bond entitled to receive such notice, either before or
after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers
of notice by registered owners shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall
not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon
such waiver. In lieu of the foregoing official notice, so long as the Bonds are
held in book entry form, notice may be given as provided in the Representation
Letter, and the giving of such notice shall constitute a waiver by the Depository
and the book entry owner, as registered owner, of the foregoing notice. After
giving proper notification of redemption to the Trustee, as applicable, the County
shall not be liable for any failure to give or defect in notice.

7.

New Bond in Amount Not Redeemed. Upon surrender for any partial redemption
of any Bond, there shall be prepared for the registered owner a new Bond or
Bonds of like Series and tenor, of Authorized Denominations, of the same
maturity, and bearing the same rate of interest in the amount of the unpaid
principal.

8.

Effect of Nonpayment upon Redemption. If any Bond or portion of Bond called
for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, in the
case of Current Interest Bonds, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from
the redemption date at the rate borne by the Bond or portion of Bond so called for
redemption; in the case of Variable Rate Bonds, the principal shall, until paid,
bear interest as provided in a relevant Indenture; and, in the case of Capital
Appreciation Bonds, the Compound Accreted Value at such redemption date
shall continue to accrue interest from such redemption date at the Yield to
Maturity borne by such Capital Appreciation Bond, or portion thereof, so called
for redemption.

9.

Bonds to Be Cancelled; Payment to Identify Bonds. All Bonds which have been
redeemed shall be cancelled and destroyed by the Trustee and shall not be
reissued. Upon the payment of the redemption price of Bonds being redeemed,
each check or other transfer of funds issued for such purpose shall bear the

168

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
CUSIP number identifying, by issue and maturity, the Bonds being redeemed
with the proceeds of such check or other transfer.

Sec. 6.

10.

Additional Notice. The County agrees to provide such additional notice of
redemption as it may deem advisable at such time as it determines to redeem
Bonds, taking into account any requirements or guidance of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the
Government Accounting Standards Board, or any other federal or state agency
having jurisdiction or authority in such matters; provided, however, that such
additional notice shall be (a) advisory in nature, (b) solely in the discretion of the
County (unless a separate agreement shall be made), (c) not be a condition
precedent of a valid redemption or a part of the Bond contract, and (d) any failure
or defect in such notice shall not delay or invalidate the redemption of Bonds for
which proper official notice shall have been given. Reference is also made to the
provisions of the Continuing Disclosure Undertaking of the County with respect
to the Bonds, which may contain other provisions relating to notice of
redemption of Bonds.

11.

Trustee to Advise County. As part of its duties hereunder, the Trustee shall
prepare and forward to the County a statement as to notices given with respect to
each redemption together with copies of the notices as mailed.

Registration Of Bonds; Persons Treated As Owners; Bonds Lost, Destroyed, Etc

The County shall cause the Bond Register to be kept at the office maintained for the purpose by
the Trustee, which is hereby constituted and appointed the Registrar of the County. The County is
authorized to prepare, and the Trustee shall keep custody of, multiple Bond blanks executed by the
County for use in the transfer and exchange of Bonds.
Subject to the provisions hereof relating to the Bonds in Book Entry Form, any Bond may be
transferred or exchanged, but only in the manner, subject to the limitations of and upon payment of the
charges as set forth in this Ordinance. Upon surrender for transfer of any Bond at the office maintained
for the purpose by the Trustee, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments
of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and duly executed by, the registered owner or his or her
attorney duly authorized in writing, the County shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate, date and
deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees (i) in the case of any Capital Appreciation Bond, a new
fully registered Capital Appreciation Bond or Bonds of the same Series and of the same Stated Maturity
of Authorized Denominations, for a like aggregate Original Principal Amount or (ii) in the case of any
Current Interest Bond or Variable Rate Bond, a new fully registered Bond or Bonds of the same Series of
the same tenor, of the same interest rate and Stated Maturity, of Authorized Denominations, for a like
aggregate principal amount. Subject to the provisions of this Ordinance relating to Book Entry Form any
Capital Appreciation Bond or Bonds may be exchanged at said office of the Trustee or its proper agent for
a like aggregate Original Principal Amount of Capital Appreciation Bond or Bonds of the same Series and
maturity of other Authorized Denominations; and any fully registered Current Interest Bond or Bonds or
Variable Rate Bond or Bonds may be exchanged at said office of the Trustee or its proper agent for a like
aggregate principal amount of such Bonds of the same tenor, of the same Series, interest rate and Stated
Maturity, of other Authorized Denominations.
The Trustee shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Bond during the period from the
close of business on the Regular Record Date for an interest payment to the opening of business on such
interest payment date or during the period of fifteen (15) days preceding the giving of notice of

169

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
redemption of Bonds or to transfer or exchange any Bond all or a portion of which has been called for
redemption.
The execution by the County of any fully registered Bond shall constitute full and due
authorization of such Bond, and the Trustee or its proper agent shall thereby be authorized to authenticate,
date and deliver such Bond in accordance with the terms of this Ordinance and of any Indenture;
provided, however, the principal amount of Bonds of each Series and maturity authenticated by the
Trustee shall not at any one time exceed the authorized principal amount of Bonds for such Series and
maturity less the amount of such Bonds which have been paid.
The person in whose name any Bond shall be registered shall be deemed and regarded as the
absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and payment of the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on
or any Maturity Amount of any Bond shall be made only to or upon the order of the registered owner
thereof or his or her legal representative. All such payments shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and
discharge the liability upon such Bond to the extent of the sum or sums so paid.
No service charge shall be made for any transfer or exchange of Bonds, but the County or the
Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Bonds exchanged in the case of the issuance of
a Bond or Bonds for the outstanding portion of a Bond surrendered for redemption.
If any Bond, whether in temporary or definitive form, is lost (whether by reason of theft or
otherwise), destroyed (whether by mutilation, damage, in whole or in part, or otherwise) or improperly
cancelled, the Trustee or its proper agent may authenticate a new Bond of like Series, date, maturity date,
interest rate (or, in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, Yield to Maturity), denomination and Original
Principal Amount (in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds) or principal amount (in the case of other
Bonds) and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding; provided that (a) in the case of any
mutilated Bond, such mutilated Bond shall first be surrendered to the Trustee, and (b) in the case of any
lost Bond or Bond destroyed in whole, there shall be first furnished to the Trustee evidence of such loss
or destruction, together with indemnification of the County and the Trustee, satisfactory to the Trustee. In
the event any lost, destroyed or improperly cancelled Bond shall have matured or is about to mature, or
has been called for redemption, instead of issuing a duplicate Bond, the Trustee shall pay the same
without surrender thereof if there shall be first furnished to the Trustee evidence of such loss, destruction
or cancellation, together with indemnity, satisfactory to it. Upon the issuance of any substitute Bond, the
Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that
may be imposed in relation thereto.
Sec. 7.

Security.

The full faith and credit of the County are hereby irrevocably pledged to the punctual payment of
the principal of, interest on and Maturity Amount of the Bonds. The Bonds shall be direct and general
obligations of the County and the County shall be obligated and hereby covenants and agrees to levy ad
valorem taxes upon all the taxable property in the County for the payment of the Bonds and the interest
thereon, without limitation as to rate or amount. The County hereby pledges, as equal and ratable security
for the Bonds, all present and future proceeds of the Pledged Taxes on deposit in the Bond Fund for the
sole benefit of the registered owners of the Bonds, subject to the right, hereby expressly reserved by the
County, to transfer certain interest income or investment profit earned in the Bond Fund to other funds of
the County.
Sec. 8.

Forms of Bonds.

170

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011

Sec. 9.

Taxes Levied; Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest; Covenants re Pledged
Taxes; Ordinance and Bond Orders to be Filed; Abatement.

A. Taxes Levied. For the purpose of providing the funds required to pay the principal of and
interest on, or Maturity Amount of, the Bonds promptly as the same become due, there is hereby levied
upon all taxable property in the County, a direct annual tax sufficient for those purposes in addition to all
other taxes, for the years and in the amounts as shall be provided in each relevant Bond Order, which
amounts, when aggregated with (i) for any Series of Refunding Bonds, the receipts, if any, of taxes levied
and collected for the payment of Refunded Bonds, (ii) any accrued interest received on the sale of a Series
of Bonds, and (iii) any proceeds of a Series of Bonds available to pay capitalized interest on said Series of
Bonds, shall be sufficient to pay principal of and interest on the Bonds. For this purpose, interest to
accrue on Variable Rate Bonds shall be deemed to be that rate which, in the reasonable estimation of the
Chief Financial Officer as he or she may from time to time determine, will be sufficient to pay principal
of and interest on such Variable Rate Bonds when due.
B. Payment of Principal, Interest and Maturity Amount. Subject to the right reserved by the
County under Section 7 of this Ordinance to transfer investment income, the Bond Moneys shall be
applied by the Trustee to pay principal of and interest on, or Maturity Amount of, the Bonds.
Principal of and interest on, or Maturity Amount of, the Bonds coming due at any time when
there are insufficient funds on hand from the Pledged Taxes to pay the same shall be paid promptly when
due from current funds on hand in advance of the collection of the Pledged Taxes herein levied which
funds are hereby appropriated for such purpose as necessary; and when the Pledged Taxes shall have been
collected, reimbursement shall be made to said funds in the amount so advanced.
C. Covenants re Pledged Taxes. The County covenants and agrees with the purchasers and
registered owners of the Bonds that so long as any of the Bonds remain outstanding, the County will take
no action or fail to take any action which in any way would adversely affect the ability of the County to
levy and collect the Pledged Taxes. The County and its officers will comply with all present and future
applicable laws in order to assure that the Pledged Taxes may be levied, extended and collected as
provided herein and deposited into the Bond Fund. With respect to Variable Rate Bonds, in furtherance
of the general obligation full faith and credit pledge of the County to the punctual payment of the
principal of and interest on the Bonds set forth in Section 7 of this Ordinance, the County will take all
actions necessary to levy in addition to the taxes described above, any direct annual tax required in excess
of that levied in this Ordinance for collection on a timely basis to make all payments of the principal of
and interest on such Variable Rate Bonds.
D. Ordinance and Bond Orders to be Filed. A copy of this Ordinance, together with a
subsequent copy of each Bond Order, duly certified by the County Clerk, shall be filed in the office of the
County Clerk, and such filings shall constitute the authority for and it shall be the duty of said County
Clerk, in each year as aforesaid, to extend the taxes levied pursuant to this Section and said Bond Order(s)

171

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
for collection, such taxes to be in addition to and in excess of all other taxes heretofore or hereafter
authorized to be levied by the County on its behalf.
E.
Abatement. Whenever and only when other funds from any lawful source are made
available for the purpose of paying any principal of and interest on, or Maturity Amount of, the Bonds, so
as to enable the abatement of the Pledged Taxes levied herein for the payment of same, the Corporate
Authorities shall, by proper proceedings, direct the deposit of such funds into the Bond Fund and further
shall direct the abatement of the Pledged Taxes by the amount so deposited. A certified copy or other
notification of any such proceedings abating taxes may then be filed with the County Clerk in a timely
manner to effect such abatement.
Except as may be otherwise provided in a relevant Bond Order or Indenture, at any time and from
time to time as the Chief Financial Officer shall determine to be necessary or advisable, the Chief
Financial Officer is hereby expressly authorized, without further official action of the Corporate
Authorities, to abate any portion of the Pledged Taxes levied to pay principal of and interest on Variable
Rate Bonds, in the event and to the extent that the Chief Financial Officer shall determine that the
collection of such Pledged Taxes will not be necessary to provide for the timely payment of the principal
of and interest on such Variable Rate Bonds. The filing with the County Clerk of a certificate of
abatement, signed by the Chief Financial Officer, shall constitute due authorization for the County Clerk
to effectuate such abatement.
Sec. 10.

Powers as to Bonds and Pledge

The County is duly authorized to pledge the Pledged Taxes and other moneys, securities and
funds purported to be pledged by this Ordinance in the manner and to the extent provided in this
Ordinance. The Pledged Taxes and other moneys, securities and funds so pledged are and will be free
and clear of any pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance thereon or with respect thereto prior to, or of equal
rank with, the pledge created by this Ordinance. The County shall at all times, to the extent permitted by
law, defend, preserve and protect the pledge of the Pledged Taxes and other moneys, securities and funds
pledged under this Ordinance and all the rights thereto of the Bondholders under this Ordinance against
all claims and demands of all persons whomsoever.

by the President or the Chief Financial Officer to evidence the approval by the Corporate Authorities of
all such revisions. The annual fee paid to any financial institution that provides a Credit Facility shall not
exceed two percent (2.00%) of the average principal amount of such Bonds outstanding during such
annual period. The final form of reimbursement agreement entered into by the County with respect to a
Series of Bonds shall be attached to the relevant Bond Order filed with the County Clerk pursuant to this
Section. Each such promissory note shall mature not later than the final maturity date of the Bonds and
shall be a general obligation of the County for the payment of which, both principal and interest, the
County pledges its full faith, credit and resources. Each such promissory note shall bear interest at a rate

this Ordinance, as may be required by such bond insurer, including as follows:

175

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
(i)
Consent to Amendments. That any provision of this Ordinance expressly recognizing or
granting rights in or to any such Insurer or to Bondholders generally may not be amended in any manner
which affects the rights of the Insurer or Bondholders generally without the prior written consent of the
Insurer.
(ii)

Notices. That the County may be required to furnish to the Bond Insurer information or

notices.
(iii)
List of Permitted Investments. That the investment of moneys in the various accounts of
the Bond Fund or the Project Fund may be limited to such list of lawful investments as may be required
by the Insurer; provided, however, such list shall include direct obligations of the United States of
America and shares in the Public Treasurers’ Investment Pool.
(iv)
Non-Defeasance and Subrogation. That in the event that the principal and/or interest due
on the Bonds shall be paid by the Insurer pursuant to a Policy, the Bonds shall remain outstanding for all
purposes, not be defeased or otherwise satisfied and not be considered paid by the County, and the pledge
of Pledged Taxes and all covenants, agreements and other obligations of the County to the Bondholders
shall continue to exist and shall run to the benefit of the Insurer, and the Insurer shall be subrogated to the
rights of such Bondholders.
(v)
Payment Procedure Pursuant to Policy. That so long as the Policy shall be in full force

such bonds in connection with bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency plan or proceeding.
H. ISDA DOCUMENTS. The President or the Chief Financial Officer is hereby authorized to
execute and deliver from time to time one or more agreements with counterparties selected by the Chief
Financial Officer, the purpose of which is to hedge or manage the County’s interest cost with respect to
the Bonds (or any portion thereof), or to reduce the County’s exposure to fluctuations in the interest rate
or rates payable on the Bonds or to insure, protect or preserve its investments from any loss (including,
without limitation, loss caused by fluctuations in interest rates, markets or in securities). The stated
aggregate notional amount under all such agreements authorized hereunder shall not exceed the principal
amount of the Bonds issued hereunder (net of offsetting transactions entered into by the County). Any
such agreement to the extent practicable shall be in substantially the form of either the Local Currency Single Jurisdiction version or the Multicurrency-Cross Border version of the 1992 ISDA Master
Agreement accompanied by the U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule published by the International
Swap Dealers Association (the “ISDA”) or any successor form to be published by the ISDA, and in the
appropriate confirmations of transactions governed by that agreement, with such insertions, completions
and modifications thereof as shall be approved by the officer of the County executing the same, his or her
execution to constitute conclusive evidence of the Corporate Authorities’ approval of such insertions,
completions and modifications thereof. Amounts payable by the County under any such agreement
(being “Swap Payments”) shall constitute operating expenses of the County payable from any moneys,
revenues, receipts, income, assets or funds of the County available for such purpose or be payable from
the sources pledged to the payment of the Bonds, as the Chief Financial Officer may from time to time
determine. Such amounts shall not constitute an indebtedness of the County for which its full faith and
credit is pledged. Nothing contained in this Section shall limit or restrict the authority of the President or

176

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
the Chief Financial Officer to enter into similar agreements pursuant to prior or subsequent authorization
of the Corporate Authorities.
Sec. 12.

Creation of Funds and Appropriations; Abatement of Taxes Levied for Refunded
Bonds.

A. BOND FUND CREATED. There is hereby created the “General Obligation [Refunding]
Bonds, Series 201__, Bond Fund” (the “Bond Fund”), which shall be the fund for the payment of
principal of and interest on and Maturity Amount of the Bonds.
All receipts of the Pledged Taxes received by the County Treasurer, acting ex officio as the
County Collector, shall be deposited daily, as far as practicable, with the Trustee. All other moneys
appropriated or used by the County for the payment of the principal or redemption price of, and interest
on, or Maturity Amount of, the Bonds shall be paid to the Trustee. The Trustee shall be accountable only
for moneys actually so deposited with the Trustee. The Trustee is hereby expressly authorized to
establish such accounts within the Bond Fund as shall be necessary to account for the Pledged Taxes
levied for each Series of Bonds issued hereunder. All Pledged Taxes, and all such moneys, shall be
deposited by the Trustee into the Bond Fund.
The County Treasurer is hereby expressly authorized and directed to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary to provide for the prompt deposit with the Trustee, in accordance with this Ordinance, of
all Pledged Taxes.
The Bond Fund shall be held and maintained as a separate and segregated account by the Trustee.
The Trustee may create Accounts within the Bond Fund as necessary for any Series of Bonds as specified
in a relevant Bond Order or, for Variable Rate Bonds, as provided in a relevant Indenture. Moneys in the
accounts of the Bond Fund may be withdrawn or may be transferred among the accounts of the Bond
Fund by the County upon requisition by the Chief Financial Officer. Accrued interest, capitalized interest
and premium, if any, received upon delivery of the Bonds shall be deposited into the Bond Fund and be
applied to pay first interest coming due on the Bonds.
The Pledged Taxes shall either be deposited into the Bond Fund and used solely and only for
paying the principal of and interest on or Maturity Amount of Bonds or be used to reimburse a fund or
account from which advances to the Bond Fund may have been made to pay principal of or interest on or
Maturity Amount of the Bonds prior to receipt of Pledged Taxes. Interest income or investment profit
earned in the Bond Fund shall be retained in the Bond Fund for payment of the principal of and interest
on Current Interest Bonds and Variable Rate Bonds and Maturity Amount of Capital Appreciation Bonds
on the interest payment date next after such interest or profit is received or, to the extent lawful and as
determined by the Chief Financial Officer, transferred to such other funds as may be determined. On or
after such date as may be provided in a relevant Bond Order, capitalized interest, if any, deposited to and
remaining in the Bond Fund for any Variable Rate Bonds shall be transferred to such other funds or
accounts as the Chief Financial Officer shall determine or as may be provided in a relevant tax agreement
for any Tax Exempt Bonds or Tax Advantaged Bonds.
B. (i) CAPITAL PROJECT FUNDS CREATED. The amount of proceeds of the Bonds issued to pay
costs of the Capital Projects as shall be set forth in the relevant Bond Order shall be set aside in one or
more separate funds of the County, hereby authorized to be created, and designated as the “Public Safety
Project Fund,” the “Health Fund Project Fund,” the “Corporate Project Fund,” and the “Capital
Equipment Project Fund” (collectively, the “Capital Project Funds”). Any Capital Project Fund may
further be divided into accounts and designated the “Series ______ Bonds Capital Project Account”(an
“Account”). The Capital Project Funds shall be held and maintained as separate and segregated accounts

177

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
by the Trustee. Moneys in the Capital Project Funds may be withdrawn or may be transferred among the
Capital Project Funds by the County to pay the costs of the Capital Projects upon requisition by the Chief
Financial Officer, the Comptroller or any other employee of the County designated by the Chief Financial
Officer or the Comptroller.
Alternatively, the Chief Financial Officer may allocate the proceeds of any Bonds issued to pay
costs of the Capital Projects to one or more related project funds or accounts of the County already in
existence; provided, however, that this shall not relieve the County and such officer of the duty to account
for the proceeds as if any Capital Project Fund or Account were created as herein provided. The County
by its Corporate Authorities reserves the right, as it becomes necessary from time to time, to change the
purposes of expenditure of any Capital Project Fund or its accounts, to change priorities, to revise cost
allocations between expenditures and to substitute projects, in order to meet current needs of the County;
subject, however, to the provisions of the Act and to the tax covenants of the County relating to the Tax
Exempt status of interest on Tax Exempt Bonds or to the status of any Bonds as Tax Advantaged Bonds.
(ii) FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT FUNDS. The amount of proceeds of Bonds issued to
pay costs of the Financial Management Projects as shall be set forth in the relevant Bond Order shall be
set aside in one or more separate funds of the County hereby authorized to be created and designated as
the “General Obligation Bonds, Series 201_ Insurance Reserve Fund” and the “General Obligation
Bonds, Series 201_ Cash Management Fund” (each, a “Financial Management Fund” and, together with
the Capital Project Funds, the “Project Funds”) and shall be disbursed as necessary to pay costs of the
Financial Management Projects.
Alternatively, the Chief Financial Officer may allocate the proceeds of any Bonds issued to pay
costs of the Financial Management Projects to one or more related funds or accounts of the County
already in existence; provided, however, that this shall not relieve the County and such officer of the duty
to account for the proceeds as if any Financial Management Project Fund or Account were created as
herein provided. The County by its Corporate Authorities reserves the right, as it becomes necessary from
time to time, to change the purposes of expenditure of any Financial Management Project Fund or its
accounts, to change priorities, to revise cost allocations between expenditures and to substitute projects, in
order to meet current needs of the County; subject, however, to the provisions of the Act and to the tax
covenants of the County relating to the Tax Exempt status of interest on Tax Exempt Bonds or to the
status of any Bonds as Tax Advantaged Bonds.
C. ESCROW ACCOUNTS. The sum necessary, as determined by the Chief Financial Officer, of
the principal proceeds of the Refunding Bonds together with such money in the debt service funds for the
Refunded Bonds as may be advisable for the purpose, shall be used to provide for the Refunding,
pursuant to the provisions of the relevant Escrow Agreement or Escrow Agreements. Any funds
remaining to the credit of the County pursuant to an Escrow Agreement upon the termination of the
Escrow Agreement shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to the County as directed by the Chief
Financial Officer.
D. EXPENSE FUND CREATED. The sum necessary, as determined by the Chief Financial
Officer, of the principal proceeds of each Series of the Bonds shall be deposited into a separate and
segregated fund, hereby created, to be known as the “General Obligation [Refunding] Bonds,
Series 201__ Expense Fund” (the “Expense Fund”) and shall be disbursed upon the delivery of that
Series of Bonds by the Trustee at the written direction of the Chief Financial Officer or shall be used by
the County to pay costs of issuance in accordance with normal County disbursement procedures. Any
funds remaining to the credit of the Expense Fund on the date which is six months following the date of
delivery of the Bonds shall be transferred to the County Treasurer for deposit into such fund or account of
the County as the Chief Financial Officer may direct.

178

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011

E. INVESTMENTS. The moneys on deposit in the Bond Fund may be invested from time to
time by the Trustee at the written direction of the Chief Financial Officer in Qualified Investments. Any
such investments may be sold from time to time by the Trustee without further direction from the County
as moneys may be needed for the purposes for which the Bond Fund has been created. The moneys on
deposit in each Project Fund shall be invested from time to time by the Trustee at the written direction of
the Chief Financial Officer in any lawful investment for County funds. In addition, the Chief Financial
Officer shall direct the Trustee (which direction may be by telephonic or facsimile transmission by the
County to the Trustee and confirmed by facsimile transmission by the Trustee to the County) to sell such
investments when necessary to remedy any deficiency in the Bond Fund, any Project Fund or any
accounts created therein. All other investment earnings shall be attributed to the account for which the
investment was made.
F. DEPOSITS. All moneys (not including securities) held by the Trustee subject to the
provisions of this Section may be deposited by it, on demand or time deposit, in its banking department or
with such banks, national banking associations, trust companies, savings banks or savings and loan
associations, that are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as may be designated by the
President or the Chief Financial Officer. No such moneys shall be deposited with any such financial
institution in an amount exceeding 50 percent of the amount that an officer of such financial institution
shall certify to the Trustee and the Chief Financial Officer as the combined capital and surplus of such
financial institution. No such moneys shall be deposited or remain on deposit with any such financial
institution in excess of the amount insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,
unless (a) such financial institution shall have lodged with the trust department of the Trustee or with a
Federal Reserve Bank or branch or, with the written approval of the Trustee and the Chief Financial
Officer, pledged to some other financial institution for the benefit of the County and the holders of Bonds,
as collateral security for the moneys deposited, Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations having a
market value (exclusive of accrued interest) at least equal to 100 percent of the amount of such moneys,
and (b) the Trustee shall have a perfected first lien in the Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations
serving as collateral, and such Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations shall be free from all third
party liens. The Trustee shall allow and credit interest on any such moneys held by it at such rate as it
customarily allows upon similar funds of similar size and under similar conditions or as required by law.
Interest in respect of moneys or on securities in any fund shall be credited in each case to the fund in
which such moneys or securities are held.
G. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The County may invest any moneys pursuant to a repurchase
agreement. Each repurchase agreement shall meet the requirements of the Public Funds Investment Act
of the State of Illinois, as amended, or be secured by Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations or such
Qualified Investments as may be specified in a relevant Bond Order, having a market value, marked to
market weekly, at least equal to 102 percent of the amount invested in the repurchase agreement plus
accrued interest. The Trustee shall at all times have a first lien in such Federal Obligations or Agency
Obligations perfected (i) by possession of certificated securities held by the Trustee or held by a third
party acting on behalf of the Trustee if the institution serving as Trustee is also the counterparty to the
repurchase agreement and is providing the collateral securities, or (ii) under the book-entry procedures
specified in 31 Code of Federal Regulations 306.1 et seq. or 31 Code of Federal Regulations 350.0 et seq.
The President or the Chief Financial Officer is hereby authorized to enter into, execute and deliver any
investment or repurchase agreement authorized by this Ordinance, and any additional documents as shall
be necessary to accomplish the purposes of any such agreement.
H.
VARIABLE RATE FUNDS OR ACCOUNTS. Other funds or accounts appropriate for Variable
Rate Bonds, such as a purchase fund to accommodate demands for purchase of such Bonds and the
remarketing of same to other Bond owners, may be created in the Indenture.

I.
TAXES LEVIED FOR REFUNDED BONDS. To the extent not theretofore abated and as
determined necessary by the Chief Financial Officer, the taxes previously levied and collected (or in the

Sec. 13.

General Tax Covenants

A.
NOT PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS. None of the Tax Exempt Bonds is a “private activity
bond” as defined in Section 141(a) of the Code. In support of such conclusion, the County certifies,
represents and covenants as follows:
1. No more than the portion allowable for Tax Exempt financings of the sale proceeds of each
Series of Tax Exempt Bonds, each considered separately, plus investment earnings thereon, will be used,
directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in any Private Business Use.
2. The payment of more than the portion allowable for Tax Exempt financings of the principal
of or the interest on each Series of the Tax Exempt Bonds, each considered separately, will not be,
directly or indirectly (i) secured by any interest in (A) property used or to be used in any Private Business
Use or (B) payments in respect of such property or (ii) on a present value basis, derived from payments in
respect of property, or borrowed money, used or to be used in any activity carried on by any person other
than a state or local governmental unit.
3. No more than the lesser of five percent of the sale proceeds of each Series of the Tax
Exempt Bonds and investment earnings thereon or $5,000,000 will be used, directly or indirectly, to make
or finance loans to any persons.
4. No user of any portion of the Capital Projects financed by Tax Exempt Bonds (collectively,
the “Infrastructure”) other than a state or local governmental unit will use on any basis other than the
same basis as the general public more than the portion, if any, of the Infrastructure which in the aggregate
is allowable for Tax Exempt financings, and no person other than a state or local governmental unit will
be a user of more than such allowable portion of the Infrastructure, in the aggregate, as a result of (i)
ownership, (ii) actual or beneficial use pursuant to a lease or a management, service, incentive payment,
research or output contract, or (iii) any other similar arrangement, agreement or understanding, whether
written or oral.
5. The County has not and will not enter into any arrangement that conveys to any person,
other than a state or local government unit, special legal entitlements to any portion of the Infrastructure
that is available for use by the general public. No person, other than a state or local governmental unit, is
receiving or will receive any special economic benefit from use of any portion of the Infrastructure that is
not available for use by the general public.

B.

PERTAINING TO REBATE.

The County further certifies and covenants as follows with respect to the requirements of
Section 148(f) of the Code, relating to the rebate of “excess arbitrage profits” (the “Rebate , the County
Requirement”) to the United States:
1. Unless an applicable exception to the Rebate Requirement is available to the County will
meet the Rebate Requirement.
2. Relating to applicable exceptions, any Designated Officer is hereby authorized to make
such elections under the Code as either such officer shall deem reasonable and in the best interests of the
County. If such election may result in a “penalty in lieu of rebate” as provided in the Code, and such
penalty is incurred (the “Penalty”), then the County shall pay such Penalty.
3. The Designated Officers are hereby expressly authorized and directed to cause to be
established, at such time and in such manner as they may deem necessary or appropriate hereunder, a
“201__ General Obligation [Refunding] Bonds Rebate [or Penalty, if applicable] Fund” (the “Rebate
Fund”) for the Tax Exempt Bonds, and such officers shall further, not less frequently than annually,
cause to be transferred to the 148 Compliance Fund the amount determined to be the accrued liability
under the Rebate Requirement or Penalty. Said Designated Officers are hereby expressly authorized and
directed to cause to be paid to the U.S., without further order or direction from the Corporate Authorities,
from time to time as required, amounts sufficient to meet the Rebate Requirement or to pay the Penalty.
4. Interest earnings in the Bond Fund and any Project Fund are hereby authorized to be
transferred, without further order or direction from the Corporate Authorities, from time to time as
required, to the Rebate Fund for the purposes herein provided; and proceeds of the Tax Exempt Bonds
and other lawfully available funds of the County are also hereby authorized to be used to meet the Rebate
Requirement or to pay the Penalty, but only if necessary after application of investment earnings as
aforesaid.
Sec. 14.

Registered Form.

The County recognizes that Section 149 of the Code requires Tax Exempt Bonds to be issued and
to remain in fully registered form in order to be and remain Tax Exempt. In this connection, the County
agrees that it will not take any action to permit Tax Exempt Bonds to be issued in, or converted into,
bearer or coupon form.
Sec. 15.

Further Tax-Exemption Covenants.

The County agrees to comply with all provisions of the Code which, if not complied with by the
County, would cause Tax Exempt Bonds not to be Tax Exempt. In furtherance of the foregoing
provisions, but without limiting their generality, the County agrees: (a) through its officers, to make such
further specific covenants, representations as shall be truthful, and assurances as may be necessary or
advisable; (b) to comply with all representations, covenants and assurances contained in certificates or
agreements as may be prepared by Bond Counsel; (c) to consult with Bond Counsel and to comply with
such advice as may be given; (d) to file such forms, statements and supporting documents as may be
required and in a timely manner; and (e) if deemed necessary or advisable by its officers, to employ and
pay fiscal agents, financial advisors, attorneys and other persons to assist the County in such compliance.
The County also certifies and further covenants with the Underwriters and registered owners of
the Tax Exempt Bonds from time to time outstanding that moneys on deposit in any fund or account in

181

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
connection with the Tax Exempt Bonds, whether or not such moneys were derived from the proceeds of
the sale of the Tax Exempt Bonds or from any other source, will not be used in a manner which will cause
the Tax Exempt Bonds to be “arbitrage bonds” within the meaning of Code Section 148 and any lawful
regulations promulgated thereunder, as the same presently exist or may from time to time hereafter be
amended, supplemented or revised.
The County further covenants that it will not take any action, or omit to take any action or permit
the taking or omission of any action within its control (including, without limitation, making or permitting
any use of the proceeds of the Tax Exempt Bonds) if taking, permitting or omitting to take such action
would cause any Tax Exempt Bond to be a private activity bond within the meaning of the Code or would
otherwise cause interest on the Tax Exempt Bonds to be included in the gross income of the recipients
thereof for federal income tax purposes. The County acknowledges that, in the event of an examination
by the Internal Revenue Service of the exemption from federal income taxation of interest on the Tax
Exempt Bonds, under present rules, the County may be treated as a “taxpayer” in the examination and
agrees that it will respond in a commercially reasonable manner to any inquiries from the Internal
Revenue Service in connection with such an examination.
Sec. 16.

Reimbursement.

None of the proceeds of the Tax Exempt Bonds will be used to pay, directly or indirectly, in
whole or in part, for an expenditure that has been paid by the County prior to the date hereof except
architectural, engineering costs or construction costs incurred prior to commencement of any of the
Capital Projects or the Financial Management Projects or expenditures for which an intent to reimburse
was properly declared under Treasury Regulations Section 1.150-2. This Ordinance is in itself a
declaration of official intent under Treasury Regulations Section 1.150-2 as to all costs of the Capital
Projects and the Financial Management Projects paid after the date hereof and prior to issuance of the
Bonds.
Sec. 17.

Opinion of Counsel Exception

The County reserves the right to use or invest moneys in connection with the Bonds in any
manner, notwithstanding the tax-related covenants set forth in Sections 13 through 16 herein, provided,
that it shall first have received an opinion from Bond Counsel to the effect that such use or investment as
contemplated is valid and proper under applicable law and this Ordinance and that such use or investment
will not adversely affect the Tax Exempt status of the Tax Exempt Bonds.
Sec. 18.

Certain Rights Reserved to County

The County reserves the right to provide one or more Credit Facilities, or a combination thereof
to secure the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on one or more Series of
Outstanding Bonds, or in the event owners of such Bonds have the right to require purchase thereof, to
secure the payment of the purchase price of such Bonds upon the demand of the owners thereof. In
connection with any such Credit Facilities, the County may execute and deliver an agreement setting forth
the conditions upon which drawings or advances may be made under such Credit Facilities and the
method by which the County will reimburse the issuer of such Credit Facilities for such drawings together
with interest thereon at such rate or rates and otherwise make payments as may be agreed upon by the
County and the issuer of such Credit Facilities. Any such obligation of the County to reimburse or
otherwise make payments to the issuer of such Credit Facilities securing a Series of Outstanding Bonds
shall constitute operating expenses of the County payable, from any moneys, revenues, receipts, income,
assets or funds of the County available for such purpose or be payable from the Pledged Taxes, as the
Chief Financial Officer may from time to time determine, under this Ordinance to the same extent as any

182

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
Series of Outstanding Bonds, and any and all amounts payable by the County to reimburse the issuer of
any such Credit Facilities, together with interest thereon, shall for purposes of this Ordinance be deemed
to constitute the payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on Outstanding Bonds. Such
amounts shall not constitute an indebtedness of the County for which its full faith and credit is pledged.
Sec. 19.

Indentures.

Any Indenture for Variable Rate Bonds shall conform as fully as may be practicable to the
provisions of Sections 20 to 46, inclusive, hereof, but need not be identical, giving effect to the unique
features of such Bonds. In addition, the provisions of this Ordinance relating to the following matters are
subject to different provisions that may be contained in an Indenture for Variable Rate Bonds:

Interest Bonds, and the Maturity Amount, in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, to become
due thereon at the times and in the manner stipulated therein and herein, (ii) all fees and expenses
of the Trustee shall have been paid, and (iii) the County shall keep, perform and observe all and
singular the covenants and promises in the Bonds and in this Ordinance expressed as to be kept,
performed and observed by it or on its part, then these presents and the rights hereby granted shall
cease, determine and be void. If the County shall pay or cause to be paid to the registered owners
of all Outstanding Bonds of a particular Series, or of a particular maturity within a Series, the
principal, premium, if any, and interest, in the case of Current Interest Bonds, and the Maturity
Amount, in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, to become due thereon at the times and in the
manner stipulated therein and herein, such Bonds shall cease to be entitled to any lien, benefit or
security under the Ordinance, and all covenants, agreements and obligations of the County to the
holders of such Bonds shall thereupon cease, terminate and become void and discharged and
satisfied.
(b) Provision for Payment. Bonds for the payment or redemption or prepayment of
which sufficient monies or sufficient Defeasance Obligations shall have been deposited with the
Trustee or an escrow agent having fiduciary capacity (whether upon or prior to the maturity or the
redemption date of such Bonds) and for Tax Advantaged Bonds, accompanied by an opinion of
bond counsel as to compliance with the covenants with respect to such Bonds, and accompanied
by an express declaration of defeasance of the Bonds by the Corporate Authorities, shall be
deemed to be paid within the meaning of this Ordinance and no longer outstanding under this
Ordinance; provided, however, that if such Bonds are to be redeemed prior to the maturity
thereof, notice of such redemption shall have been duly given as provided in this Ordinance or
arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee shall have been made for the giving thereof. Defeasance
Obligations shall be considered sufficient only if said investments mature and bear interest in
such amounts and at such times as will assure sufficient cash to pay currently maturing interest,

183

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
principal or Maturity Amount, as applicable, and redemption premiums if any when due on the
Bonds without rendering the interest on any Bonds taxable under the Code.
The County may at any time surrender to the Trustee for cancellation by it any Bonds
previously authenticated and delivered hereunder, which the County may have acquired in any
manner whatsoever, and such Bonds, upon such surrender and cancellation, shall be deemed to be
paid and retired.
(c) Termination of County’s Liability. Upon the discharge of indebtedness under
paragraph (a) hereof, or upon the deposit with the Trustee of sufficient money and Defeasance
Obligations (such sufficiency being determined as provided in paragraph (b) hereof) for the
retirement of any particular Bond or Bonds, all liability of the County in respect of such Bond or
Bonds shall cease, determine and be completely discharged and the holders thereof shall
thereafter be entitled only to payment out of the money and the proceeds of the Defeasance
Obligations deposited with aforesaid for their payment.

such an Event of Default is received by the Trustee [at the Corporate Trust Office], and such notice
references any of the Bonds generally or this Ordinance or the applicable Indenture.

subject to the provisions of this Ordinance.

Sec. 35.

Remedies Cumulative.

No remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee, the Bondholders, or to the Insurer is

expedient. In the event any Event of Default shall be waived by the Bondholders or the Trustee, acting at
the direction, or with the consent of, the Bondholders, such waiver shall be limited to the particular Event
of Default so waived and shall not be deemed to waive any other Event of Default hereunder.
Sec. 37.

Application of Monies After Default

Subject to a different provision in an Indenture for Variable Rate Bonds, and subject to any
Commitment, the County covenants that if an Event of Default shall happen and shall not have been
remedied, the Trustee shall apply all monies, securities and funds received by the Trustee pursuant to any
right given or action taken under the provisions of this Article as follows:
(1) First, to the payment of all reasonable costs and expenses of collection, fees, and
other amounts due to the Trustee hereunder; and thereafter,
(2) Second, to the payment of amounts, if any, payable to the United States Treasury
pursuant to any Tax Agreement;
(3)

All such monies shall be applied as follows:

(A) first, to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of all installments of
interest on Outstanding Bonds then due, in the order of the maturity of such installments,
and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full any particular
installment, then to the payment ratably, according to the amounts due on such
installment, to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference;
(B) second, to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of the unpaid principal
or then current Compound Accreted Value of and premium, if any, on any of the
Outstanding Bonds which shall have become due (other than Bonds matured or called for
redemption for the payment of which monies are held pursuant to the provisions of this
Ordinance), in the order of their due dates, with interest upon such Outstanding Current
Interest Bonds from the respective dates upon which they became due, and, if the amount
available shall not be sufficient to pay in full Outstanding Bonds due on any particular
date, together with such premium, then to the payment ratably according to the amount of
principal and premium due on such date, and then to the payment of such principal or
then current Compound Accreted Value ratably according to the amount of such principal
due on such date, to the persons entitled thereto without any discrimination or preference;
and
(C)

third, to the payment of Swap Payments.

Whenever monies are to be applied by the Trustee pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, such
monies shall be applied by the Trustee at such times, and from time to time, as the Trustee shall determine
upon consultation with the County, having due regard to the amount of such monies available for
application and the likelihood of additional monies becoming available for such application in the future.
The deposit of such monies with the paying agents, or otherwise setting aside such monies, in trust for the
proper purpose, shall constitute proper application by the Trustee; and the Trustee shall incur no liability
whatsoever to the County to any Bondholder or to any other person for any delay in applying any such
funds, so long as the Trustee acts with reasonable diligence, having due regard to the circumstances, and
ultimately applies the same in accordance with such provisions of this Ordinance as may be applicable at
the time of application by the Trustee. Whenever the Trustee shall apply such funds, it shall fix the date
(which shall be an interest payment date unless the Trustee shall deem another date more suitable) upon

190

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
which such application is to be made and upon such date interest on the amounts of principal paid on such
date shall cease to accrue. The Trustee shall give such notice as it may deem appropriate of the fixing of
any such date and of the endorsement to be entered on each Bond on which payment shall be made, and
shall not be required to make payment to the holder of any unpaid Bond until such Bond shall be
presented to the Trustee for appropriate endorsement, or some other procedure deemed satisfactory by the
Trustee.
Sec. 38.

191

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
(b) Supplemental Ordinances Requiring Consent of Bondholders. With the consent
(evidenced as provided in Section 43) of the registered owners of not less than a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Bonds, at the time outstanding, and subject to any
Commitment, the County, by the Corporate Authorities may pass, and the Trustee may accept
from time to time and at any time an ordinance or ordinances supplemental hereto for the purpose
of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this
Ordinance or of any supplemental ordinance; provided that no such modification or amendment
shall extend the maturity or reduce the interest rate on, or permit the creation of a preference or
priority of any Outstanding Bond or Outstanding Bonds over any other Outstanding Bond or
Outstanding Bonds, or otherwise alter or impair the obligation of the County to pay the principal,
interest or redemption premium, if any, at the time and place and at the rate and in the currency
provided therein of any Bond, without the express consent of the registered owner of such Bond
or permit the creation of a preference or priority of any Bond or Bonds over any other Bond or
Bonds, or reduce the percentage of Bonds, respectively, required for the affirmative vote or
written consent to an amendment or modification, or deprive the registered owners of the Bonds
(except as aforesaid) of the right to payment of the Bonds from the Pledged Taxes, or alter or
impair the obligations of the County with respect to the Tax Exempt status, the registration,
transfer, exchange or notice of redemption of Bonds, without the consent of the registered owners
of all Outstanding Bonds affected; nor shall any such modification or amendment reduce the
percentage of the registered owners of Outstanding Bonds required for the written consent of such
modification or amendment without the consent of the owners of all of the Outstanding Bonds.
Upon receipt by the Trustee of a certified copy of such ordinance and upon the filing with the
Trustee of evidence of the consent of Bondholders as aforesaid, the Trustee shall accept unless
such supplemental ordinance affects the Trustee’s own rights, duties or immunities under this
Ordinance or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated
to, accept such supplemental ordinance.
If a given Series of Bonds is fully and irrevocably insured or otherwise provided for as to the
timely payment of principal and interest by a municipal bond or financial guaranty insurance
policy, a letter of credit, or some other means, and such policy provider or letter of credit provider
shall not be in default, then any consent to amendment as herein provided shall not be given by
the owners of Bonds of such Series, but rather shall be obtained from such provider, whose
consent may or may not be given in its complete discretion, and whose consent shall be binding
on such owners and all successors in interest. Ownership of Bonds for purposes of consent by the
registered owners thereof shall be conclusively proved by the Bond Register.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Bondholders under this paragraph to approve the
particular form of any proposed supplemental ordinance, but it shall be sufficient if such consent
shall approve the substance thereof.
Promptly after the passage by the County and the acceptance by the Trustee of any supplemental
ordinance pertaining to the Bonds pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, the County shall
publish a notice, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental ordinance, at
least once in a financial newspaper or journal printed in the English language, customarily
published on each business day and of general circulation among dealers in municipal securities
in the County of New York, New York. If, because of temporary or permanent suspension of the
publication or general circulation of any financial newspaper or journal or for any other reason it
is impossible or impractical to publish such notice of supplemental ordinance in the manner
herein provided, then such publication in lieu thereof as shall be made with the approval of the
Trustee shall constitute sufficient publication of notice. Any failure of the County to given such

192

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any
such supplemental ordinance.
(c) Supplemental Ordinance to Modify this Ordinance. Upon the execution of any
supplemental ordinance pursuant to the provisions of this Section, this Ordinance shall be
modified and amended in accordance therewith and the respective rights, duties and obligations
under this Ordinance of the County, the Trustee and all registered owners of Bondholders,
respectively, outstanding thereunder shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced
hereunder subject in all respects to such modification and amendments, and all the terms and
conditions of any such supplemental ordinance shall be and be deemed to be part of the terms and
conditions of this Ordinance for any and all purposes.
(d) Trustee May Rely Upon Opinion of Counsel Re: Supplemental Ordinance. The
Trustee may receive an opinion of counsel as conclusive evidence that any supplemental
ordinance executed pursuant to the provisions of this Section complies with the requirements of
this Section.
(e) Notation.
Bonds authenticated and delivered after the execution of any
supplemental ordinance pursuant to the provisions of this Section may bear a notation, in form
approved by the Trustee, as to any matter provided for in such supplemental ordinance, and if
such supplemental ordinance shall so provide, new bonds, so modified as to conform, in the
opinion of the Trustee and the Corporate Authorities, to any modification of this Ordinance
contained in any such supplemental ordinance, may be prepared by the County, authenticated by
the Trustee and delivered without cost to the registered owners of the Bonds then outstanding,
upon surrender for cancellation of such Bonds in equal aggregate principal amounts.

Sec. 41.

Signing by Trustee of Amendments and Supplements.

The Trustee will sign any amendment or supplement to the Ordinance or the Bonds authorized
hereunder if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may, but need not, sign it. In signing an amendment or

NORESCO, LLC (PROPOSED CONTRACT), Herman Brewer, Director, transmitting a
communication, dated June 17, 2011:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into and execute a contract with
Noresco, LLC, Des Plaines, Illinois, for a Guaranteed Energy Performance Contracting
Project. Phase 1 of this contract provides for engineering services for an investment grade
energy audit of the Department of Corrections Campus and the Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center. Noresco, LLC was selected through a Request for Qualifications
(RFQ)/Request for Proposal (RFP) process as highly qualified and offering a competitive
price.
Reason:

This contract provides for a guaranteed energy performance contracting project at
the Department of Corrections and the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center
campuses. The goal of the project is to identify and implement identifying energy
conservation measures (ECMs) that will result in at least a 10% reduction in
emissions and energy costs as compared to a Base Year, throughout a 15 year
financing period. Phase 1 consists of a comprehensive investment grade audit of
13 buildings on the Department of Corrections and Criminal Courts Campus. If
the ECMs identified are estimated to achieve cost savings sufficient to cover
financing of the ECMs, the parties will negotiate in good faith the terms of Phase
2, pursuant to which Noresco, LLC will perform engineering and construction
services to implement the agreed upon ECMs. If adequate cost savings to cover
the financing costs cannot be identified, the County has no obligation to pay for
the audit. If adequate savings are identified but the County chooses not to enter
into a GEPC or chooses not to finance the conservation measures, the County
will pay the actual cost of the audit, up to a maximum of $149,000.00.

This is a joint project undertaken by the Office of Capital Planning and Policy, the
Department of Environmental Control, and the Bureau of Finance. This is categorized as an
energy efficiency project.

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 18, 2011 from
DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $4,115.00 from Account
528-449, Operation, Maintenance & Repair not Classified to Account 528-444, Operation, Maintenance
& Repair of Auto Equipment for the repair of a van that was involved in an accident in May 2011.
Reason:

The funds are needed to pay for the repair of a van that was involved in an accident in May
2011. The van is necessary for daily operations.

From Account 528-449

Total

$4,115.00

To Account 528-444

Total

$4,115.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
In May 2011, one of the Clerk of the Circuit Court vehicles was involved in an accident. Three
estimates were obtained for the repair of the vehicle, the vendor providing the lowest estimate was
selected, and the repair services were performed in June 2011. A Payment Only Requisition was
completed immediately following the repair services using available funds in Account 528-449. On
July 18, 2011, it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds as
the County Budget Department determined that Account 528-449 is not the appropriate account for
payment of the repair. Account 528-444 was not budgeted in FY 2011, therefore, the balance on
July 18, 2011 and thirty days prior to that date was $0.00.

228

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011
2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 528-449 was identified as the source of transferred funds as the actual cost of the Voice
Information System maintenance purchased through the Cook County Central Services was less
than the estimated budgeted amount, which created a surplus in the account, hence, the availability
of funds for the transfer.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from Account 528-449.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The actual cost of the Voice Information System maintenance purchased through the Cook County
Central Services was less than the estimated budgeted amount which created a surplus in the
account, hence, the availability of funds for the transfer.

requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $890,720.00 from and to
the accounts listed below, to meet current and future financial obligations.
Reason:

The increase in Account 183 is to increase knowledge and maintain certifications needed by

for security personnel per their union agreement. In Acct. 330 the increase is needed to
purchase supplies needed for the Janitorial staff at Rockwell. In Acct. 333 the increase is
needed due to the rising cost of the day to day supplies and needed to implement energy cost
savings measures. In Acct. 350 the increase is needed due to the increased documentation
requirements of compliance with court orders. In Acct. 444 the increase is needed in order to
maintain our fleet of vehicles all of which are in excess of 10 years old. In Acct. 450 the
increase is needed to perform multi-year preventive maintenance and repair an aging physical

CONTRACT

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2011

Transmitting a Communication, dated June 17, 2011 from
ABISHI C. CUNNINGHAM, JR., Public Defender
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Leann Horrocks,
Venice, Florida, for development of an interface between the Public Defender's Legal Edge system and
the Circuit Court Clerk's data system.
Reason:

This office has a case management system to assist in tracking cases and helping attorneys
handle their caseload. The reason for the request is we must expand our usage of the current
case management system in order to properly fulfill our mission of defending the indigent. In
addition, the data provided by the Circuit Court Clerk's Office will help us provide data for
our performance management objectives as requested by the President's Office. This office is
appointed to over 100,000 cases a year and does not have the manpower to manually input
case information into our system. The Clerk's Office already has the case data this office
requires in their electronic system and has a data file which they make available to other
agencies in the criminal justice system. The Chief Information Officer, Greg
Wass, has reviewed the proposal and concurs with the need.
After submitting a Request For Proposal to purchasing and going through the appropriate
bidding process, we found Ms. Horrock's qualifications to be the best in terms of meeting the
specifications and award amount. Her proposal is slightly higher for startup but is more
efficient and less expensive in the long run for maintenance and support. Her hourly rate was
the lowest of the three bids.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $131,100.00. Contract period: August 15, 2011 through August 14, 2012.
(717/260-579 Account).
The Chief Information Officer has reviewed this item and concurs with this recommendation.

affiliate and third party administrator to provide eligible Cook County employees and their dependents

The Request for Proposal (RFP) for Vision Care Benefits was joint initiative by the various municipal
agencies and issued by the Chicago Transit Authority. Six (6) national vision care companies responded
to this Request for Proposal. Based on an extensive financial analysis and overall evaluation of benefits
from the respondents, the Department of Risk Management recommends the selection of EyeMed Vision
Care. EyeMed Vision Care, previously known as Cole Managed Vision, offers the following advantages:
lowest costs for examinations, spectacle lenses, contact and frames; largest provider network in Cook
County with 730 locations; high level of satisfaction for Cook County employees since 1995; responsive
service and ease of administration to covered members; very competitive administrative fee; and a fiveyear rate guarantee for materials and services (three year term, with two one-year renewal options). The
proposal from EyeMed Vision Care includes Minority Business Enterprises (MBE)/Women Business
Enterprises (WBE) direct participation and has been found responsive to the Contract Compliance
guidelines. This will allow Cook County employees to continue to participate in the Vision Care program
as part of the fringe benefit package.
All fees and expenses will be paid from the following accounts:
Corporate/Grant: 490-179
Public Safety: 499-179
Health Fund: 899-179
Estimated Annual Fiscal Impact: $2,900,000.00.

local law enforcement agencies concentrate their investigative efforts in the City of Chicago and the
entire outlying suburban Cook County area. This grant does not require a match contribution.
