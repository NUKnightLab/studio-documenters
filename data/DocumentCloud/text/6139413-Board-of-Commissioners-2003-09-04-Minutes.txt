requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to extend for five (5) months, Contract No. 98-43-1323

natural gas budget.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Request does not change annual funding to any department's FY 2003
natural gas heating account. Contract extension: December 1, 2003 through April 30, 2004.

Chainnan Hansen, Vice Chairman Butler, Commissioners Gorman, Murphy and Steele (5)

Absent:

None (0)

Also
Present:

Commissioner Sims (! ); Elizabeth Reidy and Helen Haynes - State's Attorney' s Office

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Administration of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to
notice on Wednesday, September 3, 2003 at the hour of 1:00 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County
Building, I I 8 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
1.

Review of pending corrections to County Proceedings.

2.

Procedures for conducting bid proceedings by members of the Board of Commissioners.

3.

Review of alternate methods of solicitation, receipt and processing of bids.

4.

Info rmation on continuous supply of electrical power by conventional or through alternate
sources to ensure administrative function of county governmental units.

ITEM #1
Chainnan Hansen stated that everyone on the committee should have received a copy of the Proposed
Amendments to the Journal of Proceedings of December 3, 2002 through May 6, 2003, which was
prepared by the Cook County Clerk ' s Office. He also stated that no further action needs to be taken at
this time because it appears on the Cook County Board Agenda of September 4, 2003 to be reconsidered.
(The referenced document is on fil e with the Office of the County Clerk.)
ITEM #2
Chainnan Hansen stated that a Guide for Bid Opening Procedures/Acceptance of Bids for the Cook
County Board of Commissioners was distributed to the commissioners. He stated that the guide is not
mandatory; it is a guide for the commissioners.
Commissioner Steele stated that she is concerned wi th the County's process; she stated that there are too
many corrections that need to be made after the bids have been opened.

2460

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 4, 2003

Chainnan Hansen asked for a motion to recommend the guide to the Board.

Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved to recommend the Guide for
Bid Opening Procedures to the Cook County Board. The motion carried.
ITEM#3
Chainnan Hansen stated in regards to electronic bidding the Purchasing Agent and his staff are currently
reviewing the information and are also continuing to gather information from other government agencies.
A letter has been received to this effect.
Chairman Hansen asked for a motion to continue to look into the electronic bidding.

Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved to continue the discussion
regarding information on the electronic bidding at the next Administration Committee meeting.
The motion carried.
ITEM#4
Chairman Hansen stated that after the power outage that occurred out East, he wrote a letter of concern to
Michael LaMont, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy. A response was passed out to the
commissioners. The answer shows that electricity under unusual circumstances is sufficient to run
elevators, emergency lighting, emergency telephones, etc. Chairman Hansen stated that he raised the
question whether the County Building would be capable of operating under all circumstances. Chairman
Hansen stated that Michael LaMont stated that this can be looked at. Chairman Hansen further stated that
Michael LaMont is willing to study this further to see what it would take under all circumstances.
Commissioner Sims stated that there should be something set in place where in a catastrophe the County
Building would function as a command center. In conclusion Commissioner Sims stated that she would
like to see the Administration Committee look into setting something up and not depending solely on the
Sheriff.
Commissioner Steele stated that after September 11, 200 I, there was a committee put in place and Gerald
Nichols was appointed to the Countywide Task Force Committee to represent the County's interest.
Commissioner Murphy stated that after September 11 , 2001 , there was talk about trying to have an
umbrella group set up that would control everything in case of a catastrophe. Further, Commissioner
Murphy stated that the County should find out what the City of Chicago is doing.
Helen Haynes, State' s Attorney's Office, stated that she would like to make the Commissioners aware
that Cook County has a "Cook County Emergency Services and Disaster Agency Ordinance", which
relates to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act (!EMA), the statewide act which coordinates
with all the different governmental entities. She stated that this particular ordinance has been in the books
for a long time; it was recently looked at in conjunction with the TOPOFF exercise because it tracks the
old statute. Further, she stated that under the ordinance and statute the President of the County Board as
the Chief Executive Officer has a number of powers and is also responsible for appointing the coordinator
of the Cook County Emergency Services and Disaster Agency; which she stated is the Sheriff.
Finally, Ms. Haynes stated that the ordinance deals with communications to the Commissioners in the
event of an emergency, and does provide for various steps to be taken and for plans to be developed.
Helen Haynes stated that the Sheriff performs many functions by virtue of his status as an elected officer,
but his function as the coordinator of the Cook County Emergency Management Agency is performed
because the President appointed him to that position.

2461

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 4, 2003

Chainnan Hansen stated that the first thing the Administration Committee needs to do is obtain a copy of
the Cook County Emergency Management Agency Ordinance and related documents.

Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved to continue with the
investigation and gather all materials from the City of Chicago and the State to find out exactly
what can be done and also to include further examination of the electrical capabilities in tota.1. The
motion carried.
Commissioner Murphy moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Gorman. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.
Respectfully submitted,

Commissioner Daley asked if any of the containers that were found were filled.
Deborah Sawyer stated that some of the containers were filled and some were partially filled.
Commissioner Suffredin asked Ms. Sawyer if she had any infonnation on the current integrity of the
foundations and structure of the main hospital building and was any work done to analyze the
foundations.
Deborah Sawyer stated that it was not part of their scope of work.
In response to Commissioner Collins's question regarding whether the report will be used as part of the
calculation of what the expected cost will be in terms of the overall environmental assessment and
abatement, Michael LaMont stated that this is a summary of what the consultant prepared and they base
cost estimates off of what they found.
Commissioner Collins asked if the base costs for the abatement are available.
Michael LaMont stated that it was distributed to the commissioners with the handout regarding the
demolition.
Commissioner Collins asked if the abatement is a separate cost from the actual demolition.
Michael LaMont stated that there are two contracts; one for abatement and one for demolition.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 4, 2003

In response to Commissioner Silvestri' s question regarding whether the environmental condition of the
main hospital is better or worse than the other buildings in question, Ms. Sawyer responded that there is
no quality answer.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if the environmental abatement will have any impact on the structural
quality of the main hospital building.
Deborah Sawyer stated that in order to remove all the asbestos containing material, minor amounts of
demolition must occur.
In response to Commissioner Silvestri ' s question regarding the estimate on the time that it will take to
complete the environmental abatement of the building, Mr. LaMont stated that it would take
approximately four months for the main hospital.
Commissioner Peraica asked where is Environmental Design International, Inc. in the planning schedule
in tenns of the consulting schedule.
Deborah Sawyer stated as of July l the design was at 50%.
Commissioner Peraica asked in regards to the Summary Campus Master Plan that was provided by
Michael LaMont, it stated that reuse of the main building would cost over $200 million, what was the
basis for this conclusion.
Michael LaMont stated that the numbers alone were initially from a study done in 1988, which was done
to renovate the existing buildings versus building a new hospital. The Office of Capital Planning and
Policy took those figures and escalated them up 15 years and came up with the figure.
Commissioner Peraica asked if any updates have been done since the August 2002 report was issued.
Michael LaMont stated that no further calculations have been done. The mission has been to prepare for
the demolition of the buildings.
Commissioner Peraica asked if the estimates that were provided by Deborah Sawyer are realistic.
Michael LaMont stated that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy has not done any independent
estimating and tabulation, we stand by the estimates that EDI has reported.
In response to Commissioner Peraica' s question regarding saving any of the equipment or materials that
would be salvageable or that any value can be recovered for them, Michael LaMont stated that the Board
and the Office of Capital Planning and Policy had approved salvaging the three emergency generators
which were installed <luting the first round of demolition to clear the site.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the tanks that need to be removed are reusable.
Deborah Sawyer stated that the 275-gallon tank is a day tank associated with a large tank that is part of
the powerhouse.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the status of the electric in the main building.
Steve Sovak, Vice President, WMA Consulting Engineers, stated that in the main building the electric is
very old.

2464

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 4, 2003

Commissioner Hansen asked what year the electrical risers were installed.
Steve Sovak stated that he does not have that information.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the plumbing, Steve Sovak stated that there is
some renovation in progress.
Steve Sovak stated that there is no incoming utility company service coming to the main building, it is all
sub-fed.
In response to Commissioner Quigley's question regarding putting out an RFP, Michael LaMont stated
that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy has been asked by the County Board to proceed with the
demolition plan. The Board has been following the requirements of the City of Chicago and the Medical
District. A new hospital could have not been built without going on record stating that the old hospital
would be demolished.
Vice Chairman Butler stated that if Michael LaMont had been told by the Board to go out for an RFP the
Board would have a RFP. Further Chairman Butler stated that until the newer commissioners came to the
Board there was no question as to what would happen to the old hospital.
In response to Commissioner Goslin's question regarding when the specifications were developed for the
equipment, will it reflect that there may be equipment that can be reused and will have a useful life
elsewhere, Steve Sovak stated that under normal demolition contracts, if there was no interest regarding
the equipment the contractor can do as he chooses. Further he stated that the demolition contractors are
experienced on finding deals for reuse of that type of equipment.
Steve Sovak also stated that you must be clear in the documents what the intent is, because if it is to be
removed and given to an outside party the contractor would have to provide the information and would
have to reflect it in his bid.
Commissioner Goslin asked Walker Johnson, Principal, Johnson-Lasky Architects, to comment on the
historical significance, if any on the facades.
Walker Johnson stated that as far as he knows, it is terra cotta; and it is cracked, fragile and pieces have
fallen off the building. Further, he stated that if the fac;;ade is to be removed and reused it needs to be
taken apart carefully.
Commissioner Goslin asked what would be involved in restoring the building into a condition that would
make it safe and would restore it to its original design purpose.
Walker Johnson stated that the first job you would have to do is to provide a detailed exterior condition
report; second the elements that are in danger of falling would be removed at the point at which they were
being examined and some temporary patches would be made; third you would need to reorder
replacement pieces; fourth the investigator would decide on how to repair or stabilize the remaining
elements.
Commissioner Goslin asked if this would be a job that could be completed m a weekend or 1s it
something that would take longer to complete.
Mr. Johnson stated that if it's removed it would take from three to six months.

2465

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 4, 2003

Commissioner Daley asked if Mr. Johnson was able to check with the hospital archives to see where the
murals could be.
Mr. Johnson stated that he attempted to, but the hospital had no records.
Commissioner Suffredin asked if the information is strong enough to put the building on the National
Register.
Walker Johnson stated that he couldn't answer the question.
Commissioner Hansen asked Mr. LaMont to contact the Art Institute and the Historical Society regarding
the search for the picture.
Commissioner Moreno asked Gary Mundinger of McDonough Associates if he knew how much money,
and for what projects the money was directed to in order to maintain the stability and the sound condition
of the hospital from that point to the present.
Mr. Mund inger stated that he couldn't answer the commissioner's question at this time. But he does
know that there was a lot of work done to stabilize and maintain the hospital in a safe condition, as well as
meet code requirements or code demands by the various regulatory officials when it was the hospital.
Commissioner Moreno stated that the cost estimate indicated that it would take approximately $200
million dollars in 1998 dollars to bring it up to speed to comply with the codes in existence at that time.
Gary Mundinger stated that he was not the one that put together the 2002 report. He would have to go
back and look at the report.
Commissioner Hansen asked what type of problems did McDonough see with the nurses building, that is
now the administration building.
Mr. Mundinger stated that he believes that he saw very similar problems in all of the buildings. The
mechanical systems and plumbing systems were original systems which all outlived their live expectancy
of 50 years. There was deterioration of the windows and roofing, however he does not recall a specific
issue related to structural. He does recall that the floor-to-floor heights in the nurses building are very
limited when you get above the second or third floor for a long time there was discussion about providing
air conditioning in the building and the limitation of floor-to-floor height made it difficult to
accommodate any sort of centralized air conditioning system.
Vice Chaimrnn Butler called on Mr. Kehar S. Soodan, President, Soodan & Associates to address the
exterior fa9ade issues.
Commissioner Moreno asked Mr. Soodan if his contract with Cook County recommended to do cost
analysis that would involve maintaining the fa9ade throughout the forty buildings.
Kehar Soodan stated not at this time.
Commissioner Moreno asked Mr. Soodan if he had an opinion as to what it would cost to make safe the
fa9ade at Cook County Hospital.
Mr. Soodan stated that it would require further investigation, you would have to go over every square
inch of the exterior.

2466

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 4, 2003

Commissioner Moreno asked what would the further investigation cost going by square inch.
Mr. Soodan stated that at this time he doesn' t have an answer. He further stated that it would probably
take over a couple of months to complete the report; it would be done on a swing stage with the engineers
and architects, which are the ones that would be looking at the work that is completed. Finally the data
would be put together with cameras and different instruments; and then we would attempt the cost
estimate. Mr. Soodan stated when the Cook County Building was done it cost over $200,000.
Commissioner Hansen asked to what degree a landmark preservation issue is taken up formally by the
Medical District and how is it rated when you need to come to a conclusion on such a thing as demolition
of the old hospital; or is not taken into consideration.
Tom Livingston, Director, Illinois Medical District Commission, stated that the Medical District would
normally defer to other Federal and State designations on landmark status. If there is something that has a
landmark status and has been designated by an outside official body, the Medical District would respond.
But their aren ' t any internal policies about landmark preservation, because of the fact that there are other
individuals that the Medical District works with.
Commissioner Steele asked what is the Illinois Medical District Commission mandated to do.
Tom Livingston stated that the Illinois Medical District is mandated to conduct programming and
practices, which encourage the development of research facilities, treatment facilities in an integrated
manner within the 560-acre Medical District. Also the Medical District is directly mandated to operate
the Chicago Technology Park, which includes five or six buildings for small healthcare related
commercial businesses that are growing. In closing he stated that their agency is a combination of
overlay zoning responsibility, which is officially designated in their act and also economic development.
Commissioner Steele asked if development of condominiums is included.
Mr. Livingston stated that condominiums are not allowable.
Commissioner Moreno asked if a landmark building causes a problem or hinders the overall plan of the
Medical District.
Tom Livingston stated that the Illinois Medical District would have to take into consideration any sort of
outside officially designated individual, Federal, State, City or County that would designate any edifice in
the Medical District of that nature. Further he stated that the Medical District is not a unilateral
organization. The Medical District has an act that must be followed in tenns of growth and
redevelopment.
Commissioner Moreno asked if the Illinois Medical District would do anything outside of their charge
that would require an amendment to the enabling statute that created the District in order to be completed.
Mr. Livingston stated that it would depend on the degree and scope. But likely the Medical District
would have to amend legislatively the act.
Chairman Sims asked if there was a development of the old Cook County Hospital other than medical;
and there was a need in the District to build a research center later, where would the Illinois Medical
District have to reach out to in order to develop the research center.

2467

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 4, 2003

Tom Livingston stated that the Medical District would reach out for new research space that would be in a
new facility in the District Development Area, which is south of Roosevelt Road.
Vice Chairman Butler asked if a traffic study has been conducted in tenns of traffic patterns and parking
relative to a proposed new use of the old building.
Tom Livingston stated that there has not been one attached with the new use of the old building; but
several traffic studies have been conducted which assume that the old hospital would be demolished.
Under the current circumstances traffic has been chronically problematic in the area on Harrison Street in
front of the old hospital, which has long been cited as a problem that would be mitigated when the old
hospital had been demolished.

Commissioner Hansen stated that the County ' s own Planning Department needs to address the disparity
in costs between cost per square foot between what they have cited, $240, and the figures that Ronald
Shipka gave.
Vice Chainnan Butler asked Michael LaMont to address the commissioners regarding the figures .
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding that the figures may reflect on the credibility
of the Administration, Michael LaMont, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy, stated the Office
of Capital Planning and Policy has not been asked at any time to conduct exhaustive studies for the reuse
of the old hospital building. It has previously stated the numbers that were used are over I 5 years old and
the consultants who were asked at that time to look at the reuse of the building versus building a new
hospital. The report dates back to 1988. From those numbers, which he stated that he couldn' t speak to,
the Board relied upon those numbers at that time in terms of building a new hospital or rehabbing the old,
the numbers merely escalated, those numbers from I988 to 2003. Nothing else was done to those
numbers.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the hearing has been very productive.
Commissioner Moreno stated that before the County proceeds anywhere, he thinks that the County should
confer with the Illinois Medical District and the City of Chicago, to see whether or not the legal
requirements that the County has been bound to and accepted for the construction and licensing of the
new hospital can be amended. Then it would be appropriate to consider the RFP's.
Vice Chairman Butler asked Michael LaMont to give the developers instructions on how they can sign up
to go through the old hospital and purchase whatever materials· are available.

2468

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 4, 2003

Michael LaMont stated that there was a sign up sheet outside of the boardroom and about 10 developers
had signed up. The purpose of the sign up sheet was to get the address and telephone numbers of the
developers for the purpose of conducting the site tour. The developers will be contacted and a packet of
infonnation will be sent out for a site tour. Further he stated that the developers would have to sign
waiver of release forms for any individuals who want to come into the building. Once the material is
received back by August 1, the Office of Capital Planning and Policy, based on that information they will
be able to determine how many walk-throughs are needed. The walk-through will be from the basement
to the roof of the main hospital building only.
Michael LaMont stated that there was a sheet on the sign up table that indicated the reports that have been
done and the available documentation on the hospital. Mr. LaMont stated that the entire reports are being
made available at Cushing & Company for anyone who wishes to obtain a copy for a cost.
Vice Chairman Butler thanked everyone for coming. He stated that for ten years the Commissioners have
known that the old hospital would be demolished. He stated that he does not have a personal problem
with doing either thing. But it sounds as though that the Commissioners have made a decision in a
vacuum and that the Commissioners did not consider any of the alternatives that have been presented and
that is not true.
Additionally, Vice Chairman Butler stated that the County still does not know the value of the land or are
we just giving it to the developers or are they prepared to purchase it, and how much will it cost. Finally,
he stated whatever the decision of the Board, he hopes that it would be in the best interest of the tax
payers and not in the interest of personal gain for the developers, or personal honors for those who have to
vote one way or the other.
Vice Chairman Butler stated that the questions he raised about traffic are serious to him, and it is a
consideration that has not been discussed and it needs to be discussed. He asked the developers that when
they come back with their proposals to include traffic and parking.
Chairman Sims thanked everyone for coming and giving their presentation. Further she stated that like
Vice Chairman Butler, she is also concerned about the parking for the doctors and the people that come to
the hospital and can't find a parking space.
Commissioner Hansen moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 4, 2003

Commissioner Hansen stated that the County ' s own Planning Department needs to address the disparity
in costs between cost per square foot between what they have cited, $240, and the figures that Ronald
Shipka gave.
Chainnan Butler asked Michael LaMont to address the commissioners regarding the figures.
In response to Commissioner Hansen' s question regarding that the figures may reflect on the credibility
of the Administration, Michael LaMont, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy, stated the Office
of Capital Planning and Policy has not been asked at any time to conduct exhaustive studies for the reuse
of the old hospital building. It has previously stated the numbers that were used are over 15 years old and
the consultants who were asked at that time to look at the reuse of the building versus building a new
hospital. The report dates back to 1988. From those numbers, which he stated that he couldn' t speak to,
the Board relied upon those numbers at that time in tenns of building a new hospital or rehabbing the old,
the numbers merely escalated, those numbers from 1988 to 2003. Nothing else was done to those
numbers.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the hearing has been very productive.
Commissioner Moreno stated that before the County proceeds anywhere, he thinks that the County should
confer with the lllinois Medical District and the City of Chicago, to see whether or not the legal
requirements that the County has been bound to and accepted for the construction and licensing of the
new hospital can be amended. Then it would be appropriate to consider the RFP' s.
Chainnan Butler asked Michael LaMont to give the developers instructions on how they can sign up to go
through the old hospital and purchase whatever materials are available.
Michael LaMont stated that there was a sign up sheet outside of the boardroom and about I 0 developers
had signed up. The purpose of the sign up sheet was to get the address and telephone numbers of the
developers for the purpose of conducting the site tour. The developers will be contacted and a packet of
infonnation will be sent out for a site tour. Further he stated that the developers would have to sign
waiver of release forms for any individuals who want to come into the building. Once the material is
received back by August 1, the Office of Capital Planning and Policy, based on that infonnation they will
be able to detennine how many walk-throughs are needed. The walk-through will be from the basement
to the roof of the main hospital building only.
Michael LaMont stated that there was a sheet on the sign up table that indicated the reports that have been
done and the available documentation on the hospital. Mr. LaMont stated that the entire reports are being
made available at Cushing & Company for anyone who wishes to obtain a copy for a cost.
Chainnan Butler thanked everyone for coming. He stated that for ten years the Commissioners have
known that the old hospital would be demolished . He stated that he does not have a personal problem
with doing either thing. But it sounds as though that the Commissioners have made a decision in a
vacuum and that the Commissioners did not consider any of the alternatives that have been presented and
that is not true.
Additionally, Chairman Butler stated that the County still does not know the val ue of the land or are we
just giving it to the developers or are they prepared to purchase it, and how much will it cost. Finally, he
stated whatever the decision of the Board, he hopes that it would be in the best interest of the tax payers
and not in the interest of personal gain fo r the developers, or personal honors for those who have to vote
one way or the other.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 4, 2003
Chairman Butler stated that the questions he raised about traffic are serious to him, and it is a
consideration that has not been discussed and it needs to be discussed. He asked the developers that when
they come back with their proposals to include traffic and parking.
Commissioner Sims thanked everyone for coming and giving their presentation. Further she stated that
like Chainnan Butler, she is also concerned about the parking for the doctors and the people that come to
the hospital and can' t find a parking space.
Commissioner Hansen moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

DES PLAINES VALLEY MOSQUITO ABATEMENT DISTRICT (APPOINTMENT).
Transmitting a Communication, dated June I 0, 2003 from John H. Stroger, Jr., President,
Cook County Board of Commissioners:
I hereby appoint Mr. EMANUEL "CHRIS" WELCH to the Des Plaines Valley Mosquito
Abatement District, for a tenn to expire December 1, 2004.
I submit this communication for your approval.

Mr. Welch stated the following:
To the Honorable John H. Stroger, Jr. , County Recorder of Deeds Eugene "Gene" Moore, Chairman
Suffredin and Commissioners, thank you for this opportunity to speak to such an esteemed Body this
morning. An opportunity like this one comes along on very rare occasions, and with all the other
qualified people that could have been considered, I am humbled and proud of the fact that I have been
chosen to be with you here today. As such, if I am appointed to the Des Plaines Valley Mosquito
Abatement District, I will not disappoint you. I will not disappoint you because, I truly believe in this
community, in which I have spent my entire life. Thirty-two years ago I was born in Melrose Park and
shortly after I was born my family moved to Maywood. When I was just about to enter the eight grade,
my family moved to Bellwood, where many of my family still reside today. lam a graduate of Roosevelt
Junior High School in Bellwood, Provi so West High School in Hillside, Northwestern University in
Evanston, and John Marshall Law School in Chicago. As you can see, Cook County, Proviso Township
and the entire Des Plaines Valley Mosquito Abatement District is in my blood, because this is the
community in which I' ve lived my entire life.
After graduating from Law School in 1997, I joined the Law Finn of Sanchez and Daniels, where I
worked for six years, until I left in June of this year to join the Firm of James J. Roach and Associates.
My practice of law has focused on personal injury cases, consumer fraud cases, real estate matters and
municipal and school law. Shortly after graduating from law school in 1999 I purchased a home in
Hillside, and quickly started looking for ways to give back to my community. Since 2000, I have served
as Chainnan of the Hillside Human Relations Commission, and in 200 I I was elected to the Proviso
Township High School District 209 Board of Education, serving Proviso East and Proviso West High
Schools. From November 2001 to April 200 I I served the Board as the Vice President, and this year my
colleagues unanimously elected me as Board President. As President of the District 209 School Board, I
am proud to say that in less than two full years on the Board, my colleagues and l have put policies into
place that have led to grades improving twelve percent in just one quarter. The average daily attendance
rose fourteen percentage points in just one year from a dismal 80% to 94%, and we have increased
parental involvement to an all-time high, among other things that we have accomplished. As a result of
our work on the Board the last two years, our slate of candidates swept the April I, 2003 election, and
broke all time records for tum out for a school board race in Proviso Township.
Commissioners, I believe my love for this community, my legal background, and my experience working
on governmental boards will make me an excellent member of the Des Plaines Valley Mosquito
Abatement District. As a member of this community and a leader to many in Proviso Township, I believe
people want to live in communities that are safe and free from harm. With the fear of the West Nile virus
prevalent among us, we need someone on the Abatement District who will always remember to be
accountable, responsible, and committed to the community. Commissioners, if you honor me with your
vote I will work hard to make all of you proud. Thank you very much.

Commissioner Gorman moved to approve the nomination, seconded by Commissioner Sims.
