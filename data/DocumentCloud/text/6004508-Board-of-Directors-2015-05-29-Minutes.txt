During the presentation of public testimony, Chairman Hammock provided comments in response to testimony presented
regarding Agenda Item VI(B), proposed negotiated wages and healthcare changes for SEIU Local 73. He stated that this
Board is interested in comprehensively reviewing the item, and approving or not approving the item with the full facts
and information. The primary reason why the Human Resources Committee did not act on the item on May 22nd is that it
did not have comprehensive comparative data showing how these benefits and this compensation compared to other
organizations. This information is relevant for comparisons, so the Committee asked staff to go back to provide
additional information to satisfy the Committee/Board as to what the comparative data is. He stated that this Board is
going to expect that kind of comparative data each time it reviews whatever the compensation or benefits issues are for
any and all unions. It is not an unusual request; it is the primary criteria moving forward for these types of items.

VIII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (Attachment #8)
A.

Strategic Plan Progress

Dr. Shannon provided an update on several subjects; detail is included in Attachment #8.
Following the adjournment of closed session, Dr. Shannon provided the following comments.

I want to speak regarding two things - in response to some of the things you heard in public testimony today about the
status of nurse staffing, particularly at Stroger Hospital, and some untruths related to that, and secondly a brief notice on
C4.
I just want to remind the group, and I think we have shared this before, on April 30th, we were notified by the mediator
working on the NNOC negotiations with our leadership team, that the nurses had voted to authorize a one-day strike.
This followed on the heels of our settling with them on the influenza vaccination. I should point out, following up on
Dr. Mason’s comments, that I have spoken with the Director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, and the
Director for the Chicago Department of Public Health - both have voiced support of the notion to get the administrative
rules changed around healthcare workers and a mandatory vaccine. I hope that in the tumult of stuff going on at the
State level we can find time to do that.
Nonetheless, the nurses did vote to authorize a strike. They have not given us any information that they have any plans
to stage the strike or that they have scheduled a strike. I’ll also remind you that, should they give us that notice, the
typical practice would be a five-day advance notice of any kind of activity. We feel fairly confident, given that notice,
that we would be able to go to the Illinois Labor Relations Board, explain the circumstances, and get them to put in a
stop decree to that, for at least the high-risk, high-acuity areas like the Emergency Room (ER), Operating Room and
Med/Surg floors. What I do want to address is some of the stuff that has been brought up and propagated around the
campus and across the System by the nursing union, which I do take exception to.
First of all, I would point out that, when they talk about nurse vacancies, and massive amounts of overtime, that is
simply not true. We do not have any areas at Stroger or elsewhere today that we feel we are providing unsafe nurse
staffing levels. It is true that we use a whole variety of mechanisms to make sure we have appropriate nurse staffing
levels, and that includes staffing to acuity. So we do not, as they are recommending, follow a patient to nurse ratio –
that is an overly simplistic approach that we think is incorrect; in fact, what we do is we staff based on both the census
of the area and the acuity in the nursing services needed by those patients. This is what virtually every organization
does today, with the exception perhaps of places located in the State in California. If we find we have areas that are
relatively understaffed or it looks like they’re going to be understaffed, they will be covered in some combination of
either nurses floating from an area, where perhaps their census has dipped, or by in-house registry - these are nurses
familiar with the System, that will be able to plug a gap - or by nurses working overtime within the range that is allowed
by the Cook County recommendations about overtime. That range is 624 hours per year; that is 24 hours per 26 pay
periods. We think that if nurses go over that amount, particularly if they go way over that amount, we get worried about
nurses being tired and making mistakes, so we think that the overtime recommendations from the County on this are
appropriate. As a last option, we will call in registry nurses to plug the gap, but we do not have unsafe staffing. The
nursing union has put out and published comments that because of a smaller number of nurses we’ve had longer ER
waits; we have in fact shared with you over the past year, FY2014 in particular, that we’ve dropped our ER waits by
more than 35%, so that’s simply not true. A third claim is that nurses have been bargaining for a contract since
November 2012 and we’re unwilling to negotiate on
that5contract;
Page
of 103 this is also not correct.

VIII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (continued)
We have strong and significant differences with the nurses. In particular, I would say there are three areas where we are
far apart right now. One area is regarding the wage increase that they are asking for - dating back to 2012, they are
asking for a 5% per year wage increase every year of a five year contract (2012-2017). We don’t think that is right, and
we think it is not consistent with the scale that we’re paying compared to the market rates. The second area is on
staffing by number and ratio. As I mentioned, totally disagree on that. The third area that we have very significant
disagreements about is that the nursing union’s position has been that they want to use seniority as the primary decisionmaker about whether an applicant for a position gets the job; we simply disagree about that.
So we continue to bargain in good faith with the nursing union, but different from SEIU, AFSCME and a couple of the
other unions, we’re still pretty far apart. We’re doing our best, and we’re going to stay bargaining in good faith.
They’ve made a claim that the organization can’t hire nurses and that we’re not expending energy trying to attract and
fill nursing positions – that is just a crazy idea. You’ve heard in general, that it is taking us about five vacancy fills to
fill one position for nursing, because of the bumping from shift to shift, bid shifting, and the ability to go back within 90
days of getting a posting. The amount of inefficiency associated with that is very problematic. Additionally, to say that
we’re wasting money, which has been the implication, on marketing externally, is also incorrect. We are in a
competitive environment, and we are spending a very modest amount of money to in fact try to attract business, to fill
the place up, both in our Ambulatory and inpatient environment. I’m happy to answer any questions people might have
about this, but what we are trying to do is try to reach out to the nurses as best we can, and we’re trying to reach out to
the rest of the organization. The allusion that was made to the System Briefs - in fact, we did say a number of these
things, in a public email, to our employees, because we want our employees to be reassured that we are in fact trying to
do what we can to staff the place appropriately and everything else. I don’t know how much the nursing union
leadership is accurately and in a proportional way representing the nurse on the street or the nurse at the bedside, if you
will. We don’t have a good feel for what the degree of engagement of all the nurses is with the nursing union; we have
no idea how many nurses voted in the authorization for a strike, and the union won’t share that information with us.
On a different subject, here is a reminder and a more public acknowledgement and update on the agreement we entered
into with C4. You’ll recall, and we shared with you, that we entered into a provider agreement within the last few
weeks with C4, to provide behavioral counseling services for our CountyCare members, who are the traditional
Medicaid population. C4 has a long track record of effective community and home-based counseling that we think in
the long run aligns with our own behavioral health strategy, which is evolving. We are going to be giving a presentation
to you all in June on our overall behavioral health strategy and we’ll give you some background and information as it
relates to that, but again, just to give you the information that our arrangement with C4 is a provider agreement through
CountyCare, our Medicaid health plan, for the FHP and SPD populations. It is based on a per-member per-month rate,
for those behavioral health services. It is our hope, that in addition to doing that, that we as an organization will be able
to grow our own behavioral health strategy from the skills that C4 has. We think we’re doing this in a fiscally prudent
way, and in a way that both brings better services to our patients but also insulates the organization from financial risk.
We’re confident about that and as we go along in this relationship, we’ll have the ability to see how effectively C4 is
providing these services - if they’re not, we won’t continue with that agreement.

Presentation to the Cook County Health Hospital System Board

Friday, May 29, 2015

Good morning Ladies 8: Gentlemen. My name is Christine Boardman, and I am
the President of SEIU Local 73 which has members covered under ?ve (5)
different contracts within the Cook County Hospital system. Our last contracts
expired on November 30, 2012. It took a lot of work on both sides of the aisle,
to reach a satisfactory agreement. It was with great disappointment that I
learned that the motion to approve the ?ve (5) agreements was not passed by
the Human Resource Committee at one of your last meetings.

I have worked inside of Cook County since 1988. This goes back to George
Dunne days and includes all of the successive Presidents of the County Board,
including now President Toni Preckwinkle. Possibly some of you are unaware,
but for years the entire County has implemented the same health insurance
system for every single bargaining unit throughout the County. This also
includes all non-union employees throughout the County. This also means that
the County has the legal obligation to bargain fairly with each unit and their
exclusive representative. This includes every Union in the County, Teamsters,
AFSCME, NNOC and the skilled trades.

Bargaining is a two-way street. We did not get everything that we wanted in
the contracts, and neither did management. And this applies to every section
of the contract. Failure to approve these contracts will result in extreme
discord amongst our members, who did ratify the agreements. We have
attempted to work with the hospital system. The entire Board of
Commissioners of Cook County unanimously approved all of our agreements
which include the Of?ce of the President, and joint employers that are elected
of?cials, such as the Recorder of Deeds, Cook County Sheriff, Cook County
Clerk, and Cook County Treasurer.

I strongly urge you to approve of these contracts today. Thank you.

COOK COUNTY-HEALTH
8: HOSPITALS SYSTEM



JOHN JAY SHANNON, MD

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

COOK COUNTY HEALTH HOSPITALS SYSTEM
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

May 29, 2015

Recognition

In April 2014, Dr. Sharon Irons, General Medicine Clinic (GMC) Director, organized a GMC team of care
providers consisting of 2 champion Physician providers Dr. Patrika Smith and Dr. Sonia Tanwar; as well
as 2 Nurse Practitioner providers, Shelby Strong and Karlene Schowalter. Using the Mapp registry to
help identify our at-risk Diabetic patient population, GMC launched a pilot program entitled "The
Diabetic Nine's Program." The initial pilot focused on two GMC physician-patient panels with the goal
of improving Diabetic patient outcomes. By summer 2014, GMC initiated a partnership with the
American College of Physicians (ACP) to work toward the goal oftransforming our practice delivery of
Diabetes care to our patients. This partnership has provided phenomenal support to our champions as
well as a more intense overall Ql approach to Diabetes care through the inclusion of GMC

Champions in hands-on, patient-centered workshops.

As a result of this work, GMC Diabetic outcomes are trending toward meeting national goals in
Glycostylated Hemoglobin counts. In May 2015, the GMC Diabetic Team was nationally
recognized by the American College of Physicians for the team?s excellence in quality improvement as
well as for their efforts and commitment to Diabetic care. The GMC team continues is working to
expanding this effort in other parts of the system.

Additionally, Drs. Suja Mathews, Patrika Smith and Pierko from the Department of Medicine
were named American College of Physicians (ACP) Quality Champions at the ACP annual meeting for
work done improving the care of diabetic patients at 

We have received formal notification from The Joint Commission of our Primary Care Medical Home
certification for ambulatory sites. The PCMH model will be expanded in all of our health centers
in the coming months. The surveyor remarked that Prieto was more prepared than any other clinic
attempting first-time certification than any she had ever surveyed. Team members include Drs. Krishna
Das, Juliet Bradley, Shivani Kamdar, Irv Pikelny, nurses Irene Marks, Ellen Costello, Suzanne
Contreras-Hoffman, Marisa Perez, Mercy? Kuriakose and Denise Gilbert. Edie Johns, Kisonah Smith,
Veronica Rivera and Maria Vasquez provided critical administrative leadership to the effort.

Dr. Krishna Das, Chief Quality Officer for Cook County Health Hospitals System was named
to Becker?s Hospital Review list of ?50 Experts Leading the Field of Patient Safety.? This national list
recognizes preeminent health care providers, administrators, researchers, professors and advocates
working to advance patient safety.

As a member of the Hospital Quality and Patient Safety committee ofthe Society for Hospital
Medicine, Dr. Das helped develop the Choosing Wisely guidelines for Hospital Medicine to educate
consumers and drive high value care at a national level. She also led collaboration with
America?s Essential Hospitals as part of the Essential Hospital Engagement Network, a Partnership for
Patients initiative supported by the Centers for Medicare 8: Medicaid Services to reduce harm events in
safety net hospitals, achieving drastic reductions in several measures of harm. Dr. Das is a practicing
hospitalist, in addition to her role as System Chief Quality Officer.

Congratulations to Dr. Thomas Patrianakos, Division Chair of Ophthalmology for being named one of
the "40 Under 40? by Ophthalmologist Magazine. In addition to his busy clinical duties, he is a
dedicated mentor to future ophthalmologists and those-in-training. Dr. Patrianakos was the 
Doctor of the Year in 2014.

One of his nominators stated: ?Thomas has trained and inspired many young ophthalmologists, not
only clinically, but academically. Through functions and newsletters, he remains influential to his past
graduates.? A frequent lecturer on glaucoma and general ophthalmology, he has many published
articles and aims to uncover better ways to teach ophthalmologists in training; as well as to improve
the surgical treatment of glaucoma.

Internal Medicine Jeopardy, known popularly as "Doctor's Dilemma", is a competition modeled along
the lines of the famous TV quiz show, "Jeopardy". The questions can range anywhere from the history
of medicine to latest drug discoveries and trials, to names of heart murmurs and medicine literature.
Preparation for this competition is intense, and the greatest skill is to master the art of quickly pressing
the "buzzer" and having the right strategy while planning which questions to answer, because each
wrong answer has negative marks. Our team has won the "Regional" Jeopardy
Championships for the past 2 years from a group of 17 other residency programs. This year?s regional
finals were against Loyola University and Northwestern University which our team won handily. At the
National Championship, we competed against 48 other teams and made it to the semi-finals for the
first time where Cleveland Clinic squeaked out the win.

Congratulations to the members of the team: Sharath Vipparthy, Amith George Jacob, and
Sriman Swarup.

Activities and Announcements

- On April 28th, welcomed an evaluation committee for a two day CLER (Clinical Learning
Environment Review) visit. CLER is a program of the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical
Education (ACGME) designed to raise the quality and safety of the residents? training milieu. The belief
is that the learning environment shapes the doctor?s future performance in the areas of patient safety
and quality as well as professionalism. In addition to many hours touring the hospital floors, units,
emergency room, and even the operating room, the committee spent 4.5 hours questioning residents,
faculty, and program directors in large group sessions.

The evaluation committee found that we had made progress since the visit 18 months earlier and
acknowledged a high rate of "near miss? reporting by resident physicians, and their high a rate of
participation in GI projects Additionally, we will implement several of the committee?s
recommendations to increase resident involvement. A written report is expected shortly.

On April 30th, we were notified by the mediator assigned to the bargaining table that the
nurses voted to authorize a one day strike. System leadership has contingency plans in place to ensure
the continuity of services should NNOC leadership decide to call a strike.

On May 20th, the Cook County Board referred to their Labor Committee proposed Collective Bargaining
Agreements with SEIU for the 2012-2017 term. The contracts will be considered by the Cook
County Labor Committee after consideration by the Cook County Health Hospitals System Board.

Wednesday, June 10th is the next regular meeting of the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

Earlier this month, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled a 2013 state pension reform law unconstitutional.
This will result in an additional shortfall for the next fiscal year, bringing the total estimated deficit to
$6.6 billion in state fiscal year 2016.

Earlier this week Senate Bill 788 House Amendment 2 was filed. This Medicaid omnibus bill includes
cuts to the Medicaid program, including a 2.25 percent rate reduction for many Medicaid providers,
excluding hospitals. Reductions to other programs and social services affecting Illinois residents,
including the 5.2 million who live in Cook County, are still being debated.

May 315t is the last day of the Illinois General Assembly's Spring 2015 session. After May 31, the
legislature goes into "overtime session? and legislation will require a 3/5ths majority to pass. At this
time, it is unclear when the legislature will adjourn.

Federal

In April, Congress approved HR 2, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015. The act
removed the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) methodology in determining the formula for payment for
physician services and extended CHIP financing. The Act also amended the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act to extend through FY2017 funding for Community Health Centers and the National
Health Service Corps. Congress used a budget accounting maneuver by delaying the scheduled
reductions in payments to hospitals serving a disproportionate number of Medicaid beneficiaries and
the uninsured, called Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSH), by one year from 2017 to 2018.

Delaying these cuts further allows the 960 county-supported hospitals and others that serve Medicaid
beneficiaries and the uninsured across the country to continue to stabilize local health care systems.

In early May, Congress passed the FY2016 Budget Resolution. The budget resolution sets the level of
discretionary spending and is a blueprint for changes in revenues and entitlement spending. Congress
must take further actiOn, Reconciliation, to implement appropriations for discretionary spending
and make substantive changes in revenues and entitlements to fulfill the blueprint.

Key elements of the resolutions include repeal ofthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)
and repeal of Medicaid expansion. Alternatively, the resolution suggests the block?granting Medicaid
through new "State Flexibility Funds" with the Children?s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
consolidated into Medicaid. Although not explicitly described, the committees ofjurisdiction might
consider several Medicaid provisions that states use to ensure sufficient funding for Medicaid eligibles
and the cost of serving the uninsured.

The current schedule for relevant committees to report their proposed revenue and entitlement
changes is July 15, 2015. However, Congress will not begin to consider the reconciliation of the budget
resolution in earnest until after the Supreme Court rules on King v. Burwell, deciding the status of the
subsidies for individuals purchasing insurance through the Federal Exchange. There are discussions
among Republican lawmakers on how to address the ACA should the Supreme Court rule out the
subsidies.

Congress has held hearings and there have been discussions about how the Section 3408
Pharmaceutical Discount Program is operating. Most of the discussion concerns the transparency of
pricing and the growth of drugs used in outpatient clinics that have come under the ownership of
eligible hospitals.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for the Cook County Health Hospitals System at both
the State and Federal level.
