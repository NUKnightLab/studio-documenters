G. Finance Committee Meeting, September 20, 2019
i. Metrics (Attachment #5)
ii. Meeting Minutes, which include the following action items and report:
 Contracts and Procurement Items (detail was provided as an attachment to this Agenda)
 Proposed Transfers of Funds, as amended
 Proposed Resolutions regarding Cook County Health bank accounts
Director Reiter presented the Meeting Minutes for the Board’s consideration. He noted that a Substitute Transfer of
Funds is being presented, so that item will be separated from the Finance Committee Meeting Minutes and will be
considered separately.
Director Reiter, seconded by Director Koetting, moved to separate the Transfers of Funds
item from the September 20, 2019 Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Reiter, seconded by Director Munar, moved to accept the Substitute Transfers of
Funds.
Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed the Substitute Transfer of Funds. At the Finance Committee
Meeting, they had reviewed the proposed transfers listed at the top of the document; the Substitute Transfer of Funds
includes an additional transfer based on an agreement with the County Budget Director that these funds are available
for transfer; this brings the total transfer amount to $80 million.
Dr. Shannon stated that there is a State Statute that puts a time limit on a point at which the County budget (which
includes the Health System and Health Plan budget) can be modified; it can only be modified within thirty (30) days
after passage, so there is a limit on what can be spent. CountyCare’s revenues significantly exceed the expenses of
the Plan, so the Plan is financially quite healthy; however, the challenge is that the administration underestimated in
the actual allocation that was approved by the County Board the amount of external claims that would need to be
paid. There are assets that have been received for CountyCare, but the Plan is bumping up against an appropriation
limit. By taking these funds that have been appropriated but are not going to be spent, and moving them into the
CountyCare line, the administration is thus able to make those funds flow. For the record, and at the request of
Acting Chair Richardson-Lowry, Jeff McCutchan, General Counsel, concurred that the System is within its authority
to transfer these funds.

Finance Committee Meeting, September 20, 2019 (continued)
On the motion to accept the Substitute Transfers of Funds, a vote was taken and THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Reiter, seconded by Director Koetting, moved to approve the Substitute Transfers
of Funds. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Charles Jones, Chief Procurement Officer, provided a brief overview of the contractual requests considered at the
Finance Committee Meeting. Additionally, he reviewed the report on minority and women-owned business
enterprise (M/WBE) participation and quarterly report of purchases made under the authority of the Chief Executive
Officer. It was noted that there are four (4) contractual requests pending review by Contract Compliance (request
numbers 4, 5, 16 and 17) contained within the Finance Committee Meeting Minutes.
During the discussion of the quarterly report of purchases made under the authority of the Chief Executive Officer,
Acting Chair Richardson-Lowry inquired regarding the contract with The Exeter Group – TMN, LLC, for cultural
competency and implicit training services. Wayne Wright, Director of Organizational Development and Training,
provided information on the scope of the services provided under the contract. The vendor will assess the
organization’s needs and develop content for a 2.5 hour course that will be rolled out to all management, hopefully
before November of this year; the course will then be pared down for a train-the-trainer session that will go out to
all of CCH’s workforce before the conclusion of 2020.
For the record, Director Suleiman Gonzalez expressed concerns regarding the vendor’s capacity to be able to address
issues of immigration, immigrant groups and language capacity. Following further discussion, Acting Chair
Richardson-Lowry stated that the Human Resources Committee will bring the subject forward for a more robust
review and discussion, to assuage any concerns that have been expressed by Directors on the subject.
Mr. Akpan reviewed the metrics and proposed banking resolutions that were recommended for approval by the
Finance Committee.
At this point, Director Deer raised a point of personal privilege to introduce the following visitors who were on the
premises for a tour of the Stroger Campus: Hon. Stanley Moore, Cook County Commissioner, and Hon. Natalie Hall,
Fulton County Commissioner. He noted that Commissioner Hall is the niece of former Cook County Board President
John H. Stroger, Jr.
Director Reiter, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the approval of the Minutes of
the Meeting of the Finance Committee of September 20, 2019, as amended. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

CY19 Q2

SIR (Standardized Infection Ratio) is a summary
measure which compares the actual number of
Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) in a facility
with the baseline data for standard population. SIR >
1.0 indicates more HAIs were observed than predicted,
conversely SIR of < 1.0 indicates that fewer HAIs were
observed than predicted.

 CCH Board Meeting September 2019
Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer
September 27, 2019

 Observations on Financials
Net Patient Service Revenues - $455M, 5% unfavorable to target due to increasing and unsustainable growth in
charity care, some lower clinical activity and lower revenue cycle activity

•

System-wide uninsured numbers
•

Captured by Visits, held at 44%

•

Captured by Charges, held at 40%

CountyCare Capitation Revenues - $1.2B, 4% unfavorable to target due to lower than budgeted enrollment as a
result of lower State/County MCO enrollment
Other Revenues - $3.8M , ongoing review of outstanding payments to ensure we get caught up by year end

Cost of Pharma - $52, favorable by 4% compared to budget

 Other Key Progress
•

•

•

Kicked off Task Force in May 2019 with over 20 Cook County
depts/agencies and key local food system stakeholders represented
Initiated baseline assessments with Cook County Health (CCH), the
Sheriff’s Office (CCSO), and Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC)
Provided technical assistance to the Bureau of Asset Management in
integrating GFPP language into contract up for renewal

 Challenges and Opportunities
We Lack
• Established guidelines, as
this is a cutting edge strategy

• Data related to local food
systems, especially for
suburban Cook County
• Additional resources to
implement this initiative; we
are relying on existing
resources and partnerships

We Need To Build
•

Inclusive, values-based procurement
process within Cook County

•

Readiness and capacity of local food
producers/businesses owned by people of
color or residing in low- to moderateincome communities to meet Good Food
standards and supply chain requirements

•

Idea that good food is a right, instead
of just a privilege
16

 Next Steps
•

•

•

•

Complete baseline assessments with CCH, CCSO, and JTDC
Continue to act on incorporating GFPP language in vendor solicitations
and contracts
Work to increase readiness and capacity of local food producers and
businesses of color or from low to moderate-income communities
Finalize evaluation plan and secure resources for implementation
