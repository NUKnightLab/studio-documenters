Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

units have polished surface and can be coated to match the historic
color and finish of the terra cotta; and,
2. Per the mock-up reviewed by staff the applicant may use Edison
Coating Elastowall-351 as a base coating and Aquathane-UA 210 as
the top coating to match the color and reflectivity of the historic terra
cotta. All products are to be applied per manufacturer’s specifications.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

2. All of the storefront glazing, including the panel above the southern
storefront entry (with no canopy), shall be clear vision glass;
3. The new upper-floor windows shall be double-hung windows as

transom windows if possible, or replace them to match if beyond

bars. Existing and proposed storefront details with dimensioned
exterior profiles shall be submitted with the permit application;
3. As proposed, the existing historic cast iron columns in Bay A shall be
retained and reinstalled to accommodate a new storefront system.
Since no evidence exists that cast iron columns were historically
utilized for the remaining storefronts, columns proposed for new
storefront bays may either be simplified in design to not replicate the
historic columns or may be eliminated;
4. As proposed, the new second floor windows shall match the existing
windows in size, glass size, operation, muntin arrangement and muntin
size. Existing and proposed details of exterior profiles and interior
spacer bars shall be submitted with the permit application; and,
