APPROVED AS AMENDED
Transmitting a Communication, dated January 28, 2007 from
THOMAS J. GLASER, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Health Services
ROBERT R. SIMON, M.D., Interim Chief, Bureau of Health Services
requesting approval of payment in the amount of $164,923.00 to Varian Medical Systems, Des Plaines,
Illinois, for the purchase of hardware and software upgrades including the Aria oncology information
system and software licenses including the installation, training and thirty-six (36) months of software
support for the Department of Radiology, Radiation Division.
Reason:

Varian Medical Systems is the proprietary and sole licensor of this system necessary to
upgrade the Varis Vision radiation oncology information system owned by the hospital. The
hospital required immediate replacement of this system that was beyond repair for patient
safety in that it monitors the dose of radiation therapy given to patients. Without immediate
software upgrade, radiation therapy to cancer patients would have to have been stopped – an
absolutely untenable situation which would have left patients without this life-saving therapy.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $164,923.00. (717/897-540 Account).

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
COOK COUNTY PROMPT PAYMENT ACT
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 34, Article IV, Section
34-128 of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
Sec. 34-128. Cook County Prompt Payment Act.
(a) Payment of contractors. The appropriate Cook County official or agency receiving goods or
services must approve or disapprove a bill from a vendor or contractor for goods or services furnished to
the local governmental agency within 30 days after the receipt of such bill or within 30 days after the date
on which the goods or services were received, whichever is later. If one or more items on a construction
related bill or invoice are disapproved, but not the entire bill or invoice, then the portion that is not
disapproved shall be paid. When safety or quality assurance testing of goods by the local governmental
agency is necessary before the approval or disapproval of a bill and such testing cannot be completed
within 30 days after receipt of the goods, approval or disapproval of the bill must be made immediately
upon completion of the testing or within 60 days after receipt of the goods, whichever occurs first.
Written notice shall be mailed to the vendor or contractor immediately if a bill is disapproved.
(b) Failure to pay contractor. Any bill approved for payment pursuant to Subsection (a) shall be
paid within 30 days after the date of approval. If payment is not made within such 30 day period, an
interest penalty of 1% of any amount approved and unpaid shall be added for each month or fraction
thereof after the expiration of such 30 day period, until final payment is made.
(c) Failure to approve payment. If the Cook County official or agency whose approval is
required for any bill fails to approve or disapprove that bill within the period provided for approval by
Subsection (a), the penalty for late payment of that bill shall be computed from the date 60 days after the
receipt of that bill or the date 60 days after the goods or services are received, whichever is later.
(d) Agreement between County and contractor. The time periods specified in Subsections (a),
(b) and (c), as they pertain to particular goods or services, are superseded by any greater time periods as
agreed to by the County and the particular vendor or contractor.
(e) Funds controlled by the State. As authorized in 50 ILCS 505/7, if the funds from which the
Cook County official or agency is to pay for goods or services are funds appropriated or controlled by the
State, then the local governmental official or agency may certify to the State Treasurer, Comptroller and
State agency responsible for administering such funds that a specified amount is anticipated to be
necessary within 45 days after certification to pay for specified goods or services and that such amount is
not currently available to the local governmental official or agency. The State Treasurer, Comptroller and
State agency shall than expedite distribution of funds to the local governmental unit to make such
payments. The certification shall be mailed on the date of certification by certified U. S. mail, return
receipt requested. Any interest penalty incurred by the local governmental unit under Subsection (b) or (c)
because of the failure of funds to be distributed from the State to the local governmental unit within the
45 day period shall be reimbursed by the State to the local governmental unit as an amount in addition to
the funds to be otherwise distributed from the State.

ITEM #49 cont’d
(f) Payments to subcontractors and material suppliers; failure to make timely payments;
additional amount due. When a contractor receives any payment, the contractor shall pay each
subcontractor and material supplier in proportion to the work completed by each subcontractor and
material supplier their application less any retention. If the contractor receives less than the full payment
due under the public construction contract, the contractor shall be obligated to disburse on a pro rata basis
those funds received, with the contractor, subcontractors and material suppliers each receiving a prorated
portion based on the amount of payment. All interest payments received pursuant to Section 3 also shall
be disbursed to subcontractors and material suppliers to whom payment has been delayed, on a pro rata
basis. When, however, the public owner does not release the full payment due under the contract because
there are specific areas of work or materials the contractor is rejecting or because the contractor has
otherwise determined such areas are not suitable for payment, then those specific subcontractors or
suppliers involved shall not be paid for that portion of the work rejected or deemed not suitable for
payment and all other subcontractors and suppliers shall be paid in full.
If the contractor, without reasonable cause, fails to make any payment to his subcontractors
and material suppliers within 15 days after receipt of payment under the public construction contract, the
contractor shall pay to his subcontractors and material suppliers, in addition to the payment due them,
interest in the amount of 2% per month, calculated from the expiration of the 15 day period until fully
paid. This Section shall also apply to any payments made by subcontractors and material suppliers to
their subcontractors and material suppliers and to all payments made to lower tier subcontractors and
material suppliers throughout the contracting chain.
Effective Date. This Act takes effect immediately upon approval.
