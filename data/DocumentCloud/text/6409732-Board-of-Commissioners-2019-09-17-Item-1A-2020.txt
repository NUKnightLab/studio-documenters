Item No. 1A

Proposed FY2020 Moving To Work (MTW) Annual Plan

Presenter: Jennifer Hoyle, Director, Strategic Management

Recommendation
The Chief Executive Officer recommends that the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing
Authority approve the FY2020 Moving to Work (MTW) Annual Plan and authorize CHA to submit the
FY2020 MTW Annual Plan to HUD.
The requested action in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable Chicago
Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) regulations.
Background
As part of the MTW Agreement, CHA is required to submit an Annual Plan to HUD, due 75 days prior
to the start of CHA’s fiscal year. The MTW Annual Plan provides required information on planned
operations and activities for the fiscal year, including proposed new MTW activities that require
HUD approval
A 30-day public comment period was conducted from July 26 – August 27, 2019. CHA held three
public comment hearings during the public comment period: August 7th, August 14th and August
16th. Announcements for the public comment process appeared on CHA’s website and in the
Chicago Sun Times on Friday, July 26th; and Monday-Thursday, July 29th-August 1st; and Hoy
Newspapers on Friday, August 1st and 8th. CHA also distributed resident notices across public
housing properties and sent an email notification to HCV residents.
During the public comment period, residents and the general public were able to submit comments
orally and in writing regarding the proposed FY2020 MTW Annual Plan. Prior to finalizing the
proposed FY2020 MTW Annual Plan, CHA gave consideration to comments received during the
public comment period. Public comments and CHA responses will be provided to the Board prior to
approval and will be available to the public in the final plan amendment posted on CHA’s website
after Board approval and submission to HUD.
CHA has complied with the requirements of the Amended and Restated MTW Agreement and HUD
regulations regarding annual plans and amendments.
Respectfully Submitted:
