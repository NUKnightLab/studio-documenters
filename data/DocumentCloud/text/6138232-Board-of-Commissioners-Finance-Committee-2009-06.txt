BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 74
Taxation, Sec. 74-70 and 74-71 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as
follows:
Sec. 74-70.

Class 8a and 8b Designation / Assessment Class

(a) Class 8a. Real estate that is used primarily for industrial or commercial
purposes, which real estate would qualify for a class 8 designation pursuant to Sec.
74-62 thru Sec. 74-64, except for the fact that the qualifying use of the property
prior to application for the incentive does not comply with the definition of
abandoned property provided for in Sec.74-62(b), can receive a designation as a
class 8a property so long as the applicant can show that it has complied with all of
the requirements necessary to receive a class 8 designation per Sec. 74-62 thru
Sec. 74-64, except for meeting the definition of abandonment provided for in Sec.
74-62(b), but only when the Cook County Board of Commissioners provides a
resolution or ordinance in support of such designation absent abandonment.
(1)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a
resolution or ordinance in support of class 8a designation absent
abandonment when:
a.

an applicant who collects or transmits sales tax has obtained
from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
Cook County Board of Commissioners, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, an agreement to abate a
portion of the local government’s sales tax generated by the
industrial or commercial enterprise located on such real
estate and such abatement of sales tax must cover the
period of time for which the applicant would qualify for this
Class 8a incentive;

 FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
JUNE 16, 2009
PAGE 42

(2)

(3)

b.

applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners that due to national and
regional economic conditions beyond its control the industrial
or commercial enterprise has undergone a significant
reduction in net operating income of at least 40% in the year
it makes application for this incentive as compared to the
average net operating income of the industrial or commercial
enterprise in the prior three years;

c.

applicant provides objective and credible evidence including,
but not limited to, an economic impact study that
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that the ongoing industrial or commercial
enterprise is not economically viable and as such it will cease
operations within sixty-days of the submission of an eligibility
application for class 8a designation to the Cook County
Assessor, and thereafter the property will become vacant and
unused for an extended period of time of at least twenty-four
months; and

d.

applicant provides objective and credible evidence including,
but not limited to, an economic impact study that
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that designation as a class 8a property will
allow the industrial or commercial enterprise to be
economically viable and thereby continue its operations so
that the industrial or commercial enterprise can continue to
occupy and fully utilize the real estate for an extended period
of time.

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that industrial or commercial enterprise has
undergone a significant reduction in net operating income of
at least 40% in the year it makes application for the incentive
as compared to the average net operating income of the
industrial or commercial enterprise in the prior three years;

b.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that class 8a designation of the property is
necessary for the ongoing industrial or commercial enterprise
to continue its operations and that without such designation
the industrial or commercial enterprise would not be
economically viable causing the property to become vacant
and unused;

c.

a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners
that it supports and consents to the designation of the
property as a class 8a property absent an abandonment
requirement; and

d.

a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners
that it supports and consents to the application made to the
Cook County Assessor requesting designation as a class 8a
property absent an abandonment requirement.

county, and designation as a class 8a property is sought using the
provisions of this section, the municipality in which the real estate is
located must provide to the Cook County Assessor a resolution or
ordinance that contains the following:
a.

a finding by the municipality that it has determined that class
8a designation of the property is necessary for the ongoing
industrial or commercial enterprise to continue its operations

 FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
JUNE 16, 2009
PAGE 43
and that without such designation the industrial or
commercial enterprise would not be economically viable
causing the property to become vacant and unused;

(4)

b.

a statement by the municipality that it supports and consents
to the action by the Cook County Board of Commissioners to
support designation of the property as a class 8a property;

c.

a statement by the municipality that it supports and consents
to the class 8a application to the Cook County Assessor; and

Real estate receiving a class 8a designation pursuant to the
provisions of this section shall be assessed at the lowest percentage
of market value provided for in Section 74-64 (11), however the term
of the incentive will be limited to five years only and such class 8a
designation shall not be renewed.
a.

after the initial application has been approved and granted, if
the subject real estate receiving the class 8a designation
pursuant to the provisions of this section is sold or the
applicant transfers ownership of any portion of the property at
any time prior to the five year term of the 8a classification,
then the property’s 8a classification shall be subject to an
eligibility review by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, the municipality, and the Assessor under the
procedures set forth in this Ordinance for the remainder of
the 5 year term.

(5)

In order for real estate to qualify for a class 8a designation an
eligibility application must be made to the Cook County Assessor.

(6)

Class 8a designation can not be applied to real estate unless the
following has occurred: application is made to the Cook County
Assessor; all required municipal and county ordinances and
resolutions are provided to the Cook County Assessor; and the Cook
County Assessor determines that the real estate which is the subject
of the application for a class 8a designation would qualify for
designation as a class 8 property but for the inability to comply with
the definition of abandonment pursuant to Sec.74-62(b).

(7)

The Cook County Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this
section to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under class
8a.

(8)

Upon receipt of an eligibility application for a class 8a designation,
the Cook County Assessor shall forward such application and any
supporting documentation provided with such application to the
Cook County Board of Commissioners or its designee for
consideration as to whether the County Board will provide a
resolution or ordinance in support of a class 8a designation absent
abandonment.

(9)

Real estate receiving a class 8a designation pursuant to the
provisions of this section shall not be eligible for a class 8a
designation for any year prior to the assessment year for which an
application for the designation is made to the Cook County
Assessor.

The Cook County Board of Commissioners or its designee may
adopt rules consistent with this section that may be needed to
ensure proper review of information, data and documents submitted

ordinance in support of a class 8a designation as provided for in this
section.

(11)

an application for the following assessment years 2008, 2009, 2010,

 FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
JUNE 16, 2009
PAGE 44

any real estate as class 8a property for assessment year 2018 or
thereafter.

located on the property ceases operations and the subject real
estate becomes vacant and unused.

Real estate that receives a designation as a class 8a incentive
property will lose such designation and the corresponding reduced
level of assessment upon termination of the required partial sales tax
abatement by local government.

(14)

This Section 74-70 of the Real Estate Classification Ordinance will
become effective upon passage.

(b) Class 8b. Real estate that is used primarily for hospital purposes where
the property has been acquired for hospital use by an acquirer unrelated to the
disposer, thereby avoiding Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board discontinuation
approval, shall be considered for a class 8b designation if it meets the requirements
of this section and the Cook County Board of Commissioners provides a resolution
or ordinance in support of such designation.
(1)

(2)

(3)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a
resolution or ordinance in support of class 8b designation when:
a.

the applicant is a hospital as defined in the Hospital
Licensing Act that is licensed by the state, and the
abandonment of the hospital would require the applicant to
obtain a permit or exemption from the Illinois Health Facilities
Planning Board pursuant to the Illinois Health Facilities
Planning Act prior to discontinuing its operations and to
obtain a second permit or exemption prior to re-opening or
otherwise re-establishing the hospital after abandonment;
and

b.

the applicant demonstrated that approval of the class 8b
designation will materially increase the likelihood that the
property will be retained for hospital use with the associated
employment benefits relative to industrial or commercial use
of the property.

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that the applicant demonstrated that approval of
the class 8b designation will materially increase the likelihood
that the property will be retained for hospital use; and

b.

a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners
that it supports and consents to the designation of the
property as a class 8b property.

When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the
county, and designation as a class 8b property is sought using the
provisions of this section, the municipality in which the real estate is
located must provide to the Cook County Assessor a resolution or
ordinance that contains the following:
a.

a finding by the municipality that without a classification
having the impact of this section, special circumstances
inherent to hospitals including but not limited to efforts to
continue treatments, maintain access to emergency medical
and other health care services, and the unique requirement

 FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
JUNE 16, 2009
PAGE 45
that mandates that hospital operations are continually
maintained without interruption in order for the Illinois Health
Facilities Planning Board to issue a permit and licensure
approval for the continued operation of the hospital, will not
be addressed and the hospital will become vacant and
underutilized.
b.

a statement by the municipality finding a classification having
the impact of this section to be necessary for the
redevelopment of the subject hospital to occur; and

c.

a statement by the corporate authorities of municipality that
they support and consent to the filing of an application for a
classification having the impact of this section.
