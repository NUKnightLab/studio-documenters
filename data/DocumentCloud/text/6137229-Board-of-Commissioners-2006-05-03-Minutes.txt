PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, Cook County government is facing a serious budget crisis now and in the near future; and
WHEREAS, this budget crisis is caused by a variety of factors in part, but not limited to, ever escalating
healthcare costs that have reached double-digit figures within the last five years, exasperated by an
approximately $70 million loss from IGTs (Intergovernmental Transfers) for FY 2006 with an additional
loss of $30 million expected next year, which was earmarked for health services; and
WHEREAS, federal budget cuts in Medicaid and Medicare, create more indigent citizens with healthcare
needs, who turn to the County as their only option; and
WHEREAS, an estimated 1.8 million Jllinois State residents are uninsured, and of those with medical
coverage, as many as 40% do not have dental insurance; and
WHEREAS, Jack of preventive dental care often leads to more serious dental ailments, which in tum can
lead to serious health risks left untreated; and
WHEREAS, studies have shown that periodontal disease has been linked to increased risk for stroke,
diabetes, heart attack and worsening lung disease; and
WHEREAS, people with gingivitis and periodontal disease have a mortality rate that is 23% to 46%
higher than those who do not; and
WHEREAS, gum disease is the major cause of about 70% of adult tooth loss, affecting three out of four
people at some point in their life; and
WHEREAS, the burden of disease restricts activities in school, work, and home, and often significantly
diminishes the quality of life; and
WHEREAS, these citizens turn to the County' s health services, including costly emergency room visits
for treatment, despite the fact that most hospital emergency rooms do not have dentists on staff; and
WHEREAS, those patients with dental emergencies cannot be adequately treated by a medical doctor,
and may return several times to the emergency room, if they are unable to find access to a dentist; and
WHEREAS, Stroger Hospital of Cook County receives about 7 ,000 calls a month from people who wish
to see a dentist for serious dental ailments, but can serve only 11 % of that demand per month ; and
WHEREAS, currently only e ight of the County 's clinics offer dental care, and the demand for dental care
heavily outweighs the resources available to accommodate it; and
WHEREAS, despite the expansion of dental coverage for children in Illinois, 32% of third-graders in
Chicago bad untreated dental decay and 38% in suburban Cook County, according to the latest statewide
survey, completed in 2004; and
WHEREAS, Illinois Medicaid for adults does not cover preventive care and insurance coverage is more
limited compared to that for children.

6

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 3, 2006

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, does
hereby request a six month study, to be conducted by the Bureau of Health Services, to detem1ine how
many people go to county hospitals for illnesses caused by a lack of proper dental care and the cost to
treat them; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this study will also consider the cost of implementing a preventive
dental care system in Cook County clinics to lower the cost of these hospital visits.

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the Proposed Resolution be
referred to the Committee on Finance. (Comm. No. 278682). The motion carried unanimously.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, America's Baby Boomer generation is aging; and
WHEREAS, there are now approximately 4.5 million Americans who suffer from Alzheimer's disease;
and
WHEREAS, the number of Americans with dementia-type illnesses will increase as the Baby Boomer
generation ages; and
WHEREAS, the problem of " wandering," the condition in which senior citizens with dementia travel by
foot or other mode of transportation away from their place of residence and become disoriented and lost;
and
WHEREAS, the phenomenon of "wandering" has resulted in the disappearance and the death of some
vulnerable senior citizens and heartache for their families; and
WHEREAS, several other states are preparing legislation or studying how to address this issue; and
WHEREAS, by law the state of Illinois now directs the state police to issue a regional or statewide alert
when a vulnerable senior citizen is missing; and
WHEREAS, there currently is no local coordination of the statewide alert system and such coordination
is necessary to make this policy effective in Cook County; and

7

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 3, 2006

WHEREAS, the creation of an alert system to help locate senior citizens who have wandered away from
their residence as a result of dementia will facilitate the search for them; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does hereby urge the creation of
a "Silver Alert" system which should be implemented in Cook County, particularly a system that
coordinates its search with the local media and local governmental and police agencies.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved that the Proposed Resolution be

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 3, 2006

Transmitting a Communication, dated April 26, 2006 from
PETER C. NICHOLSON, Director, Department of Planning and Development
Re:

HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME Program)

respectfully requests authorization to enter into an agreement with Anchor Group, Ltd. of Illinois, an
Illinois corporation (" Anchor"), Ch icago, 111inois, concerning real estate located at 136 East 155th Street,
Harvey, Illinois (the " real estate") and requests that the C hief Administrative Officer or his designee be
authorized to execute on behalf of the County all necessary documents. The agreement will provide for
the execution of a note and amended mortgage by Anchor as the borrower/mortgagor and the County as
the lender/ mortgagee. The loan documents will provide that repayment of the loan will be forgiven if
Anchor complies with HOME Program affordability restrictions for the remaining affordability period,
which terminates on June 1, 20 11 .
The Board origina lly authorized a County HOME loan on October 4, 1994 for the rehabilitation of the
real estate for low-income housing. The loan was initially made to the New Cities Community
Development Corporation and was later assigned to the Turlington Cooperative. On June 29, 2005, the
real estate was forec losed upon in an action brought by Fifth Third Bank as the holder of a first lien in
excess of $400,000.00. The County joined the action on September 9, 2005 as the holder of a second lien
in the amount of $1 ,220,508 .30.
This transaction is recommended in order to avoid a forec losure sale, which is scheduled for May 30,
2006 and wou ld result in the termination of the HOME program affordability restrictions. Approval of
this transaction will also allow the affordability requirements to be maintained thereby achieving the
objectives of the HOME Program a nd wi ll not necessitate repayment to HUD.
The Department has been working closely with the State' s Attorney ' s Office with regard to this
transaction.

Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved that the request of the Director of the

CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication from

requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Verdict Systems, Tempe,

program that will be utilized to present electronic video interrogation evidence at trial.
Reason:

Verdict Systems is the only company capable of supplying this unique software to the State 's
Attorney's Office for several interrelated reasons. First, the Office has not found any other
software product that performs the same functions as quickly or as easi ly as Sanctions II.
This specially designed software allows office attorneys to link verbatim transcripts of
conversations with audio and video evidence and then present this work product in court.
Second, the Office has used the Sanctions II software for a number of years and has a small
group of attorneys who are highly ski lled in using this software. Office attorneys have been
trained on Sanctions Il software in one Chicago area law school, through in-house training
programs, and through the National District Attorney Association national training center.
All Assistant United State's Attorneys in the country receive similar training on Sanctions II
software. This well-developed prosecutorial knowledge base would be wasted if the office
were to choose another type of software. This well deYeloped proseeutorial knowledge base
wo1:1ld be wasted if the office '+¥ere to ehoose arwther type of software. Verdict Systems is the
sole source provider of this product and they require purchasers to purchase directly from

Election Division within the office of the Cook County Clerk; and
WHEREAS the Cook Coun ty C lerk and the Chicago Board of E lections have jointly
de termined it is in the best interests of all voters throughout Cook County to conduct
elections under a unifonn system that is simi lar in equipment, design, ballot format, and
procedure, in all fifty Chicago wards and thirty suburban townships; and
WH EREAS to achieve the goal of a uniform voting system, and to ensure full compliance

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 3, 2006

WHEREAS the new $54 million system consists of three primary pieces of equipment; an
optical scan ballot reader, a voter card activator/consolidator, and a touch screen vote
recorder manufactured by Sequoia Voting Systems of California; and
WHEREAS all three pieces of electronic equipment were never before used in any election
by the 24,000 election judges throughout Cook County, and complicated new procedures
were required to issue, tabulate, consolidate, and process the ballots; and

completed in-precinct counts and reported unofficial totals within one hour of the polls
closing at 7:00 pm; and
WHEREAS in the primary election of 2006, the first such election using new ballot formats
and vote tabulation equipment, 66% of all Suburban precincts still had not reported results by
11 :00 pm, more than four hours after the polls had officially closed; and
WHEREAS fully one week after election day, election authorities in both Chicago and
Suburban Cook County were still working to complete the counting of all ballots; and
WHEREAS the confusion and uncertainty surrounding the conduct of the 2006 Primary
Election serves to undermine voter confidence in the integrity of the system; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners will conduct a Public
Hearing to examine the administration of the 2006 Primary Election in all its aspects,

BE JT FURTHER RESOLVED, that said hearing shall include participation from
representatives of the Office of the Cook County Clerk, the Chicago Board of Elections, and
Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc.; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that upon the selection of a date, time, and location for thi s

Vice Chairman Steele noted the following problem areas, and inquired how these issues will be
addressed: huma n error, voting materia ls not delivered on time, lack of avai lable paper, technical
problems, jammed machines, mac hines not being properly set, insufficient judge training (j udges did not
know how to merge the two syste ms), lack of technical assistance response, and mechanical and software
issues.
Jack Blaine, President of Sequo ia Voting Systems, Inc. replied that an independent expert has been hired
to review the firmware and hardware. Judges will receive more hands-on training. A select number of
judges, perhaps one per precinct, will receive extra-intensive training. Technical assistants w ill receive
additional training as well.

71

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 3, 2006

Vice Chairman Steele noted that there were occasions when it was not possible to reach the technical
assistants.
Mr. Blaine replied that he would look into this issue.
Commissioner Hansen reiterated Vice Chairman Steele's concern that technical assistants were not
reachable when needed. He further stated that having to use two machines and a tabulator is too
complicated. Necessary equipment can be borrowed from jurisdictions that are not holding elections.
Special bonding or other alternatives should have been sought out to obtain the additional $20 million that
this project required. Machines shou ld be small enough that people of small stature can move them. It
might be difficult to recruit polling judges for future elections.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired whether, in light of the grievances aired today, Mr. Blaine still stands
behind the quality of the mechanical and technolog ical aspects of Sequoia 's equipment.
Mr. Blaine replied that the machines will be made more user-friendly and more training will be provided.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that, in California in February of 2006, Sequoia had a 60% failure rate
with regard to volume testing of both the Insight and the Insight Plus machines. Commissioner
Maldonado requested that the source of this citation, page 26 of "lllinois Ballot Integrity Project" be
entered into the record. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Commissioner Maldonado inquired whether Cook County and C hicago were made aware of this fact.
Mr. Blaine stated that he would get back to the Commissioner on whether this statistic is accurate. He
noted that Sequoia successfully passed certification requirements in California, and that significant testing
was also conducted in Illinois. He further stated that all testing information is public knowledge.
Commissioner Maldonado asked Mr. Blaine whether he believes that Sequoia should be compensated as
previously arranged, given the malfunctioning that took place on March 2 1st.
Mr. Blaine replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired whether Sequoia was undertaking any investigation concerning
machine malfunctions.
Mr. Blaine replied that Sequoia wi ll be reviewing information supplied by the jurisdictions.
Richard A. Cowen, Commissioner, Chicago Board of Election Commissioners, stated that training has to
be rethought. He voiced a concern that there may be systemic problems with the machines and that, to
evaluate this possibility, the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners is retaining an independent
expert.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired as to what protective provisions or sanctions will be included in the
Sequoia contract for November.
Clerk Orr replied that there is a provision that the County can withhold payment if it feels that there has
been a breach of contract. He does not believe there has been a breach so far.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired whether the machines being used in November will be the same used
in March.

72

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 3, 2006

Mr. Blaine replied no, the machines being used in November will possess a new operating system .
Commissioner Ma ldonado requested that Langdon D. Neal, C hairman of the Chicago Board of Election
Commissioners, comment on the issue of provisions and sanctions.
Chairman Neal replied that there will be negative monetary adjustme nts as a result of the machines'
malfunctioning. Also, a mock election will be conducted prior to the November election.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired whether any memory cartridges are missing.
Chairman Neal and C lerk Orr replied in the negative.
Commissioner Murphy stated that as a cotTection to what the first speaker stated, touch screen machines
were in use in suburban Cook County; every district that she visited had at least one. Ninety percent of
senior citizens who participated in exit polling stated that they liked the touch screen machines. In
particular, senior citizens with arthritis were relieved at not having to use punch cards. It is her
understanding that every precinct will possess at least one touch screen machine for the November
election. She recommends that each touch screen machine have the ability to count all of the precincts
within the polling place; this could alleviate problems if one of the machines malfunctions. She believes
that privacy will be a large issue in November, when there are crossover votes.
Commissioner Murphy requested leave to ask a question of Gary Rycyzyn, Election Consultant. Leave
was granted.
Commissioner Murphy asked whether Mr. Rycyzyn thought that the problems surrounding the Sequoia
equipment's malfunctioning are surmountable in time for the November election .
Mr. Rycyzyn replied in the affi rmative, noting that training of election judges and voters will be very
important.
Commissioner Murphy thanked Carol Stefan, President of the League of Women Voters, Palos-Orland,
for her attendance, and for the voter tra ining that her organization performs.
Clerk Orr stated that, in order to engender voter pri vacy, future training will emphasize that only the voter
goes to the scanne r unless a j udge' s assistance is needed, in which case, the security sleeve can be held
over the ballot.
Commissioner Gorman thanked all of the speakers for attending, and stated that it is her opinion that the
Chicago Board of Elections and the Cook County Election Department would be more effective if they
were combined into one entity. In all the complaints she has received, all were regarding equipment
malfunctioning. None indicated that election judges were at all uncomfortable with the equipment. She
inquired whether the sharing of acti vation cards among machines was problematic.
Mr. Blaine replied in the affirmative, and stated that this sharing would not take place in November.
Additionally, in November, only one tape printing w ill be required for transmittal, instead of the six that
were necessary in March.
Commissio ner Gorman inquired how many precincts were unable to transmit on the evening o f March
2 1st.

73

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 3, 2006

Mr. Blaine replied that, in Chicago, 365 out of 2700 were unable to transmit. Clerk Orr replied that, in
suburban Cook County, 275 out of 2380 were unable to transmit.
Commissioner Gorman inquired as to the relevance of the malfunctioning of Pennsylvania' s system.
Mr. Blaine replied that this was a different system than that used by Cook County. The malfunctioning
there happened in the certification process and was remedied in time for the election .
Commissioner Gorman inquired whether the paper shottage was Sequoia 's responsibility.
Mr. Blaine replied that it was a confluence of events that Sequoia would be addressing.
Commissioner Gorman inquired how many Sequoia staff were present or on-call for the primary election.
Mr. Blai ne replied that approximately seventy were available a few days prior to March 21st, on March
21 st, and a few days after March 21st. This number far exceeded what was required by contract.
Commissioner Gorman stated that a review should be taken, not only of Sequoia, but of all the vendors
that were involved, especially Pickens-Kane Moving & Storage Company and whoever was involved
concerning an instructional mailing to election judges that arrived well after the election was over. She
stated that many township and municipal clerks were underutilized, especially in cases of transporting
ballots. Watchdog groups, voters' leagues, students and many other astute people exist who would like to
be involved and who could be utilized. She inquired whether 95% of absentee and early votes were
counted.
Mr. Blaine replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Moreno thanked the public for attending the meeting. He stated that split precincts where ballot styles were often mixed up - must be e liminated. Complications of the new equipment
interfacing were underestimated. He requested that Mr. Blaine and Chairman Neal pay close attention to
the complaints brought forth by the public at this meeting.
Chairman Neal stated that the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners is currently working on a report,
which it will present to the Board regarding how to help judges to navigate split precincts and make sure
that the correct ballots are distributed. He further stated that there are 290 splits in Chicago, and they are
usually the result of redistricting by Congress and the State Legislature.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that he feels he was mi sled when he was told that the County and Sequo ia
would have adeq uate time to implement the voting equipment. He stated that the lack of foresight with
regard to problems disturbed him. He inquired whether there were more problems than Clerk Orr had
expected.
Clerk Orr stated that there were more, particularly with the scanners.
Commissioner C laypool stated the following concerns: with regard to ballot secrecy: the privacy shield is
too unwieldy and impractical ; the ballot was too long (and in the next election there will be two ballots,
so the difficulty will be larger), there was electioneering, aided by the lack of privacy. R egarding ballot
security: when machines could not read a ballot, the ballot was dropped into a bin or kept out in the open,
later there was a lot of handling of these ballots. Someone could have filled in the blanks in those ballots
that were under-voted. Regarding the transportation of ballots and tapes and the counting downtown: inprecinct-results should be available on election night; there were missing ballots that were supposedly

74

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 3, 2006

reconciled downtown, but there is no guarantee of this; as of today, there are no precinct-by-precinct
results available; in one precinct, the results were highly improbable - several hundred ballots were cast
and Commissioner Claypool's total was zero. Regarding ballot integrity: because of lost votes, there is
insufficient guarantee that the votes were counted accurately; there were malfunctioning paper systems,
voting continued without paper trails; early votes either did not arrive at the precincts or the judges didn ' t
know that they had arrived; some people voted twice; early and absentee votes should be physically
transported to precincts. Regarding ballot verification: when Commissioner Claypool voted, there was a
paper malfunction and he could not read the verification; other individuals could not get printouts or tapes
on election night and were instead told the numbers verbally. Regarding early voting: There is not
adequate oversight (while the State mandates early voting, it provides no funding for oversight); it is
prohibitively expensive for campaigns to devote staff to poll watch over many weeks and sites - hence,
the situation is rife for abuse; in one example of such abuse, senior citizens were bussed in by a special
interest group, and the special interest group members accompanied the senior citizens to the polling
booths and voted for them. Abuse will only become graver as early voting is more widely utilized .
Chairman Neal replied that the precinct counts have been available for three weeks, and that he would get
these results to Commissioner Claypool as soon as possible. He further replied that early voting will be
expanding; the Board of Elections will need funding assistance. The Board will be modifying the privacy
sheaths. Most large jurisdictions perform a central count; the trend is away from precinct counts. The
issue of the tapes will be addressed .
Chicago Board of E lection Commissioner Cowen made the following reply to Commissioner Claypool
that electronic voting affords greater privacy. There was funding available for only one electronic voting
system per precinct. Judges need to be trained to encourage voters to use this technology.
Commissioner Peraica stated that the following problems had come to his attention: cartridges misplaced
for several weeks, missing electrical cords, difficult-to-find switches on voting equipment, and lack of
bathroom facilities . He inquired as to what is needed to avoid these problems in November.
Mr. Blaine replied that converting to an entirely DRE system would be the safest option.
Clerk Orr agreed to provide to Chairman Daley the cost of leasing DRE systems for all 5000 precincts.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether the March election used an "Optic Eagle."
Clerk Orr replied in the negative.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether Sequoia is traded on NASDAQ or adheres to public disclosure
practices.
Mr. Blaine replied in the negative.
Commissioner Peraica inquired what technical problems existed with the machines deployed on election
day, and what measures are being taken to fix them.
Mr. Blaine stated that they don ' t know the number of technical problems yet. He stated improvements
will be made to the machines at no cost to the County.
Chairman Neal stated that while it is an option to hold the vendor responsible for payment for a
consultant, at this time it is the responsibility jointly of Cook County and the City. He further stated that

75

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 3, 2006

he would inform the Cook County Board of Commissioners if his office plans to proceed with the hiring
of a consultant.
Clerk Orr stated that the reason that an independent consultant would be retained would be to obtain a
review that is made independently of the vendor.
Commissioner Peraica stated that the payment for elections judges is insufficient. He further stated that
Clem Balanoff, Director of Elections, indicated to him that the equipment had been certified with a
software glitch uncorrected.
Mr. Balanoff replied that the glitch did not affect the accuracy of the result.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether the Board will receive a report regarding the elections equipment
schedu led to be leased for the November e lection.
Mr. Blaine replied that the Board will be receiving a report on the "Edge" and "Insight" machines as well
as the firmware and hardware that support them. Also, a mock election will be staged, and a report on
this will be supplied to the Board.
Chairman Neal replied that he would try to obtain a detailed report from the State Board of Elections on
the equipment being used in the November election. He further stated that although typically the State
Board of Elections does not publish detailed reports, he believes that this situation warrants it.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to when Sequoia will furnish the County Board with a report
addressing the number and nature of the technical problems possessed by the election equipment used in
the March elections.
Mr. B laine replied that the County Board will receive this report by July 1, 2006.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to a suit filed against Sequoia in the state of Washington.
Mr. Blaine replied that that suit had been dropped.
Commissioner Sims inquired whether the equipment used by Cook County in the March e lections is stateof-the-art.
Mr. Blaine replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Sims inquired whether the software being used by the equipment in November will be
compatible to any upgraded machines the County might move to.
Mr. Blaine replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Sims inquired whether the equipment can be enhanced to accommodate any change in
requirements that the government might impose.
Mr. Blaine replied that Sequoia cannot foresee what future requirements the government might impose.
Commissioner Sims asked whether the boxes with voting information are locked before they leave the
precinct.

76

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 3, 2006

Clerk Orr replied in the affirmative. He added that results, tapes and other information go to the receiving
station; from there it goes immediately downtown to be counted.
Commissioner Sims recommended that the training-group size for judges be decreased.
Clerk Orr replied that the ratio they were attempting to achieve was one machine per one trainer per ten
judges.
Commissioner Sims recommended that the judges be provided with a tape that they can watch at home as
part of their training, and that each judge be required to sign for the tape.
Chairman Neal replied that this type of tape was sent to judges who could not attend training; the tape
was also running all day in the polling place.
Commissioner Sims suggested that if a judge has a history of serving in a particular polling place, that his
request to remain in that place be honored.
Chairman Daley requested that Chairman Neal and Clerk Orr list for the record how many polling judges
were not in attendance.
Chairman Neal replied approximately 20% of 3000 judges were not in attendance.
C lerk Orr replied that approximately 1000 judges were not in attendance.
Commissioner Sims asked what explanation there is for the non-attendance.
C lerk Orr replied that in addition to sickness and being called out of town, many found the new
technology too complicated.
Commissioner Sims inquired as to the effectiveness of the extra County personnel, precinct
representatives and students who were dispatched on election day.
Clerk Orr replied that these personnel were well trained and effective. He stated that he will be giving a
report to the Commissioners regarding this issue.
Commi ssioner Hansen stated that at one training session of which he was made aware, ballot scanners,
sample ballots, and cartridges from the ballot scanner were not available; due to the absence of these, the
process of consolidation could not be demonstrated. He further stated that election judges were originally
set up as an adversarial board; this balance should be preserved and kept in mind when adding other
personnel. Commissioner Hansen further stated that decentralization is one of the Cook County's
election process' strength. He inquired how many split precincts exist.
C lerk Orr agreed to provide thi s number to the Board.
Commissioner Hansen inquired whether the County can convert to an entirely digital touch screen voting
system. He stated that our objective should be to lead the nation in elections.
Clerk Orr replied that if security issues can be overcome and the funding is available, it is possible.
Commissioner Hansen requested that Clerk Orr address this issue in the report he submits to the Board.

77

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 3, 2006

Commissioner Suffredin noted that on March 21st, Cook County was the only jurisdiction holding an
election, whereas on November 7 Sequoia will have equipment in twenty states. He inquired whether
Sequoia will be able to provide the appropriate technical assistance and personnel on November 7th as it
did on March 21st.
Mr. Blaine replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Suffredin further noted that, after November 7th, Cook County e lections will continue into
February and April of 2007. He inquired whether Sequoia has the requisite technical ability and the
ability to provide the necessary assistance in these elections as well.
Mr. Blaine replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Suffredin delivered the following explanation of the proposed amendment: The
amendments require a monthly report to the Finance Committee on each point of both the Chicago Board
of Election 's eleven-point corrective plan and the ten- point corrective plan of the Cook County C lerk.
The amendment further requires, by June 15, a plan as to equipment modifications as needed for the
election.

A RESOLUTION ORDERING THE COOK COUNTY CLERK TO WITHHOLD
PAYMENTS TO SEQUOIA VOTING SYSTEMS, INC. (PROPOSED RESOLUTION).
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Roberto Maldonado, County Commissioner.
The attached resolution will be added to the New Items Agenda for the April 5, 2006 Cook
County Board meeting. I will request that this item be referred to the Committee on Finance
for further review and discussion.
The resolution orders the Cook County Clerk to withhold payments to Sequoia Voting
Systems, Inc. for the electronic election machinery supplied to Cook County until a full and
complete public hearing and investigation determines the extent that Sequoia's voting
equipment contributed to any errors on election day and to the extreme delay in the March 21,
2006 Primary Election results.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, every United States citizen has a right to participate in our democracy by
casting a vote for their chosen elected official in an election administered through a fair and
accurate voting process; and
WB EREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners is committed to the integrity of each
vote cast by its residents and has entrusted the Cook County Clerk's office to administer and
protect its election process; and
WHEREAS, responding to the "hanging chads" debacle of the 2000 presidential election,
Congress sought to fix our voting process by implementing electronic voting, also known as
"e-voting'', through the Help American Vote Act (HA VA), and released $2 billion in federal
funds to modernize state's voting systems by January I, 2006; and

84

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 3, 2006

WHEREAS, in 2005, the Cook County Board, in compliance with the HA VA mandate,
approved the Cook County C lerk 's office recommendation of California-based Sequoia
Voting Systems, Inc . to provide updated voting equipment for the suburban county precincts
at a cost of $23 .8 mil lion; and
WHEREAS, the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners also selected Sequoia Voting
Systems, Inc., approving a $28 million contract for new voting equipment in the city of
Chicago; and
WHEREAS, in the March 21 , 2006 Primary Election, Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc.
launched its dual-machine e-voting system consisting of touch screen machines (primari ly to
aid persons w ith disabilities, but avai lable to all voters) and paper ballot optical scanners; and
WHEREAS, with widespread reports of equipment failure coupled with human error
resulting from using new technology, the 2006 Primary Election will be remembered as a
ballot counting disaster, with problems delaying fina l vote counts for nearly a full week after
election day, compared to the old-style punch card system which tabulated 90 percent of the
votes with in one hour of the clos ing of the polls; and
WHEREAS, although election judges were required to part1c1pate in a three-hour
instructional class as mandated by the Illinois Board of E lection Commissioners, roughly
4,000 of the 14,000 election judges in Chicago failed to attend a training session for the new
equipment, according to Daniel W. White, Executi ve Director of the Illinois Board of
Elections; and
WHEREAS, reports of equipme nt failure permeated election day, when optical scanners
broke down and machines failed as election judges tried to merge voting results of the two
systems at the close of polls; and
WHEREAS, defecti ve and damaged memory cards containing vote totals prevented data
from being sent v ia cellular technology to the central counting centers and instead data
cartridges were sent via taxi to the central office; and
WHEREAS, one day after the polls closed , Chicago was missing 252 memory cartridges
with a nother 162 memory cartridges unaccounted for in suburban Cook County; and
WHEREAS, reports of Sequoia machine malfunctions in counties across the nation during
the 2004 election, including B ernalillo and Sandoval Counties in New Mexico, Snohomish
County in Washington and Palm Beach County in Florida may have foreshadowed Cook
County's problems with the new voting machines; and
WHEREAS, the implementation of " modernized" e-voting equipment in Cook County's
March 21 Primary Election left many candidates, participants in the election, public officials,
and voters questioning the integrity of the voting process and highly skeptical of the
upcoming General E lection in November.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we the Cook County Board of
Comm issioners do hereby order the Cook County Clerk to withhold scheduled payments to
Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc. for the election machinery supplied to Cook County until a full
and complete public hearing and investigation determines the extent that Sequoia's voting
equipment contributed to any errors on election day and to the extreme delay in the March 21 ,
