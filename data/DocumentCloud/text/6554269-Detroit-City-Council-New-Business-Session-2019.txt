RE: Slyde Aperitif, LLC

Honorable City Council:

Slyde Aperitif, LLC is renovating the existing structure located at 3700 Third Street near
Brainard Street. The building will be part of a mixed-use development that will house multi-
family apartments, retail, and an upscale hamburger restaurant.

Slyde has purchased a Tavern Liquor License (beer and wine only) and seeks to transfer it to a
full Class Liquor License (beer, wine, and liquor). The Michigan Liquor Control Commission
(the ?Commission?) is currently phasing out Tavern licenses. The Commission requires Local
Government consent to consider approval of a transfer of a beer and wine license to a beer, wine,
and liquor license.

We, therefore, request that your Honorable Body issue your consent that the application by Slyde
Aperitif LLC for the transfer of a beer and wine license to a beer, wine, and liquor license to be
located at 3700 Third Street, be considered for approval by the Michigan Liquor Control
Commission. Additionally, we request that your Honorable Body authorize the Director of the
Buildings Safety Engineering and Environmental Department, or his or her authorized designee,
to execute such documents as may be necessary to convey such consent.

HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: RECOMMENDATION FOR DEFERRAL
ADDRESS: 13529 Gratiot
NAME: Ivory Properties INC
Demolition Ordered: October 28, 2002

In response to the request for a deferral of the demolition order on the property noted above, the Buildings, Safety Engineering and
Environmental Department (BSEED) submits the following information:

A special inspection conducted on October 16, 2019 revealed that the building is secured and appears to be sound and repairable. The owner
has paid all taxes and is current. The proposed use of the property is owner?s use and occupancy. This is the 2"d deferral request for this

property.

Therefore, we respectfully recommended that the demolition order be deferred for a period of six months subject to the following
conditions:

1. A permit for rehabilitation work shall be applied for within te_n (10) business days from the date ofthe City Council
decision.
2. BSEED will schedule 2 Progress Inspection within forty-?ve (45) calendar days from the date of the rehabilitation

 

permit to determine whether substantial progress has been made. Thereafter, the owner must submit to BSEED
detailed inspection reports, with photos showing evidence of the work completed, every forty- we (45) calendar
for the duration of the rehabilitation work, to demonstrate that substantial progress has been made during
the approved time frame for rehabilitation.

3. The building shall have all imminently hazardous conditions immediately corrected, be maintained, and securely
barricaded until rehabilitation is complete. Rehabilitation work is to be completed within six (6) months, at which
time the owner will obtain one of the following from this department:

I Certi?cate of Acceptance related to building permits
0 Certi?cate of Approval as a result of a Housing Inspection
0 Certi?cate of Compliance, required for a_ll rental properties

4. The owner shall not occupy or allow occupancy of the structure without a certi?cate (as outlined above).
5. The yards shall be maintained clear of overgrown vegetation, weeds, junk and debris at all times.
6. Prior to seeking a permit extension, the owner must contact BSEED and request to extend the deferral period.

We recommend that utility disconnect actions cease to allow the progress of the rehabilitation.

At the end of the deferral period, the owner must contact this department to arrange an inspection to evidence that conditions of the deferral
have been satis?ed and that there has been substantial progress toward rehabilitation. If the building becomes open to trespass or if conditions
of the deferral are not followed, the deferral may be rescinded by the City Council at any time and we may proceed with demolition without
further notice. In addition, pursuant to the Property Maintenance Code we will issue a Blight Violation Notice.

Any request exceeding three (3) deferrals must be made by petition to City Council through the office of the City Clerk.

Respectfully submitted,
