PROPOSED RESOLUTION
SUPPORTING ILLINOIS SENATE BILL 1883 AND ILLINOIS HOUSE BILL 3422, THE GUN
DEALER & AMMUNITION SELLER ACT
WHEREAS, between 2009 and 2013, four particular gun dealers, each located a short drive outside of
Chicago, supplied 20% of all guns recovered from Chicago crime scenes; and
WHEREAS, firearms dealers are subject to very little federal oversight, and on average, are only
inspected once a decade. ATF lacks the resources and authority to monitor the 138,000 gun dealers,
manufacturers, collectors and others that it licenses; and
WHEREAS, measures such as law enforcement inspections, background checks for employees,
inventory inspections, video surveillance and improved security, and restrictions on the locations of gun
dealers and ranges, would promote best practices, discourage theft, and thwart illegal sales and straw
purchases; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois possess the infrastructure and resources to institute licensing and
regulation of gun dealerships, by requiring them to obtain a state license from the Department of
Financial & Professional Regulation; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois licenses and regulates a wide range of professions to promote public
safety, health and welfare, including for example, acupuncturists, cosmetologists, real estate appraisers
and geologists, but not gun dealers; and
WHEREAS, Illinois State Senator Don Harmon and Illinois State Representative Christian Mitchell have
introduce Senate Bill 1883 and House Bill 3422, the Gun Dealer and Ammunition Seller Act (“the Act”);
and
WHEREAS, the Act provides that it is unlawful for any person engaged in the business of selling,
leasing or otherwise transferring firearms or ammunition without a dealer license issues by the Illinois
Department of Financial and Professional Regulation; and
WHEREAS, the Act requires all applicants for a dealer license and their employees to have a valid
Firearm Owner’s Identification Card and to have background check conducted; and
WHEREAS, the Act prohibits the consumption of alcohol on the premises of any firearm dealer and
allows the Department of State Police to establish rules requiring employees and agents of licenses to
undergo training regarding legal requirements and responsible business practices as applicable to the sale
or transfer of firearms or ammunition; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County supports
Illinois Senate Bill 1883 and Illinois House Bill Number 342, and encourages the Illinois General
Assembly to pass both bills and for Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner to sign them; and

 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a suitable copy of this resolution be tendered to State Senator Don
Harmon, State Representative Christian Mitchell, Illinois Speaker of the House Michael Madigan, Illinois
Senate President John Cullerton and Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner.

numerous bills that effect the services and operation of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the County’s intergovernmental relations staff and hired lobbyists are actively monitoring
the legislation that effects Cook County’s services and operations; and

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION URGING THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO INSTITUTE
STATEWIDE LICENSING AND REGULATION OF GUN DEALERS AND RANGES

Page 4 of 7

 WHEREAS, on average 1,000 people die each year from gunshot wounds in our state. The gun death
toll in Illinois in 2013 included 576 homicides and 496 suicides; and
WHEREAS, guns are used in over 70% of all homicides in Illinois; and
WHEREAS, the price of one gun homicide costs an average of $441,000 in direct costs (including law
enforcement, medical expenses, court costs, and prison), of which 87% is paid by taxpayers; and
WHEREAS, each gun death averages about $6 million in total costs, including both direct and indirect
costs; and
WHEREAS, Chicago police officers recover more than twice the number of crime guns per capita than
in Los Angeles, and more than seven times than in New York City; and
WHEREAS, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives (“ATF”) almost all
the guns recovered after being used in crimes were originally sold by retail dealers; and
WHEREAS, corrupt gun dealers represent a major source of illegally trafficked firearms, making
oversight of dealers critical; and
WHEREAS, between 2009 and 2013, four particular gun dealers, each located a short drive outside
Chicago, supplied 20% of all guns recovered from Chicago crime scenes. These stores supplied thousands
of crime guns; and
WHEREAS, firearms dealers are subject to very little federal oversight, and on average are inspected
only once a decade, primarily because ATF lacks the resources and authority to monitor the 138,000 gun
dealers, manufacturers, collectors, and others that it licenses; and
WHEREAS, lack of oversight makes it far too easy for gun dealers to turn a blind eye to “straw
purchasers,” and other traffickers who fill out the paperwork and undergo background checks in order to
provide guns to criminals or other people ineligible to possess guns; and
WHEREAS, states that do not permit or require law enforcement inspections of gun dealers are the
sources of crime guns recovered in other states at a rate that is 50% greater than states that do, showing
that illegal trafficking of guns could be substantially reduced with better oversight of gun dealers; and
WHEREAS, measures such as law enforcement inspections, background checks for employees,
inventory inspections, video surveillance and improved security, and restrictions on the location of gun
dealers and ranges, would promote best practices, discourage theft, and thwart illegal sales and straw
purchases; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois possesses the infrastructure and resources to institute licensing and
regulation of gun dealerships, by requiring them to obtain a state license from the Department of
Financial & Professional Regulation (IDPFR); and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois licenses and regulates a wide range of professions to promote public
safety, health, and welfare, from acupuncturists and cosmetologists to real estate appraisers and
professional geologists, but not gun dealers; and
WHEREAS, too many Illinois families have suffered the loss of a loved one and too many innocent
Page 5 of 7

 people have been injured or lost their lives as bystanders or victims of gun crimes; and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners hereby petition the Illinois General Assembly to protect the health, safety, and welfare of
the general public in Illinois by requiring firearms dealers and ammunition sellers to obtain a state license
and conduct business responsibly to avoid the diversion of guns into the illegal market.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Clerk notifies the Illinois General Assembly and
the Governor of this request.
