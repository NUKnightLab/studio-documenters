What is the GCRTA System Redesign Study?

What has happened so far?

What should RTA be trying to do? Different people
tell us to do opposite things. We only have so much
money, so we need your help figuring out what our
priorities should be.
We want everyone’s opinions about this. RTA works
for all taxpayers, and needs to deliver benefits to the
whole region, so everyone has a valid point of view.
This study is about what we should focus on in the next
three years, which is why it’s mostly about bus service.
Many US transit agencies are rethinking their bus services, and sometimes expanding them.
Bus service is important. It carries most of RTA’s customers and is our only way to get service to most
people. Good bus service can help people who don’t
have cars, or choose not to rely on them. It can also
relieve the impacts of traffic congestion and is better
for the environment. Useful transit service, bus or rail,
can help influence where people live and businesses
locate.

B

In February 2019 A , we surveyed the public on the priorities RTA should focus on when it designs its network,
and designed two alternatives illustrating how the network could look if we emphasized different priorities
than today. These budget-neutral network alternatives
show how the transit network might look if it were designed to focus more on generating higher ridership, or
on extending coverage, than it does today.
Then, in May and June 2019 B , we presented these
two networks to collect feedback from the public.

Coverage alternatives here:

What Happens Next

In Summer 2019, RTA and the study team used input
from the first two surveys to design two network concepts with different levels of funding available for
transit.
Now C , we want to hear what you think about these
network concepts!

Some routes have reduced frequency
further out from the city center, as
indicated by a change in line color. This
does not mean passengers have to
transfer to another vehicle.

Some routes split into branches, as indicated by the “A” or “B” suffix . As long
as the route number remains the same,
passengers can ride through the branch
without transferring.

 Help RTA Decide!
Like all transit agencies, RTA is asked
to pursue opposite goals:
Ridership means attracting as many riders as possible.
When we do this, we also achieve these goals:
•  Reduced air pollution from car and truck traffic,
including emissions that cause climate change.
•  Lower tax subsidy per rider.
•  Better bus service for anyone in denser areas with
more people.
•  More economic activity without more traffic
congestion.

Coverage means being available in as many places as
possible, even if not many people ride. When we do
this, we also achieve these goals:
•  Bus service to emerging suburban employment
and residential areas.
•  Mobility options for people who are located in
hard-to-serve places and can’t drive or don’t have
access to a car.
•  Bus service to every city, town or neighborhood in
Cuyahoga County.

•  Support for new dense and walkable development.

 What we have heard so far

With existing resources, respondents were evenly split
on whether to refocus service design towards ridership (42%) or coverage (41%).
Only 15% chose to maintain the existing balance (60/40
ridership/coverage).

606 phone survey
responses

2381 online
survey responses

When asked to divide 100 points between three priorities for how to deploy coverage-oriented service,
respondents generally selected “Meeting Needs” as
the top priority.

Average Points

From February 6 to March 18, 2019,
we asked the public in an online
survey, what high-level priorities they
think RTA should focus on.

all Taxpayers

“Meeting needs” means transit service that reaches people who can’t drive or
have limited access to a personal car, even if they are located in a place that is
hard to serve with transit.

 What we have heard so far

High Frequency Alternative

Figure 2: High Frequency Alternative

In May and June 2019, we asked
the public to react to transit
network alternatives showing
how RTA's network could look if
it were redesigned to focus more
on generating high ridership, or
on expanding the coverage area.
The High Frequency Alternative showed how
the network could look if it were designed to
achieve higher ridership. This alternative concentrates service so that lines run more frequently
where they would serve the most people. The
network would reach fewer places, but where it
does reach, waiting times (at the beginning of
a trip, or to connect between routes) would be
shorter than with the Existing Network.

Coverage Alternative

Figure 3: Coverage Alternative

The Coverage Alternative spreads out service
across the county, However spreading it out
means spreading it thin. Frequencies would be
lower throughout the network. This means that
the network reaches more places but some trips
would take much longer.
You can read more about the alternatives,
and view detailed maps, at riderta.com/
systemdesign.
6

 What we have heard so far
In the last survey, we asked the public to tell us
what they thought of the High Frequency and
Coverage alternatives.
When we asked respondents to tell us whether
they preferred a network more like the High
Frequency alternative, more like the Coverage
Alternative, or somewhere in the middle, there
was no majority suggesting that RTA should
change in services in either direction.

460 prompted
web survey
responses

1577 online
survey
responses

However, more (47%) of respondents preferred
an alternative more like the High Frequency
Alternative than like the Coverage Alternative
(33%).
While only 33% of respondents preferred a
network that provides more coverage than today,
when you include the 20% who preferred an
option between the two alternatives, 53% voted
for no reduction in the network's coverage area.
Accordingly, neither of the Current Funding or
Expanded Funding network concepts reduce the
extent of the area served by transit from what it is
today.

Figure 4: High Frequency and Coverage alternative preference

7

 What we have heard so far
We also asked respondents to tell us whether they
agreed or disagreed with several statements about
each alternative. The charts below show the percent of
respondents who agreed or disagreed with each statement regarding the benefits of the network.

Around 50 - 55% of respondents agreed or strongly
agreed with each statement about the High Frequency
Alternative, while approximately 20-33% disagreed or
strongly disagreed.
About 30-40% agreed with the statements about the
Coverage Alternative, and 30-40% disagreed.

 Network Concept Parameters

Based on this input, the network concepts have been designed
to focus more on generating high ridership, but more moderately than the High Frequency Alternative. They generally
maintain coverage to areas that area currently served.

The Current Funding Concept ( A ) shifts the balance of service
towards the ridership goal by about 5% compared to the
Existing Network.
The Expanded Resources Concept ( B ), which shows what RTA
could do if it had a 25% larger budget to run service, shifts the
balance of service towards the ridership goal by about 10%
compared to the Existing Network.

 Current Funding Concept

The Current Funding Concept would offer:
•  shorter waits

•  no reduction in the coverage area

In this network concept, no new resources are available for transit service, but the focus of the network is
shifted slightly towards ridership.
The Current Funding Concept modestly expands the
reach of the frequent network, with 15-minute service
on major corridors like Detroit, Lorain, Kinsman,
Broadway, and Harvard. It pays for these frequency
improvements by simplifying some rush-hour services
and reducing some current routes' frequencies from
every 45 to every 60 minutes. The network generally
covers all areas currently served

•  access to more jobs within 60 minutes
•  quicker transfers
•  higher ridership potential

2,700 more jobs would be accessible in
45 minutes for the average person, a 17%
increase compared to the Existing Network.
Access to jobs
with typical trips

Design Principles
•  Maintain the existing coverage area (the total area
of the county within a 1/4 mile walk from a stop
with transit service).

2h

Access to jobs with
very long trips

•  Establish as much high-frequency service in dense,
walkable areas as possible.
•  Maintain lower frequencies on weekends than
weekdays.

5,700 more jobs would be accessible in 60
minutes, a 11% increase over the Existing
Network.

7,200 more jobs would be accessible
within 2 hours of travel time for the average
person, a 3% increase compared to the
Existing Network.

167,000 more people would be within a
1/2 mile walk of frequent transit service, an
100% increase from the Existing Network.
People near highfrequency transit

People near any
transit

50,000 more jobs would be within a
1/2 mile walk of frequent service, a 25%
increase.
8,400 more people would be within a 1/2
mile walk of transit service, a 0.9% increase
from the Existing Network.
11,900 more jobs would be within a 1/2 mile
walk of transit service, a 2.2% increase.

 Expanded Funding Concept
The Expanded Funding Scenario shows what could
be possible for RTA's network if there were around
25% more resources to run bus service. Almost all new
resources are spent on ridership-generating services,
so the overall focus of the network shifts to about 70%
ridership / 30% coverage.
In this network concept, the split of existing resources
between ridership and coverage is similar to today, but
more ridership-focused services come every 15 minutes,
and more coverage-focused services come every hour.
However, most new transit resources are spent on generating high ridership, and not on extending the coverage
area.

Design Principles

The Expanded Funding Concept would
offer:
•  shorter waits for many more trips
•  no reduction in the coverage area
•  access to many more jobs within 60 minutes
•  shorter waits when transferring
•  higher ridership potential

Access to jobs
with typical trips

Access to jobs with
very long trips

6,600 more jobs would be accessible in
45 minutes for the average person, an 42%
increase compared to the Existing Network.

16,700 more jobs would be accessible in 60
minutes, a 38% increase compared to the
Existing Network.

38,000 more jobs would be accessible
wthin 2 hours of travel time for the average
person, an 16% increase over the Existing
Network

•  Maintain the existing coverage area.
•  Upgrade service on dense, walkable corridors or to
major destinations to every 15 minutes.
•  Establish multiple 15-minute north-south crosstown
services, for quick connections in all directions.

340,800 more people would be within 1/2
mi walk of high-frequency service, a 200%
increase compared to the Existing Network
People near highfrequency transit

•  For people located in moderately dense areas, that
don't have high-frequency service, upgrade current
45 or 60 minute routes to every 30 minutes.
•  Significantly improve weekend service with frequent
routes that operate every 15-minute or better 7-days
a week.

125,500 more jobs would be within 1/2
mi walk of high-frequency service, a 62%
increase compared to the Existing Network
12,600 more people would be within a 1/2
mile walk of transit service, a 1.3% increase
from the Existing Network.

People near any
transit

15,000 more jobs would be within a 1/2 mile
walk of transit service, a 2.7% increase.

13

 Scenario Outcomes
How would a network design like those in the financial
scenarios change how people are able to move around
Cuyahoga County, compared to the Existing Network?
To understand this, we've analyzed five key factors:
1. How many residents or jobs are within walking
distance of a bus stop with each scenario?
2. With each scenario, how many residents or jobs are
within walking distance of a bus stop served by a
high-frequency route running every 15 minutes or
better?
3. How many jobs can an average person reach using
transit with each scenario?
4. How does each scenario change how easy it is to
travel to CMSD high schools?
5. How does each scenario change how easy it is to
travel to Tri-C campuses?

How do we measure access?
When we measure access to jobs, we calculate
travel times based on the following factors:
•  The walking time to and from each stop along the
street network
•  ½ headway initial wait (the time you spend waiting for
your bus to arrive). So for a 15-minute route, on average you will wait 7.5 minutes. For a 30-minute route,
your average wait would be 15 minutes.
•  In-vehicle travel time (the time you spend sitting on the
bus).

We assume that if you need to make a transfer,
your wait will be half of the frequency of the route,
unless the transfer occurs at a dedicated timed
transfer point, where shorter coordinated transfer
times are assumed.
Your "access" is the number of jobs located within
the area you could reach using transit by this
formula, in 45, 60, 75 or 120 minutes.

14

 How many people are
near transit?
Transit must be present for it to be useful. The
graphs on this page show how the number of
people and jobs within a 1/2-mile walk of transit
and high-frequency service with each concept.
Each network concept reaches about the same
total number of people with transit service as
the existing network. However, both the Current
Funding Concept and Expanded Funding
Concept extend frequent service (shown in red)
to many more people than today.
The Current Funding Concept doubles the
number of people within 1/2 mile of frequent
(15-minute) service compared to the Existing
Network. It also increases the number of people
who have access to service that comes every
30 minutes or better, because most 45-minute
services are converted to 30-minute routes.
However, some 45-minute routes would run
every 60 minutes with this concept, so more
people have access to only 60-minute service
than in the existing network.

Figure 8: How many people are near transit?

The Expanded Funding Concept triples the
number of people within 1/2 mile of frequent
service. It expands the number of people with
access to 30-minute or better service, and
reduces the number of people who have access
to only 60-minute service.
15

 How many jobs can a person reach using transit?
These maps illustrate an example
of how each network concept
would impact where you could
go with transit, starting from
University Circle.
In each map, purple shows the
area that would be reachable
by transit in 60 minutes with
either concept, while blue areas
are newly accessible with each
concept. Red areas are places
reachable with the Existing
Network that are out of reach
with the concepts.
The tables below each map
show how the number of jobs
or residents reachable from this
location changes compared to
the Existing Network.
With the Current Funding Concept, the effect of
the enhanced frequencies provided on key corridors
is evident. For example, Routes 9 and 11 (Mayfield
and Cedar, respectively) are upgraded from 45 to 30
minutes, so blue areas along those corridors could be
reached faster from University Circle A . Because Route
7 serving Monticello and Wilson Mills would run only
every 60 minutes (compared to 45 minutes today), this
corridor B shows up red because it would take longer
to reach.

B
A
C
D

Figure 9: Where could I travel to in 60 minutes from University Circle?

With the Expanded Funding Concept, the frequent
network is more expansive, and more lower-frequency
routes run every 30 minutes. As a result, more corridors show up in blue, including Warrensville Rd. ( C ,
new 15-minute service) and Lee Rd. ( D , new 30-minute
service).

16

 How many jobs can a person reach using transit?
Measuring Usefulness

One of the most important measures for how well
a transit system can compete with other modes
for riders is how useful it is for taking people
to jobs. The graph on this page shows how job
access would change at different travel times
compared to the Existing Network with each
concept.

Comparing the Funding Concepts

Both of the concepts broadly increase access for
people in Cuyahoga County. The Current Funding
Concept would provide access to an average of
18% more jobs in an hour, while the Expanded
Funding Concept would allow the average person
to reach over 42% more jobs.

Figure 10: Access to Jobs

Because neither concept substantially expands
the overall coverage area of the network, access
benefits are greatest for shorter travel times. That
said, both concepts offer some access benefits
for very long trips as a result of frequency and
travel time improvements within the existing network's extent.
With a travel time budget of 2 hours (sufficient to travel between most parts of the City
of Cleveland and the outer limits of the transit
network), 4% and 16% more jobs are accessible
by transit with the Current Funding and Expanded
Funding concepts, respectively.

Figure 11: Access to jobs by travel time

17

 How many jobs can lower-income residents of
Cuyahoga County person reach using transit?
One of the most important equity benefits
of transit is serving as a mobility option to
connect lower-income people to jobs and
other opportunities.
The tables on this page shows the number
of jobs and lower-wage jobs that would be
reachable at different travel times by people
living in households earning up to 100% of
the federal poverty level A ($25,750 for a
family of four in 2019), and between 100% and
200% of the poverty level B , with the different concepts.
Lower-income people in Cuyahoga County
are more likely to reside in the City of
Cleveland and other inner areas where more
transit service is available, so job access for
lower-income people is higher than for the
general population.
The improvements for lower-income people
provided by both concepts are comparable to
those of the entire population. The average
person could access about 12% more jobs in
an hour with the Current Funding Concept
than with the Existing Network, while the
average person living in a houshold below the
poverty level could access about 10% more.

 How does each network concept help people travel
to CMSD high schools?
In the Cleveland Metropolitan School District, students can choose to attend one of many high
schools, but whether or not a particular school is a
realistic choice for a student may often depend upon
whether they can easily travel to and from school and
home using transit.

With the Current Funding Concept:

The chart on this page shows the percent of residents within the CMSD boundaries who can reach
different numbers of high schools.

With the Expanded Funding Concept:

While the school district is large enough that very
few people can reach every school in an hour, these
network concepts would increase the number of
schools within a viable transit trip for many people.

31,900 more people within the district
would have access to at least 10 CMSD
schools in 60 minutes, a 23% increase over
the Existing Network

71,000 more people within the district
would have access to at least 10 CMSD
schools in 60 minutes, a 51% increase over
the Existing Network

Both the Current Funding and Expanded Funding
concepts establish frequent service through most of
the area of the CMSD, which means that travel within
it (including trips to and from high schools) would
enjoy the benefit of shorter waits at the beginning of
the trip and at transfers to other frequent services.

Figure 14: Access to CMSD high schools

 Access to Tri-C Campuses
Tri-C’s campuses are an important educational resource
for people in Cuyahoga County. One way of measuring
the performance of each network concept is to assess
how well each network connects people to Tri-C campuses. The following campuses were included:
•  Metropolitan Camp
•  Western Campus
•  Westshore Campus
•  Eastern Campus

With the Current Funding Concept:
134,000 more people would have access to
at least 1 Tri-C campus within 60 minutes, a
52% increase over the Existing Network

With the Expanded Funding Concept:
179,00 more people would have access to
at least 1 Tri-C campus in 60 minutes, a 70%
increase over the Existing Network

The Existing Network puts approximately 20% of
Cuyahoga County residents within a 1-hour travel time
of a Tri-C campus.
The chart on this page shows the
percent of county residents who would
have access to 0, 1 or 2 Tri-C campuses with each concept. Each concept
expands the number of people who
are within a 60 minute ride of a Tri-C
campus.
However, even the Expanded Funding
Concept puts only 36% of residents
within reach of a Tri-C campus. This
is primarily because most of Tri-C's
campuses are located in suburban settings at the edges of the country, which
means they require long drives to reach.

Detailed Outcomes

 

Detailed Access Tables
The tables on the following pages show the average
number of total, low-wage and middle-wage jobs
Cuyahoga County residents could reach under each of
the Existing Network, Current Funding Concept, and
Expanded Concept, in 45, 60, 75 and 120 minutes.
Each table provides a breakdown for the following
demographic groups:
•  All residents
•  Lower-income residents (living in households with
income below the federal poverty level, approximately $51,000 per year for a family of four in
2019)
•  Low to moderate income residents (living in households with income 100% to 200% of the federal
poverty level, approximately $51,000 per year for a
family of four in 2019)
•  Non-white residents
•  Residents living in households without access to a
car

More about employment data
All job access analyses in this project rely on workplace location data drawn from the US Census'
Logitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD)
program. This dataset provides nationwide estimates of the number of employees working in
each census block, block group, tract, and other
geographies.
LEHD defines three job wage levels:
•  Jobs with earnings $1250/month or less (referred
to here as "low-wage jobs")
•  Jobs with earnings $1251/month to $3333/
month (referred to here as "middle-wage jobs)
•  Jobs with earnings greater than $3333/month
Because the low and middle wage classes include
only jobs with wages up to an equivalent of around
$40,000 / year, we have combined the "below
$1250/month" and "$1251/month to $3333/month"
classes.

What is a Low/MidWage Job?
Because the low and middle
wage classes in the LEHD
employment data source
include only jobs with
wages up to an equivalent
of around $40,000 / year,
we have combined the
"below $1250/month" and
"$1251/month to $3333/
month" classes.

What is a High-Wage
Job?
The highest wage classification in the LEHD
employment data source
includes all jobs with wages
about $3333/month. We
have used that wage class
for the high-wage job
access analysis shown on
this page.

Figure 22: Detail Table - Access to Low/Mid-Wage Jobs by People Living in LowerIncome and Low-to-Moderate Income Households

27

 Where does access change?

Figure 23: Change in 60 minute access map - Current Funding Concept

This map shows how access to
jobs in 60 minutes would change
in different areas of Cuyahoga
County with the Current Funding
Scenario. Areas shown in green
would gain access to more jobs;
areas in brown would have
access to fewer jobs. Areas
in grey would see very little
change.
The map shows the benefits
of added frequency on routes
serving Detroit and Lorain on
the west side, and on Kinsman,
Broadway (south of Union) A ,
Cedar and Mayfield B in the east.
There are also some areas where
access is diminished as a result
of changes in frequency or route
structure. On the west side, there
is a loss of access on Center Ridge
and Outer Lorain C , because
routes 49 and 75 are reduced to
60 minute frequency. On the east
side, there is a loss of access along
Miles and Harvard west of E 131st,
because Miles would be served
every 60 minutes instead of every
30 minutes today.

28

 Where does access change?
It's also important to consider
how many people are impacted
by access changes. The image on
this page puts a dot on the map
for every 50 people living in each
hexagon, and color-codes those
dots by how access changes. The
closer the dots are together, the
more people live in an area and
the greater the density is.
From this map, we can see that
most of the areas of access
improvement are places where
many dots are close together, like
in Slavic Village A , or around the
Detroit and Lorain B corridors
on the west side.

Most places where access
decreases are lower-density areas
like the Center Ridge or outer
Lorain corridors C . However,
there are a few moderately dense
places where access declines with
this concept, as along Union near
E 93rd D , where the 15-Harvard
is rerouted off Union in this
concept.

29

 Where does access change?

Figure 25: Change in 60 minute access map - Expanded Funding Concept

Most areas would gain access
to jobs with the Expanded
Funding Concept. The benefits
of the frequent network in the
inner eastern and western sides
of the City of Cleveland and
inner ring suburbs is intensified
by the introduction of frequent
service on crosstown routes like
41-Warrensville, and 78-W 117th,
and an extended 10-E 93rd.
The only continuous corridor
where access would decrease is
along Center Ridge B , which is
served only every 60 minutes in
this concept.

B

There are a few other spots
around the map which show a
descrease in access, but as these
are all adjacent to or surrounded
by areas where access improves,
its likely that these issues that
would be resolved in implementation with some attention to stop
siting, or else artifacts of the particular points at which access was
sampled.

30

 Where does access change?

In the Expanded Funding
Concept, nearly all areas of the
county with substantial residential density gain in access to
jobs. The only corridor where
a loss of access is visible for an
extended distance is Center
Ridge A , where service would
run every 60 minutes (rather
than every 45 minutes as in the
existing network).
