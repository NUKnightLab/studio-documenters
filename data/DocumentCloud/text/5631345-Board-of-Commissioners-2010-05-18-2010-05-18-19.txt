 GENERAL BACKGROUND
In spring 2008, CHA and the Horner Resident’s Committee (“HRC”) created a pilot engagement
program for approximately 747 households at Henry Horner Homes and West Haven Park
(“Engagement Program”). The Engagement Program requires eligible individuals to participate
in activities such as employment, education, job training, or volunteerism for a minimum of 20
hours per week.
NWS utilizes the FamilyWorks service model to address the range of service needs of
households at Horner Homes and West Haven Park. The program model is focused on
identifiable outcomes with an intensive concentration on lease compliance, employment
preparation, employment retention and clinical services. NWS’s case management team works
with residents to develop a multi-disciplinary service plan to develop self-sufficiency goals, to
address barriers to employment and maintaining lease compliance and participate in the
engagement program. The employment team assists individual family members with
employment preparation through access to educational resources and training opportunities, in
addition to job placement assistance and retention services. NWS works closely with CHA staff
and property management to facilitate efficient communication and coordination regarding
resident needs.
Pursuant to a competitive procurement process the Board authorized CHA to enter into a oneyear agreement with NWS for the period of June 1, 2008 through May 31, 2009 with a one-year
option. In May 2009, the Resident Services Division requested a one-month extension of the
base-term of the Contract in order to allow sufficient time to review proposed modifications to
the Engagement Program for the second year of the pilot program. In June 2009, Board
authorized the CHA to exercise the one-year option of Contract No. 8038.
In September 2009, the Horner Engagement Program was modified to be more closely aligned
with the CHA Work Requirement as outlined in the Admissions and Continued Occupancy
Policy, and the Engagement Program term was revised and extended from September 1, 2009
through August 31, 2011. NWS has satisfactorily performed the required services under this
agreement during the term of the Agreement, and CHA seeks to extend the Agreement with
NWS for 18-months to avoid disruption of the Horner Engagement Program and to maintain a
continuity of the social services that have been provided by NWS to residents of Horner and
West Haven for the remainder of the term of the Engagement Program.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the Chicago Housing Authority to extend the
contract with Near West Side CDC for the period of July 1, 2010 through December 31, 2011
(18 months), for an amount not-to-exceed $2,450,000 to continue providing employment,
clinical, and supportive case management services to families in the Horner and West Haven
Park community.
