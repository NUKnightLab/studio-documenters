numbers 5, l9, and 20) submitted as backup for Contracts and Procurement Approval Items.

Leslie Duffy, Director of Procurement of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, provided information on
the items presented.

The Committee reviewed the items. During the discussion of request number 9, the proposed contract increase with
ACS Healthcare Solutions, it was pointed out that there was an error in the Budget Account Number information.
This is a capital purchase, so the Budget Account Number should be 390f717. Chairman Carvalho requested that
the record re?ect this correction.

Julie Bonello, Chief lnfon'nation Of?cer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, provided additional
information with regard to contractual items for health information technology staffing needs; ?lling positions in
this area have proven to be challenging, and it was believed to be attributable to recruitment, rather than pay, issues.

Director Golden mentioned that Ms. Bonello will soon be leaving the System; she asked whether succession
planning had been done to prepare for the new Chief Information Of?cer.

Ms. Bonello responded that the new Chief Information Of?cer will be on- -site next week, and that there would be
overlap between her leaving and the arrival of the new Chief Information Officer.

Board Chairman Batts stated that he would like to invite Ms. Bonello and other ACS representatives to the Board
Meeting on February 26th, for an overview of transmon progress and health information technology activities.

Chairman Carvalho suggested that it may be a good idea if the Human Resources Committee were to address the
issue of recruitment challenges for health information technology positions.

DRAFT PROCUREMENT POLICY

Introduction

Before we walk through the key elements of the Draft Procurement Policy, I will
brie?y review the parameters of the System Board?s authority to adopt this Policy.

The County Ordinance that established the Health and Hospitals System, which we
refer to as the Enabling Ordinance, expressly provides, in relevant part, that:

The System Board shall have authority over all procurement and contracts
for the CCI-IHS. The System Board shall adopt written rules, regulations
and procedures with regard to these ?inctions BE
CONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS SET EOR THE IN 
COOK COUNTY CODE ON PROCUREMENT AND 

This is what is micallv referred to as the Conntv?s Purchasing Ordinance.

Consequently, this draft policy contains numerous references to provisions of the
County?s Purchasing Ordinance which the System?s Procurement Director will
have to follow in administering this Policy.

As we review the draft Policy, I will hig?ight a few instances where we were
required to include provisions in order to be consistent with the Cg_unty?s

Purchasing Ordinance.
One exception to this ?consistent with? proviso is that:

where the County Purchasing Ordinance requires approval of the County
Board or County Purchasing Agent, that approval is NOT required in the
rules or policy eventually adopted by the System Board.

The Enabling Ordinance provides that the System Board may act in place of the
Coun? Board in any contract or agreement which requires approval or other action
of the County Board.

89

As we?ve noted on numerous occasions, the Enabling Ordinance also provides
that:

Until such time as the System Board adopts its own rules, regulations or
procedures with regard to Procurement and Contracts, the existing

provisions of the Purchasing Ordinance.

Finally, on this point, the EnablingOrdinance provides that:

The System Board may exercise the authority I just recited regarding
procurement and contracting WHOLE OR IN PART PURSUANT
TO THE SYSTEM 

A case in point - verv early in its existence, the System Board exercised this
authority IN PART by adopting a rule that allows this Board to approve contracts.

However, until the System adopts its own policy SUCH AS THE DRAFT
BEFORE YOU TODAY - as well as procedures regarding procurement the
System is still operating pursuant to the existing provisions of the County 5
Purchasing Ordinance;

 

This is why the System is still processing contracts through the County Purchasing
Agent.

In drafting this Policy we were guided by certain general goals such as:

Endeavoring to streamline the procurement process - realized through

procedures promulgated pursuant to this Policy:

where permissible departing from certain existing practices; for
example, having contracts appear on the System Board?s
agendas fewer times than they currently do;

0 OR, where permissible, enabling the delegation of certain
authority, such as the authority to approve a bill or claim to the
CEO, once the contract has been properly approved.

I Another goal was to enable the System to bring the purchasing
process in house, under System?s control, to the greatest degree
possible.

90

0 And, of course, we were guided by the principles set forth in the
preamble to the Policy the overall goals of achieving maximum
ef?ciency in Operations, cost containment and transparency in the
Systems procurement and contracting procedures.

PART ONE

Part One sets forth certain GENERAL PROVISIONS of the Policy.
Of signi?cant note is Section 1.2, entitled Purchases.

This Section describes the basic ground rules for contract approval.

And is one of those instances where the Policy must be 
the County?s Purchasing Ordinance.

In essence: this Section addresses who must approve a contract depending on the
type and amount of the contract. 

0 All contracts for purchases of Professional or Managerial Services of
$25,000 or more must be approved by the System Board, and

All contracts for purchases of supplies, materials, equipment and 
Professional and Managerial Services of $100,000 or more must be
approved by the System Board.

This section also provides that contracts less than the amounts speci?ed,
ARE TO BE APPROVED BY THE CEO OR HIS OR HER DESIGNEE AS
PROVIDED IN THE PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE PROMULGATED
PURSUANT TO THIS POLICY. .

In other words, the CEO or his designee will approve contracts for less than
$25,000 if the contract is for Professional or Managerial Services OR less
than $100,000 if the contract is for supplies, materials and equipment and
non Professional and Managerial Services - everything else will come to the
System Board.

The Policy ALSO provides that contracts approved by the System Board will be
EXECUTED by the System CEO and System CFO.

3

91

Part One also sets forth the Powers and Duties of the System?s Procurement

Director:
Signi?cant among these is the:

I Duty to establish and maintain PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES AND
FORMS REQUIRED FOR-CONTRACT EXECUTION

This Policy is, in large part, an enabling document. The critical details will be set
forth in the Procurement Director?s procedures.

PART TWO:

Part Two of the Policy outlines the various alternative purchase methods available
to the System and describes the criteria for each alternative method.

Again, remember that this Policy has to be CONSISTENT WITH the County?s
Purchasing Ordinance .. so

AS A BASIC PREMIS, THE POLICY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SYSTEM
PURCHASES ARE TO BE MADE BY BID PURCHASE, OR WHAT HAS
TYPICALLY BEEN REFERRED TO AS BUT THAT
SYSTEM PURCHASES MAY BE MADE BY ONE OF THE 
NIETHODS LISTED IN THE POLICY - WHERE THE PURCHASE MEETS
THE CRITERIA SET FORTH FOR THAT ALTERNATIVE METHOD.

In addition to the Bid Purchase or competitive bid - method of purchase, the
Policv sets forth the alternative methods_ of:

II Open Market Purchases - these are purchases that do not require Board
approval based on the amount of money involved and which would fall
under the authority to approve.

I Requests for Preposals which this Committee has seen.

0 Purchasing Consortia, including GPOs or Group Purchasing Organizations

4

92

93

I Sole Source Purchases
0 Comparable Government Bid, AND
I Emergency Purchases.

Each of these methods is described in detail in the Policy.

PART TWO of the Policy also includes some miscellaneous requirements from the
County?s Purchasing Ordinance with regard to certain special purchases such as:

I Contracts for the purchase of Government Property or Services;
0 Contracts for consulting and auditing Services; AND

0 Contracts for purchase of Construction Services.

Part Three

Part Three of the Policy includes the various reguirements found throughout the
County?s Purchasing Ordinance that must be incorporated into the System?s
contracts.

For example. the System?s contracts have to include provisions ?ag: the proposed
contract vendor:

- must pay its employees a living wage;

0 cannot have any delinquent taxes, including real estate taxes, with the
County;

I cannot have outstanding child support payments; etc.

Currently, the County?s Purchasing Agent securres compliance with these
requirements through the execntion forms the vendor is required to complete when
contracting_with the County, which forms include various certi?cations and
affidavits addressing these various requirements.

The System?s Procurement Director?s procedures. which will be established
pursuant to this Policy, will have to address these requirements.

Part Four

Part Four of the Policy addresses compliance with the County?s Minority and

Women Owned Business Enterprises requirements.

The Policy calls for having the System?s Procurement Director assume all the

duties and responsibilities currently iniposed upon the County?s Purchasing Agent,

the County?s Contract Compliance Administrator. as well as the Of?ce of Contract
Compliance.

 

In other words, the Policy calls for the contract compliance ?mctions of purchasing
to be performed here at the System.

Part Five

Part Five of the Policy sets forth the ways in which a vendor shall or _n_lav be
disquali?ed from entering into a contract with the Countyr through the System.

By way of example:

0 If a vendor who has a contract with the County, including a contract
with the System and the vendor defaults on the contract and the
contract is terminated, that vendor may not contract with the County,
including the System, for 24 months.

I will note that if it is the System Board that terminated the contract
for cause, the System Board may reduce or waive this period of
ineligibility.

There are a number of additional grounds for disquali?cation which you can
review in part Five of the draft policy.

94

Part Six

Part Six is the ?nal part of the draft policy and contains certain miscellaneous
provisions.

Speci?cally, Part Six provides:

I That any change to the policy requires the _approval of the System
Board.

0 Signi?cantly, Section Six also provides that this Policy will be
effective upon its approval by the System Board. However, in order
to provide for an orderly transition from the Of?ce of the County?s
Purchasing Agent as well as the County?s Office of Contract
Compliance, the provisions of this Policy, once adopted, will be
implemented, in whole or in part, at the direction of the System?s
CEO when in his or her discretion the System has the capability to
undertake the speci?c powers and responsibilities set forth in the
Policy.

Tha?s the of the Draft Policy. Our Of?ce will work with this
Committee?s working group and Management to make any desired and permissible
changes before bringing the next Draft to the System Board.

Any Questions?
