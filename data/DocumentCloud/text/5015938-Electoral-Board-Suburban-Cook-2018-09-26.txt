PROPOSED RESOLUTION
ESTABLISHING THE COOK COUNTY COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE TO DEVELOP
AND IMPLEMENT AN OUTREACH STRATEGY FOR THE 2020 CENSUS
WHEREAS, the Constitution of the United States requires an enumeration of the population every 10 years
to apportion congressional representation among the states; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 141 of Title 13 of the United States Code, the next federal decennial
census of the population will be taken on the first day of April in 2020; and
WHEREAS, the United States Census Bureau will endeavor to count every person in the nation, and many
states and counties are establishing programs and initiatives to promote the census; and
WHEREAS, a complete and accurate count of the population is essential to the fair and proper allocation
of federal funds towards social service programs, influences the planning and development of highways,
hospitals, and businesses, and has a direct bearing on electoral representation and redistricting; and
WHEREAS, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the 2020 Decennial Census will
cost an estimated $15.6B for which there is substantial budgetary shortfall that could result in an adverse
impact on the Census Bureau’s ability to accurately count every resident of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has one of the highest concentrations of hard-to-count populations in the state,
including racial minorities, immigrants, young children, tenants, and low-income households, among
others, and an outreach strategy must be developed and implemented to include them in the Census; and
WHEREAS, this will be the first decennial Census carried out in a primarily online format, which may
have a disparate impact on residents in hard-to-count communities who are more likely to face barriers
created by the digital divide; and
WHEREAS, a united voice from businesses, government, community and faith based organizations,
educators, media and others will allow the 2020 Census message to reach a broader audience, providing
trusted advocates who can spark positive conversations about the 2020 Census ensuring that all
communities are informed about the importance of the 2020 United States Census and that every resident
is counted; and
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board President create a Complete
Count Committee and appoint a Chair of the Committee, as well as the chairs of subcommittees that are
representative of, and are directed to develop locally relevant outreach to all Cook County communities;
and

 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Complete Count Committee shall report to the Cook County Board
of Commissioners on the development of a comprehensive outreach strategy on a bi-monthly basis leading
up to the 2020 Census that shall include, but not be limited to sponsorship and partner funding initiatives
to encourage participation in the 2020 census, the establishment and support of school-based outreach
programs, partnerships with philanthropic organizations, non-profit community based organizations, and
multi-lingual, multi-media campaigns designed to ensure an accurate and complete count of Cook County's
population.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
PROPOSED RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE
COOPERATIVES IN COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS

DEVELOPMENT

OF

WORKER

WHEREAS, a “worker cooperative” is a business that is cooperatively owned and controlled by
itsworkers; and
WHEREAS, the worker cooperative model has proven to be an effective tool for creating and maintaining
sustainable, dignified jobs; generating wealth; improving the quality of life of workers; and promoting
community and local economic development, particularly for people who lack access to conventional
means of business ownership; and
WHEREAS, many worker cooperatives in the United States today were designed to improve low- wage
jobs and build wealth in communities most directly affected by inequality; and
WHEREAS, a 2009 University of Wisconsin study reported that there are an estimated 350 worker
cooperatives throughout the country with a combined estimated total revenue of $365 million, and it is
believed these estimates are much larger today; and
WHEREAS, the local economy has lost thousands of well-paying manufacturing jobs that have mostly
been replaced by minimum or low-wage service industry work and has expanded barriers to economic
mobility for people of color, returning citizens, and immigrants; and
WHEREAS, there is a growing number of worker cooperatives throughout Cook County that currently
lack access to capital, public awareness of the worker cooperative model, training and support services, and
also face significant legal complexity; and
WHEREAS, the mandate of the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development includes fostering
business growth, attraction, and retention; supporting workforce development, job creation, and sustainable
employment; and, encouraging sustainable community investment; and
WHEREAS, worker cooperatives employ less common governance and financial structures, and because
the County currently lacks programming and resources to help these beneficial enterprises thrive; now,
therefore,
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners supports the
development and growth of worker cooperatives; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners celebrates the
tremendous benefits of worker cooperatives in Cook County and supports the movement to create more
worker cooperatives throughout the region; and

 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development is encouraged to
consider use of community development block grant (CDBG) funding where appropriate and other
appropriate sources of funding to support local worker cooperatives and cooperative conversions,
strengthen existing organizations that are incubating and training worker cooperatives in Cook County, and
help to equip other organizations to provide such services, focusing on services to low‐income residents or
in underserved areas; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Bureau of Economic Development is encouraged to help worker
cooperatives access tailored resources created by community organizations and make referrals to technical
assistance providers for individuals seeking to launch new worker cooperatives or convert conventional
businesses to worker ownership, as well as seek opportunities to partner with worker cooperative initiatives
such as the Chicagoland Cooperative Ecosystem Coalition on worker cooperative education initiatives; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, it is recommended that educational materials produced to serve as a
resource for worker cooperatives and data on related outreach and funding be made publicly available on
an annual basis where appropriate as determined by the partnerships created through this effort; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the federal, state and city of Chicago governments are encouraged to
take steps to support worker cooperatives.
