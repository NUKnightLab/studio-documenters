BOARD

OF

1.

The Legislation, Intergovernmental and Veteran Relations Committee of the
Cook County Board shall conduct a public hearing to determine what policies and
actions the County Board should take with regard to expiring TIF Areas and
monies available there from.

2.

Such hearing shall be scheduled prior to December 17, 2008.

1.

After a hearing on the subject matter, the Cook County Board shall use as much
of the $10 million RTIV as necessary to bond for $90 million, to be used for real
estate tax Circuit Breaker relief as determined by the Cook County Board; and

the remainder of the $10 million shall be returned to the taxpayers as a property
tax rate reduction.
Ms. Berman and Mr. Vaselopulos delivered further remarks.
Commissioner Claypool offered the following clarification for the record: This produces the
equivalent of an income stream that then would support a bond just like any other traditional
income stream. It is not, unlike some of the conversation heard today, “robbing Peter to pay
Paul.” It is not taking part of our budget or healthcare or pensions or something else to balance
out, but rather is taking something that was not previously available to the County that now is
available to the County to support a new source.
Commissioner Daley clarified for the record that next year the levy would be $730 million.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Claypool, moved to withdraw the
motion to Approve Communication No. 297355.
Commissioner Claypool, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, moved to adjourn. The
motion carried.
