UNANIMOUSLY.

B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
The following individuals provided additional information on the requests: Dr. Claudia Fegan, Executive
Medical Director/Medical Director Stroger Hospital; and Agnes Therady, Executive Director of Nursing.
With regard to request number 2, Ms. Besenhofer indicated that this request includes dollars for some
transactions that have accumulated. Board Chairman Carvalho requested that, in the future, if this is the case,
the transmittals should note that information.
During the discussion of request number 3, a question arose regarding whether the vendor is a for-profit
corporation. Ms. Besenhofer responded that she will check and provide that information to the Committee1.
Board Chairman Carvalho provided an overview of the history of the System’s transition from providing these
types of services at System facilities to outsourcing those services through vendors. In response to a question
from Director Hammock regarding the rates paid for these services, Ms. Besenhofer stated that the rates are on
a per-diem basis, and there was no increase to the rates relating to this contract extension. Board Chairman
Carvalho asked Ms. Besenhofer to be able to address two subjects relating to the request for the Board Meeting
next week: 1) need to provide the back story relating to the contract history and history of the provision of
these services; and 2) need to elaborate on the subject of the rates, as it relates to the marketplace. He
suggested that this information be incorporated for the full Board2.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 9. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
C. Any items listed under Sections III and IV

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided an update on the Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver
Demonstration Project/CountyCare.
Mr. Glass informed the Committee that on December 30, 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS) granted the State of Illinois a 90-day temporary extension of the CountyCare waiver through
March 31st; CMS noted that they would consider an additional three month temporary extension, if needed.
The most significant change in the extension is that CountyCare is able to claim 100% of the per-member permonth capitation for its membership starting January 1, which aligns to the Fiscal Year 2014 budget. In
addition, the extensive application assistor network that has been put in place will be allowed to continue
through March 31st without disruption.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare (continued)
These 90 days will allow leadership from the System and the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family
Services (HFS) to continue their negotiations of the managed care agreement which will make CountyCare a
full-fledged managed care entity. It is anticipated that the managed care agreement will be brought to members
of the Finance Committee for review in March.
Also within these next 90-days, CountyCare leadership will finalize its plans to transition its back-office thirdparty administrator to a new vendor. The agreement for this is under negotiation, and is expected to be brought
to the Finance Committee in February for review.
During the update, Board Chairman Carvalho provided an overview regarding a meeting held yesterday by the
Healthcare Reform Implementation Council; a report was presented by the State regarding their progress in
implementing the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Two notable things were learned. First, of the number of
persons whom the State has identified as benefiting from the expansion of Medicaid, about half or more than
half of them are here at the System; the System has really contributed to the State’s ability to tout the fact that a
lot of persons have been enrolled in Medicaid and the ACA. Secondly, it was reported that the handoff from
the federal website to the State of persons who really belong in Medicaid, not in the ACA options, apparently
is not working well; therefore, the State is about to receive approximately 70,000 applications that they are
now going to have to figure out how to process. They made reference to the fact that they may have to pull
people from other tasks in order to do it in a timely way. Board Chairman Carvalho asked whether the
administration has received any assurances from the State that they will not be pulling people from the staff of
County-paid State employees who process System applications; he inquired whether the processing of System
applications is at risk because of this. Mr. Glass responded that the administration has not heard that this will
happen, but he will confirm and report back on the matter3.
With regard to enrollment and membership activity for CountyCare since the last meeting, Mr. Glass stated
that on Friday, January 10th, CountyCare approved membership surpassed 70,000 members. This
accomplishment was announced and celebrated at an event attended by Cook County Board President Toni
Preckwinkle, United States Senator Richard Durbin, System Finance Committee Chairman and Cook County
Commissioner Jerry Butler, Board Chairman David Carvalho, Dr. Raju and several System staff at Erie Family
Health Center, one of the System’s partnering Federally-Qualified Health Center (FQHC) sites. He added
that, as of this past Wednesday, 71,494 people have been approved for membership in CountyCare.
In addition to this membership threshold, Mr. Glass stated that CountyCare also achieved another significant
milestone last week –100,000 applications have been submitted to the State for processing. As of Tuesday,
there have been 101,496 applications for CountyCare membership sent to the State for processing.
The Committee received and filed the report without objection.

VI.

Report from Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #3)
John Cookinham, System Chief Financial Officer, reviewed his report, which contained information on the
following subjects: Year End Results; Year End Comparison; 2013 Cash Collections versus Budget; and Year
End Adjustments. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the information on page five of the presentation, Board Chairman Carvalho inquired
regarding the section on Physician Revenue and Contracts. Mr. Cookinham explained that this section relates
to those situations where System physicians are placed at other institutions; in some cases the System collects
money for their services at those institutions, and in other instances the institutions pay for staffing contracts
under which the System provides the physician, and the institution pays the System for the cost of the
physician. Dr. Raju provided additional information on the subject. He stated that the System provides some
specialist physicians for some of the safety-net hospitals, and collects money for those services. Board
Chairman Carvalho noted that several years ago the System had an issue in which Roseland Hospital was well
behind in its payments to the System; he inquired whether that issue has been cleared up. Dr. Raju responded
in the negative; he stated that the System continues to have a problem with receiving payment from Roseland
Hospital. Board Chairman Carvalho requested that the Committee receive a report on the situation with
Roseland Hospital, at some point in the near future.

VII. Adjourn
As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman Butler declared the meeting ADJOURNED.

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
The scope of work for Provident Hospital has been reviewed and revised. The scope of work has been reduced to
be comparable with the current environment and will yield no negative impact to the safety of our patients and staff.
A Request for Quotation was issued to our two incumbents. The results of the scope of services utilized for the RFQ

which are more closely aligned with true requirements will result in savings In keeping with our
desire to standardize across all facilities and based upon both responses received to our Request for
Quotation proposal, we request to amend and increase the current contract with Digby?s Detective Security Agency
in the amount of $1 592,307.30 for fifteen (15) months and to make the contract amendment coterminous with the
original contract period.

TERMS OF REQUEST:
This request is to amend and increase contract number H13-25-032 in an amount not to exceed $1,592,307.30 as

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
This request is to amend and increase the contract for the printing of forms, labels and document management. The
increase is needed due to the volume and increased utilization of clinical labels, pharmacy and lab labels,
prescription forms as well as marketing and communication materials - such as brochures and pamphlets including
those for County Care. This has resulted in the increase for additional funding. Going fonzvard, the overall print cost
is planned to be reduced by 30% by June 2014 and 80% by year end. This will be accomplished by migrating printed
clinical forms to electronic formats utilizing the current Electronic Medical Record technology.

07/21/2013 and 08/01/2013 thru 11/30/2013.

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:

NuCare provides short term care long term care for patients who cannot be discharged home for lack of the
resources or insurance coverage necessary to secure these services directly. Patients are placed in short term
modalities such as IV antibiotics or sub-acute rehabilitation when they no longer meet the criteria for inpatient
hospitalization. This contract also covers the long term care for patients as well as hospice patients needing skilled
nursing care. As the contract included optional annual renewals we are requesting the Board to approve the
