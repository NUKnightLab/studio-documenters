DESCRIPTION: The Charter Schools Law (105 ILCS et seq., as amended) provides that up to
70 charter schools may be operated in the city of Chicago. Proposals to operate charter schools are
submitted to the Board for evaluation pursuant to the standards set forth in 105 ILCS and the
Board convenes a public meeting to obtain information to assist in its decision to grant or deny each
proposal and report its action to the Illinois State Board of Education. The State Board determines
whether the approved charter school proposal and the proposed contract satisfy the provisions of the
Charter Schools Law and, if so, certifies the charter school. This school operated as an existing public
school during the 2009-2010 school year (Board Report 08-1022-EX16). This proposal to convert a public
school to charter school status is consistent with Section 27A?8(b) of the Illinois Charter Schools Law.

Innovation and Incubation and the Office of Management and Budget have partnered with the school to

semester enrollment date and waiving the facility expenses at the school for the 2013-2014 school year.

SCOPE OF SERVICES:

Vendor will supply all equipment, supplies, and labor (supervision, training, and management) necessary to
provide custodial services for all schools, excluding a group of pre-selected schools which will be managed
separately. Custodial services includes management of Board custodians, who will receive training and
supervision by Vendor.

Vendor will also provide a custodial call-center to serve CPS schools to manage work order requests and
respond to emergencies. Vendor will ensure the optimal operation of the facilities and maintenance of the
Board's Standard Cleaning Specifications. These specifications are consistent with delivering services at a
Level 2 standard for APPA ratings.

Vendor shall provide custodians to engage in nighttime deep cleaning along with daytime cleaning.

Vendor shall provide a manager to ensure delivery of Services and proper supervision of employees.
Manager has responsibility for managing all functions, providing necessary reports, managing budgets,
acting in a fiduciary capacity for protection and maintenance of equipment, serving as a relationship
manager on behalf of the provider and proposing new cost savings or efficiency projects. This is not
intended to be an all inclusive description of duties, but is providing insight to the Board's minimum
expectations.

DELIVERABLES:

1) Reduce CPS's custodial services cost while maintaining a high standard of service and quality.
2) Ensure consistency and timely delivery of services.

3) Continuously improve quality and service levels and drive year-over-year cost reductions.

4) Eliminate inefficiencies.

5) Establish common standards for service across the District.

6) Better align vendor interests with CPS's interests.

7) Implement industry-best practices and technology enhancements, where applicable.

LEASE OF SPACE: The Board authorizes the lease of space in CPS facilities to the Vendor and delegates
authority to the Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel to negotiate the terms and conditions of
the lease.

OUTCOMES:

district at an improved cost structure. There will be a consistent cleanliness standard across the district. A
call center will provide improved response time and visibility to school administrators. School administrators
will have more resources to focus on instruction and family and community engagement.

be purchased and inventoried using national leverage to reduce cost and drive standardization across the
district.
