 Statement to the Cook County Board
Darrius M. Lightfoot
March 2, 2014

I would like to thank the Board for giving me the opportunity to serve the
people of Cook County as a member of the Cook County Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center Advisory Board. I am a community Organizer in the Southside
neighborhood of Woodlawn. I have advocated for juvenile justice since 2007. As a
lead youth Organizer my youth-led Organization FLY (Fearless Leading by the
Youth) has been spearheading this movement and has accomplished a lot through
the years. During the previous administration I led a successful campaign; the cause
was to improve sanitary conditions in the JTDC. As a leader of FLY I am accountable
to a group of young people. Saying that, the voice that I bring to the Board is not just
mine, it's the voice of many young people from many neighborhoods. We also are
working with the community to find out what alternatives or reforms they think
need to be implemented.
Justice is a term people use very broadly and sometimes they do not even
know the meaning. Having been involved in the juvenile justice system as a
detainee at the JTDC, I know what goes on there. Because of that I know what the
youth need, as well as the negative impact incarceration has on youth. This is
another valuable resource that I bring to the table. I am a young black man and as
the data shows, that is the highest rate of youth in the JTDC. Part of my work is
working with criminally involved youth in the neighborhood; this gives me firsthand knowledge of what reforms are needed.
My work with Juvenile Justice helps me build many relationships with
various groups and individuals who do similar work concerning juvenile justice. I
have been trained in the art of Peace Circles, which is a form of Restorative Justice,
thanks to Precious Blood, an organization from the Back of the Yards Neighborhood.
I am part of a Juvenile Justice National Task Force with The Burns Institute, based in
San Francisco, California. I have been part of many juvenile justice conferences
nationally, which gave me the opportunity to build relationships with groups and
individuals who do similar work These relationships are a valuable resource I will
bring with me to the Board.
I believe I will be a great asset to the Board. Thank you for your
consideration.

 Statement to the Cook County Board of Commissioners
Rhoda D. Sweeney
March 12, 2014

My name is Rhoda Davis Sweeney. I retired from the position of Judge of the
Circuit Court of Cook County on November 30, 2013. During the years that I served
on the bench, I sat in the Juvenile Division, Traffic Court, Housing Court and First
Municipal non-jury civil court.
Prior to my tenure on the bench, I served as an Assistant Cook County State's
Attorney, where I was assigned to prosecute in the 1st Municipal Branch Criminal
Courts and in the Branch Drug Courts. My last position as a state's attorney was
supervisor of the Narcotics Forfeitures division.
I have also been a defense attorney in both state and federal courts, where I
had extensive experience with gangs upon being appointed by federal judges in drug
and gang cases.
Also pertinent to my qualifications is my 17 years of volunteer work as a
group leader at the McDermott Haymarket Center, which is a facility that has a
prison alternative floor. Over the years, I have worked with recovering alcohol and
drug addicts, many of whom have been imprisoned in the Cook County Jail, as well
as state prisons.
Accordingly, I have had unique experiences which qualify me to serve on the
Justice Advisory Council. I am very eager to assist the Council in addressing the
challenges our criminal justice system presents and to serve the citizens of Cook
County.
Thank you.
