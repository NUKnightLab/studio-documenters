BC2019- 293
Scope of Work Summary
The Department of Public Works is requesting a RFP Exemption for the Sanitary Division for the attached
various vendors in said amounts (see attached list) for routine building & supply purchases, and other
misc. business needs for the period of January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019. This request is to
comply with a recent audit in regard to the ORC. The resulting approval will result in the establishment
of individual encumbrance documents set up to cover routine expenses up to $1,000 per individual
purchase – the grand total of all purchases during this timeline are not to exceed the stated amounts on
the attached document. Public Works will monitor the encumbrance balances in cooperation with Fiscal
Office.
The primary goal is to obtain daily building and supply purchases that were previously purchased via the
county voucher process. The Fiscal Office has requested that these vendors be set up via an encumbrance
document. Public Works is working with OPD on advertising RFP’s for master contracts that will replace
many of these encumbrances. The master contracts should be awarded by April 1, 2019. Any amounts
not needed after the master contacts are awarded will be decertified.
Procurement
The County is continuing to use vendors that were previously used via the voucher process. The Fiscal
Office has requested that these vendors be put under an encumbered in advance.

Title: Sheriff, RQ# SH19-45095, 2019, International Preparedness Associates, Inc; Purchase Order, 20
Scope of Work Summary
Sheriff’s Department is requesting approval of a Purchase Order with International Preparedness
Associates, Inc for the anticipated cost of $30,424.
The service being provided is specialized training for the SWAT Team. The anticipated start-completion
dates are (06/03/2019- 07/31/2019).
The primary goal of the project is to maintain skills for the Sheriff’s SWAT Team as first-responders to
maritime events and to keep them abreast of current best practices. This is important because the
Cuyahoga County SWAT Team is the only specialty unit located in Northern Ohio that has tactical
training in a marine setting.
Procurement
The procurement method for this project was originally a RFB under Req # SH-18-42847. The total value
of the RFB is $30,424.
The original RFB was closed on 7/24/18. The above vendor was the only qualified bid received.
RFP Exemption: This requisition was originally bid under Req # SH-18-42847 in a formal competitive bid
process. Unfortunately, there was only one qualified bidder during that bid process. Federal grant
guidelines require a minimum of two bids for sealed competitive bidding. Due to the specialized nature
of the training and that the training must be held in the Cleveland area so the SWAT Team can learn to
follow operational procedure with the Sheriff’s Marine Patrol vessel, we did not believe another vendor
would bid. Therefore, we reached out the Federal granting agency, FEMA, to request approval to accept
the bid received, even though it was the only bid.
FEMA did provide approval to use the qualified bid, however, it took so long to get this approval there
was not enough time to process the procurement before the grant expired. We then asked for a grant
extension, which was approved.
Since it has been more than 90 days since the closing date of the original requisition and to pay any
invoices on 2019 vouchers we had to cancel the original requisition and reissue to under a new number.
We assert the approval from FEMA under the original competitive process is valid for this requisition
since the only reason for the new requisition number is clerical. If there were time to process this under
the original grant, we would have completed the competitive process and selected the current vendor.
