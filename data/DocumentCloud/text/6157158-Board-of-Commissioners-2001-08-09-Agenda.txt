PROPOSED ORDINANCE

AN ORDINANCE OF THE COUNTY OF COOK, ILLINOIS
APPROVING EXECUTION OF A
TAX REIMBURSEMENT PAYMENT AGREEMENT
WITH THE BOEING COMPANY
WHERE AS, pursuant to the Corporate Headquarters Relocati on Act, (PA 92-0207), signed into
law on August I , 2001 , as amended from time to time (the " Relocati on Act"), the General Assembly of
the State of Illinois (the "State") has detennined that the relocation of the international headquarters of
large, multinational corporations from outside of the State to a location within the State creates a
substantial public benefit and wi ll foster economic growth and development; and
WHEREAS, the Re location Act therefore provides for the creatio n of certain financial
incentives that may be used to encourage long-term commitments by an Eligible Business relocating its
Corporate Headquarters (as such terms are defined in the Re location Act) in the State; and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook (the "County"), as an affected taxing district, is authorized
under the provisions of Section 18 of the Property Tax Code, 35 ILCS 200/1 et seq., as amended from
time to time (the "Property Tax Code "), to, by a majority vote of its governing body, after the
determination of the assessed valuation of its property, to order the C lerk of Cook County to abate any
po rti on of its taxes on certa in types of real property. Pursuant to Section I 8- l 65(a)(8) of the Property
Tax Code, 35 ILCS 200/l 8- J65(a)(8), s uch abatement may be made with respect to any property or a
po rtion of any property within the County that is used by an Eligible Bus iness for a Corporate
Headquarters. Alternatively, in lie u of such abatement, the County may enter into an agreement with an
Eligible Business to make annual payments to such Eligible Business in an amo unt no t to exceed the
property taxes paid directly o r indirectly by such Eligible Business to the taxing district and any other

25 11

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR AUGUST 9, 2001
affected taxing district(s) for premises occupied pursuant to a written lease and may make such payments
without the need for an annual appropriation. Any such abatement or agreement may be effective for the
entire term specified by the County, provided, however, that such abatement or annual payments in lieu
thereof may not exceed 20 years; and

WHEREAS, the Boeing Company (" Boeing") is a large, multinational corporation with worldwide revenues in excess of $50,000,000,000 that presently maintains its international headquarters in
Seattle, Washington. Boeing intends to relocate its international headquarters to the real property
commonly known as I 00 N. Riverside Plaza, Chicago, Jllinois 60606 (the " Property"). In connection with
such relocation, Boeing has executed that certain Office Lease dated May I 0, 200 I by and between I 00
North Riverside, LLC, as landlord, and Boeing, as tenant (the " Boeing Lease"), pursuant to which Boeing
shall, among other matters, initially lease approximately 275,000 rentable square feet of space including
the top 12 floors of the building located on the Property (the " Building") for an initial period of fifteen
(15) years, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein. Upon such relocation, and during the
Term of the Agreement, as defined in the Tax Reimbursement Payment Agreement (the " Agreement")
submitted hereto as Exhibit A, the portion of the Building occupied by Boeing will be the principal office
of Boeing and the site which Boeing's principal executive officers have designated as their principal
offices. In connection with its occupancy of the Building, Boeing shall construct substantial tenant
improvements necessary to permit Boeing to take possession in accordance with the terms of the Boeing
Lease. Such relocation will create a substantial public benefit through its creation of not less than 500
permanent FTE jobs (as defined in the Agreement), through Boeing' s payment of various taxes and
governmental charges and through other public benefits described in this Agreement and wi ll also foster
further economic growth and development in the County and State. Therefore, Boeing constitutes an
Eligible Business under the Relocation Act and the portion of the Building occupied by Boeing will, upon
such occupancy, constitute Boeing's new Corporate Headquarters; and
WHEREAS, the County' s annual reimbursement payments under the Agreement wil l consist of
the County's allocable share of the Boeing General Real Estate Taxes (as defined in the Agreement), the
Forest Preserve District of Cook County a llocable share of the Boeing General Real Estates Taxes, based
on the respective tax rates of such taxing district(s) or fund ; and
WHEREAS, the County's agreement to provide the annual reimbursement payments provided
for in the Agreement is conditioned upon, among other things, (i) Boeing's relocation to the Building, as
described above, (ii) Boeing's construction of certain initial Boeing improvements, (iii) Boeing's
continued status during the Term of the Agreement as an Eligible Business under the Relocation Act, (iv)
the continued status of the portion of the Building occupied by Boeing as a Corporate Headquarters under
the Relocation Act during the Term of the Agreement, (v) Boeing's relocation to and retention at the
Building of not less than the minimum number of FTE jobs and the corporate headquarters employees
specified in the Agreement during the Term of the Agreement, (vi) Boeing's lease and occupancy of not
less than the mi nimum number of square feet at the Building specified in the Agreement during the Term
of the Agreement, and (vii) Boeing's compliance with the job readiness training and public benefit
requirements specified in the Agreement, all subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the
Agreement; and
WHEREAS, Boeing' s relocation to the County would not reasonably be anticipated without the
payment of the annual reimbursement payments provided for in the Agreement and the comparable
agreements being executed and delivered by the other taxing districts levying property taxes on the
Property and the Building; now therefore,

RESOLUTION
This Agreement is entered into this 9th day of August 2001 pursuant to 35 Ill. Admin. Code
Section 742. I 020 by and between Amoco Oil Company as owner or operator of underground storage
tank(s) ("Owner/Operator") and the County of Cook, Illinois ("the County") as follows:
WHEREAS, Owner/Operator has owned and operated or currently owns a nd operates certain
undergro und fuel storage tanks which either are currently or were previously located at 2405 West
Augusta Boulevard in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois (hereinafter "the Site");
WHEREAS, the Illinois Emergency Management Agency ("!EMA") has confirmed a release of
contaminants in the soil and groundwater at the Site and the right of way adjacent to the boundary of the
Site. The !EMA has assigned incident number 923151 to this release at the Site. Submitted as Exhibit A
is a site map which shows the area of estimated contaminant impacted soil and/or groundwater at the time
of this Agreement in the right of way above Tier I residential levels under 35 Ill. Adm in. Code Part 742.
Also submitted as Exhibit B is a table showing the concentration of contaminants of concern, hereafter
"Contaminants", in soil and/or ground water within the area described in Exhibit A and which shows the
app licabl e Tier I objectives for soil and groundwater of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency
(" !EPA") which are exceeded. The right of ways described in Exhibit A (commonly described as
Augusta Boulevard and Western Avenue and hereinafter described as the "Right-of Way"), adjacent to
the site is s ubject to this Agreement. As the drawings in the Exhibits are not plats, the boundary of the
Right-of-Way in the Exhibits may be an approximation of the actual Right-of-Way lines. The Right-ofWay is impractical to sample for Contaminants, however, the parties believe that the area of the Right-ofWay is adequate to encompass soil and/or groundwater within the Right-of-Way possibly impacted with
Contaminants from a release at the Site;
WHEREAS, Owner/Operator is pursuing a corrective action of the Site and of the Right-of-Way
adjacent to the boundary of the Site and intends to request risk-based, site specific soil and/or
groundwater remediation objectives from the IEPA under 35 Ill. Admin. Code Part 742. Under these
rules, use of risk-based, site specific remediation objectives in the Right-of-Way may require the use of a
Highway Authority Agreement as defined in 35 Ill. Adm in. Code Section 742. l 020;
WHEREAS, the County holds a fee simple interest or a dedication for highway purposes in the
Right-of-Way, and has jurisd iction over it. As such, the County exercises sole control over the access to
the soil and use of the groundwater beneath the Right-of-Way;
WHEREAS, the Owner/Operator and the County are desirous of preventing the use of
groundwater under the Right-of-Way as a potable or domestic s upply of water and to limit access as
described herein to the soil under the Right-of-Way that is contaminated from the release at level s above
residential Tier I remediation objectives;
WHEREAS, this Agreement is intended as a "Highway Authority Agreement" pursuant to the
terms of 35 Ill. Adm in. Code Section 742. 1020, which restricts the use of the land under the Right-ofWay adjacent to the Site.

A.

The County

( I)
The County will prohibit the use of groundwater beneath the Right-of-Way that is contaminated
from the release at levels above Tier I residential remediation objectives as a potable or other domestic
supply of water and will limit access to soil under the Right-of-Way that is contaminated from the release
at levels above Tier I residential remediation objectives.
The County has the right to construct, reconstruct, improve, repair, maintain and operate a
(2)
highway upon its property or to a llow others to use the Right-of-Way by permit. The County reserves the
right and the right of those using its property under permit to remove contaminated soil or groundwater
above Tier I residential remediation objectives from its Ri ght-of-Way and to dispose of the same as
deemed appropriate not inconsistent with applicable environmental regulations so as to avoid causing a
further release of contaminants and to protect human health and the environment.
Prior to taking any such action, the County w ill first give Owner/Operator thirty (30) days written
notice, unless there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public or any individual, that it
intends to perform a site investigation in the Right-of-Way and remove or dispose of contaminated soil or
groundwater to the extent necessary fo r its work. The removal or disposal shall be based upon the site
investigation and any modificati ons thereto as field conditions dictate.
If the County deems it practicable, it may request Owner/Operator to review or perform the site
investigation and/or to remove and dispose of the contaminated soil and/or groundwater necessary for the
County's work in advance of that work. Failure of the County to give notice to Owner/Operator of its
intent to perfo rm a site investigation shall not constitute a violation of this Agreement.

provisions in accordance with all environmental laws:
"As a condition of this permit, the permittee sha ll request the office issuing the pennit to identify
sites in the Right-of-Way where access to contaminated soil or gro undwater is governed by
Tiered Approach to Correcti ve Action Obj ectives Agreements. The permittee shall take
measures before, during and after any access to these sites to protect worker safety and human
health and the environment. Excavated, contaminated soil should be managed off-site in

investigating, identi fy ing, handling, storing and disposing of contaminated soil and groundwater in the
Ri ght-of-Way as a result of the release of contaminants at this S ite. There is a rebuttable presumption that

incurs in removing and disposing of any contam inants discovered within the Ri ght-of-Way, as required
by appl icable environmental laws, in the course of performing highway activities other than ordinary
maintenance. Owner/Operator understands that the County does not represent that it will perfo rm
maintenance on the Right-of-Way, or that it w ill mainta in the Right-of-Way as an engineered barrier, or
that the Right-of-Way will a lways re main a highway.
Owner/Operator agrees to indemnify and hold the County and its Commissioners, officers,
(3)
agents, director, employees, contractors, consultants and affi liates, permit holders, as well as any other

BREACH

A.

By Owner/Operator

Should Owner/Operator, or its successors and/or assigns, violate any of the tenns of this
Agreement shall be null and void as a highway authority agreement at the County's option upon thirty
(30) days' written notice by the County. If the violation relates to Owner/Operator's failure to reimburse
the County, as provided in paragraphs 2(B)( I), (2) or (3), above, Owner/Operator may remedy the breach
by making payment within twenty (20) working days from the date the notice is received.

B.

By County

Violation of the terms of this Agreement by the County shall not void this Agreement unless the
IEPA has determined that the violation is grounds for voidance of this Agreement as a highway authority

Should the County breach this, breach of Agreement, Owner/Operator's sole remedy is an action
for damages in the Illinois Court of Claims. Any and all claims for damages against the County arising at
any time for a breach of paragraph 2(A)( I) of this Agreement are limited to an aggregate maximum of
twenty thousand ($20,000.00) dollars. No other breach by the County of a provision in this Agreement is
actionable in Jaw or equity by Owner/Operator.

JOHN W. DAVIS, Director, Real Estate Management Division
requesting approval of the submitted lease amendment for the premises in the Cook County
Administration Building with the Grandma Gebhard Company as tenant. The Cook County Board had
previously approved an extension of the three existing leases with this tenant on a month-to-month basis

renew for a long term, but has agreed to continue to operate a portion of the area until December 3 I,

service to occupants of the building. The base rent and operating pass-through expense for the Dairy
Queen and Muffin Shop will continue at their current levels, as will the rental for the storage space lease.
The County will continue to seek out a new occupant for the food service operation during this period.
Notwithstanding the aforementioned, if a suitable tenant has not been identified, also requested is the
authority to extend this agreement upon its expiration, on a month-to-month basis, at the same terms and
