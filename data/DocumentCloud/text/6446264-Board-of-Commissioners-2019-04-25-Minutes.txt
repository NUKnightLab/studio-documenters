PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REQUESTING STATE’S ATTORNEY KIM FOXX TO APPEAR BEFORE THE BOARD OF
COMMISSIONERS TO DISCUSS THE STATE’S ATTORNEYS OFFICE’S DECISION TO
DISMISS ALL CHARGES IN THE JUSSIE SMOLLETT CASE
WHEREAS, Jussie Smollett alleged that he was a victim of a racist and homophobic hate crime in the City
of Chicago, County of Cook; and
WHEREAS, the alleged hate crime attack immediately received global media attention and the
immeasurable impact of this case has reflected poorly on the City of Chicago and Cook County government;
and
WHEREAS, the Chicago Police Department expended valuable resources to investigate the hate crime
attack alleged by Mr. Smollett; and
WHEREAS, the investigation by the Chicago Police Department revealed that the alleged hate crime never
occurred and was, in fact, staged by Jussie Smollett; and
WHEREAS, Jussie Smollett was indicted by a Cook County Grand Jury on 16 felony counts after allegedly
lying to police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic hate crime; and
WHEREAS, the decision by State’s Attorney Kim Foxx and her office to adjudicate the Smollett case in
an unprecedented manner caught the Mayor of Chicago and the Chicago Police Superintendent completely
off-guard and has left much doubt and many questions yet to be answered; and
WHEREAS, the overwhelming reaction from the legal community has been of shock and surprise by the
decision and it has left a negative perception that the State’s Attorney’s Office was neither fair and equitable
nor transparent in the adjudication of the Smollett case; and
WHEREAS, Cook County constituents deserve nothing less than honest and transparent answers to this
very troubling case; and

Summary: This contract will allow all County departments participate in the photocopier leasing
program. All equipment will be capable of network printing, faxing, and scanning. Cost per copy includes
the use of the equipment, maintenance services and all supplies (excluding paper).
It has been determined that leasing of multifunction photocopier equipment allows the County to achieve
significant savings when contrasted with purchasing and maintaining the same equipment. Additionally,
photocopier leasing contracts allow the County to keep up with technology by replacing the equipment
with each new contract. Finally, multifunction photocopier equipment allows departments to eliminate
stand-alone printers and fax machines which reduce capital, maintenance, and supply costs.
Competitively bidding procedures were followed in accordance with the Cook County Procurement Code.
Bids were solicited for leasing of multi-functioning digital copiers. Toshiba Business Solution was lowest,
responsive and responsible bidder.
The proposed contract will replace County Contract No. 1384-12815 (Konica Minolta), which expires on
May 1, 2019.

support from Loyola University Chicago. Loyola's participation will include developing an in-depth
implementation fidelity review plan, a process evaluation plan, and an outcome evaluation plan.
The successful implementation of this federal grant award requires a research partner that possesses
unique skills and knowledge related to the administration of community corrections in Cook County. To
perform the required grant activities, the research partner must have a strong knowledge and
understanding of the criminal justice system in Cook County, specifically the courts and probation. Loyola
University Chicago is the only university in the Chicago area with the necessary combination of criminal
justice system experience, an available pool of student research assistants, and a focus on action research
with dedicated capacity. Faculty and students in Loyola's Criminal Justice Department have a strong track
record of research in Cook County through recent initiatives, including the MacArthur Safety and Justice
Challenge, the Adult Redeploy Illinois Program, and positions on several statewide policy and oversight
bodies. Loyola University will be providing research support through the Center for Criminal Justice
Research, Policy, and Practice, which is a unique institution in Cook County.
This is a sole source procurement pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.

THE HONORABLE DONNA MILLER, COUNTY COMMISSIONER
AN AMENDMENT TO CHAPTER 74, ARTICLE II, REAL PROPERTY TAXATION
WHEREAS, vacant properties can devastate a neighborhood and block, undermine neighbors’ quality of
life, and diminish the value of nearby properties; and
WHEREAS, they also cause severe fiscal damage to local governments, reducing local tax revenues while
costing cities millions for policing, cleaning vacant lots, and demolishing derelict buildings; and
WHEREAS, most vacant buildings and houses are well maintained, but many are not and thousands can
sit empty for years, abandoned by their owners, deteriorating to the point where they cannot be reused
without major rehabilitation with many ultimately demolished, leaving vacant lots in their place; and
WHEREAS, besides their impact on social and economic conditions, vacant, abandoned properties have a
devastating effect on the fiscal condition of their cities, towns, and counties; and
WHEREAS, not only do they pay little in property taxes and generate little revenue for the city or county
when sold at tax sales, but they further reduce property tax collections by millions of dollars by devaluing
neighboring properties.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter
74 Taxation, Article II Real Property Taxation, Division 2 Classification System for Assessment, Section
74-73, of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 74-73. - Suspension, Revocation or cancellation of incentive classification.
(a) The following Incentive Classifications are subject to suspension, revocation or cancellation
herein pursuant the provisions of this section: Class 6b; Class 6b (special circumstances); Class 6b TEERM;
Class 6b SER; Class 7a; Class 7b; Class 7c; Class 8; and Class 8 TEERM.
(b) The incentive may be suspended, revoked, or cancelled by the Assessor under the following
circumstances:
(1)

By rule, as provided by the Assessor;

(2)

By the County Board by Resolution or Ordinance, which is based on a report from the
Bureau of Economic Development that has been approved by the Economic Development
Advisory Committee of the County;

(3)

By the County Board by Resolution or Ordinance at the request of the Municipality by
submission of a Municipal Resolution or Ordinance;

(4)

By request of the taxpayer to cancel;

(5)

Beginning in the 2019 assessment year and for all subsequent assessment years, upon
application of the municipality in which a property is located finding that the owner (s),
which has received a reduction in its assessed valuation due to receiving a property tax
incentive as classified in Sec. 74-73 (a) for two consecutive tax years and has not provided
evidence to the municipality that the owner has progressed in the leasing, development
or sale of the property as contemplated in the incentive classification application submitted
by the owner (s), the Assessor may suspend the property tax incentive relating to the
property for a period not to exceed two years, subject to a subsequent application to the
Assessor by the owner (s) of said property to restore the incentive, which application is
supported by documentation of development or occupancy. After a period of two years
from the date of such suspension, if said restoration application by the owner (s) is not
received, the property tax incentive shall be revoked.

(c) A basis for revocation pursuant to Section 74-73(b)(2) or (b)(3) above includes, but is not
limited to, the following:

limited to, the application and the Economic Disclosure Statement.

(d) During such period as the Incentive Classification is suspended, the Assessor shall treat the
subject property as a Class 5 property for any tax year in which the suspension is in effect.
In case of revocation or cancellation, the Incentive Classification shall be deemed null and void for the tax
year in which the incentive was revoked or cancelled as to the subject property. In such an instance, the
taxpayer shall be liable for and shall reimburse to the County Collector an amount equal to the difference
in the amount of taxes that would have been collected had the subject property been assessed as a Class 5
property and the amount of taxes collected under the Incentive Classification as determined by the Assessor.
Effective Date: This Ordinance Amendment shall be effective upon passage.
Approved and adopted this 25th of April 2019.

PROPOSED CHANGES TO PUBLIC FACING RULES AND REGULATIONS
Department: Cook County Assessor’s Office
Summary: Revision to the Official Rules of the Cook County Assessor.
Consistent with the County Code, §1.9, the following proposal, which was approved by the Cook County
Assessor on 3/15/2019, will be effective on the date this rule revision is received and filed by the Rules
Committee of the County Board of Commissioners.
The Cook County Assessor’s Rules provide requirements, parameters and guidance to persons doing
business with the Assessor. Taxpayer assistance will be provided to individuals by Assessor personnel
during normal business hours.
FILING AN ASSESSED VALUATION APPEAL COMPLAINT
Rule 1 All complaints for an Assessment Appeal (Appeal) shall be originated by the taxpayer’s timely
filing of the official appeal form(s) prescribed and adopted by the Assessor, as set forth in these
Official Rules of the Cook County Assessor.
Rule 2 All attorneys or other parties acting on behalf of a taxpayer shall file an Attorney Authorization or
Authorization Form and the filing of the Form shall constitute a certification that the attorney or
party has been specifically authorized to file the complaint by the taxpayer, and is the only person
so authorized. Only the Assessor’s original Attorney Authorization or Authorization Form
may be filed. The Form may not be altered in any way from its original format, or language, or in
any other manner. References in these Rules to the actions of a “taxpayer” include actions of an
authorized attorney or practitioner on the taxpayer’s behalf.
Rule 3 Failure to follow any rule of the Cook County Assessor’s Office or to provide complete
information is grounds for the denial of an appeal.
Rule 4 Each form required to be filed by these rules shall be filed with all applicable information
completed in its entirety.
Rule 5 Pursuant to Rule 1, complaints must be filed on the official appeal form prescribed and adopted by
the Assessor. All sections on the form must be completed. Once filed no other copy of this

<http://www.cookcountyassessor.com/Appeals/Appeal-Forms.aspx>
Rule 6 The official application form for a Certificate of Error and supporting documentation must be filed
in triplicate. Generally, an application for a Certificate of Error generally must be filed during the
period when a taxpayer may file an appeal based on the Township schedule posted on the
Assessor’s website. If a taxpayer seeks a change in classification based on the exempt status or
property, an incentive classification, or due to the application of a homestead type exemption
(such as homestead, senior, senior freeze, veterans, disabled and disabled veterans), an application
may be filed at any time. Please see Assessment Calendar at:
www.cookcountyassessor.com/Appeals/Appeal-Deadlines.aspx
<http://www.cookcountyassessor.com/Appeals/Appeal-Deadlines.aspx>
Rule 7 A complaint must be filed on or before the date established by the Assessor as the official appeal
closing date for the Township in which the property is located. The Assessor will post in its
office and will publish on its website the opening and closing dates for filing for each of the
38 townships in Cook County, as required by law. No complaint will be accepted after the
close of a Township’s official appeal filing period as published on the Assessor’s website.
Rule 8 All complaints except individual residential complaints, must be filed in the office of the Assessor,
County Building, Room 301, 118 N. Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois 60602, either in person, or by
a courier or mail service. The date of a U.S. Postal Service postmark or the receipted date of
shipment via a courier or mail service will be considered the date of filing for a complaint received
by the Assessor. The Assessor is not responsible for complaints sent by courier or mail that are
not received on time. Appeals for individual residential taxpayers may be filed at any location of
the Cook County Assessor’s Office, filed online, or mailed in accordance with the above
provisions.
Rule 9 If property that is the subject of an appeal consists of two or more contiguous or neighboring
Property Index Numbers (PINs) at one location, the PINs shall be listed on one complaint form.
Multiple PINs that are not contiguous or do not comprise a single property at a one location, shall
be filed as separate appeals.
Rule 10 If more than one complaint is filed for the same PIN, the first complaint filed will be considered
by the Assessor as controlling. All subsequent complaints will be disregarded, provided, however,
that in the event that more than one attorney or representative files a complaint on the same
PIN(s), all parties filing on the same property shall be notified by the Assessor and the Assessor
will request a properly executed Authorization or Substitution form.
A party may substitute an appearance on behalf of a taxpayer while the appeal is pending at the
Assessor’s Office prior to the close of the Township filing or review period, by filing with the
Assessor a completed Withdrawal and Substitution form.
The complaint, the appeal Authorization or Attorney Authorization Form, and any
Withdrawal and Substitution form shall be grouped separately from other documents filed
with the appeal. All other documents that provide substance in support of an appeal should
include ONLY the attorney or practitioner’s number and not identifying law firm,
attorney or practitioner information. For example, nothing filed shall be put on a law

Except for apartment buildings with more than 6 units, the taxpayer shall file with the Assessor an
affidavit* setting forth any relationship (other than landlord and tenant) between the parties to any
submitted lease including, but not limited to, those existing by blood, or marriage to the second
degree, corporate parent-subsidiary companies, or ownership by virtue of non-publicly held stock.
The Assessor may request copies of fully executed leases.
Rule 20 If assessment relief is sought on the grounds of “vacancy” at a specific property, the taxpayer shall
file:
1. A Vacancy/Occupancy Affidavit on the form provided by the Assessor; (Occupancy shall
include all space actually occupied or for which rent is being paid or is payable, even though the
space may actually be vacant);
2. Dated photographs of the interior vacant space and/or units; and
3. An affidavit setting forth the duration of, and reason for the vacancy, the attempts made to
lease the vacant space with documents such as copies of listings and advertisements utilized in
such efforts attached. If no such effort was made, the affidavit must set forth the reason no
attempt to rent such space was made. The affidavit must comport with the form Affidavit found
on the assessor’s website.
4. If relief is sought on the grounds of “vacancy,” the utility bills for the term the vacancy is
requested must be filed.
5. As applicable, all documents required by Rule 19 also must also be filed.
The Assessor is charged with assessing property at a percentage of its fair cash value as

supported by a plat of survey detailing the dimensions and locations of all buildings, parking areas,
or other improvements, any unimproved areas or storage used, and any ingress, egress or product
or person flow across the property. The actual use of the property shall be specified. A recent
original and clear photograph of the land claimed to be excess shall be filed with the Assessor.
REVIEW OF AN ASSESSED VALUATION APPEAL DECISION
103

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

April 25, 2019

Rule 23 A taxpayer dissatisfied with a decision of the Assessor may request a review of the case. The
review process is not to be employed to cure a failure to timely submit documents required by the
Assessor. Review requests should not simply dispute the Assessor’s capitalization rates,
expense ratios, and rulings of law without further detailed explanation and analysis. Nor
should requests simply reiterate or resubmit previously advanced arguments and materials
without new supporting evidence or argument to justify reconsideration.
Review requests must be made in writing and delivered to the Assessor in person, via mail or
facsimile. Review requests must meet the following criteria:
1. be filed timely, within 5 days of the date of the letter from the Assessor informing the appellant
of the Assessor's decision;
2. identify the assessment, township and complaint number and the relevant PIN numbers of the
case; and,
3. state the specific grounds for the review request.
The only grounds for a review request which the Assessor will consider are:
1. newly discovered, obtained or received evidence, accompanied with documentation
demonstrating the previous unavailability of the documents;
2. changes in the law, setting forth the previous law and the relevant changes thereto;
3. an error or mistake in the Assessor’s previous application of existing law, setting forth the
alternative theory being advanced;
4. evidence provided in response to a request of the Assessor.
These rules shall be effective on the date of adoption by the Cook County Assessor.

stabilization. The occupancy of the properties is stated above next to the PINS. The City of Berwyn will
encourage redemption of delinquent taxes as its goal is not to displace residents, but return the properties
to the tax rolls.
A known Third Party, the Berwyn Development Corporation (the “BDC”) will be acquiring and managing
the properties on behalf of the City following acquisition through the No Cash Bid program. Should the
properties prove to be in stable condition with minimal rehabilitation costs, BDC staff recommends the
establishment of the Berwyn First Time Homeownership Program, a program for Berwyn Police, Berwyn
Fire and other qualifying individuals who may be seeking to buy property in and move closer to the
community. The process is described in further detail in the Third Party Requestor Package. If the properties
need to be rehabbed, the BDC will be responsible; the properties will then be sold. The City will file for tax
exempt status on said properties and maintain the status until parcels are transferred to new owner(s). Legal
counsel will be sought out in order to obtain the tax deed on behalf of the BDC and the BDC will bear all
legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of the parcels. Additionally, the BDC will send a
No-Cash Bid Report to the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development on the status of the parcels for
five (5) years or until development and/or rehabilitation is complete, whichever occurs last.

Summary: This letter is to express the Village of Chicago Ridge’s interest in receiving a No Cash Bid
for parcels located in Chicago Ridge. The permanent index numbers of the parcels requested are: This
Request Package contains 3 PINs (the “Subject Property”). The PINs requested currently contain a partially
occupied commercial structure on parcels in the Village of Chicago Ridge. It is the intent of the Village of
Chicago Ridge, as part of its overall economic development strategy, to acquire the Subject Property and
return it to a beneficial use for the citizens of the Village. Presently only one of the three units is occupied
by a dental lab which is a tenant of the Subject Property. The building sits directly south of a large
undeveloped piece of property suitable for redevelopment and north of a beautiful banquet facility. Upon
acquisition, it is the Village’s intent to remove the tenants, demolish the structure and market it for
redevelopment. This building is already a longstanding eyesore that brings down the value of surrounding
properties and it is located on Ridgeland Avenue, the main street through the middle of Chicago Ridge.
The Village of Chicago Ridge has retained legal counsel in order to obtain the tax deeds and will bear all
costs associated with the acquisition of the parcels. In accordance with the requirements of the Cook County
No Cash Bid Ordinance, the Village of Chicago Ridge will submit to the Cook County Office of Economic
Development a No Cash Bid Report on the status of each parcel for five years or until development is

Village’s Harlem Avenue TIF District and this blighted structure presents a clear obstacle to serious

Summary: On behalf of the Village of Crestwood (the “Village”), and pursuant to the duly enacted
resolution by the Board of Trustees of the Village of Crestwood, this letter shall serve as notice of the
Village’s interest in the No Cash Bid for the following parcel: The number of parcels in this request is one

this parcel to tax-paying status through commercial redevelopment. The property is located nearby other
Village of Crestwood NCB PINs from prior rounds and we find that there is interest in this property for use
as a truck stop, gas station or convenience facility. This would benefit the Village by adding commercial
property and businesses to the Village and increasing the Village’s assessed valuation.
The Village will initially file for tax exempt status upon receipt and filing of tax deeds, but expects to return
the property to tax-paying status at the earliest possible time. At the present time there are no Third Party
Requests, no prospective developers and no organizations identified to assume development or ownership
of this parcel. The Village will retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deeds and bear all legal and other costs
associated with acquisition of the parcel. The Village of Crestwood agrees to submit to the Cook County

Volume and Property Index Number:
231, 03-10-201-072-0000; 231, 03-10-201-074-0000
Summary: The Village of Wheeling, (the “Village”) has targeted two parcels within the Village for
redevelopment or for the use for municipal purposes. In the interest of utilizing these properties for said
purposes, the Village is seeking title to the following tax delinquent properties and requests that the Cook
County Board of Commissioners submit a No Cash Bid for both properties on behalf of the Village. The
PINs in this Request Package are as follows: This Request Package contains two (2) PINs
03-10-201-072-0000 and 03-10-201-074-0000, which are vacated parcels commonly addressed as 221
South Wheeling Road, formerly occupied by the Evanger’s Dog and Cat Food Company, Inc. The former
occupant has relocated their operations outside the Village and the existing structures are unoccupied and
are not structurally suitable for reuse. The Village has determined the parcels to no longer be fitting for
industrial uses, but acquiring them could help aid in the assemblage of parcels in this area to create a larger
land area for redevelopment. Alternately, the land could be used by the Village for Metra commuter parking
to expand the availability of commuter parking within close proximity to the train station. Acquisition of
the parcels will also allow the Village to address ongoing issues with the vacated industrial facility and
allow for proper clean-up of the land, and further the Village’s efforts to relocate heavy industrial uses from
this area due to the expansion of commercial retail and residential developments of nearby land.
The Village will file for tax exempt status as long as it retains the PINs for municipal use, maintaining that
268

status until any tax deed either or both properties is/are conveyed to a potential developer. The Village does
not, at the present time, have a Third Party Request by a developer, organization or other private party, in
which the Village would convey a certificate of purchase or the perfected tax deed of the above-listed PINs
to that Third Party Requestor. The Village agrees to submit, to the Cook County Department of Planning
and Development, No Cash Bid Reports on the status of each parcel for five (5) years, or until development
is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No Cash Bid Ordinance. The law firm
serves as Corporate Counsel to the Village of Wheeling, and will obtain the tax deeds and bear all legal and
other costs associated with acquisition of the parcels.
