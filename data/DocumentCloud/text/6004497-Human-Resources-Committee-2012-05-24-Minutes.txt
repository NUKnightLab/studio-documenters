**Report from System Human Resources Department
A. Report from Interim Director of Human Resources (Attachment #1)
Gladys Lopez, System Interim Director of Human Resources, provided an update on the following subjects:
Recruiting – Vacancies filled through May 7, 2012; Training and Development; and Multicultural Affairs. The
Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
With regard to the information presented on the vacancies filled – breakdown by position (page 3 of the
presentation), Board Chairman Batts inquired regarding some of the positions classified as “Other,” such as the
positions of EKG Technician and Respiratory Therapist. He asked whether these types of positions would fall
under a category closer to “Clinical Support,” as they are positions providing direct patient care. Ms. Lopez
responded in the affirmative; she will regroup those positions that provide direct patient care (the revised
document reflecting the regrouping is included in the minutes).
