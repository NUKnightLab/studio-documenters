EXPLANATION
Prior to 2003, the City of Chicago’s Mayor’s Office of Workforce Development administered a
summer pre-apprenticeship employment program for youth ages 14 and 15 throughout the City
of Chicago (“City”). Since 2003, the City has utilized ASM to administer the pre-apprenticeship
program city-wide. ASM’s key partners are the Chicago Public Schools, Chicago Park District,
the Chicago Department of Family and Support Services, Chicago Public Library and the
Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs. In addition to these partners, ASM coordinates

 programming in approximately 100 community based organizations (CBOs) located in
neighborhoods throughout the City where there are high concentration of underserved teens.
Since 2003, CHA has contracted directly with ASM to ensure slots for CHA youth in the preapprenticeship, and apprenticeship summer employment programs. In the summer of 2010,
ASM will ensure a minimum of 325 slots for CHA youth ages 14 and 15 in the preapprenticeship and apprenticeship summer youth employment programs. An additional 30 slots
will be available for CHA youth to participate in a mural project that will be housed in CHA’s
Executive Offices.
The six-week pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship programs are held five (5) days per week,
four (4) hours per day. The programs focus on the development of workplace skills including,
but not limited to, communication, teamwork, analytical thinking and work readiness. Youth
will participate in career exploration activities, including lectures and demonstrations from
professionals and local industry leaders. Youth will receive a $500 stipend upon completion of
the program.
In 2008, 962 CHA youth participated in ASM programs, while CHA funded only 330 slots.
CHA youth participation in ASM programs decreased slightly in 2009 due to the number of slots
available to CHA youth through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act slots (Youth
Reach Chicago.) In 2009, 704 youth participated in ASM summer programs, including the 330
pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship slots funded through CHA.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of CHA enter into a contract with After School
Matters to provide summer pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship youth employment programs
for 355 CHA youth for the period of June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2011 for a total amount notto-exceed $310,000.
