Transmitting a Communication, dated February 28, 2006 from
ROBERTO MALDONADO, County Commissioner
I am submitting this Resolution as a New Item at the March 1, 2006 Board meeting to be referred to the
Committee on Health and Hospitals.
The Resolution requires the Bureau of Health Services to prepare a report assessing the potential fiscal
and health impact of absorbing many former patients from Bethany Hospital into our public health system
as well as the fiscal impact of operating the Bethany clinic on a rental basis. Furthermore, it requires the
Committee on Health and Hospitals to a hold public hearing to detennine the overall health and
community impact of converting Bethany Hospital to a long-term care facility.
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
ROBERTO MALDONADO, County Commissioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, Bethany Hospital has been serving Chicago's West Side for over 85 years as a full service
community hospital; and
WHEREAS, the West Side has Chicago' s largest proportion of medically needy residents as well as the
highest concentration of '·working poor," people earning between 100% and 200% of the federal poverty
level, who are least likely to have either public or private health insurance; and
WHEREAS, according to the Sinai Urban Health Institute, neighborhoods in the Bethany service area
face a host of serious health challenges, including rates of asthma, diabetes, depression, and obesity
dramatically higher than the national and Chicago averages; and
WHEREAS, despite the growing need for general acute care services in Chicago's West Side, Advocate
Health Care Network, Chicago' s largest private nonprofit hospital system and Bethany's corporate owner,
recently announced plans to convert Bethany Hospital from a general acute care faci lity to a long-tenn
care faci lity; and
WHEREAS, Advocate's conversion plan would eliminate a wide range of health care services including
emergency, obstetrics/gynecology, intensive care, mental health, and other crucia l services for the poor
and underserved West Side residents; and
WHEREAS, since the majority of Bethany 's 67,000 patients lack private health insurance, these patients
will likely seek care at Cook County ' s Stroger Hospital, and other area hospitals already struggling to
deal with the area' s large uninsured and Medicaid populations; and
WHEREAS, prior to the conversion plan, Advocate allowed the Cook County Bureau of Health Services
to use space in Bethany Hospital free of charge to operate a walk-in clinic that served 15,000 patients
each year, and it now intends to charge Cook County between $200,000 and $300,000 annually to use the
same space; and

9

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 1, 2006

WHEREAS, as a religiously-sponsored, nonprofit health care provider that has long enjoyed substantial
public subsidies in the form of generous tax breaks and other benefits, Advocate has a responsibility, both
legal and moral, to continue to help meet the West Side's health needs.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the President and the Members of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners encourage Advocate Health Care Network to fo llow applicable laws and
regulations with regard to converting Bethany Hospital to a long-term care facility, including obtaining all
necessary pennits and holding all necessary public hearings before it discontinues any services at Bethany
Hospital; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Bureau of Health Services prepare a report
assessing the potential fi scal and health impact of absorbing many of the fonner patients from Bethany
Hospital into our public health system as well as the fi scal impact of operating the Bethany clinic on a
rental basis, present those findings to the Cook County Board, and make the report available to the public;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Health and Hospitals Committee hold public hearings to
determine the overall health and community impact of converting Bethany Hospital to a long-tenn care
facility.

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved that the Proposed Resolution be

Section 6: Effective date.

Chainnan Collins asked Commissioner Maldonado to explain the changes that were made on the
amendments to the Proposed Substitute Ordinance.
Commissioner Maldonado explained that the amendments to the Proposed Substitute Ordinance are either
underlined or typed in bold for the benefit of the members of the Committee.
Commissioner Maldonado stated the following: The Proposed Substitute Ordinance protects 28,000
employees in Cook County. Most of the building owners provide the type of protection that is contained
in the Proposed Substitute Ordinance. However, there are a few buildings owners and contractors who
have failed to provide basic protection. Thus it is important for the Committee to adopt this Proposed
Substitute Ordinance so that Cook County can protect all of the workers who potentially could be
covered. The Proposed Substitute Ordinance provides, in the event that a new contractor assesses that he
needs fewer employees than the previous contractor, that he has the right to reduce the work force. Under
the Proposed Substitute Ordinance he also has the right to tenninate employees who were employed by
the previous contractor. However, if, within the first twenty-five days the new contractor realizes that he
needs new employees, he must give the first right of refusal to the employees that were tenninated. These
are very simple protective measures that this Proposed Substitute Ordinance provides.
Commissioner Maldonado asked that the correspondence from New York City Council Member Erik
Martin Dilan be made part of the record. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County
Clerk.)

107

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH I, 2006

Chairman Collins stated that she is disappointed that the State's Attorney's Office did not have the
opportunity to review the amendments. She will support moving the amendments to the Proposed
Substitute Ordinance onto the floor. However, this is contingent upon inserting an amendment to the
previous motion, that the Committee obtains a legal opinion of the amended version of the Proposed
Substitute Ordinance from the State' s Attorney's Office, and that the Committee seeks to amend Section
3 Subsection I regarding background checks on employees.
Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, moved to approve the
amendments to the Proposed Substitute Ordinance (Comm. No. 271732), contingent upon the
State's Attorney's Office incorporating the language of the amendment in Section 3 Subsection I.
The motion carried.
Vice Chairman Goslin voted no on the above item.
