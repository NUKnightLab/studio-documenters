Report of the Executive Director:
Executive Director Feldman mentioned why the resolution to approve Public Library Fund Allocation
2018-2021 was on the agenda. The nine library systems came to an agreement in 2018 to have an
agreement about the Public Library Fund (PLF). CCPL Board did not vote on this agreement and it
should be retroactively voted on. Since we do not have a quorum of five people this evening to vote on
the agreement, we will have to present it in April.
Executive Director Feldman congratulated Kimberly Dressel, Administrative Manager, who received
another letter of recognition as part of the annual certification for passports. She does an amazing job
and we are glad the US Department of State National Passport Center continually recognizes that.
Executive Director Feldman congratulated Julie Liedtke. She was the Orange, Branch Manager, and has
just moved to the Solon Branch as Manager. Ms. Liedtke was recognized by the Ohio School Public
Relations Association and is receiving the Friend of Education Award for her work at the Orange Branch.
We are very happy for Ms. Liedtke to receive that recognition.
Executive Director Feldman recognized Megan Barrett, Information & Technology Literacy Specialist, and
Rebecca Ranallo, Information & Technology Literacy Manager. They had a book published titled
Cultivating Connected Learning: Library Programs for Youth. We are happy for them and congratulations
on their publication.
Executive Director Feldman introduced Jeffery Mori, Facilities Director to present on how we collect data
from our facilities division and how we use that data.
Director Mori stated the facilities data from our computerized maintenance management system, Dude
Solutions, shows our facilities are properly and the CCPL Facilities team is performing at a very high
level. The current facilities condition index (FCI) shows our facilities overall are in good condition and well
maintained. We are working with Dude Solutions to create a more specific peer group for “apples to
apples” comparisons and better networking. Our focus for the future: increasing planned maintenance
activities and increasing connectivity/integration among building systems. This will help ensure our
facilities are sustainable and flexible for whatever the future needs of CCPL may be.

Director Mori thanked the Board, Executive Director Feldman, Deputy Strobel and Director Morgan for

Acres farm and the sponsorship for Nourish compete and conflict with the sponsorship management of

advance we received in February brought us close to 50% of what we anticipate for the year.
Director Morgan stated in the Public Library Fund (PLF) distribution for this month was again smaller than
anticipated. Last year we started the year with smaller distributions than expected and as the year
progressed, we received what we had budgeted. He stated we will monitor this account closely.
Director Morgan stated patron fines and fees are currently exceeding our estimates. He stated the
largest increase continues to be in the area of passports due to the $10.00 increase in passport
processing fees. He stated we are processing more passports than in the years past.
Director Morgan stated in general expenditures, there are no negative indicators. Salaries and benefits
we are well within budget and where we should be for the year.
(See under FINANCE)

Securities, and Mufg Bank Ltd. The rates on those are from 2.68% to 2.73%, we are seeing decent

Purchase Approval List
Director Morgan stated that the Purchase Approval List (PAL) was reviewed in depth at the Finance
Committee Meeting. He highlighted Item #2 is the expenditure for the Executive Director search services
and search expenses. Item #5 is to install new security offices at the Warrensville Heights Branch. Item
#7 he mentioned the public survey of registered voters and that we plan to conduct 400 telephone
interviews from within our service area.
Director Mori mentioned on the November 2018 PAL was a blanket purchase order for 2019 Lawn and
Grounds for $125,000 at that time we did not have a contractor name associated with it due to the fact
that we had just ended the relationship with Royal Landscape, because of performance and reliability
issues. We did finish up the competitive bidding process for the contract and accepted a five-year bid
from the Davey Tree Expert Co. He stated we just wanted to close the loop on that because we were able
to negotiate with Davey Tree to the budgeted number of $125,000.00 annually.
Director Morgan thanked Director Mori and those that worked closely with him on the search process for a
new vendor. They did an excellent job and we will see a lot of landscaping improvements at our
buildings.
07-03/2019
Trustee Varley moved approval of Purchase Approval List, seconded by Trustee Leonard. Seeing no
additional discussion, the Purchase Approval List dated March 26, 2019, was approved as presented by
unanimous vote of the Board members present. (See pages 100-101)

two larger gifts one from the Brown and Kunze Foundation and the other from CCPL Foundation. We
received a memorial gift and one gift as a thank you and appreciation for services received at the Berea
Branch.

unanimous vote of the Board members present. (See page 102)


Resolution Authorizing the Library to Enter into an Easement Agreement with the
Village of Mayfield

Village of Mayfield for construction of a path that would connect through the library property and this
would benefit both the village and the library, and we thought it valuable to bring it to the Board for
approval.
09-03/2019
Trustee Leonard moved approval, seconded by Trustee Varley. Seeing no additional discussion, the
Resolution Authorizing the Library to Enter into an Easement Agreement with the Village of Mayfield was
approved by unanimous vote of the Board members present. (See pages 103-108)

 Resolution To Amend the Cuyahoga County Public Library Borrowing Policy
Executive Director Feldman spoke to this resolution to amend the CCPL borrowing policy. This is for a
change in the circulation policy for lending digital content for Hoopla which offers access to streaming
music, comic books, movies and television shows. These are pay per use circulations making it difficult to
budget. Director Barden was able to negotiate a cap on the Hoopla expenditure for 2019 and 2020 with
the caveat from Hoopla that we adjust the borrowing limit from 50 per month per customer to 30 per
month per customer as a way of controlling cost. This resolution was brought to the Board at the March
12, 2019 Policy, Planning & External Relations Committee meeting.
10-03/2019
Trustee Leonard moved approval, seconded by Trustee Spangler. Seeing no additional discussion, the
Resolution to amend the Cuyahoga County Public Library Borrowing Policy was approved by unanimous
vote of the Board members present. (See pages 109-113)
Motion to Adjourn
Seeing no other business under consideration for vote, President Shlonsky asked for a motion to adjourn
the meeting.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE
Why Doctors and Librarians Make Great Partners
This year marks the 30th anniversary of Reach Out and Read, an organization
that helps transform doctors and health care professionals into partners
in literacy. Since its launch at Boston Medical Center in 1989, under the
leadership of Robert Needlman and Barry Zuckerman, Reach Out and Read
has been giving young children a foundation for success by donating books to
pediatric care providers, reading aloud to kids in waiting rooms and teaching
families about the beneﬁts of reading together at home.
When my ﬁrst daughter was born, I was told by well-meaning librarians to
read to her. At the time, there was still little information out there about the
beneﬁts of early reading, and most libraries had yet to offer programs for
babies and new mothers. So, in my own intentional, somewhat selﬁsh way, I
held my daughter, Meg, and read Ann Tyler’s The Accidental Tourist aloud to
us both. Why not? I wanted to hold my baby. And I wanted to read the Ann
Tyler book. This scene made perfect sense to me!
I don’t think Meg has any residual memories from the experience, but I am
still sentimental about that quirky novel. There was plenty more to come, of
course; I recited beloved Mother Goose nursery rhymes, and my husband
consistently sang to our new baby. By the time we welcomed our second
daughter, Bridget, there was growing evidence suggesting a relationship
between reading to kids and early language development. And we were
fortunate to raise two great readers.
It’s now well documented that talking, singing and reading to your baby
encourages brain development and lays the foundation for language skills.
And with some 90% of young children seeing their pediatricians regularly,
Reach Out and Read offers a tremendous opportunity to reinforce early
literacy in a safe, nonthreatening way. Gifting books to children and families
over a series of wellness visits gives physicians the opportunity to talk to new
parents about this crucial part of their children’s development. Meanwhile,
volunteers in the waiting room read to families, modeling the dialogic reading
methods most recommended to reinforce language development and school
readiness.
Obviously, there’s an important role for libraries in the Reach Out and Read
program, too. “When Reach Out and Read doctors prescribe a visit to the
local library for their young patients, a lifetime of family reading and learning
begins,” says Susan Hildreth, interim director at California’s Sonoma County
Library and current American Library Association treasurer, adding that
libraries are especially effective partners, whether providing books, storytimes
or reading activities in waiting rooms.
As Reach Out and Read celebrates its 30th anniversary this year, why not take
this opportunity to reach out and see how you might help better support early
childhood literacy efforts in your community?

In conjunction with the Brecksville-Broadview Heights School District’s “Take Back Togetherness Night,” Brecksville
Branch and Information & Technology Literacy Department staff members presented a fun-ﬁlled K – 12 “Family Night.”
More than 100 visitors made paper craft outlines of the state of Ohio with a Cricut machine, put their wits together
to solve an escape room riddle, created pictures with the paint feature on the TruTouch interactive multitouch display,
played regular and jumbo-size games from the CCPL toy collection, experimented with circuits using a Makey Makey
and used Makedo tools to build cardboard houses, swimming pools and school buildings.
The Bay Village Branch hosted a “One School, One Book Family Night” March 5th. The 160 attendees enjoyed drop-in
activities related to The Sasquatch Escape by Suzanne Selfors, which was read by all Normandy Elementary School
students in kindergarten through second grade. Students were excited to see their principal, Mr. Sebring, at the event.
Olmsted Falls Branch Teen Librarian Lee Ikimis hosted the ﬁrst three weeks of an eight-week “Design a Game Controller
With Arduino” program. In the ﬁrst three sessions of this series – which is meant to be a deep dive into Arduino
and 3-D design – the students were given an overview of the Arduino microcontroller, participated in several circuit
building activities and began to breadboard and code their game controllers.
A mother came to the North Olmsted Branch looking for materials to help her sixth grade sons improve their reading
skills. Both of her boys have IEPs for reading. Staff member Liza Kahoe Arthur mentioned various items and resources,
and the mother was thrilled to learn that the branch offered a selection of ﬁrst readers in Arabic. She checked out 10
of those books on the spot.
On March 27th, Tim Protiva from the Strongsville Branch presented a storytime in SouthPark Mall’s Live 360 space.
About 40 participants enjoyed giveaways and prizes donated by SouthPark Mall merchants. This ongoing partnership
will provide good community visibility for CCPL.
Dennis, an employee at Metro Hospital, related this message to the MetroHealth Service Point staff: “This place is a
lifesaver. I canceled my internet at home because I don’t use it that often and I can rely on the library at Metro. I’m
adding the money I spent on internet to my deferred comp.”
Parma City School District held its “March Into Kindergarten” registration event for 221 families March 6th and 7th
at the Parma Branch. Future kindergartners received their choice of one of three books about starting kindergarten –

Financial Statement Analysis
March 2019

Revenues
For General Property Taxes we received another distribution in March as part of the
advance in taxes. The next couple of months should be smaller amounts that may be
distributed until we receive our next large advance for the second half of the year in
June or July. In the Intergovernmental account we also received our first half of the
reimbursement from the State of Ohio for Homestead Exemptions and Rollbacks. With
these distributions we are on budget for property taxes.
Our March distribution for the PLF was slightly smaller than what we received last year.
We believe the distribution in April will bring us back to budget but, as we do every
month, we will monitor this account closely. Last year we started out the year with
smaller distributions than expected and then as the year progressed, our distributions
were larger and made up for some of the smaller distributions to keep us within budget.
Patron Fines and Fees are currently exceeding our estimates. Once again it is passport
fees and photos which are the reason for the increase. Sale of Resale Supplies is also
slightly exceeding our estimates.
All other revenue accounts are where we would expect them to be for the month and
the year.

Expenses
Expenses for Salaries and Benefits are all within budget, with the exception of the
Insurance Benefits and as was mentioned last month all of the HSA accounts were
funded for the year and it will take a couple of months for the budget not to exceed
expenses.
Many of the other expense accounts have higher than expected percentages for
expenses and encumbrances because many of these accounts have standing orders
encumbered against them to pay monthly and recurring expenses.
All other General Fund expense accounts are where we would expect them to be for the
month and the year.
In the Capital Fund projects there are still some funds encumbered for Maple Heights
Branch. This is for some AV work that has been completed, but we are still waiting for
the invoice. After the invoice is paid, we will be closing that project.

 28

Investments
We purchased 4 Certificates of Deposit for the month. Those CD’s purchased were:
Fifth Third Bank

$245,000

Mutual Savings Bank

$245,000

State Bank of India

$245,000

Those CD’s were purchased at $250,000 or less to keep us within the insurance
coverage offered through FDIC and offered a good rate for a one-year investment.

We have changed our investment strategy within our Money Market funds by keeping a
larger balance in Star Ohio, which is offering a higher rate than what we are receiving at
Key Bank. We just transfer operating funds back from Star Ohio as needed.

Transfers
There were no transfers for the month.

formerly known as the county Library and Local Government Support Fund (hereinafter referred to as

WHEREAS, the libraries have in the past found that the statutory framework for allocating that

the libraries; and  
WHEREAS, trustee and directors of the various libraries have met together in good faith to agree

litigation with regard to such allocations; and  
WHEREAS, the libraries have agreed that for the four‐year period commencing January 1, 2018 
through December 31, 2021, the libraries will retain the current percentage allocations with regard to 
distributions from the Fund that are equal to or less than the amount distributed to all the libraries from 
the Fund in the year 2007 (“2007 Base Year”); and  
WHEREAS, the libraries have further agreed that should the Fund receipts exceed the amount 
distributed to the libraries in the 2007 Base Year during the four‐year period from 2018‐2021, any 
excess shall be subject to a new agreed‐upon percentage allocations, which new percentage allocations

NOW, THEREFORE, subject to the approval of the Cuyahoga County Budget Commission, the 
libraries hereby agree that the Budget Commission shall order an allocation of the Fund for the years

refrain from challenging and/or appealing the distribution of the fund to the Board of Tax appeals, or to 
any other agency or court of competent jurisdiction.   The only basis upon which any library may 
challenge any such distribution shall be on the basis that the Budget Commission failed to follow the 
provisions of this Agreement and any agreement of the libraries provided for herein for any of the 
subject years. 
In the event that during the term of this agreement one library should cease to operate or be 
included with another, the libraries and the Cuyahoga County Budget Commission agree to meet to 
discuss any revision to the allocation set forth above and amend the agreement accordingly.   
In addition to the foregoing, the libraries agree that they will do the following: 
(a) The directors of each library will attend a meeting to be held at least twice a year during years
2018 through 2021 in order to discuss the percentage share of the Fund to be allocated amongst
the libraries after 2021, which discussions shall consider a new percentage allocation formula

taking into consideration the 2020 U.S. Census population figures, and in order to foster 
continued good faith and cooperation between the libraries.  The directors will also explore 
ways and opportunities to utilize more effectively their resources to better serve their patrons 
and to achieve the goals of this agreement; 
(b) The libraries will work together through available political, civic and media channels to maintain
and  increase the level of financial support Ohio law provides for public libraries in Ohio; and
(c) The libraries will work jointly to meet the needs of users in the present and in the future, with
careful attention to population growth, circulation and particular requirements of different
communities and neighborhoods.
This Agreement is executed by each of the libraries and the Budget Commission by their
appropriately designated representatives for the purpose of effecting an agreed allocation and 
distribution of the Fund of the years 2018 through 2021.  This Agreement shall be introduced into 
evidence at the Board of Tax Appeals without objection by any library or the Budget Commission when it 
is claimed that any library has attempted an appeal pursuant to Ohio Revised code 5705.37 or when it is 
claimed that the Budget Commission has failed to make an allocation and distribution of the Fund in 
accordance with the terms of this agreement.  Any amendment to this Agreement must be made in 
writing and be signed by the libraries and the Cuyahoga County Budget Commission.

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be 
deemed an original, but such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
