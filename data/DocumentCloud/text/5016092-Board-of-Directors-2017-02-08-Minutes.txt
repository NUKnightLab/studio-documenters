PROJECTS
Packard Administration Building Brownfield Redevelopment Plan
Mr. Vosburg presented the history of the project and the assignment agreement before
the board. Mr. Vosburg noted the new memorandum handed out to the board which
explains that Arte Express Detroit, LLC, the original named development entity, has
transferred all of its interest in the eligible property and project to Arte Express Detroit 1,
LLC and the resolution and assignment agreement names this new entity.
On December 14, 2016, the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (the “DBRA”)
Board of Directors recommended approval to City Council of the Brownfield Plan for the
Packard Administration Building Redevelopment Project (the “Plan”) which was
subsequently approved by Detroit City Council on January 31, 2017. A requirement for
Tax Increment Financing reimbursement pursuant to the Plan is that a Reimbursement
Agreement (the “Agreement”) be entered into between the DBRA and Arte Express
Detroit 1, LLC (the “Developer”). The Agreement has been prepared between the DBRA
and the Developer and is presented to the DBRA for review and approval.
Ms. DeSantis called for a motion approving the Reimbursement Agreement for the

Mr. Vosburg presented the background of the Gardenview Estates Sector II Brownfield

The termination resolution before the board due to the fact that the development failed to

Section 16(8)(b) of Act 381 of 1996. Terminating the Plans would relieve staff and the

accounting. Termination would also allow a future development to apply for a new
Brownfield Plan for the parcel(s).

 Mr. Vosburg stated that he previously worked on the Gardenview Estates project while
an employee of the Detroit Housing Commission (DHC), however this work does not
present a conflict of interest because he worked on a different sector, Sector I (rental
housing) of the project, the DHC is in agreement with the termination of the Brownfield
Plan, and his work at the DHC ended over 2 years ago.
Mr. Vosburg explained that the resolution before the board is asking the board to approve
publication of intent to terminate the Plans by City Council in a newspapers of general
circulation, recommend termination of the Plans to City Council, and authorizes the DBRA
to terminate the Reimbursement Agreement as well as any other agreements or contracts
between the DBRA and the developer upon termination of the Plan by City Council.
Board members presented various questions and comments regarding the proposed
termination.
Ms. DeSantis called for a motion approving the publication of the recommendation to
terminate in a newspaper of general circulation, recommend termination of the Plans to
City Council, and approve the termination of the Reimbursement Agreement as well as
any other contracts or agreements for the Plan upon approval of the termination by the
City of Detroit.
