the protection of the public health, safety, morals and welfare; to license; to tax; and to incur debt; and
WHEREAS, Illinois law (55 ILCS 5/5-1009) permits home rule units to impose "taxes not based on the
selling or purchase price or gross receipts from the use, sale or purchase of tangible personal property"; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and
the World Health Organization, based on a summary of the available evidence linking intake of added sugar
and sugar sweetened beverages to adverse health outcomes including obesity and diabetes, have
recommended that Americans consume no more than 10% of their daily calories in the form of added sugar;
and
WHEREAS, numerous organizations and agencies, including the American Heart Association, American
Diabetes Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, Institute of Medicine of the National Academies,
American Medical Association, and the Centers for Disease Control, recommend limiting intake of added
sugar and sugar sweetened beverages to improve health; and
WHEREAS, studies show that sugary beverages flood the liver with high amounts of sugar in a short
amount of time and that this “sugar rush” over time leads to fat deposits and metabolic disturbances that
cause diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other serious health problems; and
WHEREAS, diseases connected to sugary beverages disproportionately impact minorities and low-income
communities; and
WHEREAS, two (2) out of three (3) adults and one (1) out of three (3) children in the United States are
overweight or obese and on any given day, half the people in the U.S. consume sugary drinks, with one (1)
in four (4) consuming at least 200 calories from such drinks and 5% drinking at least 567 calories
[equivalent to four (4) cans of soda]; and
WHEREAS, the University of Connecticut RUDD Center for Food Policy & Obesity found that residents
of the City of Chicago consume approximately 140 million gallons of sweetened beverages per year;
applying such analysis to the County, Cook County residents are estimated to consume approximately 269
million gallons of sweetened beverages per year; and
WHEREAS, sodas, sports drinks, coffees and other sugar sweetened beverages packed with calories
constitute the largest source of added sugars in the diets of American children and consuming only one (1)
sugar sweetened beverage per day correlates positively with weight gain for children and adolescents; and
WHEREAS, a 2008 study found drinking more than two (2) servings of diet soda (a beverage containing
non-caloric sweeteners) a day doubled the risk for kidney decline in women; and
WHEREAS, the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis found that daily consumption of beverages
containing non-caloric sweeteners was associated with 36% greater risk for metabolic syndrome and 67%
increased risk for type 2 diabetes; and

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

November 10, 2016

WHEREAS, a 2012 study found that consumption of diet soft drinks was associated with increased risk
for vascular events, including stroke;
WHEREAS, in the San Antonio Heart Study, participants who drank more than 21 beverages containing
non-caloric sweetener per week were twice as likely to become overweight or obese as people who did not
drink such beverages; and
WHEREAS, the World Health Organization recently stated that implementing taxes on sugar sweetened
beverages can lower consumption and reduce obesity, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay; and
WHEREAS, in an effort to promote public health, including lowered obesity rates, the Board of
Commissioners has determined that a County tax not based upon the selling or purchase price or gross
receipts from the use, sale or purchase thereof should be imposed on the sale of sweetened beverages in
Cook County, as provided herein.

FISCAL YEAR 2017 REVENUE INITIATIVE AND MODIFICATION OF FUTURE
COOK COUNTY HOME RULE AND PROPERTY TAXES
WHEREAS, since FY 2011, the overall full time employee positions (“FTE”) have decreased by over
2,000 FTE’s, with the General, Health and Grant Funds realizing a 10% reduction since FY 2011; and
WHEREAS, through the passage of the FY 2016 Annual Appropriation Bill, Cook County Board
President, Toni Preckwinkle ("President") and the Cook County Board of Commissioners took significant
steps to promote the long-term sustainability of County government; and
WHEREAS, given the fiscal challenges facing the County in FY 2016, additional expenditure reductions
and new sources of revenue were implemented in order to begin to address the County’s long-term needs
in a responsible manner so as not to unduly burden the children and grandchildren of current taxpayers with
extensive debt and unfunded pension liabilities at the County Employees’ and Officers’ Annuity and
Benefit Fund of Cook County; and
Page 13 of 20

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

November 10, 2016

WHEREAS, despite efforts to continue to stream line services and hold the line on revenue increases in
FY 2017, the County’s Preliminary Budget forecast released in June projected a budget shortfall of $174.3
million for FY 2017; and
WHEREAS, the fact remains that 87% of the County’s operating budget goes to Public Health and
Public Safety; revenues fail to keep pace with the rate of inflation; and technology, pharmaceutical and
other costs have historically exceeded the rate of inflation; and
WHEREAS, in order to continue to build a fiscally sound foundation with long term financial
sustainability, efforts have been undertaken in the proposed FY 2017 budget recommendation to further
streamline County services; reduce vacant and filled positions; prioritize the delivery of critical public
safety and health services; and address the County’s revenue needs; and
WHEREAS, the FY 2017 budget recommendation includes an additional one percent reduction in
positions; includes the layoff of 300 employees; implements non-personnel reductions and proposes various
management initiatives as cost saving measures; and
WHEREAS, the FY 2017 budget recommendation includes over $78 million in expenditure reductions;
however, to seek additional expenditure reductions would result in a significant impairment of our public
health and public safety operations; and
WHEREAS, in order to prevent devastating cuts to the County’s public safety and public health operations,
a one cent per ounce sweetened beverage tax is being sought to generate the funds needed to cover the
remaining $74.6 million deficit for FY 2017; and
WHEREAS, implementing a sweetened beverage tax on both sugar sweetened and artificially sweetened
beverages will not only allow the County to address various public safety and health funding needs but it
is an important public health initiative to discourage sweetened beverage consumption among youth and
adults which over time should assist in lowering obesity rates, prevent type 2 diabetes, reduce
cardiovascular disease, reduce kidney decline in women and reduce other serious health problems; and
WHEREAS, implementing a sweetened beverage tax on largely consumed sweetened beverages could
result in healthier beverage and food choices by both youth and adults and a healthier Cook County
community long term; and
WHEREAS, proposing a new revenue initiative, streamlining services, reducing vacant positions and
implementing layoffs are not easy choices; however, Cook County and its leadership must continue to act
responsibly to address the long-term needs of the County's residents and taxpayers and balance the proposed
sweetened beverage tax with cuts.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners do hereby support passing a one cent per ounce sweetened beverage tax in an effort to
improve public health as well as cover the remaining $74 million deficit for the FY 2017 budget and avoid
devastating cuts to the County’s public health and public safety budgets; and

Page 14 of 20

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

November 10, 2016

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that following a three year fiscal forecast and planning exercise
undertaken by the Bureau of Finance, the sweetened beverage tax revenue estimates for FY 2018 and FY
2019 would allow the County to maintain the proposed streamlined services levels recommended in the FY
2017 budget in FY 2018 and 2019; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners do
hereby resolve upon passage, implementation and enforcement of the proposed sweetened beverage tax,
that the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners will not further increase any of the tax
rates provided in the County’s home rule tax ordinances in FY 2017, FY 2018 or FY 2019 or deviate from
the property tax restrictions provided in the County’s Cook County Property Tax Relief Ordinance as
