NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING
A public hearing will be held by the Detroit City Planning Commission in the Committee of the
Whole Room, 13th Floor, Coleman A. Young Municipal Center, 2 Woodward Avenue, Detroit,
Michigan 48226, on

THURSDAY, MARCH 21, 2019 AT 6:15 PM

to consider the request of the Detroit Planning & Development Department to amend Article
XVII, District Maps 28 & 30 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, Chapter 61, Zoning, by showing M2
(Restricted Industrial) zoning classification where R2 (Two-Family Residential), R4
(Thoroughfare Residential) and B4 (General Business) zoning classifications currently exist on
approximately two hundred sixty-six (266) parcels generally bounded by East Warren Avenue to
the north, St. Jean Street to the east, Kercheval Street to the south and Lillibridge and Beniteau
Streets to the west. The location of the proposed rezoning is specifically indicated as the shaded
area on the accompanying map. The specific addresses of the parcels are available upon request.
The proposed map amendment is being requested to allow for the expansion of the Fiat Chrysler
Mack Engine Plant. The proposed uses for the parcels to be rezoned are employee parking,
assembled vehicle storage and semi-trailer parking. The proposed uses are permitted by-right in
the M2 zoning classification, but are not permitted in the R2, R4 and B4 zoning districts.
The pertinent zoning district classifications are described as follows:
R2 – Two-Family Residential District
The district is designed to protect and enhance those areas developed or likely to develop
with single- or two-family dwellings. The district regulations are designed to promote a
suitable environment for homes and for activities connected with family life. The only
principal uses permitted by right are single- and two-family dwellings. Additional uses are
conditional.
R4 – Thoroughfare Residential District
This district is designed to be used primarily on major or secondary thoroughfares where
the major use of the property is for low-medium density residential dwellings

 characterized, primarily, by rental apartment dwellings. Among others, uses permitted by
right include multiple-family dwellings, single- and two-family dwellings, and certain
other residentially related uses which can function most advantageously where located on
these thoroughfares. Medical and dental clinics, motels or hotels, and certain types of nonprofit uses may be permitted on a conditional basis subject to appropriate findings and
compliance with required standards.
B4 – General Business District
The B4 General Business District provides for business and commercial uses of a
thoroughfare-oriented nature. In addition to these uses, other businesses, which may benefit
by drawing part of their clientele from passing traffic are permitted. Additional uses, which
may be successfully blended with permitted by-right uses, are conditional.
M2 – Restricted Industrial District
This district is designed for a wide range of industrial and related uses which can function
with a minimum of undesirable effects. Industrial establishments of this type provide a
buffer between residential districts and intensive industrial districts. New residential
construction is excluded from this district with the exception of loft conversions of existing
buildings and of residential uses combined in structures with permitted commercial uses.
These requirements are both to protect residences from an undesirable environment and to
ensure reservation of adequate areas for industrial development.
A Zoning Ordinance map amendment requires approval of the City Council after a public hearing
and after receipt of a report and recommendation by the City Planning Commission. This Zoning
Ordinance map amendment request is being considered consistent with the provisions of Article
III, Division 3 of Chapter 61 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, the Detroit Zoning Ordinance.
You may present your views on this proposal by attending this hearing, by authorizing others to
represent you, or by writing to this office prior to the hearing; 2 Woodward Avenue, Room 208,
Detroit, Michigan 48226 (Fax: 313-224-4336). Because it is possible that some who are affected
by this proposal may not have been notified, it is suggested that you kindly inform your neighbors
so that they too may express their positions if they so desire.
With advance notice of seven calendar days, the City of Detroit will provide interpreter services
at public meetings, including language translation and reasonable ADA accommodations. Please
contact the Civil Rights, Inclusion and Opportunity Department at 313-224-4950, through the TTY
number 711, or email crio@detroitmi.gov to schedule these services.
For further information on this proposal or the public hearing, please call (313) 224-6225.
