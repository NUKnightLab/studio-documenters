FISCAL YEAR 2019 FORECAST
The FY2019 outlook includes a $52.3 million
shortfall projected in the General Fund and a
$29.5 million shortfall in the Health Fund, creating
a total operating funds projected deficit of $81.8
million. This projection assumes a flat operating
tax allocation for the Health System of $102 million.
This projected operating deficit also reflects an
increased appropriation of $360 million from
$353.4 million in FY2018 for supplemental pension
contributions that will put the County on a path
to address the outstanding unfunded pension
liability at the County Employee’s and Officer’s
Annuity and Benefit Fund of Cook County (the
“Retirement Fund”), consistent with the intention
of the majority of the Board of Commissioners
when they raised the Home Rule Sales Tax in 2015.
In the General Fund, projected expenditures of
$1,863 million will exceed projected revenues of
$1,810 million. The projected shortfall is driven
by an increase in estimated expenditures of $63
million that outpaced an increase in expected
revenues of roughly $10.5 million over the FY2018
adopted budget. In the Health Fund, revenues are

2018 YEAR-END REVENUE PROJECTION

The total budgeted revenue for FY2018 is $1,800
million for the General Fund. The projected
year-end revenues of $1,809 million are higher
than budgeted revenues by $9 million, or less than
half a percent. This projected increase in revenues
is attributed to higher than anticipated revenues
in the County Sales Tax due to a non-recurring
accelerated payment from the State of Illinois to
compensate for increased receipts in comparison

 to the prior year. Also, effective with the State’s
FY2019 budget, the 2 percent service fee imposed
by the State on municipalities for the collection
and remittance of sales tax revenue has been
reduced to 1.5 percent, further attributing to the
favorable revenue projection.

HEALTH ENTERPRISE FUND
The total budgeted revenue for FY2018 is $2,043
million for the Health Enterprise Fund. The
projected year-end revenues of $2,551 million are
higher than budgeted revenues by $508 million,
or 25 percent. The projected increase in revenue
is attributed to the increase in enrollment in the
Managed Care Medicaid expansion program,
commonly referred to as CountyCare, which is
allocated and collects reimbursements on a per
member per month basis.
The County’s General Fund revenue is comprised
of Property Tax, Non-Property Taxes, Fees,
Intergovernmental Revenues, Investment Income,
Indirect Costs and Miscellaneous Revenues. The

2 0 1 9

Health Enterprise Fund revenue is comprised of
Patient Fees, Managed Care and Other revenue.

PROPERTY TAX
The projected year-end Property Tax Levy and Tax
Increment Financing Surplus collections to the
General and Health Enterprise Funds for FY2018
remains estimated at the budgeted amount of
$274.8 million.

NON-PROPERTY TAXES
Several of the Non-Property Taxes are on track to
meet or exceed the FY2018 budgeted amounts.
The projected year-end revenues of $1,324 million
in the General Fund are higher than budgeted
revenues by $36.2 million, or 3 percent. The
aforementioned projected year-end revenue in the
County Sales Tax for FY2018 is $38.9 million higher
than budget, representing a 5 percent favorable
variance. Due to the robust economy, the State
Income Tax which is collected by the State and
remitted to the County is projecting year-end
revenues of $12.3 million, that is $1.8 million higher
than budget, or 17 percent.

GENERAL FUND FEES
The County imposes various General Fund fees
for certain services it performs. The fees charged
by various County departments include fees for
vital records, real estate transactions, court case
filings, and delinquent taxes. General Fund fees
are anticipated to be $197.6 million for year-end
FY2018, which is a negative variance of $21.9
million, or 10 percent. The primary driver of the
negative variance relates to fees generated by
the County Treasurer’s office. The fees consist of
penalties on delinquent taxes. Due to the positive
state of the economy and enhanced communications to inform impacted residents, there are fewer
delinquent taxes.

INTERGOVERNMENTAL REVENUES
The projected year-end Intergovernmental
Revenues for FY2018 is $46.3 million, this
represents a $3 million, or 7 percent increase
from the budgeted amount. Intergovernmental
Revenues include reimbursements from the State
of Illinois and Forest Preserve District for select

•

 services under the administration of Cook County.
The favorable year-end revenue projection is
attributable to higher than anticipated subsidies
from the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts
(AOIC).

INVESTMENT INCOME, INDIRECT COSTS, AND
MISCELLANEOUS REVENUES
The County is projecting to receive Investment
Income of $1.8 million, at the budgeted amount.
Investment Income is the interest garnered on
County fund cash balances.
Indirect Costs are charged to Grants and Special
Purpose Funds to reimburse the General Fund

2 0 1 9

for pension and administrative resources. The
projected year-end Indirect Costs revenues for
FY2018 are $11.6 million, on par with budget.
Miscellaneous Revenues are projected to
generate $25.8 million in FY2018; this is below
budgeted expectations by $8.3 million due to
delays in anticipated one-time legal settlements.

COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS
SYSTEM FEES
The Health Enterprise Fund receives revenue
from patient fees and supplemental payments for
care provided at County Hospitals. In addition,
the Cook County Health and Hospitals System

(CCHHS) operates a Managed Care Community
Network (MCCN) known as CountyCare.
CountyCare receives a fixed per member per
month reimbursement for each of its roughly
332,000 members. CCHHS projects that it will
end FY2018 with fees totaling $2,479 million, a 26
percent, or $508 million increase to the FY2018
budget. The increased FY2018 revenues projected
by CCHHS are attributed to increased enrollment
in the Managed Care Community Network. CCHHS
experienced CountyCare membership growth
from 140,000 members per month to an estimated 332,000; outpacing the projected 225,000
members per month budgeted in the FY2018
budget.

 PROJECTED FY2018 YEAR-END EXPENDITURES
2018 YEAR-END EXPENDITURE ESTIMATE
Year-end expenditures in the General Fund are
projected to have a $6.0 million negative variance.
The overage is primarily attributable to higher
than anticipated salary and wages ($5.8M) and
reserve for claims ($4.5M). These increases are
partially offset by lower than anticipated overtime
spending ($8.4M).

The Health Fund year-end expenditures are
projected to be above the FY2018 appropriation by
about $510 million due to higher than budgeted
member enrollment in CountyCare, causing a
large increase in managed care claims. Projected
overtime costs are expected to exceed the
budgeted amount by $4.4 million while regular
employee salaries will be under budget due to

 2019 PRELIMINARY FORECAST
The outlook for FY2019 includes a $81.8 million shortfall across the General and Health Enterprise Funds. The General Fund’s deficit is
projected at $52.3 million and an additional $29.5 million deficit is estimated in the Health Enterprise Fund for a total projected deficit
of $81.8 million. The FY2019 forecast reflects a decrease in legacy debt service payments of $19.5 million increasing the amount of
property tax levy available to the General Fund. It includes a $36.9 million increase in County Sales Tax due to a growing economy.
The FY2019 revenue collections are projecting to decline in County Treasurer revenue as experienced in the FY2018 budget. Also
included is an increase in the supplemental pension appropriation of $7.1 million over the FY2018 budget to $360.5 million, consistent
with the alternative payment schedule adopted by the County Board of Commissioners to address the unfunded liability in the Pension
Fund.

 2019 REVENUE OVERVIEW
The preliminary revenue estimate for FY2019
is $4,443 million for the General and Health
Enterprise Funds. This represents a 16 percent, or
$600.1 million increase over the FY2018 budget,
which is overwhelmingly dedicated to Managed
Care Community Network revenue in the Health
Enterprise Fund.
The County’s General Fund revenue is comprised
of Property Tax, Non-Property Taxes, Fees,
Intergovernmental Revenues, Investment Income,

GENERAL FUND

The preliminary estimate for Health Enterprise
Fund revenues in FY2019 is $2,633 million, an
increase of $589.5 million, or 29 percent compared
to FY2018 budgeted revenues. This figure does
account for the operating tax allocation from the
General Fund to the Health Enterprise Fund of $102
million, consistent with FY2018.

The preliminary estimate for General Fund
revenues in FY2019 is $1,810 million, an increase
of $10.5 million, or 1 percent compared to FY2018
budgeted revenues. This figure assumes an
operating tax allocation to the Health Enterprise
Fund consistent with the FY2018 figure of $102
million which essentially covers expenses related

 PROPERTY TAX
The preliminary estimate for the Property Tax Levy
in FY2019 is $281.8 million, an increase from the
prior fiscal year budget by $19.5 million primarily
due to the decline in debt service payments for
General Obligation Bonds that are supported by
Property Taxes. The Tax Increment Financing
Surplus to the General Fund is projected at $6
million.

NON-PROPERTY TAXES
The preliminary estimate for revenues for
Non-Property Taxes for FY2019 is $1,323 million,
which is $35.8 million more than prior year
budgeted revenues. This increase is driven solely
by the increase in County Sales Tax revenue due
to a robust economy and the reduction of the
2 percent service fee imposed by the State on
municipalities for the collection and remittance
of sales tax revenue to 1.5 percent. Absent the
growth in County Sales Tax revenue, Non-Property
Taxes would be decreasing compared to prior year
budgeted revenues by $1.1 million.

GENERAL FUND FEES
The County imposes various General Fund fees for
certain services that it performs. The fees charged
by various County departments include: fees for
vital records, real estate transactions, court case
filings, and delinquent taxes. The preliminary
2 0 1 9

estimate for General Fund Fees in FY2019 is $187.2
million, a $32.3 million, or 15 percent decrease in
comparison to FY2018 budgeted revenues. This
is primarily the result of a decline in fees generated by the County Treasurer’s office. The fees
consist of penalties on delinquent taxes. Due to
the positive state of the economy and enhanced
communications to inform impacted residents,
there are fewer delinquent taxes. The County
Treasurer is projecting FY2019 revenues of $30
million, that is $31 million, or 51 percent less than
the FY2018 budget.

INTERGOVERNMENTAL REVENUES
The preliminary estimate for Intergovernmental
Revenues for FY2019 is $46.1 million, $2.8 million
higher than FY2018 budgeted revenues. This
projection reflects a slight increase in subsidies
from the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts
(AOIC).

INVESTMENT INCOME, INDIRECT COSTS, AND
MISCELLANEOUS REVENUES
The County is projecting to receive Investment
Income of $1.8 million in FY2019, the same as
FY2018 budgeted revenues. Investment Income
is the interest garnered on County fund cash
balances.
Indirect Costs are charged to Grants and Special
Purpose Funds to reimburse the General Fund

for pension and administrative resources. The
projected FY2019 Indirect Costs revenues are
projected to remain steady at $11.6 million in
comparison to FY2018.
The preliminary estimate for Miscellaneous
Revenues for FY2019 is $25.3 million, which is
a decrease of $8.7 million compared to FY2018
budgeted revenues due to one-time legal settlements anticipated in FY2018 but not in FY2019.

COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS
SYSTEM FEES
The Health Enterprise Fund receives patient fees
and supplemental payments for care provided at
County Hospitals. In addition, the Cook County
Health and Hospitals System (CCHHS) operates
a Managed Care Community Network (MCCN)
referred to as CountyCare. CountyCare receives
a fixed per member per month reimbursement for
each of its roughly 332,000 members. CountyCare
membership realized a substantial increase
above the 140,000 members in FY2017 and the
estimated 225,000 members in FY2018 as a
result of two successful strategic acquisitions.
CCHHS’ preliminary estimate for fees in FY2019
increases 30 percent, or $589.5 million to $2,560
million compared to Fiscal Year 2018 budget. The
projected rise is due to increased enrollment into
the Managed Care Community Network.

 PROJECTED 2019 EXPENDITURES

GENERAL FUND
The FY2019 General Fund expenditures are
projected to increase by $62.8 million over the
FY2018 appropriation. This increase is driven
by rising personnel costs ($29.5M) as a result of
projected wage increases. Further increases are
driven by scheduled step increases. Another key
driver of increasing expenses are rising employee
health benefit costs ($10.1M) which are expected to
rise at the rate of medical inflation.

budgeted expenses for FY2019 totaling $2.662
billion. The primary drivers of the cost increases
are due to larger than anticipated CountyCare
enrollment and personnel costs, increasing
by $519 million and $33 million, respectively.

 Additionally, CCHHS anticipates increases in
the operating budget to continue upgrades and
advancements of medical and technology equipment to provide better and more efficient care
for patients. Historically, CCHHS relied on debt
proceeds from the County to purchase capital
equipment, now capital expenditures are funded
through its operating budget. Additional expenditures include a $27.6 million increase for the
maintenance and procurement of software and
hardware to continue efficiency upgrades to the
Cerner system and other software, and increases
in surgical, medical and dental supply budgets
by $16.5 million, to support increased patient
volumes.

2 0 1 9

DEBT SERVICE FUND
The County has undertaken a long-term plan to
manage its debt service in a manner which will
target the rate at which debt service will grow
in future years at no more than 2 percentoff the
2018 figure, when including all projected new
money borrowing. Even with this long-term
plan, achieved through strategic refinancing,
limited principal re-amortization as necessary,
and continuing to limit the issuance debt as the
County has done in recent years, debt service will
continue to rise through 2026 before leveling off at
approximately $335 million based on a significant
legacy debt service burden and the need to invest
in County facilities and technology infrastructure.

C O O K

C O U N T Y

P R E L I M I N A R Y

F O R E C A S T

During 2009 and 2010 the County sold a significant amount of new money debt, approximately
$686 million, which was structured for a roughly
$100 million increase in debt service in the 2011
fiscal year. Subsequent refinancing of this legacy
debt service has allowed the County to create this
multi-year ramp, and even though the County has
limited the issuance of new money borrowing
in recent years and has $358 million less debt
outstanding at the end of FY 2017 than in FY2011,
the County’s debt levels remain very elevated
versus peer Counties across the nation.

 CONCLUSION
The County continues to emphasize long-term
fiscal sustainability. Although the County has
a diverse revenue base, inflationary factors put
pressure on expenditures, causing them to rise,
in many cases faster than the rate of inflation.
In FY2019, the County expects to benefit from a
robust economy with the anticipated growth in
the Home Rule Sales Tax. However, due to uncer-

2 0 1 9

tainty of activities at both the state and federal
levels as well as economic volatility, out year
budget gaps are still of great concern and reinforce the need for judicious fiscal management.
In FY2019 the County will continue to target both
expenditure and revenue solutions that support
long-term fiscal sustainability. The County’s longterm outlook addresses challenges associated
with the solvency of the Retirement Fund, stability

of debt service and growing expenditures. The
administration looks forward to working with
the Board of Commissioners, elected offices,
taxpayers, employees and other stakeholders
to address challenges. The tables that follow
provide further analysis as described in this
summary overview.

 2019 SPECIAL PURPOSE FUNDS OUTLOOK
The County’s Annual Appropriation Bill contains Special Purpose Funds in addition to the General Fund, Health Fund and the Debt
Service Fund. Special Purpose Funds are established for a specific and dedicated purpose, and are considered to be self-balancing.
Self-balancing means that the appropriated revenues for each of the special purpose funds supports the required expenditures for the
budgeted fiscal year.

 MFT ILLINOIS FIRST (1ST)
Used to plan, design, construct, maintain and
operate transportation facilities in Cook County
and is funded by proceeds from the State distribution of Motor Fuel Tax (MFT). The FY2019 Motor
Fuel Tax revenue estimate is $46.94 million, with a
projected $47.17 million in expenditures, resulting
in an FY2019 projected ending surplus balance of
$23.64 million.

ANIMAL CONTROL DEPARTMENT
Responsible for the prevention of the transmission of rabies and other diseases from animals
to humans. The department forecasts revenue
in 2019 to be $3.65 million, with $5.34 million in
expenditures resulting in $7.56 million positive
fund balance by the end of FY2019.

COUNTY CLERK – ELECTION DIVISION FUND;
BOARD OF ELECTION COMMISSIONERSELECTION FUND
Funds the cost of elections using property
tax revenue. In 2019, the funds’ expenses are
projected to decrease by $16.74 million to $24.88
million due to FY2019 being a non-election year.

2 0 1 9

This increases the amount of property tax revenue
available for other obligations, such as the cost
of debt service or capital project pay-as-you-go
financing. The FY2019 projected ending surplus
balance is $17.28 million.

2019 revenues are estimated to be $10.5 million,
with expenditures of $11.25 million, resulting in
a 2019 fund balance deficit of $5.96 million. This
will require expenditure reductions to reduce the
negative fund balance.

COUNTY RECORDER DOCUMENT STORAGE
SYSTEM FUND

CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT DOCUMENT
STORAGE FUND

Funds the equipment, materials and necessary
expenses to implement and maintain the Recorder
of Deeds’ document storage system. Fees are
charged for record retrieval and other items. The
2019 revenue estimates are $2.5 million, with
$3.15 million in expenditures, resulting in a 2019
year-end fund balance deficit of $1.69 million. This
fund is one of a number of Special Purpose Funds
that required a corrective action plan to restore
solvency.

Manages Circuit Court records. Projected revenues
for 2019 are $9.50 million and expenditures of $7.97
million. The 2019 ending fund balance is estimated
to be a negative $220,441 compared to an ending
FY2018 estimated negative $1.74 million. Continued
expenditure reductions are necessary to fully
restore solvency to this fund.

CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT AUTOMATION
FUND
Maintains the automated systems which support
the activities of the Circuit Court, meets the needs
of Court constituents, and provides constant
access to both internal and external users. The
