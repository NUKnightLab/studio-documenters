(Item 3)
The resolution for Item 3 approves execution of an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with City
Colleges of Chicago (CCC) to provide education and training programs for CHA residents. The
requested not-to-exceed amount is $1,200,000.00 for a one-year base term and $1,200,000.00 per year
for four one-year option terms, for an aggregate not-to-exceed amount of $6,000,000.00. Each option

 term shall only be exercised at the time of the expiration of the prior IGA term, and may only be
exercised individually. CHA has partnered with CCC since 2005 to provide the Partners in Education
program, which provides education and training programs for CHA residents. The goal of this IGA is to
continue supporting CHA residents by creating a continuum of education and training opportunities that
allow residents to advance progressively to higher levels of education over time. This collaboration with
CCC will ultimately result in better paying careers in areas of industry growth and stability for CHA
residents. Due to significant program utilization, the budget for the current IGA is projected to be
exhausted prior to December 31, 2017; the current termination date. The future terms of the IGA with
CCC will continue to provide tuition and student supports (e.g. books, uniforms, exam fees) for CHA
residents to attend CCC programs, after financial aid is exhausted. Residents can participate in
certificate programs and earn their associates degree at City College locations throughout Chicago, in
most cases at no cost. The IGA allows for the delivery of educational services for CHA residents at
various educational levels and provides support while residents are engaged in CCC programs. CHA
and CCC will continue to collaborate on initiatives and launch targeted campaigns during peak
enrollment periods and promote the educational opportunities and services available through the
Partners in Education program.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2017-CHA-77
the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated July 18, 2017 entitled “Authorization to enter into an
Intergovernmental Agreement with City Colleges of Chicago”.

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee
to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement with City Colleges of Chicago in an
amount not-to-exceed $1,200,000.00 for a one-year base term and $1,200,000.00 per
year for four (4) one-year option terms, for an aggregate not-to-exceed amount of
$6,000,000.00. Each option term shall only be exercised individually.

(Item 4)
In April 2017, a Request for Proposal was issued requesting qualified firms to provide training and job
placement services for Summer Food and Golden Diners participants. A total of three proposals were
received by the proposal deadline. Of the proposals received and evaluated, two Respondents were
determined to be within the competitive range and were invited for oral presentations. Following
negotiations, Best and Final Offers were received and Employment & Employer Services was the
recommended awardee, with the highest overall score. Accordingly, the resolution for Item 4 approves
the award of a contract to Employment & Employer Services in an aggregate amount of $11,151,530.00
which includes a contract value of $4,400,751.00 for a two (2) year base term plus three one-year option
terms in an aggregate amount of $6,750,779.00 to provide training and job placement services for
Summer Food and Golden Diners participants. The Board delegates authority to the Chief Executive
Officer to use his discretion to exercise the option year terms. Each option term shall only be exercised
at the time of the expiration of the prior contract term, and may only be exercised individually. The
Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) provides nutritious breakfast and lunch to children between the
ages of three and eighteen. Since 2008, CHA has used Summer Food sites located near CHA
developments as a subsidized employment opportunity for CHA adult residents to work as Nutritional
Aides, and incorporated both training and certification components. In Summer 2016, nearly 90,000
meals were served by more than 90 CHA residents working as Nutritional Aides at SFSP sites. The
Golden Diners Program (GDP) provides nutritious meals for seniors age 60 and older who may have
limited mobility and lack the incentive to prepare meals. Golden Diners sites are located at 19 CHA

 senior buildings, and CHA adults are trained to deliver food services for program patrons. In 2016, more
than 226,000 meals were served by CHA residents working as Nutritional Aides at Golden Diners sites
located at CHA Senior properties. Of the contract value, approximately 50% of the budget is allocated
for wages and other client support to directly benefit CHA residents.
RESOLUTION NO. 2017-CHA-78
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board

and perform such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the foregoing.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE

(Item 6)
The resolution for Item 6 approves contract modifications to C-11436 with Old Veteran Construction for
the Modernization and Life Safety Upgrades at Minnie Riperton Apartments in an amount not-to-exceed
$1,900,000.00 and to C-11438 with Old Veteran Construction for the Modernization and Life Safety
Upgrades at Major Robert Lawrence Apartments in an amount not-to-exceed $1,900,000.00. totaling
$3,800,000.00. The original scope of work at Minnie Riperton and Major Robert Lawrence Apartments
was to bring the buildings into compliance with the City of Chicago’s High Rise Sprinkler and Life
Safety ordinances and to modernize the buildings. The original scope of work included various
improvements to the sprinkler and fire alarm systems and targeted minor renovation scopes. These code
compliance and modernization projects were designed in late 2012 prior to the implementation of the
revised CHA design standards. However, after construction began at both Minnie Riperton and Major
Robert Lawrence Apartments, the scope of work increased significantly due to the widespread
discovered conditions such as deteriorated plumbing risers and asbestos encountered. Due to the
overwhelming number of discovered conditions, the scope of work for both projects grew substantially
resulting in significant impacts to both construction schedules. The construction project at Minnie
Riperton is expected to be completed in March 2018, while the construction project at Major Robert
Lawrence is expected to be completed in August 2017. These change orders will address the remaining
outstanding issues before construction is complete. On October 31, 2016, Minnie Riperton Apartments
was converted from a public housing development to a RAD (Rental Assistance Demonstration) PBV
development. At conversion, CHA transferred ownership of Minnie Riperton Apartments to Chicago
Housing Administration LLC, a limited liability company of which CHA is the sole member. In
addition, the funding to complete the construction project, along with contingency funds were
transferred from the CHA’s account to an account held by Chicago Housing Administration LLC.
Further, at the time of conversion, the CHA was designated by HUD as the Rehab Administrator,
granting CHA control and management of construction until completion.

Mark Cozzi
Dr. Mildred Harris
Meghan Harte
John Hooker
Cristina Matos
Nays:

None

There being no questions or discussion, Chairman Hooker thereupon declared said Motion carried and
said resolutions adopted.
Vice-Chairman Chico then addressed the Chairman. Per Vice-Chair Chico at the June 20th committee
meeting, the Real Estate Operations Development committee members entertained the Multi-Project
Labor Agreement item. The matter however, did not leave Committee. Exercising discretion as
Committee Chairman, Vice-Chair Chico referred the Multi-Project Labor Agreement item to the full
board for discussion and vote.
Chairman Hooker then announced that in order to give the public another opportunity to voice their
comments, the Board will vote on the Multi-Project Labor Agreement item at the conclusion of public
participation.
(Item 9)
CEO Jones and James Bebley, Chief Legal Officer then presented Commissioners and the public with an
overview of Item No. 9.
The resolution for Item 9 authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to negotiate and execute a MultiProject Labor Agreement with the Chicago and Cook County Building and Construction Trades Council

 for up to five years. Project Labor Agreements (PLA) have become common in both government and
private sector construction. PLAs are designed to ensure the availability of labor resources and
eliminate the potential for delay due to labor disruptions or disputes. The proposed CHA PLA is
designed to be one vehicle for implementation of the CHA’s Section 3 goals. In addition, it will provide
pipeline opportunities for CHA residents and Section 3 residents to have access to trades career
opportunities. The CHA PLA will also provide an exception which places CHA’s Job Order
Contracting and Task Order Competitive Contracting programs outside of the PLA. As part of
implementation of the PLA, the CHA will form a committee with representatives of the labor
organizations and contractors to create, review and assess pipeline opportunities for CHA residents and
Section 3 residents.
Representatives of the Chicago Carpenters Union (CCU) then addressed the Board and the general
public. Per a representative, the proposed PLA, for the first time in CHA’s history, will not only offer
CHA residents opportunities for employment but a pathway to a career. According to the CCU, the
employment opportunities would not be limited to CHA funded projects only but for employment with
other public and private partners
Frank and cordial exchange of views regarding the pros and cons of the CHA PLA then followed.
Several Commissioners lauded the hiring provisions of the PLA and the meaningful access to trade jobs
and positive impact the Agreement would have for CHA residents. Matters discussed included
requirements to join the union; scope of the PLA; advisory committee composition and mission; metrics
