Item No. 1

RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE AND SUBMIT TO HUD THE FY2018 MTW ANNUAL
REPORT
Presenter: Jennifer Hoyle, Director, Strategic Management and Partnerships
Recommendation
The Chief Executive Officer recommends that the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing
Authority approve the FY2018 Moving to Work (MTW) Annual Report and authorize CHA to submit the
FY2018 MTW Annual Report to HUD.
Background
Submission of the FY2018 Moving to Work (MTW) Annual Report fulfills CHA’s annual MTW reporting
requirements and supports CHA’s goal of successful continued compliance with the obligations of HUD’s
MTW Demonstration Program.
On February 6, 2000, CHA and HUD signed the original MTW Agreement, which allowed CHA to implement
the Plan for Transformation. On June 26, 2008, CHA’s Amended and Restated MTW Agreement with HUD
was fully executed, extending CHA’s participation in the MTW Demonstration Program through FY2018.
On April 14, 2016, HUD extended the MTW Agreement through 2028.
As part of the MTW Agreement, CHA is required to submit an Annual Report to HUD, due 90 days after
the end of CHA’s fiscal year. The MTW Annual Report provides information necessary for HUD to assess
CHA’s performance in FY2018 in its operations as well as activities authorized by the MTW Program. In
2018, HUD issued a revised Form 50900 (Attachment B to the MTW Agreement) which outlines
requirements for the content of MTW annual plans and reports and for tracking the impact of MTW
activities. CHA continues to work with HUD for technical guidance and feedback on MTW reporting
processes and requirements to ensure compliance.
CHA has complied with the requirements of the Amended and Restated MTW Agreement and HUD
regulations regarding the submission of annual reports. The Board action recommended in this item
complies in all material respects with applicable Chicago Housing Authority Board policies and federal
(HUD) regulations.
Respectfully Submitted:
