AWARENESS CAMPAIGN AND EXPANSION OF TRAINING ACCESS

CPR

&

AED

TRAINING

WHEREAS, in one year alone, 475,000 Americans die from cardiac arrest and globally, cardiac arrest
claims more lives than colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, influenza, pneumonia, auto
accidents, HIV, firearms, and house fires combined; and
WHEREAS, heart disease (including Coronary Heart Disease, Hypertension, and Stroke) remains the
No. 1 cause of death in the United States, while the estimated annual incidence of heart attack in the U.S.
is 720,000 new attacks and 335,000 recurrent attacks per year; and
WHEREAS, more than 350,000 cardiac arrests occur outside of the hospital each year and nearly 45
percent of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims survived when bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR) was administered, as immediate CPR can double or triple chances of survival after cardiac arrest;
and
WHEREAS, similarly to national statistics, heart disease is the leading cause of death in Cook County as
well, accounting for just under 10,000 deaths per year with more than half occurring in suburban Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Health and Hospitals System along with the Cook County Department of
Public Health can contribute to decreasing the incidents of fatal heart attacks in Cook County by creating
a robust awareness campaign to increase participation of Cook County employees in existing training
programs on how to properly administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation and how to use an automated
external defibrillator (AED) as well as expand access to such trainings countywide in all County
workplaces; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois beginning in 2014 has made such training a curricula requirement for all
secondary schools in the state; and
WHEREAS, the County awareness and training initiative should cover adult CPR & AED training and

Page 5 of 54

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

December 12, 2018

such training must include a hands-on practice component for beginners, as well as be in accordance with
the standards of the American Heart Association, or another nationally recognized certifying organization;
and
WHEREAS, any improvement in outcomes associated with heart attacks would have an immeasurable
impact on survivors both for County employees and their co-workers and families as well as the general
public;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners requests the development of a countywide CPR and AED training awareness campaign
for all Cook County employees as well as expanded access to training programs in all County workplaces
in order to assist in reducing incidents of death due to cardiac arrest both in the workplace and general
public; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners
requests that the Cook County Health and Hospitals System along with the Cook County Department of
Public Health and their partners develop such awareness campaign and that the expanded training
program shall be in accordance with the standards of the American Heart Association, or another
nationally recognized certifying organization; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Health and Hospitals System or one of its
partners such as the American Heart Association provide this Honorable Body with statistics on the
number of lives that could be saved in Cook County by knowing and using CPR and/or AED; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the awareness campaign and expanded training access should
begin in February 2019 to coincide with American Heart Month; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that data on said awareness campaign and expanded training including
the total number of employees newly trained or re-trained in CPR and AED as well as their employment
location by district be added to the monthly and annual Cook County Health and Hospitals System reports.
Effective Date: This resolution shall take effect immediately upon adoption.

FORCE

REPORT

WHEREAS, blockchains offer enormous potential for the storage and maintenance of data and records;
and

Page 6 of 54

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

December 12, 2018

WHEREAS, a blockchain is a database that is replicated over a peer-to-peer network that is designed to
achieve consistent and reliable agreement over a record of events between independent participants
through consensus about changes to the state of the shared database; and
WHEREAS, blockchains allow digital information to be distributed, but not copied, making it very difficult
to inappropriately modify the original data. Anything of value, money, titles, deeds, votes, and identity
attributes can be exchanged, stored, and managed securely and privately; and
WHEREAS, there are a variety of potential applications of blockchains to manage the voluminous data
that Cook County manages, including, but not limited to, applications in the Office of the Cook County
Clerk, Recorder of Deeds, Assessor, Clerk of the Circuit Court and much more; and
WHEREAS, on November 30, 2016, the State of Illinois formed the Illinois Blockchain Initiative to
explore how Blockchain could help spur economic development in the State; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Blockchain Task Force was charged by Illinois House Joint Resolution 25, which
was adopted by both houses on June 28, 2017, to study aspects of distributed ledger technology that
includes opportunities and risks associated with using blockchain, different types of blockchains (public and
private), as well as projects and use cases in other states and domains that Illinois could consider utilizing;
and
WHEREAS, on January 31, 2018, the Illinois Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Task Force issued a
report on:

1) opportunities and risks associated with using blockchain and
technologies,
2) the different types of blockchains, public and private,
3) projects and use cases in other states/nations that Illinois could consider,
4) how current state laws could be modified to support this technology,
5) encryption technology, including Illinois’ digital signature infrastructure, and
6) official reports and recommendations from the Illinois Blockchain Initiative.

other

distributed

ledger

WHEREAS, the Task Force found that that blockchain technology and its built-in encryption can
facilitate highly-secure methods for interacting with government and keeping paperless records, increasing
data accuracy and providing better cybersecurity protections for Illinois residents; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that a joint meeting of the Legislation and Intergovernmental
Relations and Technology Committees of the Cook County Board of Commissioners convene to review
the Illinois Blockchain Task Force Report and the possible applications of blockchain technology within
Cook County.
