delivery to be set at a date TBD in the spring. Discussion around ensuring we have a cohesive
look and the need for a unifying plan- the option of returning/ refunding the pots was
discussed as an option while we develop a master plan.

25% of the budget can carry over. The commission discussed the need for new ideas for new
projects. The main project that was discussed was the hiring of a firm to create a district
marketing plan. A plan that would create a cohesive ‘brand’ for the SSA and that would include

directed Paul to draft an RFP for a marketing plan.
