 AGENDA ITEM #6A

Date: June 15, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager
Re:

Proposed Underwriter Selections for the for the 2018 Financing Program

Background: At its meeting on June 27, 2016, as part of the underwriter selection process
related to its inaugural 2016 bond transaction, the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA)
Board of Directors (Board) approved the following list of ten (10) firms that were deemed
qualified to act as senior managing underwriters for subsequent GLWA bond issuances.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Barclays Capital, Inc.
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Goldman Sachs & Co.
JP Morgan Securities LLC
Morgan Stanley & Co.
Piper Jaffray & Co.
PNC Capital Markets
Ramirez & Co.
Siebert Brandford (Cisneros) Shank
Wells Fargo Securities

Furthermore, the GLWA Board directed that in the event of a subsequent bond issuance, the
Chief Procurement Officer shall:
1) Convene an evaluation panel to interview and review the qualifications of each of the
ten (10) firms listed below to serve as Bookrunning Senior Managing Underwriter or
Co-Senior Managing Underwriter for that issuance; or
2) Issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to select a Senior Managing Underwriter(s) for
that transaction.
Justification: To begin preparations for GLWA’s proposed transactions as outlined below,
GLWA is required to select the Senior (Book Running) Underwriter as directed by the GLWA
Board, for the proposed bond issues. The target date to complete the proposed transactions
is October 1, 2018. To meet this time schedule, the financing team needs to be finalized by
July 1, 2018 so that there is sufficient time to approve resolutions, draft and circulate
disclosure documents, meet with the rating agencies and investors as well as price and
deliver the bonds before the October deadline.

Page 6

 Proposed Transactions: The outstanding GLWA bonds for the water and sewer systems
that are the focus of the refunding plan total approximately $178 million for the water
system approximately and approximately $190 million for the sewer system. These
include the current refunding of Series 2001C second lien bonds of the Water System, the
current refunding of the senior lien 1998A, 1998B, and 2001 C2 Sewer System Bonds, as
well as the potential taxable advance refunding of the senior lien Series 2001 C1 Sewer
System Bonds. Additionally, GLWA has been notified by DWSD that it will need GLWA to
issue approximately $75 million of new money sewer bonds on its behalf.

Time Schedule: GLWA put together an aggressive time schedule of less than 30 days to
advertise and select the Senior Underwriter. This schedule and proposed selection
processes were reviewed and approved by the GLWA Audit Committee at its May 22, 2018
meeting and by the GLWA Board of Directors at its May 23, 2018 meeting. Below is the
time schedule for the underwriter solicitation process.

Selection Process: GLWA, through its Procurement Group, issued a Request for Updated
Proposals from the pre-approved list of the 10 underwriters above. An evaluation panel
was assembled to represent GLWA, DWSD and the member communities in the selection
process. The panel evaluated all 10 firms that responded to the request, based on their
written proposals and oral interviews.
Evaluation Panel: To accomplish the objective of selecting the Senior Underwriter, an
evaluation panel was selected in accordance with the Board’s direction of having 3 GLWA
representatives, 2 DWSD representatives and one member community representative.
The evaluation panel was comprised of the following members.
Nicolette Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer, GLWA
Thomas Naughton, Chief Financial Officer, DWSD
Jeff McKeen, General Manager, Southeast Oakland County Water Authority
Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager, GLWA
Robert Rice, Public Finance Manager, DWSD
Kim Garland, Public Finance Management Professional, GLWA

 Proposal Scoring: The scoring of the proposals was based on the written responses to the
proposals, which included recommended financing plan and structure, rating agency
strategy and investor marketing strategy. The scoring for the written responses was
completed prior to the oral interviews. The oral interviews with all 10 underwriting firms
were held on June 12, 2018. The oral interviews and team members were also scored as part
of the evaluations. After the written response and oral interview scoring, the fees were also
scored, based on the separate submissions by the firms, as summarized in Attachment B,
which was prepared by GLWA’s financial advisor, PFM. The total weighting of the evaluation
criteria is shown below.

Panel Recommendation: Based on the panel’s final scoring of the evaluation criteria
referenced above, it was the unanimous recommendation of the evaluation panel to select
Citigroup as the Bookrunning Senior Managing Underwriter and Wells Fargo Securities as
the Co-Senior Manager for the upcoming refunding and new money bond sales (see, “Roles
of the Underwriter” below). The summary of the evaluation panel’s final scoring is shown in
Attachment A.
In addition to the Bookrunning Senior Manager and Co-Senior Managers selected above, the
evaluation panel also recommends the following list of co-managers for the upcoming
transactions:
•
•
•
•
•

Goldman Sachs & Co.
JP Morgan Securities LLC
Morgan Stanley & Co.
Ramirez & Co.
Siebert Cisneros Shank & Co.

Proposed Action: Audit Committee recommends that the GLWA Board approve Citigroup
as Bookrunning Senior Managing Underwriter, Wells Fargo Securities as Co-Senior
Managing Underwriter at a Takedown fee of no more than $2.50 per bond (plus expenses)
which will be subject to negotiation prior to the final pricing of the bonds. The Audit
Committee further recommends the Co-Managers of Goldman Sachs & Co., JP Morgan
Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co., Ramirez & Co. and Siebert Cisneros Shank & Co.

RE:
Approval of FY2016 Shared Services and Transition Costs True-up
between the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and the Great Lakes Water
Authority

MOTION
Upon recommendation of Nicolette Bateson, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer (CFO) and
Randal M. Brown, General Counsel, the Board of Directors (Board) of the Great Lakes
Water Authority (GLWA):
1)
Authorizes GLWA’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), CFO and
General Counsel to finalize, and the CEO execute on behalf of the GLWA, the
FY2016 Shared Services and Transition Costs True-Up Agreement between
the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) and the GLWA;
2) GLWA and DWSD shall create at a minimum four (4) binders,
including the FY2016 Shared Services and Transition Costs True-Up
Agreement and supporting documentation. The binders shall be retained by
both parties’ CFOs and General Counsel and kept in their permanent

Page 13

 3)
Authorizes the CEO and CFO to take such other action as may
be necessary to accomplish the intent of this vote.
BACKGROUND
The concept of formation of a regional water authority arose as a part of the City of
Detroit’s Chapter 9 Bankruptcy. The formation of GLWA was discussed during mediation
proceedings held as a part of the bankruptcy case. On June,12, 2015, the City of Detroit
and GLWA entered into a Regional Water Supply Lease, a Regional Sewage Disposal
Lease (collectively the “Leases”) and a Water and Sewer Services Agreement (“WSSA”).
On January 1, 2016, the Leases and WSSA became effective and govern the relationship
between GLWA and DWSD. In the course of operations, GLWA and DWSD determined
that it would be in their mutual interest to provide certain services to each other these
services are provided pursuant to the Shared Services Agreement. Further, there were
transition costs associated with the bifurcation. Both, the shared services and transition
costs for FY 2015-2016 have been reviewed and agreed upon by the parties.
JUSTIFICATION
The GLWA and DWSD administrations wish to finalize the FY2016 shared service and
transition costs.
BUDGET IMPACT
The budget impact of the FY2016 Shared Services and Transition Costs True-Up
Agreement is outlined in the attached memorandum and supporting documentation. The
FY2016 Shared Services and Transition Costs True-Up Agreement does not adversely
impact GLWA’s ability to perform its current and proposed financial plan.
COMMITTEE REVIEW
This item is being presented directly to the full Board of Directors.
SHARED SERVICES IMPACT
This item brings closure to the shared services and transition costs for FY2016 between
GLWA and DWSD.

Shared Services and Transition Costs Fiscal Year 2016 True-up

The Fiscal Year 2016 (FY2016) Shared Services and Transition Costs have been
finalized. The Great Lakes Water Authority (“GLWA”) and Detroit Water and Sewerage
Department (“DWSD”) (collectively the “Parties”) have reviewed all costs for each Shared
Service and transition costs and have come to a proposed agreement for the six months of
provided Services. The final step for the settlement of FY2016 is to secure GLWA Board and
Board of Water Commissioners (BOWC) approval and for DWSD and GLWA to pay the
amounts due to each other by June 30, 2018.
Shared Services

Section 5.1 of the Shared Services Agreement (“SSA”) addresses invoices, in
pertinent part, it states (emphasis added in bold):
Article 5.1 Invoices. For Fiscal Year 2015-2016, the City shall
pay the Authority $4,707,608 for all Authority Services
(including “as-needed” Services) and the Authority shall pay the
City $2,179,506 for all City Services (including “as-needed”
Services), each in equal monthly installments. Such installments
received by the Authority shall be deposited into the Authority
Regional Operation and Maintenance Account of the Operation
and Maintenance Fund established in the master bond
ordinances for each of the Systems...

The Parties shall engage, and share the costs of, a third-party to
analyze the actual Service Costs (“Cost Analysis”) of providing
the City Services and the Authority Services for Fiscal Year
2015-2016 and each subsequent Fiscal Year. If, based on this

Page 18

 Cost Analysis: (a) the costs paid by a Subscribing Party 1
were greater than the costs of providing the Services, the
Providing Party shall pay an amount equal to such cost
variance to the Subscribing Party in the next Fiscal Year or
as otherwise agreed to by the Parties; and (b) the costs paid
by a Subscribing Party were less than the costs of providing
the Services, the Subscribing Party shall pay an amount
equal to such cost variance to the Providing Party in the
next Fiscal Year or as otherwise agreed to by the parties…
Each invoice, whether for Services provided regularly or “as
needed”, shall itemize the costs and charges by Services
provided under each Service Delivery Schedule, and shall
provide sufficient detail to the Subscribing Party to identify the
Services performed and the basis for the charges. A Performing
Party may only charge the Service Cost for Services provided.
Neither Party may set-off any amount it owes to the Party on
account of any amounts it may be owed by such party. Contract,
material and other applicable Service Costs shall be billed at the
contractual rates or third-party charges therefor.

The application of Section 5.1 has resulted in monthly estimated billings in
accordance with the calculations from the SSA. The actual calculated Service Costs based
upon a Cost Analysis have been agreed to by the Parties.

To date, payments have not yet been exchanged. It has been agreed to by both Parties
to expedite the processing of the settlement by having both parties pay the amounts due to
each other by June 30, 2018. The payments and acceptance of these payments will be
considered as satisfaction of payment by both Parties. This is not deemed a set-off of other
costs as noted in the SSA.

Per the SSA, the Parties, individually, prepared a true-up analysis to calculate the
Service Costs. For those Services where there were differences, an amount was negotiated
to settle on a Service Costs.
Transition Costs

In addition to the Shared Services outlined in the SSA, there have been transition costs
associated with the stand-up of the Regional and Local System. The Parties have reviewed
the transition costs for FY2016. Of the transition costs, the most significant are the Employee
Termination Payouts ($5,699,000) and the payment of Lakeshore Invoices ($1,291,699). The
Employee Payouts were contemplated in the Regional Water Supply and Sewerage Disposal
Leases between the City and GLWA (the “Leases”). See Sections 4.1 and 1.1(k)(i)—the
definition of City Residual Costs. Pursuant to the Leases, GLWA was obligated to reimburse
the City for these costs. As it relates to the Lakeshore invoices, the City assigned the
Lakeshore contracts to GLWA pursuant to Schedule E of Leases. However, Lakeshore had
work to complete on the Local System after the stand-up. As such, DWSD needs to reimburse

Subscribing Party means the Party that is receiving a Service from a Performing Party in supporting the
transition of a Subscribing Party to transition to a new Service provider.

The following is the “Schedule of True Up Billings” which provide the details of the

Since the proposed agreement deviates from the monthly process outlined in the SSA
and the Parties’ transition costs are also being resolved, it is recommended that GLWA’s
Board and DWSD’s BOWC approve the proposed agreement.

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Deirdre Henry, Treasury Manager
Re:

Proposed Contract Extension and Increase with PFM Asset Management LLC
GLWA Contract No. GLWA CS-022

Background: In November 2015, Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) engaged PFM Asset
Management LLC (PFM) as a registered investment advisor to assist with 1) identifying portfolio
and cash management optimization opportunities, 2) overcome personnel resource constraints
during the stand-up of both GLWA and DWSD-Retail, 3) expand the transparency and capacity of
investment portfolio reporting, and 4) provide an added level of controls.

PFM has worked with the treasury staff to 1) negotiate and increase bank earnings credit rates, 2)
invest debt service and debt reserve funds, 3) transition balances in bank deposit accounts to
higher yielding government money market and local government investment pools, 4) invest funds
in construction and trust accounts into longer term investment securities, and 5) develop quarterly
investment report package. With PFM’s assistance, GLWA earned $4.3 million in investment
income for fiscal year 2017. The projected investment earnings for fiscal year 2018 are $11.8
million.
The original PFM contract amount in 2015, which did not contemplate PFM actively managing the
portfolio, was $250,000 with an expiration date of December 2017. In November 2017, the PFM
contract was extended to July 2018 and was increased by $350,000 to bring the contract total to
$600,000. This contract increase was to accommodate PFM’s active management of the portfolio
and continued investment advisory services.

Analysis: The use of a registered investment advisor has proven to be a cost effective and efficient
approach to portfolio management. The use of an investment advisor allows GLWA to have direct
access to financial market expertise while allowing the treasury team to focus on the development
of cash flows, treasury internal controls, and process improvements.

We are requesting to extend the PFM contract period to December 2018 while we complete an RFP
to solicit competitive proposals for Investment Advisory Services. This contract extension would
require an increase to the contract of $100,000. The total life-to-date PFM contract amount after
this increase would be $700,000.

Page 22

 The total contract amount of $700,000 is 4.3% of the total portfolio income for FY 2017 and FY
2018. The estimated annual fee of $415,000 is .04% of the March 2018 investment portfolio
balance.

This contract extension and increase in fees does not require action by the GLWA Board. Staff did
want to report this update that achieves a desired outcome of increased investment earnings while
preserving compliance with GLWA’s investment policy and Michigan Public Act 20, Investments of
Surplus Funds of Political Subdivisions.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Deirdre Henry, Treasury Manager
Re:

Policy Resolution – Procurement Card Policy

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority Procurement Card Program has been established to
provide an efficient and cost-effective method of paying for business related goods and services. A
procurement card (PCard) may be used with any merchant that accepts credit cards. This program
is designed to serve as an alternative to the use of petty cash or instances where a purchase order,
just-in-time procedures, or other formal procurement methods cannot be used. It is not intended to
be a mechanism to avoid or by-pass the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) Procurement Policy.

Analysis: GLWA established its own PCard program with Comerica Bank at the time of the stand-up
of GLWA on January 1, 2016. The program that was established was carried forward from the
predecessor Detroit Water & Sewerage Department (DWSD) PCard program. The program and
policy have now been revised and updated to meet GLWA’s business requirements. The Chief
Financial Officer/Treasurer has delegated authority to the Treasury Manager to be the Program
Administrator and oversee compliance with this policy. The Program Administrator is responsible
for managing the program including PCard issuance, reporting, and monitoring usage. All PCards
issued to employees must be approved by an Area Chief. All transactions are reviewed for supporting
documentation and monthly/quarterly reporting is provided to the Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer
and Area Chiefs.
Local government units are required to adopt a credit card use policy in accordance with State of
Michigan Public Act 266 of 1995, Credit Card Transactions to authorize and regulate use of a company
sponsored credit card. The governing body of the local government unit must adopt by resolution
this written policy. The GLWA Board is being asked to accept this policy to close an open item from
the stand-up of the Authority.
The following documents are attached:

Purpose
The purpose of this Procurement Card (PCard) Policy for the Great Lakes Water Authority

Limited Travel PCard (LtdPC).
Introduction
The GLWA PCard Program has been established to provide an efficient and cost-effective
method of paying for business related goods and services. A PCard may be used with
any merchant that accepts credit cards. This program is designed to serve as an
alternative to the use of petty cash or instances where a purchase order, just-in-time
procedures, or other formal procurement methods cannot be used. The PCard should not
be used as a mechanism to avoid or bypass the GLWA Procurement Policy.
Definitions

Cardholder: The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) employee whose name appears
embossed on the PCard and is accountable for all charges made with that card.
Limited Travel Procurement Card (LtdPC): A PCard issued to any GLWA employee that
can only be used for business related travel expenses associated with training, seminars
and/or conference registration.
Procurement Card (PCard): A company sponsored credit card restricted for use to only
designated personnel for the purchase of goods and services when conducting official
GLWA business.
Procurement Card Program Administrator (Program Administrator): Employee
responsible for administering the PCard Program for GLWA and acting as the main
contact between the cardholders and the bank.
Supporting Documentation: A merchant produced or non-GLWA document that records
the relevant details for each item purchased including quantities, amounts, a description
of what was purchased, the total charge amount and the merchant’s name, and address
(e.g. sales receipt, original invoice, packing slip, credit receipt, etc.). GLWA purchases
are not subject to sales tax.

Re:

Background: As stated in section 14 of the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) Investment

Agencies, and commercial paper. Key indicators for the quarter are:
•

•

 Portfolio Holdings
Cash/Money Market vs. Investments
•

•

GLWA’s liquidity requirements fluctuate each month based on operational requirements such as accounts
payable and payroll, capital requirements, debt payments, legacy pension payments, and WRAP funding. We
have set an average target of 45% cash/money market accounts and 55% investments. We believe this
average allocation target will provide adequate liquidity to meet GLWA requirements.
The chart below compares the monthly allocation of the portfolio holdings to the 13 month average and the
target. As cash management strategies have improved, so has the alignment with the 45%/55% target.

As of March 31, 2018 

June 15th, 2018 
To Our Stakeholders: 
The contents of this report represent the financial presentation of construction work‐in‐progress activity for the Great Lakes Water Authority 
(GLWA) as of March 31, 2018.  The information in this report presents a snapshot to inform decision makers and stakeholders.  This is 
important as we manage the capital program for the remainder of FY 2018 and approach the implementation of the FY 2019–2023 Capital 
Improvement Plan (CIP). 
This report remains relatively new and will continue to improve each quarter to inform decision makers and stakeholders.   
Report Contents and Organization 
This report is divided into two sections:  one for the Water System and one for the Wastewater System as identified in the table of 
contents.  Each section includes analysis and reporting of the following: 
Percent of Spend Compared to Budget and Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) Requests:  Presentation of spend information is 
necessary to report our progress on CIP projects. 
Analysis of Projects with Largest Percent of Spend and Otherwise Noteworthy Projects:  A combination of commentary and 
analysis provides further insight into risk factors and project status.  An excerpt from the CIP for each of the selected projects 
follows the commentary as further background information. 
Construction Work‐in‐Progress Rollforward:  This table provides a list of all projects in the CIP along with status or financial 
activity.  This table may be used to revisit priorities, workload, and phasing. 
Budget Amendments / Allowance & Program Analysis:  This information identifies the specific usage and the reallocation of 
allowance and program budgets to CIP projects

 Construction Work‐in‐Progress Quarterly Report 
As of March 31, 2018 

Financial Information 
All project amounts are unaudited and are “pre‐close”.  This means that direct contractor costs are generally included in these totals with most 
pay estimates entered through March 31, 2018.  There may, however, be some pay estimates that lag.  The totals do not include indirect 
overhead or capitalized interest.   
Budget vs. Plan 
Generally, GLWA’s CIP projects span two or more fiscal years.  The GLWA Board of Directors adopts a biennial “budget” and a five‐year capital 
improvement “plan”.   
 The adopted budget relates to operations and maintenance expense, annual fixed commitments such as debt service, and incremental
adjustments to reserves. The budget provides authority to spend within defined amounts.  The budget is also referred to as the
“revenue requirement” for the utility.
 The CIP “budget” for the same biennial budget period above is based on the first two years of the CIP.  Funding for these projects are
established in the financial plan through a combination of bond proceeds and Improvement & Extension fund reserves
 The five‐year capital improvement plan is a rolling plan that is updated at an administrative tracking level as projects move from
estimated to actual bid numbers.  An updated mid‐cycle CIP would be presented to the Board for approval if the prioritization strategy
was revised and/or the plan was in need of material revisions.
Future Enhancements 
This report presents information that is readily available.  Currently under development are enhancements that will provide the opportunity for 
improved CWIP reporting. 
Monthly Capital Spend Projections –  Improvements are underway related to preliminary monthly spend information, projected out for 
the duration of the CIP, and communicated with Treasury to allow for investment optimization.  This reporting is being developed as a 
joint effort with our engineering partners.  This will also allow for improved accuracy of our Key Performance Indicator on rate of 
spending.

 Construction Work‐in‐Progress Quarterly Report 
As of March 31, 2018 

Future Enhancements Continued… 
Direct Labor Capitalization – Technology solutions have been procured to improve direct labor capture accuracy, timeliness and ease in 
which labor cost are captured with anticipated implantation date of July 1, 2018. 
Indirect Labor Capitalization –  An effort to identify and capture indirect labor related to the capital process remains underway. 
Alignment of Budget & CIP – During the development of the FY 2019–2023 CIP Plan, FY 2018 budgeted CIP was reforecast to align with 
anticipated spend.  The resulting budget amendments will be entered and reflected in future period CWIP reports.  This budget 
realignment will be reflected in the June 30, 2018 CWIP report. 
Key Performance Indicators – KPI’s under consideration include CIP spend vs book value assets, percentage growth of project in amount 
and duration, actual vs planned number of projects completed, and actual vs planned monthly capital spend.

WATER SYSTEM 
Percent of Spend Compared to Annual Budget and Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) Requests 
The rate of spend of is a key performance indicator.  The ratios for FY 2017 (twelve months) of 37.9% and for FY 2018 (nine months) of 23.9% 
are lower than simple benchmark of 80% and 75% respectively.  This is attributable to three reasons.  First is the competition for staff priorities 
during stand‐up of the GLWA (primarily during FY 2017).  Second, is the alignment of projects identified and staff or contractor resources to 
carry out the projects.  Several key hires occurred during the past year which will improve this performance.  Third, is the phasing of CIP activity 
which is being further refined throughout GLWA.

As of March 31, 2018 

Budget Amendment Reporting 
Scope:  Budget amendments are being utilized as an internal management tool to properly allocate funds from the allowance and programs 
within the Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) for the budgeted years by the reallocation of funds from the budgeted allowance or programs 
level to the actual project level. 
Process:  Steps are listed below. 
1) Properly identify projects that utilize funds from the allowance or programs
2) Reallocate the funds from the budgeted allowance or programs level through a journal entry
3) Attach documents that support the reallocation (CIP funding request, contract transmittal, or change orders)
4) Create, review, and approve budget amendment journal entry

 Wastewater System 
Construction Work‐in‐Progress Quarterly Report 
As of March 31, 2018 

WASTEWATER SYSTEM 
Percent of Spend Compared to Annual Budget and Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) Requests 
The rate of spend is a key performance indicator.  The ratios for FY 2017 (twelve months) of 55% and for FY 2018 (nine months) of 50.8% are 
lower than simple benchmark of 80% and 75% respectively. This is attributable to three reasons. First is the competition for staff priorities 
during stand‐up of the GLWA (primarily during FY 2017). Second, is the alignment of projects identified and staff or contractor resources to 
carry out the projects. Several key hires occurred primarily during fiscal FY 2017 will improve this performance. Third, is the phasing of CIP 
activity which is being further refined throughout GLWA.

As of March 31, 2018 

CIP Allowance and Program Summary 
Within the FY 2018 ‐ 2022 CIP, GLWA has developed budgets for allowances and programs that provide GLWA flexibility in capital development and 
improvements. 
 Allowances are established to provide funding related to unanticipated nature of pipeline and equipment failures that require immediate repair and 
rehabilitation to continuously meet level of service requirement. Allowances can also be allocated to projects with anticipated or actual spend in excess of 
the CIP budget. 
Programs are established to provide funding related to specific capital improvements that are systemic, reoccurring, and vary from year to year. 
Below are the allowances and programs within the Wastewater System.   
 
Allowance 
 
 
 
260100: WRRF, Lift Station and Wastewater System Structure Allowance 
 
Programs 
260200: Sewer and Interceptor Evaluation and Rehabilitation 
260300: Scheduled Replacement of Program of Critical Assets

As of March 31, 2018 

Budget Amendment Reporting 
Scope: Budget amendments are being used as an internal management tool to properly allocate funds from the allowance and programs 
within the Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) for the budgeted years by the reallocation of funds from the budgeted allowance or programs 
level to the actual project level. 
Process: Steps are listed below. 
1) Properly identify projects that utilize funds from the allowance or programs
2) Reallocate the funds from the budgeted allowance or programs level through a journal entry
3) Attach documents that support the reallocation (CIP funding request, contract transmittal, or change orders)
4) Create, review, and approve budget amendment journal entry

 DWSD Retail Billings: Table 1 shows the FY 2018 sewer usage and billed revenue which
are provided by DWSD staff. As of March 31, 2018, the DWSD usage was at 98.92% of the
budget and billed revenue was at 99.53% of budget. Due to DWSD’s reporting software
transition, the updated DWSD billed usage and billed revenue information for April 2018 were
not available. The April 2018 numbers will be included in next report provided at the July
2018 Audit Committee meeting.
GLWA Wholesale Customer Billings: Table 1 shows the FY 2018 sewer billed revenue.
As a result of the sewer rate simplification which provides a more stable revenue stream,
the wholesale sewer customers are billed a fixed monthly fee. The results of this effort can
be seen as the billed revenue is at 100.00% of budget through April 30 2018.

Total System Billings: Table 1 shows the FY 2018 combined DWSD and GLWA Wholesale
sewer billed usage and billed revenue. Based on the combined billings available at the time
of this report, the GLWA Sewer System had billed revenues of 100.0% of budget without
the April 2018 DWSD billings.

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager
Re:

Proposed Resolution Regarding Approval of Series Ordinance Authorizing Issuance
and Sale of Sewage Disposal System Revenue Bonds an Amount Not to Exceed
$45,000,000 (Ordinance 2018-01)

Background: On March 8, 2017, the Great Lakes Water Authority (“GLWA”) Board of
Directors approved Resolution 2017-185, “Resolution of the Great Lakes Water Authority
Authorizing Publication of Notice of Intent to Issue Sewage Disposal System Revenue Bonds in
a principal amount not to exceed $275,000,000” (the “Notice of Intent”). This is the second
series of sewer bonds from that Notice of Intent in the amount not to exceed $45,000,000.
The first series was issued on June 13, 2017 for the Rouge River Outfall disinfection project
in the amount of $38,450,000 through the State Revolving Fund (SRF).
The projects to be funded are two SRF Projects for the GLWA regional system, which will
close in September 2018. The projects are the Detroit River Interceptor (DRI) project
which is anticipated to be about $29 million and the Central Offload Facility project at the
WRRF which is anticipated to be about $16 million.

The Series Ordinance presented today is the next formal step required by the GLWA Board
of Directors in the bond issuance process which authorizes the issuance of the Bonds by
GLWA, sets forth the guidelines for the SRF Bonds, designates the Bonds as 2018 SRF Junior
Lien Bonds, and authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer to
execute the final terms of the Bonds, paying issuance costs and signing of the Purchase
Contract and Sale Order within the parameters set forth in the Series Ordinance. A copy of
the Series Ordinance and draft resolution are included with this memo.
Budget Impact: The debt service on the proposed projects is anticipated to commence in
FY 2019 and have been included in the FY 2019 financial plan.

Proposed Action: Audit Committee recommends that the Great Lakes Water Authority
Board approve the resolution for the Approval of Series Ordinance Authorizing Issuance
and Sale of Sewage Disposal System Revenue Bonds an Amount Not to Exceed $45,000,000
as presented, at its Regular Meeting on July 11, 2018.

INTEREST RATE:

____%

ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE:
The Great Lakes Water Authority, Counties of Macomb, Oakland and Wayne, State of
Michigan (the “Issuer”), upon authorization from the Board of Directors of the Issuer (the
“Board”), has issued this Bond. The Issuer, for value received, promises to pay, in lawful money
of the United States of America, but only from the Pledged Assets (as defined below), to the
Registered Owner named above, or registered assigns, the Principal Amount stated above, or so
much thereof as shall have been advanced to the Issuer and not prepaid or reduced pursuant to a
Purchase Contract between the Issuer and the Michigan Finance Authority (the “MFA”), a
Supplemental Agreement by and among the Issuer, the MFA and State of Michigan acting through
the Department of Environmental Quality and the Order of Approval issued by the Department of
Environmental Quality. The Principal Amount shall be payable on the dates and in the principal
installments set forth in Schedule A attached hereto.
In the event less than the Principal Amount of this Bond is disbursed by the MFA, any
portion of the Principal Amount is prepaid as provided herein, or any serial principal payment
becomes due before the Issuer has received proceeds from corresponding purchased principal
installments of at least a like amount, then the MFA may prepare a new serial principal installment
repayment schedule which shall be presented to the Issuer and be effective upon receipt as
provided in the Purchase Contract.
Interest on this Bond shall accrue from the Original Issue Date set forth above at the Interest
Rate set forth above, only on that portion of installments of the Principal Amount which have been
disbursed by the MFA, shall be payable on ________, 201_ and semiannually on each April 1 and
October 1 thereafter (each an “Interest Payment Date”).
If the MFA is not the registered owner of this Bond, principal of this Bond is payable upon
presentation and surrender at the designated office of U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee
under the Ordinance (as defined below) or such other trustee as the Issuer may hereafter designate
by notice mailed to the registered owner not less than 60 days prior to any Interest Payment Date
(the “Trustee”).

Page 8

 Interest on this Bond is payable to the registered owner of record as of the close of business
on the 15th day of the month immediately preceding any Interest Payment Date as shown on the
registration books kept by the Trustee by check or draft mailed by the Trustee to the registered
owner at the registered address. Interest on this Bond shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day
year comprised of twelve 30-day months. During the time funds are being drawn down by the
Issuer under this Bond, the MFA will periodically provide the Issuer with a statement showing the
amount of principal that has been advanced and the date of each advance, which statement shall
constitute prima facie evidence of the reported information; provided, that no failure on the part of
the MFA to provide such a statement or to reflect a disbursement or the correct amount of a
disbursement shall relieve the Issuer of its obligation to repay the outstanding principal amount
actually advanced [(subject to any principal forgiveness as provided for herein)], all accrued
interest thereon, and any other amount payable with respect thereto in accordance with the terms
of this Bond.
In the event of a default in the payment of principal or interest hereon when due, whether
at maturity, by redemption or otherwise, the amount of such default shall bear interest (the
"additional interest") at a rate equal to the rate of interest that is two percent above the MFA’s cost
of providing funds (as determined by the MFA) to make payment on the bonds of the MFA issued
to provide funds to purchase this Bond but in no event in excess of the maximum rate of interest
permitted by law. The additional interest shall continue to accrue until the MFA has been fully
reimbursed for all costs incurred by the MFA (as determined by the MFA) as a consequence of the
Issuer's default. Such additional interest shall be payable on the interest payment date following
demand of the MFA. In the event that (for reasons other than the default in the payment of any
municipal obligation purchased by the MFA) the investment of amounts in the reserve account
established by the MFA for the bonds of the MFA issued to provide funds to purchase this bond
fails to provide sufficient available funds (together with any other funds that may be made
available for such purpose) to pay the interest on outstanding bonds of the MFA issued to fund
such account, the Issuer shall and hereby agrees to pay on demand only the Issuer’s pro rata share
(as determined by the MFA) of such deficiency as additional interest on this bond.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Bond, so long as the MFA is the owner of this
Bond, (a) this Bond is payable as to principal, premium, if any, and interest at The Bank of New
York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., or at such other place as shall be designated in writing to the
Issuer by the MFA (the “MFA’s Depository”); (b) the Issuer agrees that it will deposit with the
MFA’s Depository payments of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Bond in
immediately available funds by 12:00 noon at least five business days prior to the date on which
any such payment is due whether by maturity, redemption or otherwise; in the event that the
MFA’s Depository has not received the Issuer’s deposit by 12:00 noon on the scheduled day, the
Issuer shall immediately pay to the MFA as invoiced by the MFA an amount to recover the MFA’s
administrative costs and lost investment earnings attributable to that late payment; and (c) written
notice of any redemption of this Bond shall be given by the Issuer and received by the MFA’s
Depository at least 40 days prior to the date on which redemption is to be made.
This Bond is one of a series of bonds designated “Sewage Disposal System Revenue
Bonds, Series 2018-SRF-__” and is issued pursuant to the provisions of (i) Act 233, Public Acts
of Michigan, 1955, as amended (“Act 233”), and Act 94, Public Acts of Michigan, 1933, as
amended (“Act 94”), (ii) Master Bond Ordinance No. 2015-02 adopted by the Board on October 7,

 2015, as amended (the “Bond Ordinance”), (iii) the Series Ordinance Authorizing Issuance and
Sale of Sewage Disposal System Revenue Bonds in an Amount not to Exceed $45,000,000,
adopted by the Board on ____________, 2018 (the “Series Ordinance”), and (iv) a Sale Order of
the Chief Executive Officer of the Issuer dated ____________, 2018 (the “Sale Order,” and,
collectively with the Bond Ordinance and the Series Ordinance, the “Ordinance”). This Bond is
issued for the purposes set forth in the Series Ordinance and the Sale Order.
For the prompt payment of the principal of and interest on this Bond, and other bonds
issued by the Issuer pursuant to the Bond Ordinance, the Issuer has irrevocably pledged the
Pledged Assets (as defined in the Bond Ordinance), which includes the revenues of the Sewer
System (as defined in the Bond Ordinance), after provision is made for reasonable and necessary
expenses of operation, maintenance and administration of the Sewer System (the “Net Revenues”),
and a statutory lien on the Net Revenues and Pledged Assets is hereby recognized and
acknowledged. Such lien is a third lien, subject to obligations heretofore and hereafter issued or
incurred under the Bond Ordinance secured by a first or second lien on the Pledged Assets. This
Bond is of equal standing on a parity with all other obligations heretofore and hereafter issued or
incurred under the Bond Ordinance and secured by a third lien on the Pledged Assets.
For a complete statement of the revenues from which and the conditions under which this
Bond is payable, a statement of the conditions under which Additional Bonds (as defined in the
Bond Ordinance) of senior or equal standing and Additional Bonds of junior standing may

This Bond is subject to redemption prior to maturity at the option of the Issuer and with
the prior written consent of and upon such terms as may be required by the MFA. That portion of
this Bond called for redemption shall not bear interest after the date fixed for redemption, provided
funds are on hand with the Trustee to redeem the same.
THIS BOND IS ISSUED UNDER ACT 233 AND ACT 94. IT IS A SELFLIQUIDATING BOND AND IS NOT A GENERAL OBLIGATION OF THE ISSUER AND
DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INDEBTEDNESS OF THE ISSUER WITHIN ANY
CONSTITUTIONAL OR STATUTORY LIMITATION, BUT IS PAYABLE, BOTH AS TO
PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST SOLELY FROM THE PLEDGED ASSETS OF THE
SEWER SYSTEM. THE PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OF AND INTEREST ON THIS
BOND ARE SECURED BY A STATUTORY LIEN ON THE PLEDGED ASSETS AS
DESCRIBED HEREIN.
The Issuer has covenanted and agreed, and hereby covenants and agrees, to fix and
maintain, or cause to be fixed and maintained, at all times while any bonds payable from the
Pledged Assets of the Sewer System shall be outstanding, such rates for service furnished by the
Sewer System as shall be sufficient to provide for payment of the interest upon and the principal
of this Bond and all other Bonds (as defined in the Bond Ordinance) assumed or issued and to be
issued under the Bond Ordinance as and when the same shall become due and payable, to create
and maintain a bond redemption fund therefor, including a bond reserve for Bonds other than this
Bond, to provide for the payment of expenses of administration and operation and such expenses
for maintenance of the Sewer System as are necessary to preserve the same in good repair and
8
Page 10

 working order, and to provide for such other expenditures and funds for the Sewer System, all as
are required by the Bond Ordinance.
This Bond is transferable only upon the books of the Issuer kept for that purpose at the
office of the Trustee by the registered owner hereof in person, or by his attorney duly authorized
in writing, upon the surrender of this Bond together with a written instrument of transfer
satisfactory to the Trustee duly executed by the registered owner or his attorney duly authorized
in writing, and thereupon a new registered bond or bonds of the same type, in the same aggregate
principal amount and of the same maturity shall be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor as
provided in the Ordinance and upon the payment of the charges, if any, therein prescribed.
It is hereby certified and recited that all acts, conditions and things required by law
precedent to and in the issuance of this Bond have been done and performed by regular and due
time and form as required by law.
This Bond is not valid or obligatory for any purpose until the Trustee’s Certificate of
Authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee.

To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee
Nicolette Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer

From: Steve Hoover, Financial Reporting Manager

Re:

April 30, 2018 Interim Monthly Financial Report (Unaudited)

Background: The Interim Monthly Financial Report (unaudited) provides information and
analysis related to the financial performance of the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA).
The monthly report is accounted for on a full accrual basis with the exception of certain
items below which are adjusted at year-end only.
1. Balance sheet only reclassification
a. Restricted versus unrestricted cash
b. Construction work in progress (CWIP) versus closed projects
c. Deferred Pension versus net pension liability
d. No delineation between current versus noncurrent assets
2. Non-cash reclassification between expenses versus assets or liabilities
a. Interest expense versus capitalized interest on CWIP
b. Wages expense versus adjustments to accrued compensated absences
c. Fringe benefits versus adjustments to accrued worker’s compensation
d. CWIP is shown as an expense for budgetary monitoring

It should be noted that this is the first monthly interim GLWA financial report that moves
toward a full accrual basis. Several of the above classification matters will be addressed in
future months as our month-end close process continues to mature.
Analysis: See attached report.

Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

Net position is defined by the accounting standards as the residual of all other elements
presented in a statement of financial position. It is the difference between (a) assets and
deferred outflows of resources and (b) liabilities and deferred inflows of resources. A net deficit
occurs when the liabilities and deferred inflows exceed assets and deferred outflows. For GLWA,
deferred inflows and deferred outflows generally relate to financing activity and GLWA’s
share of the GRS pension obligation.

The largest category of nonoperating activities is interest expense of $112.4 million. This expense is
currently reported in gross but will be reviewed for partial capitalization at the end of the fiscal year related
to CWIP. Interest expense before capitalization is largely attributable to debt service with the remainder
related to the Water Lease and obligation payable.
Operating income after operating expenses (including depreciation) equals $66.2 million or 23.7% of
operating revenue.
Sewage Disposal Fund
Wholesale customer charges of $226.1 million account for 57.4% of Sewer System revenues. Wholesale
customer charges are based on a “share” percentage of the annual budget billed one-twelfth each month.
The shares are established based upon historical flows and are formally revisited every five years. The
result is no revenue shortfall or overestimation.
Local system (DWSD) revenues of $149.1 million account for 37.8% of total operating revenues.

Page 30

 The remaining 4.7% of revenue is due to other charges such as industrial waste charges, pollutant
surcharges which are charged to non-residential users.

Operating expenses of $292.3 million represent 74.2% of total operating revenue. Depreciation is the largest
operating expense at $156.1 million or 53.4% of total operating expense. The remaining 46.6% of operating
expenses is allocated among seven categories as shown below.

 AGENDA ITEM #8G

Date: June 15, 2018

To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Kim Garland, Public Finance Management Professional

Re:

Trust Receipt & Disbursement Report for Activity through April 30, 2018

Background: Beginning January 2016, water and sewer system services are provided to
the City of Detroit through the DWSD. Accordingly, DWSD is allocated a revenue
requirement for those services in accordance with a services agreement. Consistent with
the terms of the GLWA Master Bond Ordinance, which is applicable to assumed pre- and
new post-bifurcation debt of the DWSD which was transferred to GLWA on the effective
date, the cash receipts of both DWSD and GLWA are deposited in a Trust and distributed in
accordance with the terms of the Master Bond Ordinance.

The purpose of this report is to provide an ongoing status as to the ability of both
organizations to cover their Master Bond Ordinance requirements with their cash receipts.

Analysis: The following tables summarize this activity along three lines: Local System
Activity, Regional System Activity, and Combined Activity accompanied by a series of charts
that further breakdown this activity by fund, inflows and outflows. This information does
reflect activity and transfers associated with the April 2018 Memorandum of Understanding
Term Sheet as part of fiscal year ending June 30, 2017 activity.
This is a new report and process, made possible mainly due to continuous process
improvement and the steady implementation of financial reporting best practices. It will
take time to refine but is being put in use at a high-level for Board and Audit Committee use
and at a more detailed level for use by DWSD and GLWA finance team members.

This initial report highlights the continued health of the regional system water and sewer
funds and local system water fund. While the local system sewer fund does reflect a deficit,
this report helps provide a basis to discuss changes and monitor progress. DWSD
management has already taken steps to address the local system sewer deficit as evidenced
by the use lease payment proceeds beginning in March to support current debt
requirements.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

FY 2018 Operations & Maintenance Budget Update through May 31, 2018 and
Fiscal Year-End Amendments through June 30, 2018

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) is in the process of closing May 31,
2018. A pre-close report has been prepared to present the current budget status as we
approach the final day of our fiscal year on June 30, 2018.
Analysis: This report contains the following for review and discussion.
 Operations & Maintenance (O&M) Category Analysis
 Staffing – Budget vs. Actual

 Overtime by Major Budget Category

 Budget Amendment Report/Use of Unallocated Reserve

It should be noted that these interim reports are being prepared on an accrual basis which
is currently under final review as the Financial Reporting & Accounting team is rolling out
new monthly closing procedures.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

(*) The close for May 2018 is under review. There are no known material adjustments; most common delays occur in contractual services and utilities.

As the table above shows, GLWA’s spend is currently being estimated at 87.2% of the forecasted budget. The two largest categories of
underbudget status, Contractual Services and Utilities, experience the most common delays in receiving invoices timely. These accounts
are being reviewed to ensure that the accruals for unposted vendor invoices are adequate. The third largest area with a positive variance,
Supplies & Other, may experience some lag, but to a much lesser extent. The ‘Percent of Total Amended Budget’ column and the ‘Percent
of Actual thru May 31, 2018, demonstrate that the budgeted amounts closely align with actual costs at 87.2%.

 Great Lakes Water Authority
Budget Amendment Report
Through June 30, 2018
The purpose of this report is to present the Operations & Maintenance (O&M) budget
amendments that have been processed for FY 2018 from January 1, 2018, through June 30,
2018. This report contains two parts: Part 1 - Budget Amendments Processed for FY 2018
from January 1, 2018, through June 30, 2018 and Part 2 - Analysis of Unallocated Reserves
from January 1, 2018, through June 30, 2018.
Part 1 - Budget Amendments Processed for FY 2018 from January 1, 2018, through June
30, 2018
The following is an overview of the O&M budget amendments that have been processed for the
3rd and 4th Quarters of FY 2018.
 Many of the budget amendments recorded during the 3rd and 4th quarters have been
reclassifications within a cost center or operating area to improve assignment of
costs.
 A budget amendment (No. 8580) for $360,000 was recorded to move budget to
cover GLWA-CS-154 titled Investment Grade Energy Audit. This study, covered in
the Energy, Research & Innovation group’s budget, was created in FY 2018 to
analyze GLWA’s energy usage. The outcome of this study may lead to the
development of capital projects for long term energy savings.
 A budget Amendment (No. 9229) for $5,391,640 was recorded to move budget to
cover PC-798A Change Order No. 1. This is the facilities maintenance requirement
contract for Lakeshore Global Corporation which was approved at the Board of
Directors Workshop on September 13, 2017. PC-798A is a skilled trades contract
that is to augment GLWA staff and has assisted in successfully maintaining
compliance with state and federal regulations, as well as GLWA’s Administrative
Consent Order (ACO) with the State of Michigan. The services also provide the
necessary support for urgent and emergency projects requiring immediate attention
or resources beyond the staff’s ability.
 A budget amendment (No. 8582) for $1,084,400 was recorded to move budget to
cover GLWA-CON-219. This contract, approved by the GLWA Board on 1/24/2018,
is for the removal and disposal of debris, cleaning and flowmeter services in the
influent conduit at the Baby Creek Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) facility.
 A budget amendment (No. 9104) for $1,050,000 for DTE Electric Company was
recorded to move budget for the rental of the generators that were needed while the
second electrical feed was being repaired at the Water Resource Recovery Facility.
 A budget amendment (No. 9838) for $373,000 was entered to move budget to cover
Sigma CS-1481, Task 27. This document retention project is for the scanning of the
as-built drawings for GLWA.

 Part 2 - Analysis of Unallocated Reserves from January 1, 2018, through June 30, 2018
The table below identifies four categories of unallocated reserves by the four primary budget
areas. This table includes the FY 2018 approved budget amounts as well as the net effect of
the budget amendments as described below.

Third Quarter Budget Amendments
Unallocated Reserve – Water System Operations & Wastewater System Operations
There is one budget amendment (No. 8563) that equals the $360,000 shown in the table above
for both the Water System and Wastewater System Operations.
• Budget was moved from Systems Control (a cost center within Water System
Operations) to the repairs & maintenance accounts of several Pumping Stations
(cost centers within Sewer System Operations). This reclass was made to align the
budget to the cost centers where the costs are being incurred. Since two different
funds (Water & Sewage Disposal) were being impacted by this reclass, the Unallocated
Reserve accounts were used to balance the two funds. This resulted in an increase of
$360,000 to the Unallocated Reserve – Water System Operations and a decrease of
($360,000) to the Unallocated Reserve – Wastewater System Operations.

Unallocated Reserve – Centralized Services
There are two items that equal the ($737,400) shown in the table above.
• ($620,400) – Budget amendment (No. 8716) was recorded to transfer costs to the newly
formed Hazmat group. Prior to the formation of this new group, Hazmat services had
been provided through a contract with the Detroit Fire Department. Beginning on
March 1, 2018, the GLWA Hazmat group was launched. The budget required to
make this new group operational was credited from the Unallocated Reserve.
• ($117,000) – Budget amendment (No. 9182) was recorded to cover the budget needed
for the purchase of Bonfire (a software as a service, or SaaS, solution) for the
Procurement group. Bonfire spans the “end-to-end” procurement cycle from soliciting
suppliers, receiving bids and proposals, evaluation & scoring, documenting awardee

Page 8

 decision, and managing the contract. This product was not included in the FY 2018
budget and resulted in an entry to reduce (credit) the Unallocated Reserve.
Unallocated Reserve – Administrative Services
There are three items that equal the ($1,310,000) shown in the table above.
• ($1,000,000) – A review of the current and projected activity posted in the Enterprise
Risk Management Insurance Fund cost center (883411) was conducted in February
2018. The results of this review showed that an additional budget of $1,700,000 would
be required to cover the actual cost through the end of FY 2018. Examples of the types
of coverage included in this cost center are property & casualty insurance, brokerage
services, and public officials & employment practices liability insurance. Budget
amendment (No. 9212) was recorded in the 3rd quarter to transfer $1,000,000 from
Unallocated Reserve. An additional analysis is currently being conducted to review
activity through May 2018
• ($215,000) – Budget amendment (No. 9575) was recorded to add budget to both the
Financial Planning & Analysis (884113) and Public Finance (884141) cost centers
for The Foster Group, contract GLWA-CS-195. The contract amount was not known
at the time the FY 2018 budget was adopted. The difference between the amount
budgeted and the actual contract amount was transferred from the Unallocated Reserve.
• ($95,000) – An increase to the Contractual Professional Services budget for the
Financial Reporting & Accounting group (884111) was needed to cover the additional
services required to manage the multiple projects that are being initiated by this
group. As multiple new processes are being developed in this group additional staff is
needed, on a temporary basis, to assist with the management and documentation of
these processes. This additional assistance provides the GLWA staff with the ability to
assist with the development of the processes while being able to manage their day-today workload. The additional budget needed was transferred from the Unallocated
Reserve (Budget Amendment No. 9595).

Fourth Quarter Budget Amendments
A review of several key areas of the O&M budget was undertaken during the third and fourth
quarters of FY 2018. This resulted in amendments being processed in the fourth quarter. The
three key areas were Personnel, Capital Program Allocation, and Shared Services.
Personnel – A comparison of the actual Salaries & Wages, as well as the Employee Benefits,
to the amounts budgeted showed that an increase to the budget of these areas would be
needed. The increase is due to the following.
•

Increases in the Salaries & Wages and Benefits of existing GLWA staff during FY 2018
for various reasons (market adjustments, merit raises, promotions, etc.)

Page 9

 •

Increase in Employee Benefits due to the increase in premiums charged for
Calendar Year 2018. The amount of this increase was not known at the time the FY
2018 budget was prepared.

Based on the results of the review of the Salaries & Wages and Employee Benefits, several
budget amendments were prepared to move budget from the Unallocated Reserves to the
appropriate cost centers.

Capital Program Allocation (contra accounts) – The FY 2018 budget was prepared based on
a prior methodology for recording time allocated to capital projects. A more conservative
approach is now being taken to focus on those individuals who are working directly on the
capital projects rather than those who are working indirectly. In addition, there are processes
being implemented to improve the tracking and reporting of the GLWA staff members’ direct
hours. Both scenarios have resulted in a decrease to the budget for the Capital Program
Allocation contra accounts.
The following table shows the impact of the adjustment to the Capital Program Allocation budget
on the Unallocated Reserve accounts.

Page 10

 Shared Services – The shared services budget was prepared based on the agreements as
they were interpreted, before actual invoices were issued and the true-ups (actual costs
incurred as compared to the estimates billed) analyzed. The billing trends for FY 2016 and FY
2017 were reviewed to improve the projection for FY 2018. This review has resulted in an
overall decrease to the budget for Shared Services which are primarily contra accounts.
The following table shows the impact of the adjustment to the Shared Services budget on the
Unallocated Reserve accounts.

In addition to the key areas mentioned above, a variety of other categories of expenses were
reviewed. Some of the larger categories reviewed included chemicals, utilities, and
contractual services. Budgets were moved either from or to the Unallocated Reserve
accounts as deemed necessary. The impact of these budget amendments on the Unallocated
Reserve accounts are as follows – noting that it was an overall increase in reserve.

Two additional budget amendments were processed during the fourth quarter; one impacting
the Water System Operations Unallocated Reserves and one the Wastewater System
Operations Unallocated Reserves.
Unallocated Reserve – Water System Operations
Budget amendment No. 9968 for $1,800,000 was processed to cover the O&M expenses
incurred for sludge removal services to preserve water quality and meet MDEQ
requirements for the NPDES permit for wastewater operations. This is a temporary
scenario until further equipment enhancements are in place which is currently under
consideration. This service is for the Southwest Water Treatment Plant.

Page 11

 Unallocated Reserve – Wastewater System Operations
A budget amendment (No. 9982) was processed to correct a previously posted budget
amendment – no financial impact, but it does create presentation challenges. This
amendment reclassed $7,201,000 from the O&M Unallocated Reserves to the Improvement &
Extension fund. This reclass will bring the O&M budget back in line with the Original Board
Adopted Budget of $329,512,800. This scenario was caused by a clerical error at the time
of budget load which could not be corrected by the system or their support center.

 AGENDA ITEM #7E

Date: June 15, 2018

To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Kathy Smith-Roy, Susan Kopinski, Special Projects Manager
Re:

Proposed Procurement Policy Amendment for Compliance with the
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)

Background: GLWA receives federal funds passed through State Revolving Fund Loans,
which requires compliance with the related Federal Regulations 2 CFR Part 200 and new

citations in the new “Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit
Requirements for Federal Grants”. In addition to the information below, attached is the

AICPA April 2018 summary compliance requirements.

Implementation is required by fiscal year end June 30, 2018.

Synopsis of Changes for Operating Federal programs as subrecipients of the State:

The major revision to the procurement requirements are the following five (5) methods of
procurement with dollar thresholds associated to each method of procurement. Section
200.320 found below describes the five methods of procurements:

1) Micro-purchase (less than to $3,500),
2) Small purchase (less than $150,000),
3) Sealed bids purchases (more than $150,000),
4) Competitive proposal purchases (more than $150,000), and
5) Noncompetitive purchases (special circumstances which are applicable for all purchase
levels).
All five procurement types must comply with the Procurement Standards in section
200.318, also found below, which can be summarized generally as follows:
• the purchase complies with the organization’s documented procedures in place,
• purchases are necessary,
• open competition (to the extent required by each method),
• a conflict of interest policy, and
• proper documentation for the purchases.

Page 13

 In section 200.88 simplified acquisitions threshold is used to describe small purchases and
micro-purchases (200.67). Simplified acquisition threshold means the dollar amount below
which an organization may purchase property or services using small purchase methods
(less than $150,000). Since micro-purchases are less than to $3,000, micro-purchases can
also use the simplified acquisition threshold. All purchases under the simplified acquisition
threshold (including micro-purchases) require:
• fewer terms and conditions,
• have a lesser competition standard than purchases over the simplified acquisition
threshold,
• can be solicited informally,
• and do not require a cost or price analysis.

For example, purchases of supplies or services under $3,000 are treated as micropurchases. If the organization entity considers the costs to be reasonable, the purchase
orders may be awarded without soliciting any competitive quotations. No rate competitive
quotations are necessary for the purchase. A cost or price analysis is also not required. The
organization must, to the extent practicable, distribute these purchases equitable among
qualified suppliers.

All purchases between $3,000 and $150,000 the small purchase procedures can used and is
stated in section 200.320 (b) which describes the procedures as relatively simple and
informal.
• It states that “price or rate quotations must be obtained from an adequate number of
qualified sources.”
• It leaves the discretion of the organization’s written policy to determine the
“adequate” number of qualified sources (i.e., any number greater than one) and the
methods of methods of obtaining the price or rate quotations (e.g., it can be in
writing, orally, vendor price list on website, or generated via online search engine).
• Section 200.323 also excludes the small purchases from any requirements for cost or
price analysis.
o For example, a purchase order for supplies in the amount $10,000 can treated
a small purchase order.
o This purchase order requires a rate quote from at least two sources, which
can be obtained in writing from two suppliers or research done on a public
website. A cost or price analysis is not required.
o In addition, if the supplies are of special quality that is offered by only one
company or only one company can deliver in the time frame required for the
project, the purchase order can be made under the sole source purchase
provision in section 200.320 (f).
For purchases greater than the simplified acquisition threshold of $150,000, either sealed
bids or competitive proposals purchases apply. The sealed bid method is the preferred

Page 14

 method for procuring construction and is not a typical procurement method for local
centers. Sealed bids are publicly solicited and a firm fixed price contract (lump sum or unit
price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material
terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, and is the lowest in price. For detail
information please review the information below in section 200.320 Methods of
procurement to be followed.
Competitive proposals are used to solicit multiple offers and can be awarded either a fixed
price or cost-reimbursement type contract. Competitive proposals are for bids over
$500,000 and is generally used when conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed
bids. Requests for proposals (RFPs) are typical used for competitive proposals. For
competitive proposals where qualification of the vendor is more important than the price
of the service a request for qualification (RFQ) maybe more appropriate. For detail
information please review the information below in section 200.320 Methods of
procurement to be followed.

The final method of procurement is the sole source method. This procurement method is
noncompetitive and should only be used for the following types of procurement:
• Unique type of service or product that can only be provided by a specific vendor,
• Public emergency where the service and product must be performed or produced
without delayed.
• Upon the written request by the organization, the federal awarding agency or passthrough entity expressly authorized sole sourcing, or
• After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined to be inadequate.

Finally, to promote cost-effective and efficient procurement, organizations are encouraged
to use shared services by entering into state/local intergovernmental agreements, or interentity agreements. This method is appropriate for common procurement or shared goods
and services.
Analysis: The changes to the procurement policy and related procedures relating to
Federal programs are significant and implementation is required by June 30, 2018 is
required for compliance. A markup copy of the proposed implementation of this
requirement are shown on the attached pages.

Proposed Action: Audit Committee recommends that the proposed revision to the GLWA
Procurement Policy be forwarded to the GLWA Board of Directors for consideration and
potential action at its next meeting in June 2018.

 EXCERPT FROM PROCUREMENT POLICY

Section 9 – Contract/Purchase Order Compliance

9.1 Contract Performance
A contractor shall supply goods and services conforming to the specifications of the solicitation and
award. Failure to perform within the specification and stated time of the contract or purchase order
may result in contract or purchase order termination.
9.2 Federal Uniform Guidance Procurement Standards
All projects funded in full, or in part, by federal funds, are subject to the Uniform Administrative
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Federal Procurement
Standards CFR 200.318 – 200.326 or as may be amended). The Chief Procurement Officer shall
establish procedures to incorporate the required federal provisions for federally funded projects,
regardless of the amount of funding.

Vendor Suspension and Debarment
9.29.3
It is the policy of GLWA to solicit offers from, award contracts and purchase orders to and consent to
subcontracts with responsible vendors only. Suspensions or debarments may be imposed at the
discretion of the GLWA for purposes related to the good of the public interest, including maintaining
the integrity of the bidding, contracting and procurement processes and protecting public trust and
confidence in GLWA’s operations. Suspensions and debarments will not be imposed as punitive
measures. GLWA may suspend or debar a vendor based on a finding that the vendor is not a
responsible vendor and shall report said finding to the Legal Committee. Causes which may result
in a finding that a vendor is not a responsible vendor include, but are not limited to, any of the
following:

 Election to Delay Implementation of Procurement Standards
On May 17, 2017, the Management and Budget Office issued a Rule updating the final guidance
that appeared in the Federal Register on December 26, 2013. Guidance on the
effective/applicability date was revised to allow for a grace period of one additional fiscal year
for non-Federal entities to implement changes to their procurement policies and procedures in
accordance with guidance on procurement standards (2 CFR 200.317 through 200.326). This
means the grace period for non-Federal entities extends through December 25, 2017, and the
implementation date for the procurement standards will start for fiscal years beginning on or
after December 26, 2017.

Compliance Requirements

PART 3.2 - I – COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS
Note: For all other types of compliance requirements, the auditor must use Part 3 of the
2017 Compliance Supplement.
I. PROCUREMENT AND SUSPENSION AND DEBARMENT
Compliance Requirements - Procurement
Procurement—Grants and Cooperative Agreements
States
When procuring property and services, States must use the same policies and procedures they
use for procurements from their non-Federal funds (2 CFR section 200.317).
Non-Federal Entities Other than States
Non-Federal entities other than States, including those operating Federal programs as
subrecipients of States, must follow the procurement standards set out at 2 CFR sections 200.318
through 200.326. They must use their own documented procurement procedures, which reflect
applicable State and local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to
applicable Federal statutes and the procurement requirements identified in 2 CFR part 200. A
non-Federal entity must:
1.

Meet the general procurement standards in 2 CFR section 200.318, which include
oversight of contractors’ performance, maintaining written standards of conduct for
employees involved in contracting, awarding contracts only to responsible contractors,
and maintaining records to document history of procurements.

2.

Conduct all procurement transactions in a manner providing full and open competition, in
accordance with 2 CFR section 200.319.

3.

Use the micro-purchase and small purchase methods only for procurements that meet the
applicable criteria under 2 CFR sections 200.320(a) and (b). Under the micro-purchase
method, the aggregate dollar amount does not exceed $3,500 ($2,000 in the case of
acquisition for construction subject to the Wage Rate Requirements (Davis-Bacon Act)).
Small purchase procedures are used for purchases that exceed the micro-purchase amount
but do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. Micro-purchases may be awarded
without soliciting competitive quotations if the non-Federal entity considers the price to
be reasonable (2 CFR section 200.320(a)). If small purchase procedures are used, price
or rate quotations must be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources (2 CFR
section 200.320(b)). Note exceptions described in subsequent sections for the provisions
under the 2017 and 2018 National Defense Authorization Act.

4.

For acquisitions exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, the non-Federal entity
must use one of the following procurement methods: the sealed bid method if the
acquisition meets the criteria in 2 CFR section 200.320(c); the competitive proposals

Compliance Supplement

3.2-I-1

Compliance Requirements

method under the conditions specified in 2 CFR section 200.320(d); or the
noncompetitive proposals method (i.e., solicit a proposal from only one source) but only
when one or more of four circumstances are met, in accordance with 2 CFR section
200.320(f).
5.

Perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement action in excess of
the simplified acquisition threshold, including contract modifications (2 CFR section
200.323(a)). The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost
methods of contracting must not be used (2 CFR section 200.323(d)).

6.

Ensure that every purchase order or other contract includes applicable provisions required
by 2 CFR section 200.326. These provisions are described in Appendix II to 2 CFR part
200, “Contract Provisions for Non-Federal Entity Contracts Under Federal Awards.”

Procurement—Cost-Reimbursement Contracts under the Federal Acquisition Regulation
When awarding subcontracts, non-Federal entities receiving cost-reimbursement contracts under
the FAR must comply with the clauses at 48 CFR section 52.244-2 (consent to subcontract),
52.244-5 (competition), 52.203-13 (code of business ethics), 52.203-16 (conflicts of interest),
and 52.215.12 (cost or pricing data); and the terms and conditions of the contract. The FAR
defines “subcontracts” as a contract, i.e., a mutually binding legal relationship obligating the
seller to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and the buyer to pay for them,
entered into by a subcontractor to furnish supplies or services for performance of a prime
contract or a subcontract. It includes, but is not limited to, purchase orders, and changes and
modifications to purchase orders.
Source of Governing Requirements – Procurement
The requirements that apply to procurement under grants and cooperative agreements are
contained in 2 CFR sections 200.317 through 200.326, program legislation, Federal awarding
agency regulations, and the terms and conditions of the award. The requirements that apply to
procurement under cost-reimbursement contracts under the FAR are contained in 48 CFR parts
03, 15, 44 and the clauses at 48 CFR sections 52.244-2, 52.244-5, 52.203-13, 52.203-16, and
52.215-12; agency FAR Supplements; and the terms and conditions of the contract.
Compliance Requirements – Suspension and Debarment
Non-Federal entities are prohibited from contracting with or making subawards under covered
transactions to parties that are suspended or debarred. “Covered transactions” include contracts
for goods and services awarded under a non-procurement transaction (e.g., grant or cooperative
agreement) that are expected to equal or exceed $25,000 or meet certain other criteria as
specified in 2 CFR section 180.220. All non-procurement transactions entered into by a passthrough entity (i.e., subawards to subrecipients), irrespective of award amount, are considered
covered transactions, unless they are exempt as provided in 2 CFR section 180.215.
When a non-Federal entity enters into a covered transaction with an entity at a lower tier, the
non-Federal entity must verify that the entity, as defined in 2 CFR section 180.995 and agency
adopting regulations, is not suspended or debarred or otherwise excluded from participating in

the transaction. This verification may be accomplished by (1) checking the Excluded Parties
List System (EPLS) maintained by the General Services Administration (GSA) and available at
https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/, (2) collecting a certification from the entity, or
(3) adding a clause or condition to the covered transaction with that entity (2 CFR section
180.300).
Non-Federal entities receiving contracts from the Federal Government are required to comply
with the contract clause at FAR 52.209-6 before entering into a subcontract that will exceed
$30,000, other than a subcontract for a commercially available off-the-shelf item.
Source of Governing Requirements – Suspension and Debarment
The requirements for nonprocurement suspension and debarment are contained in OMB
guidance in 2 CFR part 180, which implements Executive Orders 12549 and 12689, “Debarment
and Suspension;” Federal awarding agency regulations in Title 2 of the CFR
adopting/implementing the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180; program legislation; and the terms
and conditions of the award.
Most of the Federal agencies have adopted or implemented 2 CFR part 180, generally by
relocating their associated agency rules in Title 2 of the CFR. Appendix II to the Supplement
includes the current CFR citations for all agencies adoption or implementation of the
nonprocurement suspension and debarment guidance.
Government-wide requirements related to suspension and debarment and doing business with
suspended or debarred subcontractors under cost reimbursement contracts under the FAR are
contained in 48 CFR section 9.405-2(b) and the clause at 48 CFR section 52.209-6.
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2017and 2018
The following information is provided regarding timing and impact of the NDAA of 2017 and
2018. Additional guidance to the auditor is provided in Appendix VII -A – “Other Audit
Advisories – Hurricane and NDAA Addendum” of the 2018 Supplement.
NDAA of 2017
The NDAA of 2017, Section 217 (Pub. L. No. 114-328, 130 Stat. 6 (2051)) and 41 USC
1902(a)(2) contained the following provisions.


Raise the micro-purchase threshold to $10,000 for procurements under grants and
cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education, or related or affiliated
nonprofit entities, nonprofit research organizations or independent research institutes..



Allow a threshold higher than $10,000 as determined appropriate by the head of the
relevant executive agency.

The provisions of this Act are specific to, institutions of higher education, or related or affiliated
nonprofit entities, nonprofit research organizations or independent research institutes. As of the

Compliance Supplement

3.2-I-3

Page 20

 April 2018

Compliance Requirements

date of this 2018 Supplement, OMB has not issued guidance to clarify the applicability date
which would allow the specified entities to raise their micro-purchase threshold up to $10,000.
Once the applicability date is determined, the non-Federal entity must document this decision in
its internal procurement policies. Institutions of higher education, or related or affiliated
nonprofit entities, nonprofit research organizations or independent research institutes, which had
established micro-purchase thresholds up to the $10,000 prior to the enactment of the NDAA
2017, are allowed to continue the use of the same threshold as documented in their internal
procurement policies.
Note that the exception for the $10,000 micro-purchase threshold is not available to ALL
auditees; however when implemented by an eligible auditee, the exception would apply to
procurements purchased under ALL federal grants.
Institutions of higher education, or related or affiliated nonprofit entities, nonprofit research
organizations or independent research institutes may request micro-purchase threshold higher
than $10,000, but it requires a formal approval from an appropriate executive agency. Once
approved, the non-Federal entity must document this decision in its internal procurement
policies.
NDAA of 2018
The NDAA of 2018, Sections 805 (41 USC 134) and 806 (41 USC. 1902 (a) (1)), increased the
simplified acquisition threshold to $250,000 and the micro-purchase threshold to $10,000,
respectively for ALL auditees for ALL Federal grants. These changes effectively redefine the
level for the simplified acquisition threshold (section 200.88 of the Uniform Guidance) and the
micro-purchase threshold (section 200.67 of the Uniform Guidance). These changes will
become effective when they are formally codified in the Federal Acquisition Regulations at 48
CFR Subpart 2.1 (Definitions). Early implementation is not permissible.
Note exception for institutions of higher education, or related or affiliated nonprofit entities,
nonprofit research organizations or independent research institutes provided under 2017 NDAA
(and described in previous section).
Once codified, the higher thresholds will be available to all non-Federal entities except States.
The non-Federal entity must document this decision in its internal procurement policies.
Availability of Other Information
2 CFR section 200.110(a), Effective/Applicability Date was amended on May 17, 2017 to allow
non-Federal entities to continue to comply with the procurement standards in OMB Circular A110 or the A-102 common rule, as applicable, through December 25, 2017, extending the grace
period from 2 years to 3 years. Implementation of the procurement standards in 2 CFR sections
200.317 through 200.326 is now required for auditee fiscal years beginning on or after December
26, 2017. For example, for a non-Federal entity with a June 30th year end, implementation is
required for its fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.

Compliance Requirements

If a non-Federal entity chooses to use the previous procurement standards for the additional three
fiscal years before adopting the procurement standards in 2 CFR part 200, the non-Federal entity
must document this decision in its internal procurement policies.
Auditors will review procurement policies and procedures based on the documented standard.
Once the grace period ends, all non-Federal entities will be required to comply fully with the
procurement standards in the uniform guidance.
Audit Objectives
1.

Obtain an understanding of internal control, assess risk, and test internal control as
required by 2 CFR section 200.514(c).

2.

Determine whether procurements under Federal awards were made in compliance with
applicable Federal regulations and other procurement requirements specific to an award
or subaward.

3.

For covered transactions determine whether the non-Federal entity verified that entities
are not suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded.

Suggested Audit Procedures – Internal Control
1.

Perform procedures to obtain an understanding of internal control sufficient to plan the
audit to support a low assessed level of control risk for the program.

2.

Plan the testing of internal control to support a low assessed level of control risk for
procurement and suspension and debarment requirements and perform the testing of
internal control as planned. If internal control over some or all of the compliance
requirements is likely to be ineffective, see the alternative procedures in
2 CFR section 200.514(c)(4), including assessing the control risk at the maximum and
considering whether additional compliance tests are required because of ineffective
internal control.

3.

Consider the results of the testing of internal control in assessing the remaining risk of
noncompliance. Use this as the basis for determining the nature, timing, and extent
(e.g., number of transactions to be selected) of substantive tests of compliance.

Suggested Audit Procedures – Compliance
(Procedure 1 applies only to States under grants and cooperative agreements.)
1.

Test a sample of procurements to ascertain if the State’s laws and procedures were
followed and that the policies and procedures used were the same as for non-Federal
funds (2 CFR section 200.317).

Compliance Supplement

3.2-I-5

Page 22

 April 2018

Compliance Requirements

(Procedures 2 – 5 apply to non-Federal entities other than States.)
2.

Obtain the entity’s procurement policies and verify that the policies comply with the
compliance requirements highlighted above.

3.

Verify that the entity has written standards of conduct that cover conflicts of interest and
govern the performance of its employees engaged in the selection, award, and
administration of contracts (2 CFR section 200.318(c) and 48 CFR sections 52.203-13
and 52.303-16).

4.

Ascertain if the entity has a policy to use statutorily or administratively imposed in-State
or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals. If yes, verify
that these limitations were not applied to federally funded procurements except where
applicable Federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference
(2 CFR section 200.319(b)).

5.

Select a sample of procurements and perform the following procedures:
a.

Examine contract files and verify that they document the history of the
procurement, including the rationale for the method of procurement, selection of
contract type, basis for contractor selection, and the basis for the contract price (2
CFR section 200.318(i) and 48 CFR part 44 and section 52.244-2).

b.

For grants and cooperative agreements, verify that the procurement method used
was appropriate based on the dollar amount and conditions specified in 2 CFR
section 200.320. Current micro-purchase and simplified acquisition thresholds
can be found in the FAR (48 CFR subpart 2.1, “Definitions”)
(https://www.acquisition.gov/sites/default/files/current/far/html/Subpart%202_1.h
tml).

c.

Verify that procurements provide full and open competition (2 CFR section
200.319 and 48 CFR section 52.244-5).

d.

Examine documentation in support of the rationale to limit competition in those
cases where competition was limited and ascertain if the limitation was justified
(2 CFR sections 200.319 and 200.320(f) and 48 CFR section 52.244-5).

e.

Ascertain if cost or price analysis was performed in connection with all
procurement actions exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, including
contract modifications, and that this analysis supported the procurement action
(2 CFR section 200.323 and 48 CFR section 15.404-3).
Note: A cost or price analysis is required for each procurement action, including
each contract modification, when the total amount of the contract and related
modifications is greater than the simplified acquisition threshold.)

f.

Compliance Requirements

Verify consent to subcontract was obtained when required by the terms and
conditions of a cost reimbursement contract under the FAR (48 CFR section
52.244-2).
Note: If the non-Federal entity has an approved purchasing system, consent to
subcontract may not be required unless specifically identified by contract terms or
conditions. The auditor should verify that the approval of the purchasing system is
effective for the audit period being reviewed.

 AGENDA ITEM #8H

Date: June 15, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager
Re:

Status Update - 2018 Contract Alignment Process and Wholesale Water Contract
Reopeners Status

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) model water contract currently
provides for designated reopener dates in year 2, year 5 and every 5 years afterwards, until
the end of the 30-year term of the contract. In the fall of 2017 the GLWA contract
negotiation team met with 33 member communities which are served under the model
contract for regularly scheduled reopeners, including one out-of-sequence reopener
(Commerce Township) to renegotiate contract values. The next regularly scheduled
reopener for most of these member communities is scheduled for 2022. The GLWA
contract negotiation team will be meeting with 55 member communities throughout 2018
to reopen their model contracts as part of the Contract Alignment Process (CAP) for those
that did not reopen their contracts in 2017. In addition to the CAP reopeners, GLWA will
also be meeting with 4 additional communities on old forms of contract (Dearborn,
Gibraltar, Grosse Ile and Trenton) to discuss getting them on model contracts.
What is the CAP?

As part of the 2017 customer outreach meetings, member communities asked GLWA to
implement strategies to achieve goals of water charge stability and equity. As part of this
strategy, members asked for alignment of the model contract reopener to a common
schedule to minimize the annual charge volatility created by changing contract demands
which come as a result of the contract amendments.

The CAP involves all model contract customers that did not have a scheduled reopener in
2017 and requests that those member communities reopen their model contracts in 2018
(“2018 reopeners”) regardless of their current reopener schedule. As part of the 2018
reopener meetings, the contract reopener schedule within each customer contract is
amended to change the next regularly scheduled reopener date to 2022 and every 4 years
thereafter.

 The CAP concept was presented by GLWA at the October 10th and October 26th Water
Charges Workgroup meetings and was approved by the member communities at the
December 20, 2017 One Water Partnership meeting.
CAP Process

To maximize the efficiency of meeting with 59 communities, the GLWA contract negotiation
team grouped the member communities largely by county with a focus on establishing a
convenient regional location at which to host the meetings. The month for their meetings
were randomly chosen at the December 20, 2017 One Water Partnership meeting. On
average, 7 meetings per month have been (or will be) scheduled and will be conducted on 3
pre-announced days within each month.
With the goal of having effective and efficient meetings with all member communities this
year, the GLWA negotiation team sends the following packet of information to each
member community 30 days prior to scheduled meeting:
 Latest Exhibit A Drawings
 Proposed contract amendment
 Data sheets containing Volume, Max Day and Peak Hour information
Using 2015-2017 data (same data set used for 2017 reopeners)
Request that outlier points be investigated for cause prior to the meeting

By the close of each member community meeting, a time schedule is agreed to by the
parties to have the contract amended within the designated time period, based on the
governing body’s meeting schedule. The time schedule includes:

 Member must provide GLWA with its proposed Volume for planning purposes, Max
Day and Peak Hour values within 30 days after the meeting
 When the parties have reached mutual agreement on the contract values, GLWA will
provide within seven days the contract amendment
 After receipt of the amendment, Member will have 45 calendar days for its
governing body to approve.

CAP Meeting Schedule

Below is the current meeting schedule for the 2018 CAP. Those with check marks indicate
that meetings with these member communities have already been held. To date, the GLWA
contract negotiation team has met with 25 member communities as part of the CAP. Based
on the proposed schedule, the final meetings will be held on October 22, 2017 and all
contract amendments must be approved by the member community’s governing body by
January 11, 2018 to meet the FY 2020 water charges rollout schedule.
