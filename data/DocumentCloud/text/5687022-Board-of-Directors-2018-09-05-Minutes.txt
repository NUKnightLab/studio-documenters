Detroit Gallev, LLC - Casino l__.oan Program Nationai Retail

Ms. Hundley advised that in March, 2018, Pittsburgh-based Galley Group, inc. (?Galley")
announced that it planned to open a food hall in restaurant incubator in a vacant space on
the ground floor of the Federal Reserve Building in the city?s downtown. Galley launched
its first location in 2015 at Smailman Galley. it is a 6,0008i space with 4
kitchens. in 2017 a second location was opened in cailed the Federal
Galley. It is a 7,500sf space with 4 kitchens. A third location is scheduled to open in
Cleveland and Detroit Gailey will be the fourth location. in the ?rst and second quarters
of 2018 the average sales ticket price is reflected at $15.00 for both food and beverages.

Galley, a food hall development, management and advisory company, partners with
community leaders and industry veterans to create a collaborative space to showcase up
to four innovative food service concepts. Galley creates launch pads for the best new
chef-driven restaurant concepts. The concept was driven by an assessment of the
industry revealing a lack of business and management experience, significant waste,
inability to control cost and the inability to manage front of house and back of house
responsibilities. They provide the infrastructure for chefs to bring their concepts to market
at low?risk and for low-costs.

The opportunity to identify chef-driven restaurant concepts begins with a national press
release in a concept city. The release is launched in the designated concept area 6
months in advance. All inquiries are conducted thru the group web site.
Each inquiry (usually 60 to 80) is answered with a phone call, which
serves as the screening process. There are usually about 40 people that achieve
application status at the completion of screening. The applications are processed
through an internal committee that selects 8 to 12 finalists. Those finalists compete in a
demonstrative competition in the concept city. The best 4 concepts are chosen out of the
competition.

The start-up operating costs of the chef-owners include: purchase of food, cookware,
liability insurance, labor and legal accounting fees. (usually $10,000.00) Chef? owners
do not pay rent but share 30% of sales revenue. Revenue is derived from food beverage
sales and event fees. Galley finances and manages the build out of the spaces, utilities,
and the marketing. The restaurant operators manage their kitchen staff, menus, food
inventory and catering activities. Galley oversees the restaurants with a General Manager,
Marketing Manager and Bar Manager from the concept area. The managers are trained
in the area.
