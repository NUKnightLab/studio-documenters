 2013 Annual Report Highlights
• The adoption of all internal policies required by the Trust’s Bylaws
• The implementation of a detailed Contracting Manual that provides a
transparent, comprehensive guide to doing business with the Trust
• The approval and negotiation of the Trust’s first project, Retrofit One,
in which the Trust facilitated the design and financing of energy
upgrades in 60 public buildings in the City of Chicago, with the cost
savings from such upgrades being used to repay the loans
advanced by the private sector to fund such upgrades
• The introduction of a new public finance tool in the form of an
Energy Services Agreement (“ESA”). The ESA allows the City of
Chicago to participate in infrastructure financing that remains offcredit and off-balance sheet, thereby maintaining the City’s credit
ratings and borrowing capacity. The ESA is also replicable for a
wide variety of public financings
• The Trust received an unqualified audit opinion on financial
statements for 2012 and 2013
5

 Approval of 2013 Annual Report
WHEREAS, Section 11.2 of the Trust’s Bylaws requires that the
Trust prepare, and the Board of Directors approve, an annual report
that details the activities and accomplishments of the Trust for the prior
year, including, without limitation, information as to infrastructure
projects financed or supported by the Trust and the annual audited
financial statements of the Trust.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the 2013 Annual
Report of the Chicago Infrastructure Trust, in the form previously
provided to the members of the Board of Directors, be, and hereby is in
all regards, approved, and that management of the Trust be authorized
to release such Annual Report for public inspection and to disseminate
such Annual Report to the persons and in the manner prescribed by the
Trust’s Bylaws.

Whistle-Blower Policy
•

In order to ensure that the Trust maintains its business reputation and fulfills
its commitment to operate with the highest ethical standards and
transparency, we have drafted a whistle-blower policy

•

This policy encourages employees and others to report to appropriate
representatives of the Trust, without fear of retaliation, certain information
relating to accounting fraud, ethics violations and other complaints

•

Provisions of the policy include:
– Opportunities for employees or others to submit concerns on a
confidential or anonymous basis
– Responsibilities of the Trust leadership to investigate and report
violations to the Board of Directors
– A process for reporting violations or concerns to the Trust, or to the
Trust Board of Directors, who are totally independent of the Trust’s
management
– A mechanism for responding to, and keeping records of, complaints
9

 Approval of Whistle-Blower Policy
RESOLVED, that the Whistleblower Policy, in the form
previously provided to the members of the Board of
Directors, be and hereby is adopted and approved.

10

 Employee Manual – Version 1.0
• In order to develop as a high-performing professional organization,
the Trust has drafted an employee manual designed to
– Standardize procedures
– Establish best practices
– Fulfill auditing requirements
• The manual takes a comprehensive approach to articulating
workplace expectations and processes for staff members,
contractors and interns
• We developed the employee manual by adapting material from a
variety of sources, so that it meets the specific needs of the Trust
and to those who come to work for the Trust in any capacity
• The manual will be open to revision as the Trust evolves
• Additionally, this manual provides the basis for obtaining and
offering benefits to employees

11

 Approval of Employee Manual
RESOLVED, that the Employee Manual, in the form
previously provided to the members of the Board of
Directors, be and hereby is adopted and approved, and that
the Executive Director be, and hereby is, authorized and
empowered to establish and administer the employee
benefits required under the Employee Manual.

 Chicago Contemporary Bungalow
After Action Summary
•

Project Status: Inactive

•

Proposition: Address Chicago’s shortage of affordable housing and restore City-owned
vacant lots to productive use by introducing a Chicago Contemporary Bungalow (CCB)

– The Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) waiting list includes 40,000 names
– Chicago owns over 15,000 vacant lots
– The innovative use of containerized housing could create attractive homes at a
price lower than traditional stick-built housing
•

Guiding Principles: Based on affordable housing key learnings
Key Learning

Implication

Housing that looks like a place of “last resort”
stigmatizes residents and discourages upkeep

Design housing that is desirable and encourages
pride in residency

Insufficient maintenance over time undermines pride
in residency

Provide sufficient funding to ensure long-term
maintenance

Supply of subsidies and tax credits are limited, and
they create constraints

Business model must work with an affordable rent
($400 - $800), and not rely on subsidies or tax credits

19

 Chicago Contemporary Bungalow
After Action Summary
Project Team

Actions

Phase 1
May – June, 2014

For-credit intern team from the
University of Chicago Booth
School Private Equity Lab

Build a high-level financial model to understand
costs and feasibility of CCB proposition
• Interviews with manufacturers
• Meeting with Community Investment Bankers
• Research of renewable State grants

Phase 2
July – September, 2014

• Mike Mirretti, CIT Staff
• Aaron Rosenberg, Summer
Intern from the University of
Chicago Harris School
• Adam Helman, CIT
Contractor

Validate Phase 1 model, exploring financing
options, availability of tax credits and subsidies,
and demand-based site selection by meeting with:
• City of Chicago Department of Buildings
• Federally-certified CDFIs
• Foundations and not-for-profits focused on
affordable housing
• Affordable housing and manufactured housing
developers and manufacturers
• Building trade union leaders

Key Finding: Although it may be possible to manufacture, install, and maintain containerized housing with
monthly rents of $400 - $800, the resulting homes would not be desirable for residents in terms of design and
neighborhood fit.
The Trust may revisit this project in the future through a design competition in which architecture student teams
would be invited to submit designs that charge affordable rents and would be desirable for residents.

•

The Trust has received an unsolicited proposal from a leading national
provider of CNG fuel. This firm also designs, constructs, operates and
maintains their own fueling stations.

•

In accordance with the process defined in the Trust’s contracting manual,
the Trust is preparing materials for the Open Bid Process to solicit
additional proposals from CNG providers, auto manufacturers and
technology providers.

•

The Trust is engaging with well-regarded compressed natural gas experts
on either a pro-bono basis of funded through federal programs to assist in
the Open Bid Process and develop the program.

•

Trust is also in initial discussions with the Chicago Clean Cities Coalition,
the Illinois and Chicagoland Chambers of Commerce, the Gas Technology
Institute, the National Renewal Energy Laboratory and Argonne National
Laboratory to co-host a public forum for private sector fleet outreach to
encourage program participation.

28

 CTA 4G Das Update
• The Trust responded to a request for assistance from the
Chicago Transit Authority to identify cost-effective financing
strategies to pay for 4G wireless upgrades to the CTA’s subway
system.
• Accordingly, the Trust devised a strategy and reached out to the
four major wireless providers and worked with them to form a
unified Carrier Team with the intent of fully paying for these
upgrades.

• Trust asked for and received a term sheet from the Carrier
Team and is currently assisting the CTA in negotiations to come
to final terms with the Carriers.

29

 CTA 4G DAS Resolution
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors has previously
authorized the negotiation of the terms on which a
consortium of wireless carriers (the “Consortium”) would
finance an upgrade to the distributed antenna system in the
Chicago Transit Authority’s red and blue line subway
tunnels (the “CTA 4G Upgrade Project”);
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the
management of the Trust be, and hereby is, authorized to
negotiate and execute a services contract between the
Trust and the Consortium, on such terms as the Executive
Director of the Trust shall deem necessary, reasonable or
appropriate.
