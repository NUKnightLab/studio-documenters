7. Report from Legislative Liaison
John McCabe and Robert Molaro of McCabe Associates presented an overview of legislative
matters affecting the Fund in the 99th General Assembly. They stated that the Cook County Pension
Fund Reform bill (SB 843) was the same as the legislation presented last year. The bill passed out of
the House Personnel and Pensions Committee, but did not proceed to the House floor and was
referred to the House Rules Committee. Mr. Molaro stated that there was not likely to be action on
bills which would diminish benefits under the Pension Code. He noted that under SB 842 if the
County were to fail to make the contributions it owed, the Fund could request that the State
Controller divert any funds intended for the County to instead be paid to the Fund.
Mary Pat Burns, Fund counsel, presented an update regarding pension reform litigation in Illinois.
She stated that the Illinois State Supreme Court’s decision captioned: In re Pension Reform
Litigation, made clear that the State’s financial distress and use of “police power” would not be
sufficient grounds to reduce benefits under the Pension Code. While the decision only directly
impacted state pension funds, it would also be binding as legal precedent on the local funds. Ms.
Burns also stated that the Municipal Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund (“MEABF”) was
presently litigating the pension reform legislation affecting City employees in the Circuit Court of
Cook County. One issue in the City litigation is whether under Section 22-403 of the Pension Code,
the City is obligated to pay the annuities due to its employees if the MEABF was not able to do so.

 She stated that the Circuit Courty judge is expected to rule on this matter this summer so that any
appeal could be made to the Illinois Supreme Court in the fall.
8. Presentation of FY 2014 Audited Financial Statements
Karl Gawlas and Tim Fagan of Legacy Professionals, LLP, presented the 2014 audited financial
statements for the County Fund and the Forest Fund. The financial statements for both Funds were a
a combination of the plan fiduciary net position and the postemployment healthcare net position as
of December 31, 2014 and 2013. Each Fund adopted GASB Statement No. 67 during their plan
years ending on December 31, 2014, which requires the use of a blended investment rate of return,
and resulted in an increased liability as compared to prior years.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee McFadden that the 2014 Audit of the
County Fund as prepared by Legacy Professionals, LLP, be received and filed.

9. Presentation of 2014 Actuarial Valuations
Larry Langer and Dan Levin, of Buck Consultants, LLC, presented the 2014 Actuarial Valuations
for the County Fund and the Forest Fund. Mr. Levin made the presentation of the report relating to
the post-employment health insurance benefits (“OPEB”) provided by each Fund to annuitants. He
stated that OPEB is an unfunded liability for both the County and the Forest Fund. Mr. Levin noted
that GASB Statement Number 43, which was recently approved and would be effective sometime in
June, 2016, would likely increase accounting liability for the Funds. Mr. Langer made the
presentation for the actuarial valuations for pension benefits relating to each Fund. While he noted
that there was an increased funded status for both Funds largely due to asset gains, he emphasized
that employer contributions were insufficient on an actuarial basis to fund annuity and retiree health
benefits. Mr. Langer also reviewed the comparison of funded results in light of the GASB rule
changes.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee Nester that the 2014 Actuarial
Valuation of the County Fund as prepared by Buck Consultants, LLC, be received and filed.
