MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS, ARTICLE II. OFFENSES INVOLVING PROPERTY RIGHTS, SECTION
58-47 of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as Follows:

deception, or knowing that such use is without the consent of the person providing the property, labor or
services. Where compensation for service is ordinarily paid immediately upon the rendering of such
service or immediately upon the request for compensation by fare collectors, refusal to pay or absconding
without payment or offer to pay gives rise to a presumption that the service was obtained by deception as
to intention to pay.

(b)

offense.

Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.
