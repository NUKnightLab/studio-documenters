ITEM NO. B8

September 15, 2010

AUTHORIZATION FOR CHA TO ENTER INTO A MEMORANDUM OF
AGREEMENT WITH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY OF COOK COUNTY
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners:
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners (“Board”) authorize the Chief Executive
Officer or his designee to allow the Chicago Housing Authority (“CHA”) to enter into a
Memorandum Of Agreement (“MOA”) with The Housing Authority of Cook County (“HACC”),
to administer Housing Choice Voucher’s where an employee (or family member of an employee)
of the Housing Authority may have a financial interest in the Housing Choice Voucher (“HCV”).
FUNDING
No funding applicable
Vendor:
Address:

Housing Authority of Cook County
175 W. Jackson, Suite 350
Chicago, IL 60604
EXPLANATION

The CHA and HACC both administer Section 8/HCV programs in Chicago and Cook County
respectively. From time to time, each housing authority may have a potential conflict of interest
situation when an employee or their immediate family members have a financial interest in the
HCV as an owner who has entered into a Housing Assistance Payment (“HAP”) contract or as a
participant whose HCV is administered by their employer.
In an effort to circumvent any known or potential conflict of interests, the MOA will allow each
housing authority to administer the other housing authority’s vouchers in limited conflict of
interest situations.
Based on the foregoing, to avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest, it
is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
execute a Memorandum of Agreement with the Housing Authority of Cook County.
