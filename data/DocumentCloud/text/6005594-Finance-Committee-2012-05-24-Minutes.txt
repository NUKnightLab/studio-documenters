III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
The following individuals presented additional information: Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive Officer; Dr.
Sandra Martell, Interim Chief Operating Officer of the Cook County Department of Public Health; and Joy
Wykowski, Chief of Staff to the Chief Executive Officer.
Chairman Carvalho inquired as to the reason for backdating request numbers 1 through 3. Ms. Besenhofer
responded that it is her experience that occasionally, the official documents for grants are not received until
after the fact. Chairman Carvalho agreed that this is sometimes the case; he stated that the transmittals should
include information on the reason for delay and subsequent backdating of requests.
With regard to request number 2, Chairman Carvalho noted that the transmittal states that the previous grant
was from the Illinois Public Health Association (IPHA); he inquired how this request can be a renewal with the
Public Health Institute of Metropolitan Chicago (PHIMC), as IPHA and PHIMC are two different entities. Dr.
Martell stated that last year, IPHA was the grant awardee for the HIV prevention program. This year, PHIMC
is the grant awardee; PHIMC subcontracts with the System to provide HIV testing. Chairman Carvalho
indicated that the transmittal should reflect that this is a grant contract acceptance with PHIMC, not a renewal.
With regard to request number 4, Chairman Carvalho inquired as to when the System will release a Request for
Proposals (RFP) for this service. Dr. Raju responded that an RFP will be done next year. In response to
Chairman Carvalho’s question regarding contract deliverables and geographic distribution of services rendered,
Ms. Besenhofer stated that deliverables are being made a part of all contracts, moving forward. Ms. Wykowski
stated that reports provided by the grantees include information on the geographic distribution, sorted by zip
code, of the recipients of the services.
Dr. Raju provided a brief overview of request number 6; this was a request to execute a contract with Global
Healthcare Exchange, for an electronic data interchange software solution. He stated that this item was
absolutely essential for running a health care system. Ms. Besenhofer noted that the implementation of the
system will provide checks and balances in the supply chain process that do not currently exist; for example, the
process will provide for a segregation of duties between ordering and receiving, to reduce the likelihood of
fraud. Dr. Raju indicated that, initially when a software program for this purpose was being considered, it was
thought that the System should wait until the County selects and implements an Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) system; however, the System cannot defer on this important management tool for the two to three year
timeframe that is anticipated for the County to select and implement an ERP system.
Director Golden, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved the approval of request numbers 1
through 13, with the exception of request number 10, under the Contracts and
Procurement Items and Supplemental Contract and Procurement Item. THE MOTION
CARRIED.
Chairman Carvalho abstained and voted PRESENT on request numbers 1, 4 and 12.

III. Action Items (continued)
C. Supplemental Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #2)
This item was considered concurrently with Item III(B).
D. Approval of Transfer of Funds requests (Attachment #3)
Kimberly Velasquez, Interim System Director of Budget, presented the request for approval of a transfer of
funds for the Committee’s consideration.
Director Golden, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved the approval of the transfer of
funds request. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
E. Any items listed under Sections III and IV
F. Proposed Academic Affiliation Agreements (Attachment #4)
John O’Brien, MD, System Chair of Planning, Education and Research, presented the requests for the
Committee’s consideration.
Following discussion, it was determined that the transmittal for request number 4 should not reference
subspecialists; this agreement only pertains to residents. The previous agreement included a UIC colo-rectal
attending physician; however, Dr. O’Brien stated that the proposed agreement does not include the provision for
a subspecialist.
Director Golden, seconded by Director Ramirez, moved to approve request numbers 1
through 4, under the Proposed Academic Affiliation Agreements. THE MOTION
CARRIED.
Director Muñoz voted PRESENT on request numbers 1 through 4
IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Notification of Emergency Purchases
There were no Emergency Purchases for the Committee to review.

B. Financial Reports through March 2012 (Attachment #5)
Dorothy Loving, Executive Director of Finance, presented the Financial Reports through March 2012. The
Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Ramirez, seconded by Director Golden, moved to accept the Financial
Reports through March 2012. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Report from Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #6)
A. Update on Revenue Cycle Initiatives
B. Financial Dashboard
C. CareLink Policy
John Cookinham, System Interim Chief Financial Officer, presented his report. The Committee reviewed and
discussed the information.
During the discussion of the update on the CareLink Policy, Chairman Carvalho noted that he was puzzled by the
residency number as reflected in the report; for decades, the percentage of patients that reside outside of Cook County
has been estimated to be approximately 5%. In the report, the number of patients who were denied enrollment into
CareLink due to residency was 100 out of 33,000 persons screened, which is .3%; Chairman Carvalho asked whether
the 5% number has been inaccurate for years, or whether the variance was due to a change in how the System
confirms residency. Mr. Cookinham responded that those people who are not residents of the County may not have
made applications for CareLink. The number of 33,000 represents those people who submitted a formal application.
Mr. Cookinham noted that those patients who are not County residents will end up receiving a self-pay statement;
these patients include those who do not qualify for Medicaid or Medicare, and who have not applied or who are not
being processed for Carelink. He stated that he can provide information on the number of patients in that category.
Additionally, he stated that he can provide information on the number of dollars that the System places with a
collection agency each month. Mr. Cookinham was asked to confirm that our practices are in compliance with Illinois
law on charity care.
Chairman Carvalho noted that, at the end of the year, CareLink should be re-evaluated, to see how it is working; if
necessary, some of the parameters could be adjusted.
During the presentation of information in the Financial Dashboard (on page 11 of the report), Board Chairman Batts
asked for a clearer definition of ”non-productive.” Mr. Cookinham responded that non-productive dollars represent
those dollars paid to employees for holiday, vacation, sick and bereavement time off.
Chairman Carvalho noted that, given the scheduled holidays and sick/vacation time allotted for each employee, there
is a structural non-productive time built-in; therefore, the portion above and beyond the structural non-productive time
is that which may be manageable. He inquired whether the structural non-productive time could be conveyed;
management should be focusing on the manageable part, as the structural part is not within their authority to change
or influence, beyond the enforcement of compliance with policies and procedures on the usage of this time accrued.
The Committee discussed the information provided in the Financial Dashboard relating to volume and Medicaid
application inventory. Chairman Carvalho asked whether management has determined the correlation, if any,
between the volume numbers and Medicaid application inventory numbers. Mr. Cookinham stated that he can
provide information on the days in revenue outstanding by payer; if either one of those numbers is going up or going
down, that provides a better reflection of how the System is being effective. Dr. Raju noted that the number of
Medicaid applications submitted by Chamberlin Edmonds & Associates remains the same; however, the methodology
was changed a little bit, to concentrate on the inpatient side.

V.

Report from Chief Financial Officer (continued)
The Committee briefly discussed the activities related to the Sponsored Programs; Dr. Terry Mason, System Chief
Medical Officer, stated that both Corporate Compliance and Internal Audit have been engaged to do a full analysis of
every grant. As it is anticipated that reports from this analysis will go back through the Audit and Compliance
Committee, Chairman Carvalho stated that review of this information would not also need to be done by the Finance
Committee.

VI. Adjourn
As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman Carvalho declared the meeting ADJOURNED.

Respectfully submitted,

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:

Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX) is a best in class industry leader in e-procurement business solution
technologies ranking top 5 in five procurement categories according to the Gartner Market and Landscape study.
This GHX solution will enable to have visibility into purchases and pricing at the line item level. The software
will allow to requisition and send orders electronically and will also identify and reconcile price discrepancies.
Not only will be able to send orders out electronically, but invoices will be received electronically as well.

The yearly supply spend is approximately $66miilion. This spend can be reduced significantly if 
had a system in place that ensures contract pricing is being utilized and purchase amounts are being monitored.
Similar facilities see upwards of about 15% reduction in supply expense after complete implementation. Currently
only about 20% of purchases are actually tied back to a contracted price which indicates that 80% of our purchases
are using inflated and/or list pricing. The GHX Business Solution suite will enable to collect, monitor, report,
and compare necessary data for the purpose of reducing total supply expense and reporting KPls. In addition, GHX
will help with building an accurate Item Master and will provide a contract database management system to house all
contracts. GHX will seamlessly integrate with the ERP system as well as offer a comprehensive
solution for optimizing staff productivity, improving processes and implementing technology throughout the entire
supply chain. This solution will help move toward improved margins, while significantly reducing costs, and
focusing on our core competencies in delivering exceptional patient care. The anticipated return on investment over
3 years is approximately $6.5million with a payback of about 2 to 1.

This is a new contract to purchase 3 additional SAP Licenses, 57 UPS Batteries, and 50 Wireless Access Points

from through GPO.

    
     
 

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
The additional SAP Licenses are required due to increased utilization within Cerner Power Insight, and Siemens
DSS, which are clinical and financial warehouses. The functionality queries data from both finance and clinical
systems to extract and report data for leadership of this organization and to outside regulatory agencies.

    
    

UPS Batteries are needed for electric protection of the new Cisco network equipment installed in the Stroger
Hospital during the last quarter of 201 1. It is imperative that the network equipment remain protected at all times
for ensured functionality, failure prevention, and compliance with our service agreement.

 
     
 

Wireless Access Points are necessary to complete the wireless upgrade project started in 2011. The units in the
Hektoen, Administration and Provident Hospital buildings will be deployed to replace the existing wireless infra?

structure, which has fallen out of support and is at end of life.

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities and financial activities for the month ended March 31, 2012.
This discussion focuses on the significant financial issues and major financial activities
during the current month. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
financial statements of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Collectively, these entities provide primary,
intermediate, acute, and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to
pay. The Bureau of Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy
activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2010 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners approved Vision 2015 Strategic Plan, which outlines, over five years,
restructuring CCHHS to deliver the best possible care for the vulnerable population of
Cook County within the constraints of dollar resources available to the health system.
This plan seeks to better allocate resources.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the four months with overall
revenue of $297,286 and overall expenses was $304,313.
Net Patient revenue for the four months was $196,971.
5
Page 51 of 92

 Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $2,127. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
General
As compared to November 30, 2011, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
March-2012 increased by 19 days of revenue (or 12.3%). There were 154 days of
revenue (charges) outstanding at November 30, 2011 and 173 days outstanding at the end
of March-2012. The increase in this figure is due in part to the fact that the internal bill
hold on Out-Patient accounts was reduced from 20 days to 6 days and in part to the fact
that billed accounts grew by $75.149M (21.2%). The 173 days of revenue outstanding
decreased by 4 days as compared to February-2012.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of March-2012 decreased by
$11.039M (52.1%) as compared the November 30, 2011 balance. This amount is also
less than the previous month’s balance by $0.149M (1.5%). These items taken together
indicate an increasing number of accounts are moving to a “Billed” status.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS on the
6
Page 52 of 92

 diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs will not result in actual cash collections.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of March-2012 increased by $43.448M (or 22.5%).
This amount is less than the previous month’s balance by $10.313M (4.2%). This
decrease also decreased CCHHS’ days in revenue outstanding.
The decrease in this number indicates more accounts had the collection process
completed than both the previous month. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity
care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays on a per-diem and Medicare pays on the diagnosis, regardless of charges
on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and bad debt write-offs will not result
in actual cash collections.

Outpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts decreased by $0.878M (3.9%) by the end of
March-2012, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2011.
The change in this figure indicates more patient bills were moved to a “Billed” status, as
compared to November 30, 2011. Part of the increase in this figure is due the reduction
of the internal bill hold from 20 days to 6 days.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of March-2012 rose by $31.701M
(19.7%) over the balance as of November 30, 2011. This figure is only slightly greater
than the previous month’s balance by $0.051M (0.0%).
The growth in this figure indicates a greater number of Out-Patient accounts were moved
to a “Billed” status and a reduced number of Out-Patient accounts had collection and
write-off related activities completed as compared to November 30, 2011. Part of this
increase is due to the fact that the internal bill hold on Out-Patient accounts was reduced
from 20 days to 6 days.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

Salaries and Wages - $162.913M
Benefits - $47.750M
Supplies - $30.368M
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $37.915M
Depreciation - $11.147M
Utilities - $2.314M
Insurance - $11.905M
Nonoperating Revenue was $98.188M. The largest portions of this are attributed to sales
tax in the amount of $47.692M and property tax in the amount of $26.332M.
Sales tax revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the
underlying sales transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois Sales Tax represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet
received from the state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales
transaction to the receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are
comprised of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

The Medicaid fee-for-service revenue through the IGT covers the period beginning week ended 02/22/2012 - 03/14/2012 .
Vendor Payments From Revenue are payments out of revenue posted by the County Comptroller. Pharmacy Billing and Revenue Enhancement
payments are reductions to Medicaid revenue. Collection Agency payments are reductions to Self-Pay (Other) revenue.
The Upper Payment Limit Revision is spread over 11 months, beginning Jan-2012, as it is not known in which month this payment will be received.
Included in the "Revenue Enhancement" total is a payment to the state for supplemental workers hired to help clear the Medicaid backlog.
The "Medicaid Retroactive Payment" was budgeted all at SHCC.

in our service area about how to apply for CareLink and attract
more patients to the system.
• CareLink will provide data about the level of charity care
provided by the system.
