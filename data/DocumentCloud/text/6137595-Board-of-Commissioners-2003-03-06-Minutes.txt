LETTER

Transmitting a Communication, February 2003 from
MIKE QUIGLEY, County Commissioner
Re: Litigation involving the Sheriff
Over the course of the past few years, members of the Litigation Subcommittee of the Cook County
Board Finance Conunittee have grown increasingly frustrated by ongoing payouts to victims of brutality
and excessive force at the hands of Cook County Sheriffs Deputies. While a certain measure of litigation
is always inevitable, some of the outrageous fact patterns in the suits against the Sheriff's Department add
to the Commissioners' sense that oversight and accountability at the Sheriff's Department is lacking.
Lack of Internal Oversight
There have been 47 cases against the Sheriff's Department in the last four years involving misconduct. In
24 of these cases, the Sheriff's Office did not even conduct an internal investigation into the veracity of
the allegations. In other law enforcement agencies, the Chicago Police Department, for example, a
lawsuit against the department automatically triggers an internal inquiry.
Analyses of internal handling of inmate grievances also reveal a lack of follow-up on the part of the
Department. The John Howard Association, our court-appointed monitor of conditions at the jail, noted
in 200 I that from January 2000, to November 2000, only 61.2% of inmate grievances filed ever received
responses. From December 2000 to February 2001, 54.9 % received responses. Inmate grievances are
relevant to the discussion of conditions at the jail, but also are useful for demonstrating trends. Numerous
grievances filed against a particular guard, for example, may suggest a need for retraining and/or
discipline. Such steps cannot be taken if the grievances are never even looked at or investigated. A more
responsive inmate grievance process should, in the long run, lead to less litigation.

749

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 6, 2003

The litigation payouts and the department's repetitive failure to conduct internal investigations suggest
that Cook County should conduct an independent investigation into the Sheriff's Department to analyze
the recurring nature of these incidents and the Department's handling of them. The L.A. County Board of
Supervisors called for such a study in the early 90's and has seen significant improvements in the
Department's handling of force cases ever since.

Reform of the L.A. County Sheriff's Department
Background
After four controversial shootings in Los Angeles by the Los Angeles Sheriffs Department (LASD) in the
summer of 1991 , the L.A. County Supervisors appointed a judge (Judge Kolts) to lead an inquiry into
brutality complaints. Judge Kolts appointed attorney Merrick Bobb to lead the inquiry into the LASD.
He in tum, assembled a staff of more than 60 lawyers, certified public accountants, and academics, plus a
psychologist, a newspaper editor and others to conduct a thorough inquiry. The inquiry took six months
and involved the review of thousands of pages of records. In addition, the county held three public
hearings, one in each of three field operation regions. The county sent out press releases about the
hearings and held the hearings in county parks so that the atmosphere was open and non-threatening. The
team took testimony from over 60 individuals and organizations. The entire inquiry lasted for six months.
In July 1992, the team released the result of the inquiry, also known as the "Kolts Report." It is a
comprehensive, intensive analysis of virtually every aspect of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. The
team reviewed the Department's recruitment, training and continuing education efforts. They evaluated
every complaint filed against any member of the Department over a five-year period, from complaints
deemed "unfounded" to cases that went to jury verdicts at trial. The team analyzed the feelings and
attitudes of the community members towards the members of the Department, and surveyed the members
of the Department regarding their attitudes towards their jobs and their morale. A review of stress
management programs and wellness training provided by the Department was undertaken. The Kolts
team also reviewed many other aspects of the Department, with a particular focus on the Department's
internal disciplinary scheme and its accountability to the public.
While the resulting 358-page Kolts Report is the product of an intensive analysis of the entire L.A.
Sheriffs Department culture, for the benefit of the County Board, the following is an overview of how the
team analyzed litigation against the Department and the team's recommendations in that regard.

L.A. County's analysis of civil litigation
Cost Analysis
The Kolts team reviewed force and force-related cases that fell into two categories. In one category, the
team evaluated entire case files of force cases against L.A. County that either settled or resulted in
verdicts of over $20,000 over a five-year period. The team did not include false arrest or failure to treat
cases in this analysis unless those cases also included an excessive force component. During this time
frame, I 04 cases settled and 20 cases resulted in verdicts. The litigation during this timeframe cost the
county a total of $18,037,789.
In the second category, the team reviewed summary memoranda of cases that settled or resulted m
verdicts of $20,000 or less.

750

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 6, 2003

After assessing the files, the team put together a monthly cost analysis. This analysis revealed that
excessive force cases were costing L.A. County an estimated $377,877 a month, not including the costs of
litigation.
Pattern Analysis
The Kolts team next analyzed every imaginable variable in each case file to determine what discernible
patterns evolved. The case analyses revealed two major categories of cases: I) assaults and batteries
(75% of cases) and 2) shootings (23% of cases).
The team then compiled a detailed review of what patterns evolved in each of these two categories. After
a study of all cases, they discovered that the cases involving assault and battery followed a number of
patterns:
1) assaults on citizens during minor arrests, for crimes such as traffic violations
2) assaults on citizens during arrests for more serious violations such as drug sales
3) assaults on innocent citizens mistakenly identified by the police or innocent bystanders at scenes
of crimes committed by others
4) assaults on party goers
5) assaults on inmates at the jail
The team noted in each case the number of deputies and victims involved and the size and weight of the
deputies versus the victims. They discovered that in many cases the deputies outnumbered and
outweighed the victims, a factor that clearly weighed in favor of the victims at trial.
The team conducted a similarly thorough analysis of all officer-involved shootings, compiling trends and
patterns ranging from what types of situations generally lead to shootings ultimately to how many victims
had weapons at the time to etc.
Patterns in arrest results
After composing the breakdown of what types of cases generally ended in force-related litigation, the
Kolts team examined whether or not the victims were generally arrested and in cases in which the victim
was arrested, the disposition of their case. For example, in quite a few cases involving deputy assaults
upon citizens, the arrestees were never even charged with a crime. This weighed in favor of the victims
(plaintiffs) at trial. Excessive force used on a victim that is then not even accused of breaking the law is
more egregious to juries.
Many more victims were charged only with crimes that related to an altercation with the Sheriff's
deputies. For example, many plaintiffs did not do anything wrong other than get into an argument or
verbal dispute with an arresting officer. Many times these arguments escalated into physical altercations
in which too much force was used. These victims were typically charged with obstruction, resisting, or
battery on the arresting officer. Few of these cases resulted in guilty verdicts against the plaintiffs.

Results of all investigations done by the Department
All personnel files of every deputy involved in every complaint
The discipline imposed on the involved deputies

75 1

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 6, 2003

Findings
By looking carefully at which force cases resulted in punitive damages, the team identified three major
factors that generally lead to large settlements or jury verdicts for plaintiffs:
1) the severity of the victims injuries, in particular, broken bones, knocked out teeth or any type of
head injury;
2) whether the department filed charges against the plaintiff in connection with the incident
3) the existence of witness testimony

Resulting Recommendations from the LA Study
The team's principal recommendations were that:
1) Although discovery in civil suits produces a great deal of data about policies and procedures and
background and training of officers, it is not compiled or used in the future for analysis suits should be
used as a management tool. The Sheriffs Department should implement a department-wide force
tracking and early warning system to monitor which deputies are prone to using more force than is
necessary. The system should compile lawsuits, internal reports and citizen complaints. The
circumstances that lead to potential violence are predictable if the information is tracked and utilized.
The compiling of this information can also help the department recognize potential "problem officers"
and demonstrate which officers need retraining. All information obtained during the course of civil
litigation or via the internal investigation process should be shared with the management level employees
so that they can revise policy and procedure accordingly. In addition, all information should be used to
increase the frequency and severity of disciplinary measures.
2) The Sheriffs Department should vigorously prosecute disciplinary cases and refrain from mitigating
the discipline during the hearing process.
3) Any excessive force complaint lodged should be included in an officer's personnel file, even if it is
found " unsubstantiated." The results of any actual litigation should also be included in the file, including
the amount of any verdict or settlement and any witness testimony. This will help the department identify
patterns of behavior. Even if a deputy has unsubstantiated complaints in his file, if there are numerous
similar complaints, this could indicate a need for retraining.
4) The department should compare how many internal investigations resulted in findings of
"unsubstantiated" or "unfounded" but then later went on to involve jury verdicts or settlements.
5) Additional training should be provided to those officers that demonstrate any violent tendency.
6) Strict discipline should be meted out to those that fail to report fellow officers' dangerous conduct or
those that cover up such behavior.
L.A. Department Improvements
Since the release of the Kolts Report, officer involved shootings have continued to drop, meaning fewer
civilians and officers have been killed. In Fiscal Year 1992, 93, before the Kolts Report, the Department
had 381 force-related cases pending against it. The Department's overall docket of force-related cases is
down to less than 100. Also in FY92-93, the number of new force-related cases served on the Department
was 88. This fiscal year it is at 32. In FY92-93, the L.A. County paid out approximately $ 18 million in
force-related verdicts or settlements. That figure is now down to slightly more than $2 million a year.

752

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 6, 2003

Continuing Follow-Up
After the release of the Kolts Repo1t, the L.A. County Board appointed the lead attorney on the team as
permanent special counsel to continue to evaluate the Department and its progress in implementing the
recommendations outlined in the report.
As special counsel, Mr. Bobb is given wide access to
department records, files, and interviews with employees. Since 1992, he has submitted semi-annual
reports.
L.A. and Cook County
There are many similarities between the duties of the L.A. County Sheriff and our Cook County Sheriff.
For example, the LASO operates and maintains all the county's jail facilities. The L.A. Sheriff is also
responsible for transporting inmates from the jail to court and providing security for the courts. LASO
enforces the laws in unincorporated L.A. County.
In addition, the L.A. County Sheriff is an elected official elected every four years. The L.A. Board, like
our Cook County Board, controls the budget of the Sheriff.
Applicability to Cook County
The Kolts Report is very instructive on the issue of how to thoroughly analyze every dimension of a
particular department and use that information as a learning tool to promote reform. While many specific
issues that concerned L.A. County do not apply to our Sheriffs Department here in Cook County, there
are a few basic recommendations that can be applied here and would help promote the same type of
reflection and reform efforts that worked well in L.A.
Aggressive Internal Investigations
All litigation against the Sheriff should prompt an internal investigation. This is the rule in the Chicago
Police Department and in the L.A. County Sheriffs Department. All witnesses should be interviewed
and all medica l evidence should be considered in determining the veracity of the allegations. Officers
should be encouraged to report abuse and should be punished for failing to report abuse or for noncooperation with an investigation.
Learning from mistakes
Each individual case or complaint should not be treated in a vacuum. The discovery process in civi l suits
produces a wealth of data about internal policies and procedures in the Department. This information
should not be merely filed away once the case is settled or reaches a verdict. The infornrntion and
knowledge gleaned from these suits should be reviewed by the Department and the Litigation
Subcommittee and used to identify flawed or outdated policies and areas for improvement.
Responsive Grievance Process
Inmate grievances are relevant to the discussion of conditions at the j ail, but also are useful for
demonstrating trends. Numerous grievances filed against a guard, may suggest a need for retraining
and/or discipline. Such steps cannot be taken if the grievances are never even looked at or investigated.
A more responsive inmate grievance process should, in the long run, lead to less litigation.

753

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 6, 2003
Early Warning System
Our Sheriffs Department can also develop a department-wide tracking and "early warning system" to
monitor which deputies are prone to using more force than is necessary. The system should track any and
all officers involved in lawsuits, internal proceedings and investigations and citizen complaints. The
circumstances that lead to potential violence are predictable if the information is tracked and utilized.
The compiling of this information can also help the department recognize potential "problem officers"
and demonstrate which officers need retraining, or progressive discipline. For example, there is no reason
why the Litigation Subcommittee should be considering lawsuits involving officers with 40 Internal
Affairs investigations in their employment history. An accurate tracking system would help to prevent
these situations in the future.
Conclusion
The Cook County Board should consider hiring an outside, objective monitor to conduct the same type of
thorough analysi that L.A. County successfully conducted. The monitor should be given wide access to
department records, files, and interviews with employees and should submit regular reports to the
Litigation Subcommittee on the progress of the Department.
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the communication be referred
to the Committee on Finance. (Comm. No. 258067). The motion carried unanimously.

INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF ALLEGED
COOK COUNTY JAIL INMATE ABUSE
WHEREAS, it is public policy and practice of the President and the Board of Commissioners to protect

and
WHEREAS, there has been considerable court litigation, reports, publications and public demonstrations
about alleged excessive use of force and abuse by law enforcement officials and gang activities within

WHEREAS, to maintain integrity of the Cook County Jail System it is necessary that an investigation be
conducted by an independent body which has no past or present ties with the criminal justice system in
Cook County: such as universities and law schools which are more cost effective, labor intensive, and
could shorten the completion time of the investigation.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County authorize the commission of an independent investigation of the Cook County Jail System by a
university or law school through the RFP process, and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the RFP process clearly defines the scope of services to be
rendered which shall include but are not limited to protecting the confidentiality of all interviewees, a
clearly defined plan to minimize disruptions of day-to-day operations, and a time certain for completion.

lnSight Automated Records Management System provides a solution for effective
information creation, distribution, tracking, storage, protection and disposition in accordance
with regulated record-keeping requirements. INI developed InSight Automated Records
Management System to assist organizations undertaking workflow analysis, re-engineering

the installation of the proprietary software lnSight Automated Records Management System
which has not been installed. She will examine the more than 150 different file jackets now
used in the Circuit Clerk's Office to determine if fewer custom jackets and even stock jackets
can be used in certain applications, potentially leading to significant cost savings. Ms. Pollitt
will address the use of color code to aid in filing, retrieval and interfiling with potential
savings in staff time. And, lastly, Ms. Pollitt will provide recommendations for the use of
barcodes to track the files.

Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"), and with
such other revisions in text as the President or the Chief Financial Officer executing the same shall
determine are necessary or desirable in connection with the exclusion from gross income for federal

or the Chief Financial Officer shall be deemed conclusive evidence of the approval of the County Board
to the terms provided in the Arbitrage Agreement.
