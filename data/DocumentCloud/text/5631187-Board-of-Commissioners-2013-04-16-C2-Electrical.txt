Court of Cook County on May 22, 2013 to con?rm that a contract has been issued to perform the
work needed to correct the various Code violations issued to the CHA based on the temporary
electrical repairs. Due to the long lead time needed to order the bus duct materials, it is necessary
that the CHA issue the contract to Burling Builders, Inc. prior to the April 16, 2013 Board
meeting so that the installation work can be started before the May 22nd Court date.

Lincoln Perry Apartments is a nine (9) story tall building, containing two hundred sixty-seven
(267) dwelling units, completed in 1973 and located at 3245 South Prairie Avenue.
