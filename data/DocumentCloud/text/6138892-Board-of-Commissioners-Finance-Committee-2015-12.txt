e.

A request for a new vehicle which increases the number of vehicles in the department's vehicle
inventory shall be submitted to the Vehicle Steering Committee with a written justification as to why
the additional vehicles will be required. Such request must demonstrate that reassignment of existing
vehicles would be unable to meet department needs and that sufficient funding is available for both

state the use intended for the vehicle, whether the vehicle will be assigned with "take-home"
privileges and whether the vehicle will bear a municipal license plate.
