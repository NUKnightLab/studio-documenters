LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT MEMORANDUM
Renita Johnson City of Detroit
Wayne County Circuit Court Case No. 17-012314-CD
File No. W17-00188

Plaintiff?s Attorney: Barry Fagan
Defendants? Attorneys: Kevin Campbell of the Allen Law Group, PC.

 

 

 

FACTUAL BACKGROUND:

In 1999, the City hired Plaintiff, Renita Johnson as an Assistant Corporation Counsel in
the Contracts section of its Law Department (?Department?). Her responsibilities included
communicating with and counseling clients (various City departments), preparing and negotiating
contracts, and managing relationships with outside counsel. In time, Plaintiff attained senior
counsel status and, in this role, the City expected her to work on ?dif?cult and specialized? contract
assignments.

On or about March 2017, Plaintiff received an assignment to amend a Memorandum of
Agreement between the City of Detroit Transportation Department and Downtown Detroit
Partnership. Plaintiff refused to do the assignment. On April 7, 2017, Plaintiff received an
assignment to compare a proposed contract with the City?s proposed draft and identify any
differences in terms. Plaintiff again failed to complete the assignment. On April 10, 2017, Plaintiff
received an assignment to work on a contract between DOIT and ERSI. Plaintiff failed to complete
the assignment, which was reassigned to another attorney.

On May 22, 2017, Plaintiff received a three-day suspension for her repeated acts of
insubordination.

On May 26, 2017, Plaintiff returned to work. Plaintiff received an assignment to negotiate
a memorandum of understanding and guide the action of stakeholders. More than a week later,
Plaintiff provided an insuf?cient memorandum that was contrary to the client?s intent.
Subsequently, Plaintiff refused to draft a memorandum as instructed. Plaintiff was informed that
further insubordination would result in her termination.

On June 7, 2017, Plaintiff circulated a letter to her supervisors Kimberly James, Pamela
Parrish, Charles Raimi, and Butch Hollowell and Attorney Deborah Gordon, wherein she
claimed that her three-day suspension was retaliatory. According to Plaintiff 3 letter. the City
suspended her in March because she refused to draft the Bike Share amendment ?at the request of

SETTLEMENT MEMORANDUM PRIVILEGED and CONFIDIENTIAL
RE: Renita Johnson City of Detroit ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION

February 7, 2019
Page 2

 

an opposing party.? Plaintiff alleged her supervisor asked her to perform assignments in violation
of MRPC 1.1 (?Competence?), in addition to unspeci?ed provisions of the City Charter and Code.

On June 19, 2017, Plaintiff requested and was granted FMLA leave. She returned to work
on July 6, 2017.

On July 6, 2017, the City convened a disciplinary meeting with Plaintiff. At the meeting,
the City formally issued her a thirty-day suspension with a recommendation for termination
because of her insubordination and the futility of corrective discipline.

Plaintiff ?led a lawsuit alleging that she was terminated in violation of the Whistleblower
Protection Act and further that her termination violated the Family Medical Leave Act
public policy, and her First Amendment Rights.


I. WPA Claim

A plaintiff must establish a prima facie case by demonstrating that (1) he or she was
engaged in a protected activity as defined by the WPA, (2) he or she was subsequently discharged
or discriminated against, and (3) a causal connection existed between the protected activity and
the adverse employment action.

To establish her claim, Plaintiff must demonstrate that she engaged in protected activity
that is protected by the WPA. As a threshold matter, she would need to Show that MRPC 1.1 is a
?law or regulation or rule promulgated pursuant to law of this state, a political subdivision of this
state, or the United States to a public pursuant to MCL 15.362. The Michigan Supreme
Court adopted MRPC 1.1 by its Order of October 1, 1988, and paragraph of the rule provides
that lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client? and shall not ?handle a legal
matter which the lawyer knows or should know that the lawyer is not competent to handle, without
associating with a lawyer who is competent to handle it.?

Plaintiff will argue that MRPC 1.1 is a rule promulgated by the Michigan Supreme Court.
She will further argue that when she reported the alleged violation of MRPC. 1.1 was a protected
activity under MRPC. She will further argue that after the reporting of the alleged violation of
MRPC 1.1 on June 7, 2017 that she was terminated on July 6, 2017.

Plaintiff will be able to meet the second prong as she was terminated. Plaintiff will use the
short time frame between the alleged reporting and the termination to establish causation.

II. Public Policy Retaliation Claim

While Plaintiff does allege a retaliation claim in violation of public policy, this claim is
likely to be dismissed because it is preempted by the WPA. r. Neogen Corn, 292 Mich.
App. 626, 633', 808 804 [2011) {?The WPA provides the exclusive remedy for such

LL11 a .9 9

SETTLEMENT MEMORANDUM and CONFIDIENTIAL
RE: Renita Johnson City of Detroit ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION

February 7, 2019
Page 3

 

retaliatory discharge and consequently preempts common-law public-policy claims arising from
the same activity?) Further, Plaintiff?s retaliation claim should fail because it is barred by

governmental immunity.

If Plaintiff?s claim of retaliation in violation of Public Policy is not dismissed, then the City
will either have to appeal the decision or proceed to trial on the issue.

FMLA Interference and Retaliation Claims

To prove that the City ?discriminated or retaliated against [her] because [s]he took leave,?
Plaintiff must establish that [s]he engaged in an activity protected by the Act; (2) that this
exercise of [her] protected rights was known to the defendant; (3) that defendant thereafter took
an, employment action adverse to [Plaintiff]; and (4) that there was a causal connection between
the protected activity and the adverse employment action.? Arban v. West Publ?g Corp, 345 F.3d
390, 404 (6th Cir. 2003).

Plaintiff will be able to show that she engaged in protected activity because she did take
FMLA leave. She will be able to show that the City of Detroit was aware of her FMLA leave.
She will be able to show that she was terminated after taking FMLA leave.

While not likely, there is a chance that Plaintiffs FMLA claim would survive a motion for
summary and proceed to trial. She would likely rely on the close temporal proximity of her FMLA
leave and her discharge to show causation.

IV. First Amendment Retaliation

The First Amendment protects a public employee from retaliation for her speech if the
speech may be fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern" and her
interest in that speech is not outweighed by "the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting
the ef?ciency of the public services it performs." Connick v. Myers, 461 US 138, 142 (1983). To
constitute speech on a matter of public concern, the court ?must be able to fairly characterize the
expression as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community." Rahn
v. Drake Center, Inc, 31 F.3d 407, 412 (6th Cir. 1994).

Plaintiff will argue that her reporting of the alleged MRPC 1.1 violation was a matter of
public concern and that based on that Speech, she was terminated.

DAMAGES:

Regarding alleged economic damages, Plaintiff earned $90,366.90 at the time of her
termination. Therefore, her alleged backpay as of January 3, 2019, was approximately $135,550.
Plaintiff was also seeking future economic loss and non-economic loss. Additionally, Plaintiff has
not secured other employment and would argue to the jury damages in excess of one million
dollars. Plaintiff would also be able to seek attorney fees and costs. In a jury trial, Plaintiff would
try to elicit sympathy as a ?wronged? 20 year employee.

The parties engaged in Court ordered facilitation. The parties reached an agreement that

- Plaintiff would receive $185,000.00;
The lawsuit would be dismissed with prejudice, without costs/attorney fees.

Further, in the event this matter proceeds to trial, and Plaintiff prevails Defendants
are found responsible), and if the economic expert is to be believed, then the judgment by the Jury
could easily be 1n excess of the $185,.000 00 settlement agreement

We therefore, respectfully request that this Honorable Body authorize the acceptance of
the Settlement Agreement.

COUNCIL PRESIDENT BRENDA JONES

MEMORANDUM

TO: David Whitaker, Director
Legislative Policy Division
CC: Honorable Colleagues
Louise Jones, Senior City Clerk
FROM: Council President Brenda Iones (5 Qg
DATE: February 19, 2019
RE: Resolution Request

 

The requirement of bond insurance for construction jobs over $50,000 is limiting the
abilities of the small Detroit?based contracts to bid on City of Detroit contracts. I am
requesting LPD draft a resolution urging the State Legislature amend the current law to
enhance access to contracting opportunities for small contractors.
