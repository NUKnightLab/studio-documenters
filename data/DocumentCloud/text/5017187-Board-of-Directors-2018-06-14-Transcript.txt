Good evening.

 Report of Proceedings - June 14, 2018

1

here tonight to speak about three issues.

I've

2

been in this community for over 45 years.

I've

3

had the pleasure of attending over hundreds of

4

board meetings, CAPS meetings for one of the

5

state representatives from the areas of North

6

Avenue and Wells, all the way to the area of

7

67th and Cottage Grove back in 2004.

8

very familiar with what's going on here, at the

9

CAPS meetings from the north side to the south

So I am

10

side.

11

find out -- I see that you don't have the other

12

members that were part of the entity of the

13

Chicago Police Department.

14

out how are the members that's here now, the

15

Board, can I find out today how they are

16

elected or who brought them in to be part of

17

this new procedure?

18
19
20

But today I'm here because I want to

PRESIDENT FOREMAN:

I wanted to find

So the -- I'm not

really clear.
MS. WATKINS:

I'm not confused, but I'm

21

wondering that you have new board members.

22

What happened to the other members -- the other

23

organizations that were outside entities that

24

were part of -- on the Chicago Police
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

8

 Report of Proceedings - June 14, 2018

1

Department, the independent Police Board, all

2

those people, are they still there?

3

PRESIDENT FOREMAN:

Okay.

So what was

4

formally known as IPRA, the Independent Police

5

Review Authority, is now -- that ceased to

6

exist, and now there is a new entity, COPA.

7

And, Sidney, I don't know if you want to

8

explain COPA.

9

administrator.

10

Sidney Roberts is the chief

MS. ROBERTS:

Yes.

COPA proceded IPRA in

11

September of 2017.

12

over primary responsibility of investigating

13

police shootings, Taser discharges, allegations

14

of excessive force, 4th Amendment violations,

15

some of the more egregious abuses of police

16

power.

17

In that regard, we took

That's now investigated by COPA.

PRESIDENT FOREMAN:

So if you look on the

18

Chicago Police Board's website, there's a video

19

that kind of explains the process of how cases

20

come to the Chicago Police Board.

21

investigates misconduct, allegations of

22

misconduct.

23

charges to the Superintendent.

24

if found appropriate, come to the Police Board,

They review it.

COPA

They send those
Those charges,

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 Report of Proceedings - June 14, 2018

1

and the Police Board makes a decision.

2

one route.

3

That's

The other route is the Bureau of

4

Internal Affairs within the Chicago Police

5

Department, they review misconduct, internal

6

misconduct from the police officers.

7

find that those allegations are -- they find

8

enough evidence that it needs to proceed, they

9

send those charges to the Police Board.

10

There's a hearing.

11

at that point make a decision.

12

16

If they

The Police Board will then

So I'm not really clear if I
answered your question.
MS. WATKINS:

Exactly.

Everything I wanted

to know about that, I just found out.
I've been hearing about COPA, but

17

I did not understand that and who they were.

18

So that's why I'm here tonight.

19

Can I ask another question?

20

PRESIDENT FOREMAN:

21

MS. WATKINS:

Yes, ma'am.

One thing I would like to do

22

is make a comment.

I believe that this is to

23

the new Superintendent.

24

shirts in the community.

We need more white
And I think because,

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

10

 Report of Proceedings - June 14, 2018

1

in my opinion, just working and knowing about

2

the different types of things that's going on,

3

people are more comfortable when they see white

4

shirts.

5

more power, that's more of protection.

6

more servitude.

And I think because they think that's

7
8

And so I think that we should get
more white shirts in the community.

9
10

That's

And one more question if you
don't mind.

11

I also want to find out why

12

can't -- and the reason why I'm bringing this

13

up is, because I'm 60 years of age, and I was

14

one of the first people that started with the

15

CAPS meetings many, many years ago.

16

that there are no relationships with the

17

Chicago Police officers as well as the

18

residents.

19

Chicago police officers are always saying that

20

the people need to be involved.

21

understanding and from what I've seen in the

22

last 30 something years, that the police

23

officers are not like we had back in the '60s.

24

Like Officer Friendly, and they come to the

And I see

And the police officers -- the

But from my

1

schools, you know, they come on the blocks,

2

they speak to you.

3

not doing that, but a lot of them are not.

4

Not all of the officers are

So I think that a solution would

5

be to let the public know -- because I worked

6

in politics for 30 something years.

7

with 30 different organizations here in the

8

City, the state, and I've done a lot of great

9

things here.

I worked

So I know how people operate,

10

what they think and what they want.

And I know

11

people are not here, and maybe because people

12

feel that what is the purpose of me coming to a

13

meeting and the same thing is going to go on.

14

I believe there needs to be not

15

just unity with the people, but unity with the

16

people as well as the Chicago police officers.

PRESIDENT FOREMAN:

Thank you.

this right this time.

MS. EVANGEL YHWHNEWBN:

That was an

excellent try.
Good evening.

Last month I

23

didn't just -- I'd like a transcript copy of my

24

statement, because I didn't just talk about

shooting dogs.

2

officer, and I'm sure he feared for his life,

3

but he shot that dog in the leg, but when it

4

comes to a human being, they always have to

5

shoot them in the head, the back or the chest.

6

And I wanted to know why is that?

7

being does not have the right or privileges of

a dog?

So January 13th, 2017, the

10

Justice Department concluded that Chicago

11

police officers have practices and patterns of

12

violating constitutional rights and using

13

deadly force; that they create situations to

14

use deadly force.

15

happened last Wednesday on 47th and Prairie.

16

group of blacks are standing on the corner, and

17

the police officers come along and shoo them

18

along, which they have a constitutional right

19

to be black and young and stand on the corner

20

or any other part of the block.

21

came and messed with them.

22

That in my opinion is what

But the police

Then they came back at another

23

time and disbursed the crowd.

This time they

24

alleged that a young man, Maurice Grant,

He ran.

Then the crowd comes again when

5

the yellow tape is out, and the police officer

6

disburses them and fires, according to the

7

witnesses, a Taser shot that did not hit

8

anyone.

9

creating situations to use deadly force.

But this is a classic example of

10

And I want to know from the

11

police, will you rein in your officers and

12

remind them that the loitering law was

13

overturned; that people do have a

14

constitutional right to gather on corners

15

without being intimidated, harassed, frisked,

16

messed with, you name it, by armed officers.

17

SUPERINTENDENT JOHNSON:

What I can tell

you from the Police Department perspective,

19

that we value everyone's rights, civil rights,

use-of-force policy.

22

That's why we revised our

And there is a new use-of-force

23

policy which took effect late last year.

I

24

think that will go a long way to minimize use

14

 Report of Proceedings - June 14, 2018

1

of force that's not appropriate.

2

As a matter of fact, the use of

3

force -- the use-of-force policy was put out

4

for public comment, for the citizens of

5

Chicago, as well as the rank and file of police

6

officers had the opportunity to weigh in on the

7

new use-of-force policy.

A lot of those comments we took
to heart, and we put them in the new

So that's one piece of

The second piece is we are right

now in the midst of consent decree negotiations

with the state attorney general.

goes into effect, you will see some additional

16

things put in there, because, you know, any

17

loss of life in the city is a tragedy.

18

And when that

And so as a police department, we

19

only want to use that force if we absolutely

20

have to.
