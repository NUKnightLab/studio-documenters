April 27, 2011

President Richardson-Lowry presented the following statement for the Public Record:

Each year the Chicago Board of Education is required to approve a balanced budget for
the Chicago Public Schools not later than the end of August.

However, the state law requires that the Board of Education approve its property tax levies
by mid December of the previous school year. To ensure Chicago Public Schools has all
available budgetary options available to it to continue quality education for its students,
for the last ten years the Board has approved in December a property tax levy that
increases the potential tax extension up to the limits of the established state law.

However, after developing the preliminary budget estimates, as in many years, the Board
also votes to abate all or part of the increases just as it did in April when it abated the
entire increase leaving CPS levy flat.

For the 2011-2012 school year, the Board supports an abatement of the entire 140 property
tax increase that was approved by the levy resolution last December just as we did last
yeah

The City Mayor, Mayor Daley has also said he opposes any property tax increase for CPS,
and we certainly share his point of view of ensuring that we do not add to the burden of
homeowners as they continue to be challenged by this difficult economic and reduced
property value period.

in the past years, the Board has taken every possible step to reduce operating costs
without impacting students? education, We support continued efforts to utilize new
creative thinking and enhanced efficiencies to address the more than $700 million shortfall
without increasing property taxes.

Just as it is the responsibility of the next Board to craft its own budget for the 2011-2012
school year, they must also determine the level of resources they will utilize, including
whether or not they want to increase resources through increased property taxes.

As it would be inappropriate for this Board to enact a resolution that will in any way limit
or restrict the next Board?s available options to balance its budget, therefore, we do not
approve a property tax abatement before this Board?s service is concluded.

We leave that to the in the good hands of the future leadership of the district and please
consider this above-referenced statement as part of the record for this April 27, 2011 Board of
Education meeting.

OMNIBUS
At the Regular Board Meeting of April 27, 2011 the foregoing motions, reports and other
actions set forth from number 11-0427-M01 through 11-0427-AR14 except as otherwise indicated,

and 11-0427-PR59.

ADJOURNMENT

President Richardson-Lowry moved to adjourn the meeting, and it was so ordered by a
voice vote, all members present voting therefore.

President Richardson-Lowry thereupon declared the Board Meeting adjourned.
