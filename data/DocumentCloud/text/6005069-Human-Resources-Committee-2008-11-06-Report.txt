Mr. Small stated that several of the responses to the requests for information had been loaded into the
shared drive for the Directors to electronically access. Chairman Zopp asked whether Mr. Small had
distributed the finalized job description for the head of human resources. Mr. Small responded that it was
loaded into the shared drive.
Discussion took place on the available options for assistance in compiling the summary of the differences
in discipline and grievance policies between the collective bargaining agreements.
Chairman Zopp stated that from this point forward, there will be a standing agenda item for the Human
Resources Committee to receive updates on the status of recruitment and hiring for senior leadership
positions1.
Mr. Small provided an update of the status of recruiting for some senior leadership positions. He stated
that with regard to using an executive search firm to assist in these efforts, he was informed that a request
for proposals (RFP) must be issued. Chairman Zopp stated that the RFP should include all of the
positions for which external recruitment assistance is needed.
Mr. Small added that he has requested a list of open positions from each of the institutions; he will update
the Committee with that information when it is received2. Additionally, he stated that he will develop
draft job descriptions for the System-wide senior leadership positions and will present these to the
Committee3.
Questions were raised and discussion took place on the recruitment efforts to fill the positions of Chief
Financial Officer for the System and for the Chief Nursing Officer at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of
Cook County. Mr. Small stated that the contract with Pitt Calkin, Interim Chief Financial Officer for the
System, will soon be expiring; Mr. Calkin has indicated that he will stay on if needed.

Discussion with Dr. Jack Raba, Interim System Chief Medical Officer,
regarding creating physician performance metrics, dual employment
and medical staff human resources issues.
Dr. Jack Raba, Interim Chief Medical Officer for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System,
presented information on the subjects of creating physician performance metrics, dual employment and
medical staff human resources issues.
Discussion took place on the information presented. A question was raised by Director Lyne with regard
to stipends (such as those that are academic or drug company-related) received in the course of
performing work-related duties; Dr. Raba stated that he would follow up on the question and report back
to the Committee4. Director Carvalho provided a brief history of the Hektoen Institute of Medicine,
which was a non-profit institution involved in this type of funds and grant management.

The discussion turned to the subject of audit and compliance issues related to grant management. Mr.
Small stated that review of this subject is an area that has been identified as a primary need. He added
that the State’s Attorney’s Office has sent for his review a draft renewal agreement for the relationship
between the System and Hektoen. Director Carvalho stated that this would seem to be an item for
discussion by the Audit Committee, rather than the Finance Committee.
Dr. Raba returned to his presentation of information on dual employment; additional information was
provided on existing productivity standards at the institutions. Dr. Maurice Lemon, Chief Medical
Officer at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, stated that the details of the work plan are key;
he provided an example of a hospitalist whose work plan would be different than that of a physician who
works forty hours per week in outpatient services.
In response to a question that arose regarding the reporting structure of the Chief Medical Officers of the
institutions. Dr. Raba responded that presently, the Chief Medical Officers report to the Chief Operating
Officers of the institutions. However, he added that one of his tasks is to work on a draft table of
organization for the System.
