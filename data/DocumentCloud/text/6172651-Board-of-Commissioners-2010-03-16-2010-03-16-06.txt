ITEM NO. A5

March 10, 2010

RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE AMENDMENT NO. 3 TO CHA’S AMENDED
AND RESTATED MTW AGREEMENT
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve Amendment No. 3 to the Amended
and Restated MTW Agreement, which would allow CHA to count units supported by Project
Based Vouchers (“PBVs”) towards CHA’s stated goal under the Plan for Transformation to
replace or rehabilitate 25,000 units of public housing.
EXPLANATION
Amendment No. 3 to the Amended and Restated MTW Agreement, allows CHA to count units
supported by Project Based Vouchers (“PBVs”) towards CHA’s Plan for Transformation goal to
replace or rehabilitate 25,000 units of public housing. CHA remains committed to the delivery
of 25,000 revitalized public housing units and through Amendment No. 3, seeks to mitigate the
effects that funding shortfalls may have on meeting the unit delivery goals of the Plan.
Amendment No. 3 positions CHA to acquire units through PBVs in other developing or existing
properties, which may have greater diversity in unit, bedroom sizes, and geographic locale. This
strategy better aligns the housing choices available to CHA residents with the needs of current
and prospective residents. Moreover, the location of PBV units are dispersed across the city,
many in opportunity areas, which further assists CHA’s efforts to deconcentrate poverty.
To date, CHA has completed 71% of the 25,000 units required to be replaced or modernized by
rehabilitating, redeveloping, or acquiring units over the course of the Plan. CHA remains
committed to continuing these efforts and delivering more revitalized public housing units each
remaining year of the Plan for Transformation.
