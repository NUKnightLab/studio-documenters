GENERAL BACKGROUND /EXPLANATION
CHA entered into an initial Lease Agreement dated February 5, 2010 with Chicago Christian
Industrial League for approximately 7,544 square feet of space in an office building located at
2750 W. Roosevelt Rd. for the HCV West Regional Office. The Lease commenced on March 1,
2010 for an initial term of three (3) years, with an option to extend for two (2) additional oneyear periods. On July 23, 2010, CHA received a Letter stating that as of March 24, 2010, A Safe
Haven Foundation assumed ownership of the building located at 2750 W. Roosevelt Rd. On
November 20, 2012, the CHA Board of Commissioners reviewed and approved a request to
amend the Lease Agreement with A Safe Haven Foundation to exercise the first one (1) year
extension option. On December 17, 2013, the CHA Board of Commissioners reviewed and
approved a request to exercise the second and last lease extension option.
As the end of the second option year approached, CHA sought a new location for the HCV West
Regional Office. By the time the lease expired at the end of February 2015 CHA had not located
a suitable space that met all its requirements. Subsequent to the lease expiring, CHA approached
A Safe Haven Foundation requesting an additional lease extension, since CHA had not located a
new office space location and knew that it would not be able to vacate the space at the expiration
of the lease. A Safe Haven Foundation indicated that they were not interested in extending the
lease, as they had other plans for the office space. A Safe Haven Foundation understood that
CHA might need more time to locate a new location and permitted CHA to become a “holdover”
tenant commencing March 2015, per the terms of the existing lease.
For the month of March 2015, per the terms of the lease, CHA was required to pay 115% of the
monthly base rent for the second option year (115% of $15,566.54, or $17,901.52). For the
month of April 2015, per the terms of the lease, CHA was required to pay 125% of the monthly
base rent for the second option year (125% of $15,566.54, or $19,458.18). There was also an
additional payment made of $1,051.53 for fees assessed for additional services, per the lease,
for a total amount paid to A Safe Haven Foundation of approximately $38,412.00 during the
“holdover period”.
In early May, A Safe Haven Foundation reached out to CHA and indicated that they were
interested in amending the lease with CHA to cover the time period from May 2015 through
February 2016. A Safe Haven Foundation proposes increasing the base monthly rent by 5% over
the base rent from the second option year ($16,344.87), which is a decrease from the “holdover”
rent that was paid in both March and April. CHA has not paid any rent since the “holdover
period”, so an additional $500.00 is being budgeted to cover any late fees in the event A Safe
Haven Foundation charges such fee to CHA, and another $600.00 is also being budgeted now to
cover any fees for additional services, all per the terms of the current Lease Agreement.
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies.

 The Chief Housing Officer concurs with the recommendation to execute a second amendment to
the lease with A Safe Haven Foundation for the HCV West Regional Office space located at 2750
W. Roosevelt Rd., extending the lease term from May 2015 through February 2016, approving a
5% increase in the base rent to a monthly amount of $16,344.87 and other budgeted expenses
of $1,100.00.
The CEO/President recommends the approval of CHA executing a second amendment to the
Lease Agreement with A Safe Haven Foundation for purposes of extending the lease term from
May 2015 through February 2016. The Total Gross Base Rent amount would be in an amount notto-exceed $163,449.00 plus $1,100.00 for any fees assessed for additional services or other
related expenses, as provided for in the Lease Agreement, for a total Second Amendment to
Lease amount of not-to-exceed $164,549.00.
