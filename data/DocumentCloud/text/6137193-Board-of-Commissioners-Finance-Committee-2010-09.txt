The Clerk of the Board has imposed deadlines for submission of items (excluding the Cook
County Board of Commissioners) generally three (3) weeks in advance of a County Board
meeting. Therefore, it is likely the lobbying contacts information would be provided subsequent
to the issuance of a County Board Agenda.

For example, for the September 15, 2010 Board Meeting, the Clerk of the Board?s deadline was
Wednesday, August 25, 2010 at Noon; and for the October 5, 2010 Board meeting, the deadline
Was Tuesday, September 14, 2010.

Moreover, an Errata is no longer issued by the Clerk of the Board in accordance with the
directives of the President in Memoranda dated July 14, 2010 and August 27, 2010,
respectively. The second page of the July 14, 2010 Memorandum refers to the Errata, as
follows: ?Errata: The Clerk of the Board will no longer prepare an errata for each agenda. The
Clerk of the Board will only indicate which items have been withdrawn.?
