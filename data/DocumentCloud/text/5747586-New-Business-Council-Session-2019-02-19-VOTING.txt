Dear Chief Craig:

On behalf of our traffic safety grant review committee, it is my pleasure to con?rm your
grant award of $10,000 to be used for impaired and drugged driving prevention.

This grant will provide educational opportunities for Detroit school-age students to
experience the effects of alcohol and drug impaired driving in a controlled and safe
environment.

Students will drive the Fatal Vision Roadster Pedal Kart through a course marked by
cones. with LED lights indicating whether drivers should be turning, swerving. or stopping.
Using enhanced goggles, this exercise will give students a sense of being behind the
wheel when impaired by the alcohol or marijuana.

Officers sharing real life examples via guest speakers (trauma medical staff, citizens,
community entities) will help in the guidance of preventing driving distracted and while
under the in?uence of alcohol andlor marijuana.

is committed to traf?c safety throughout Michigan and is honored to support the
lifesaving work of the Detroit Police Department with this grant. Best wishes for continued
success.

Sincerely.

Resolution supporting Governor Whitmer?s reorganization of

MDEQ

On February 7, 2019, Council Member Benson directed the Legislative Policy Division (LPD) to
draft a resolution supporting Governor Gretchen Whitmer?s executive order reorganizing the State
Department of Environmental Quality, to be known as the Department of Environment, Great
Lakes and Energy. The draft resolution is attached.

If Council has any other questions or concerns regarding this subject, LPD will be happy to provide
further research and analysis upon request.

RESOLUTION SUPPORTING GOVERNOR EXECUTIVE ORDER
CREATING A NEW MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT, GREAT
LAKES AND ENERGY FROM THE CURRENT MDEQ

By Council Member Scott Benson

WHEREAS, Governor Gretchen Whitmer has issued an Executive Order that creates a new Michigan
Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy from the current Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality (MDEQ). The renamed and restructured department would emphasize and
pursue public policy directions that center on preserving and enhancing the State?s natural resources,
and especially on protecting safe drinking water; and

WHEREAS, Unfortunately, the Republican-dominated State House of Representatives
subsequently passed a measure opposing the Governor's executive order, and the Republican-
dominated State Senate can be expected very soon to do the same, based on an extensive history
of Michigan GOP efforts to undermine environmental protections by attacking the integrity and
competencies of the DEQ and its predecessor State Government departments; and

WHEREAS, In particular, the recent lame duck State Legislature passed inappropriate and ill-
advised statutory restrictions on the DEQ that?would subject environmental protection measures
to onerous, unfair and result-oriented so-called environmental oversight panels that threaten
Michigan's precious natural resources and public health by ?scally straitjacketing the DEQ and
substituting the bottom line of corporate polluters' pro?ts for sound environmental protection; and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Detroit City Council strongly supports
Governor Whitmer's Executive Order that creates a new Michigan Department of Environment, Great
Lakes and Energy from the current and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT copies of this resolution shall be delivered to the

Governor, Detroit's State Legislative delegation, the City's Lansing lobbyist, the State?s
Congressional delegation, and media.

DATE: February 4, 2019
RE: Resolution Urging Gov. Whitmer and the Michigan Legislature to

eliminate the tax on non-exempt pensions.

On January 24, 2019, the Honorable Council President Brenda Jones requested the
Legislative Policy Division to draft a resolution urging Governor Gretchen Whitmer

and the Michigan Legislature to eliminate the tax on non-exempt pensions.

Attached, please ?nd our draft of the resolution and contact us if we can be of any

further assistance.

BY COUNCIL PRESIDENT BRENDA JONES

RESOLUTION URGING GOV.WHITMER AND THE MICHIGAN LEGISLATURE
T0 ELIMINATE THE TAX ON NON-EXEMPT PENSIONS

WHEREAS, On May 25, 2011, Gov. Snyder signed House Bill 4361 into law as Public Act
38. Public Act 38 eliminated the State's tax exemption for pension income and repealed the
Michigan Business Tax for most businesses in favor of a ?at corporate income tax, thereby,
taxing low income seniors on ?xed incomes in order to provide tax benefits for large
corporations (a reverse Robin Hood scenario); and

WHEREAS, According to the Michigan Senate Fiscal Agency, PA 38 of 201] initiated the
most substantial changes in the Michigan individual income tax, since its establishment in
1967; and

WHEREAS, Surprisingly, the decision to tax pension income comes at a time when people
are living longer. In 2016, the US Census Bureau reported that Michigan residents? 60 and
older represent nearly a quarter of Michigan?s population. Moreover, the Census Bureau
estimates that by 2050, 27% of Americans will be 65 or older; and

WHEREAS Michigan House Representative Joseph Bellino (R-l7) introduced House Bill
4006, which, if passed into law, will restore exemptions to retirement income including
pensions, IRAs and 401(k) accounts from being taxed by the State of Michigan; NOW
THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, That the Detroit City Council strongly urge the Whitmer Administration
and the Michigan Legislature to support and approve HB 4006, thereby to reestablish the
tax exemptions placed on retirement income; BE IT FINALLY

RESOLVED, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to Gov. Whitmer, the Michigan
Senate Committee on Finance, the Michigan House Committee on Tax Policy and the
Detroit delegation in the Michigan Legislature.

RESOLUTION BY COUNCIL PRESIDENT BRENDA JONES
RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF 2019 SENATE BILL 54 HOUSE BILL 4100

WHEREAS, The mission of the Detroit City Council is to promote the economic, cultural and
physical welfare of Detroit?s citizens through Charter-mandated legislative
functions; and

WHEREAS, In 2011, the State of Michigan repealed the Michigan Historic Preservation tax
Credit, which had been an invaluable resource for owners of both residential and
commercial historic properties; and

WHEREAS, Moreover, in the thirteen years the tax credit existed, between January 1999 and
December 2011, approximately 200 projects were approved. Over this period, $42
million in state historic preservation credits helped to leverage in excess of $122
million in federal credits for local developers. Commercial projects comprised the
largest investment in historic properties; and

WHEREAS, In the recently ended 2017-18 State of Michigan legislative session, Senate Bill 469
as proposed, would have restored the State of Michigan?s historic preservation tax
credit. The measure would have allowed Michiganders who rehabilitated historic
buildings, to take a credit of up to 25 percent of their expenses against their state
income tax liability. Unfortunately however, despite overwhelming support in the
State Senate last year, approved by a vote of 36-2, and the State House Tax Policy
Committee, which approved it by an 8-2 vote last summer, it failed to come to a
vote in the full House, a consequence of the end of the legislative term; and

WHEREAS, Through a coordinated effort, two identical 2019 State Bills, Senate Bill 54 and
House Bill 4100 have been introduced, SB 54, introduced by Senators Schmidt,
Chang, Horn, Zorn and Irwin and referred to the Senate Committee on Finance, in
addition to HB 4100, introduced by Reps. Frederick, Wendzel, Anthony, LaGrand,
Marino, Elder, Mueller, Guerra and VanSingel and referred to the House
Committee on Tax Policy, were drafted to restore the historic state tax credits,
previously proposed in Senate Bill 469 from the last State legislative session; NOW
THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, The Detroit City Council, as an advocate of the ef?cient use of tax payer dollars,
expresses its strong support of 2019 Senate Bill 54 and House Bill 4100 and would
pray their expeditious passage by both houses of the legislature; NOW
THEREFORE BE IT FINALLY

RESOLVED, That this resolution be forwarded to the City of Detroit?s Lansing Lobbyist, the

Detroit Delegation in Lansing, the State Senate Committee on Finance, the State
House Committee on Tax Policy and the Governor.

BY COUNCIL PRESIDENT BRENDA JONES

RESOLUTION IN OPPOSITION TO THE TRUMP JANUARY

28, 2019 POLICY MEMORANDUM ENTITLED FOR IMPLEMENTING

SECTION 235 OF THE IMMIGRA TION AND NA TIONALITY AC TAND THE
MIGRANTPROTECTIONPROTOCOL 

WHEREAS, On Monday January 28, 2019, United States Secretary of Homeland Security
Kirstjen M. Nielsen issued a ?policy memorandum? (PM-602-0169) described as guidance to
US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) immigration of?cers for implementation of
the administration?s ?Migrant Protection Protocols? and

WHEREAS, The MPP guidance is part of the rollout of the Department of Homeland
Security?s (DHS) new ?Remain in Mexico? program for handling asylum claimants at the
southern border. The program requires, and seeks to justify, closing our country?s borders to the
vast majority of asylum seekers during the pendency of increasingly legal proceedings to
determine the viability of their asylum claims. It is a cynical immigration strategy aimed at
keeping those in need out of the country and invisible to the news media and the vast majority of
Americans, while likely guaranteeing that most asylum claims will fail; and

WHEREAS, Despite the lofty title, the Migrant Protection Protocols do nothing to protect
migrants, many of whom have survived extremely perilous journeys under treacherous
conditions to exercise their legal right to request asylum in the United States. Rather, the MPP
guts key due process protections for asylum seekers. According to the American Immigration
Lawyers Association, US. law provides all persons aniving to the United States, whether at or
between ports of entry, the right to seek asylum. (E, AILA Policy Brie}? "Remain in Mexico 
Plan Restricts Due Process, Puts Asylum Seekers Lives at Risk.) Although not everyone is
eligible for asylum, everyone deserves a full and fair opportunity to apply. Due process requires,
at the very least, access to court proceedings and reliable notice; both of these will be dif?cult to
impossible if the applicant is in Mexico; and

WHEREAS, The Remain in Mexico program will ultimately result in asylum seekers
remaining in limbo south of the border for prolonged periods of time, possibly years, intensi?ed
by the fact that the administration has allocated insuf?cient resources to DHS to efficiently
process the migrants, ultimately leaving legal and procedural protection of asylum seekers to the
Mexican government. With no clear path to implementation of the administration?s plan,
including how and where proceedings will occur, concern for the long?term safety and living
conditions of the migrants is growing. It is highly foreseeable that a humanitarian crisis of
substantial proportion will inevitably occur if this policy persists; incidents of deaths at the
Mexican border have been widely reported The Guardian,
Bidecl? 1 
border); and

WHEREAS, ln af?rming our status as a Welcoming City, the Detroit City Council?s resolution
stated ?the City of Detroit believes in the innate dignity of all its residents and recognizes the
importance of their valuable contributions to the social, religious, cultural, and economic life
within the city. The City of Detroit acknowledges, honors, and values our immigrant and migrant
roots, and embraces the values of family, faith, and hard work?; and

WHEREAS, The Detroit City Council emphatically believes that all asylum seekers should be
protected and treated humanely when they present themselves at our borders, particularly when
?eeing dangerous or threatening conditions. NOW THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, The Detroit City Council opposes the administration?s newly issued Migrant
Protection Protocols embodied in the January 28, 2019 DHS guidance, which serve to further
erode our country?s embrace of the internationally adopted 1951 Convention relating to the
Status ofRe?tgees. The United States must strike an appropriate balance between our resources
