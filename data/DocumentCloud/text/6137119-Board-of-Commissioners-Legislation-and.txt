(Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority)
It is difficult to determine the fiscal impact of HB 4103,
as amended, at this time. The amount of funds needed for grant
programs would be dependent on the decisions of the
Ex-Offenders Employment Stabilization Advisory Board that would
be created by the bill. It is also difficult at this time to
determine the necessary administrative costs. These costs will
be dependent on the amount of grant funds available, and the
number and complexity of grants to be administered. For federal
grant programs administered by the Authority, 7% to 10% of
grant funds are normally needed to properly administer a program.
HOUSE AMENDMENT NO. 5.
Deletes everything. Reinserts the provisions of House Amendment
No. 1 with the following changes: changes the composition of the
Advisory Board; provides that the grant proposal requirements are not
limited to those specified; provides that the purpose is to assist
qualified individuals; provides that expenditure of funds is subject
to appropriation; and repeals the new provisions on December 31, 2007.
Effective immediately.
