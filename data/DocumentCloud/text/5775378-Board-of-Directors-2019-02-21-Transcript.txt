 ·1· ·on which the Chief Administrator of the Civilian

·5· · · · · · ·Next speaker is Anthony Jones.
·6· · · · · · ·Crista Noel.
·7· · · ·MS. NOEL:· Yes.· They weren't able to make it
·8· ·and so Tony sent a statement for me to read.
·9· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Okay.
10· · · ·MS. NOEL:· I speak here tonight on behalf of
11· ·Betty Jones' family and friends.· The family says
12· ·that they're still struggling with the loss of
13· ·their mother.· No amount of words or even a word
14· ·can express the pain that they are enduring on a
15· ·daily basis.
16· · · · · · · The saying "laughing to stop from
17· ·crying" is an understatement that they keep finding
18· ·themselves facing.· Continuously hearing about
19· ·Mr. Rialmo and his unjustified actions taken on the
20· ·night of her death, their mother's, has become so
21· ·repetitive that it's like removing a scab off a
22· ·sore that's trying to heal.
23· · · · · · · All we ask of the Board members here
24· ·tonight is to give us some type of justice by

 ·1· ·firing Mr. Rialmo and doing so in a timely manner.
·2· ·We are not asking for you guys to be biased towards
·3· ·him or looking for favor or sympathy from you.
·4· ·What we are looking for is the truth to prevail,
·5· ·and what that looks like and what that sounds like
·6· ·is simply justice for our mother, Betty Jones.
·7· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Thank you.
·8· · · ·MR. O'MALLEY:· Thank you.
·9· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Ms. Noel, you were also
10· ·listed as a speaker, if you want to use your time.
11· · · ·MS. NOEL:· All right.
12· · · · · · · · · · · (Chief of Patrol Waller joined
13· · · · · · · · · · · the meeting.)
14· · · ·MS. NOEL:· So I'm here speaking on behalf of
15· ·Betty as well.· I just want to remind the Police
16· ·Board about the evidence, the testimony, blaming
17· ·Betty for the shooting, Rialmo's testimony blaming
18· ·Betty for the shooting.· The difference between his
19· ·deposition and his trial testimony.· The trial
20· ·tactics every time he lied or contradicted or
21· ·perjured himself his lawyer called for a side bar.
22· · · · · · ·The jury awarded the family money and
23· ·said they believed he believed, not that they
24· ·believed, that the shooting was justified.

 ·1· ·Objective reasonableness is the standard the police
·2· ·are held to to shoot, but not subjective
·3· ·reasonableness.· So it's not about what he
·4· ·believed, it's about the totality of the
·5· ·certifications.
·6· · · · · · ·The forensic evidence, Dr. Julie Melanik.
·7· ·Dr. Melanik is an American Board of Pathology Board
·8· ·Certified forensic pathologist practicing forensic
·9· ·medicine in San Francisco, California, and CEO of
10· ·Pathology Experts, Inc.· She's the one who
11· ·testified on behalf of Quintonio.
12· · · · · · · Dr. Melanik has been qualified as an
13· ·expert witness in forensic pathology, neuro
14· ·pathology, and wound interpretation.· She has a
15· ·subspecialty training in surgery and has published
16· ·and consulted on cases of medical malpractice and
17· ·therapeutic complications.· She trains doctors and
18· ·attorneys on forensic pathology, proper death
19· ·reporting interpretation.· She has been invited to
20· ·lecture at professional conferences on the subjects
21· ·of death certification, complications of therapy,
22· ·forensic toxicology, and in custody death.
23· · · · · · ·She testified that Rialmo's to story was
24· ·not supported by the forensics, specifically the

 ·1· ·trajectory of the bullets and the stippling, which
·2· ·is when a bullet fires, it will spray like little
·3· ·metal pieces.· The stippling from the gun does not
·4· ·support Rialmo's version of the events.
·5· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Thank you, Ms. Noel.
·6· · · ·MS. NOEL:· Can I ask you for another minute,
·7· ·please.
·8· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Okay.
·9· · · ·MS. NOEL:· The cops that are arguing on behalf
10· ·of Rialmo are arguing that some guys who look at
11· ·shooting policies, which changes as of the
12· ·implementation of the consent decree, shooting
13· ·policy will change, said that the shooting was
14· ·justified.· They always say that 99.9 percent of
15· ·the time.· But they are not forensic pathologists.
16· ·So they should not be considered once forensics
17· ·establishes the facts.
18· · · · · · · Conduct unbecoming.· This in and of
19· ·itself is a fireable offense.· He knocked the guy
20· ·out in the bar over a coat.· Maybe you can give him
21· ·a pass, he was upset, he had just murdered to two
22· ·people.
23· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Ms. Noel, I'm sorry, I
24· ·thought you were about to conclude.· So I do need

·7· · · · · · · Octavia Mitchell.· Good evening.
·8· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Good evening.· I spoke with -·9· ·this is for Ms. Valente, I spoke with you February
10· ·6, 2019, asking if you could help me to get the DNA
11· ·swabs in my son's, Isael Jackson's, case that is
12· ·missing.· You got in touch with me today right
13· ·before the Board meeting, and all you sent me was a
14· ·court order from Judge Coleman who stated that if
15· ·we had these DNA swabs, it would be crucial to show
16· ·evidence if it can show that Isael did not touch
17· ·this gun.
18· · · · · · ·So we did some DNA where Isael's
19· ·fingerprints was not on his gun.· So I'm trying to
20· ·get these DNA swabs that for some reason just
21· ·disappeared off the face of earth.· ·June 12, 2018,
22· ·you sent me the papers from Judge Coleman, but I'm
23· ·quite sure you seen why I put an appeal and we were
24· ·in -- we just asked for mediation to resolve this

 ·1· ·with the City August 1, 2018.
·2· · · · · · ·But the City didn't want to resolve this
·3· ·because wherever they have this DNA, they're making
·4· ·it hard for me to get.
·5· · · · · · · So I'm asking you, Ms. Valente, you
·6· ·attorney for the City, do you know the procedures
·7· ·and protocol for me to get this DNA?· Because it
·8· ·belongs to me.· I am the estate of Isael Jackson,
·9· ·and anything with him he dead or alive that belongs
10· ·to him and is connected to him belongs to me.

I

11· ·put in a Freedom of Act several times.· I can get
12· ·everything but these DNA samples that disappeared
13· ·off the face of the earth.
14· · · · · · · Ms. Valente?· Hello?· What is your name?
15· ·Am I saying your name wrong?
16· · · ·MS. VALENTE:· Ms. Mitchell, I did send an email
17· ·to you and your attorney, Mr. Aaron.· You and I did
18· ·have more than one phone conversation with you and
19· ·your attorney.· As I explained to you prior to the
20· ·meeting, I was out of the office for the last few
21· ·days, today is my first day back, and I sent you
22· ·information that I thought would be helpful.
23· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· You sent me information that I
24· ·already have.· You sent me court information that I

 ·1· ·already know about.· I'm not asking you that.
·2· · · · · · ·I'm asking for Isael Jackson's DNA.· Can
·3· ·you tell me how do I go about getting that DNA that
·4· ·I'm steadily asking the City for that somehow
·5· ·disappeared.· I have it right here what you sent me
·6· ·where it was collected.· Yes, it was.· But where is
·7· ·it?· It just stops.· You collected it and now it's
·8· ·gone.
·9· · · · · · · Yes, I was misrepresented at first by an
10· ·attorney that did not request it.· But I'm
11· ·requesting it.· I'm his mother.· Whether that
12· ·attorney requested it or not, I'm entitled to that
13· ·DNA, and I'm tired of asking for his DNA.· I've
14· ·been as nice and polite as I can be.
15· · · · · · ·Now, I'm quite sure you being the City's
16· ·attorney, you know how to get that DNA and I'm
17· ·quite sure you know where that DNA is at.
18· · · ·MS. VALENTE:· And, ma'am, as I told you
19· ·earlier, I did speak with your attorney that was at
20· ·your request, Mr. Philip Aaron, who I believe is
21· ·out in Seattle.· You said he was representing you,
22· ·he said he was representing you.· So I think what
23· ·you're asking for is legal advice that you should
24· ·be getting by ask him.

·4· · · ·MS. VALENTE:· Ma'am, I'm not telling you that.
·5· ·What I'm saying is you're asking for legal
·6· ·advice -·7· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· No, ma'am.· No, I'm not.· I'm
·8· ·asking you for what belongs to me if the City has
·9· ·it.· That's what I'm asking for.· I'm asking you
10· ·for something that is connected to my son that
11· ·belongs to me.
12· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· I'm going to get your

20· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· So I'm going to get your
21· ·information and I'll ask a few questions and try to
22· ·see.
23· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· It's as simple as one, two,
24· ·three.· They give me two of the DNAs and neither

 ·1· ·one of those DNAs is connected to my son.· This
·2· ·third DNA, as Judge Coleman stated, is crucial to
·3· ·this case.· And if they can just give me that DNA
·4· ·it will prove that my son didn't have that gun,
·5· ·just as well as there was no fingerprints of his on
·6· ·that gun.· So I don't know what's the problem.
·7· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· I'll get your information.
·8· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Okay.
·9· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· And we will go from there.
10· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Ms. Valente, you were unable to
11· ·get the information for me?

19· ·Robert J. More speaking on behalf of St, Saint

21· · · · · · ·First of all, regarding public notice
22· ·now, once again we are facing this stonewall of the

16

 ·1· ·state of mind both for criminal liability on 18 242
·2· ·1346 1961, (inaudible) various other federal cases
·3· ·as well as official misconduct is for the public
·4· ·being deprived of that.· And that's just critically
·5· ·important again, because if that had been secured
·6· ·prior to September 11 these other atrocities, the
·7· ·false flags, the assassinations, the whole things
·8· ·probably could have been preempted because of the

10· · · · · · ·What is the basis today, Mr. Gregler
11· ·(phonetic) Mr. Breaker (phonetic), I can't remember
12· ·your first initials, of the Superintendent's absent
13· ·today.· Why is he again absent?

·7· ·of 300, push the button, pull the strings, without
·8· ·having to encounter individuals who are subject to
·9· ·being disciplined for insubordination if they
10· ·refuse to interfere with what's necessary to bring
11· ·an end to this nightmare.· Okay.
12· · · · · · ·So there is reverse Michelle law.

I

13· ·invite you to provide your email address to me at
14· ·the end of this meeting so we can move on forward
15· ·on that.· Because this is just incredibly laborious
16· ·and again and again and again he's simply not here.
17· ·I have such a long list of things to do.· I need
18· ·protocols set up that if my body is found dead to
19· ·cover all these different possible contingencies.
20· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Mr. More, your time is up.
21· · · ·MR. MORE:· That's again 1 percent of what I
22· ·need to say into the record.· Enter and continue.

11· ·things you had asked for, we got you that.· And you
12· ·never speak to those issues.· You got your property
13· ·and your reports that you requested.
14· · · ·MR. MORE:· I sent a conditional commendation
