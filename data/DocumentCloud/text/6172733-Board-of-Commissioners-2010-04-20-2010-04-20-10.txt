FUNDING
No CHA Funds Required

EXPLANATION
Developer
Pursuant to a competitive Request for Qualifications (“RFQ”) The Community Builders, Inc.
(“TCB”) was selected as the developer to develop a privately owned senior building within the
Madden/Wells redevelopment area. TCB elected to enter into a joint venture Agreement with
UJIMA that outlines the roles and responsibilities of TCB and UJIMA for the proposed senior
building. The developer formed Oakwood Shores Senior Apartments Limited Partnership to own
the project and has established Oakwood Shores Senior Apartments, Inc. as its managing
General Partner.
In May of 2006, the Board approved: 1) TCB as the selected developer for a senior building
within the Madden/Wells redevelopment; 2) authorization to issue an option and execute a
ground lease; and 3) submission of a disposition application to the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development (“HUD”). Subsequent to Board approval, TCB was unsuccessful in
receiving the requisite HUD Section 202 Grant funding which, in part, led to a location change
for the construction of the senior building and expiration of the option on the land initially
contemplated to be used for this development project.

 In June of 2008, the Board granted authorization to: 1) issue a new option and execute a 99-year
ground lease with (TCB) or its affiliate; and 2) submit a disposition modification to HUD since
the development site location had changed.

building will be located on the west side of South Cottage Grove between 37th Place and 38th
Street. The land is owned by the CHA and will be ground leased to the development partnership

TCB was awarded the HUD Section 202 Grant in January of 2009 and has an eighteen month
period within which to close this mixed finance transaction.
