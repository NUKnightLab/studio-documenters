Bogdan Kozul, owner, proposes to erect a 2.5 story 2,001 square foot two family house on a 4,500
square foot lot in a B1 Two-Family Residential District. The owner appeals for relief from the strict
application of the following sections of the Cleveland Codified Ordinances:
1. Section 357.09(b)(2)(C) which states that in a Two-Family District no interior side yard shall be
less than five (5) feet in width for a corner lot, nor less than three(3) feet in width for an
interior lot, nor shall the aggregate width of side yard on the same premises be less than ten
(10) feet. However, the width of any such interior side yard shall in no case be less than onefourth (1/4) the height of the main building on the premises. The building height is
approximately 33’-4” thus no interior side yard shall be less than 8’-4” and a 3’ side yard is
proposed.
2. Section 341.02(b) which states that City Planning approval is required prior to the issuance of
a building permit. (Filed July 5, 2018)
