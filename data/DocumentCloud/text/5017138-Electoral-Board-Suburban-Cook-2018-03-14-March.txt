A
MEETING
OF
THE
CRIMINAL
JUSTICE
INVESTIGATE ISSUES SURROUNDING ELECTRONIC MONITORING

COMMITTEE

TO

WHEREAS, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart has communicated that too many violent offenders are
being released on electronic monitoring while awaiting trial, and
WHEREAS, Cook County has made significant strides in criminal justice reform that have resulted in a
much lower population at the Cook County Jail, and
WHEREAS, criminal justice reform is a crucial issue, but it must be approached in a common-sense
matter, and
WHEREAS, individuals accused of violent crimes deserve every civil right, but the County court system
should not be returning those accused of violent crimes to the streets at the cost of all other residents of
the County, and
WHEREAS, as more individuals are released on electronic monitoring instead of sitting in the County jail,
the Sheriff’s office must be given the resources necessary to appropriately keep track of those individuals,
and
WHEREAS, the County Board needs to be kept apprised of any issues surrounding criminal justice
reform because it is the fiduciary body of the jail and probation systems, and
WHEREAS, the State’s Attorney of Cook County, the Public Defender, the Sheriff and the Chief Judge
of the circuit court shall appear or send a representative to testify about this issue before the Criminal
Justice committee of the County Board.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
FOR THE LEVY OF TAXES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners and the Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners
of Cook County, Illinois, have considered the subject of the Annual Tax Levy for the Fiscal Year A.D.,
2018, and the several sums necessary to be levied to meet the needs and requirements of the County of
Cook for said fiscal year, and have recommended that this Ordinance for the Levy of Taxes be adopted;
and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, Illinois, approved, passed, and adopted the
Annual Appropriation Bill of the County of Cook, for its Fiscal Year 2018, which said Appropriation Bill is
hereinafter set forth and which contains a Revenue Estimate that includes an allocation of the 2018 Tax
Levy
by
Fund
together
with
additional
columns
captioned:
“ANNUAL
TAX
LEVY”,
“APPROPRIATION ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTED TAXES” and "NET TAX LEVY FOR
APPROPRIATION "; and
WHEREAS, Cook County and its taxpayers have benefited from Tax Increment Financing Districts
(TIFs) by having the increment generated during the life of the TIFs invest in the specific area generating
the increment; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board passed a Resolution on November 15, 2011 outlining that it is the
policy of Cook County to recapture any property taxes at the termination of a TIF; and
WHEREAS, within the County of Cook, certain real-estate parcels, or a portion of the assessed valuation
of certain real-estate parcels, are from time to time identified on the County real-estate tax rolls as
deriving from new property, insofar as they were developed or substantially improved or are the subject of
tax incentives that expired since the most recent assessment of real-estate taxes, the value of which has
not heretofore been recaptured; and
WHEREAS, the interests of County taxpayers and the County itself are better served if the taxes on the
additional value of said new property is captured.

THEREFORE,
BE

ORDAINED
AND
ORDERED
BY
THE
BOARD
OF
COMMISSIONERS OF COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS, that pursuant to its home rule powers,
$720,483,542.00 as a base levy amount, plus a TIF value recapture sum of $17,582,624, an expiring
incentives sum of $1,289,277, and a new-property value capture sum of $22,627,596, which aggregate
amount of these sums is to be collected from the Annual Tax Levy for the Fiscal Year A.D. 2018 of the
County of Cook for the Public Safety Fund purposes of said County, and for the Health Enterprise Fund
purposes of said County, and for the payment of principal and interest on general obligation bonds of said
County as represented by the Bond and Interest fund purposes, and for Cook County Employees Annuity
and Benefit Fund purposes, and for the Election Fund purposes, said aggregate amount being
$761,983,039, which is the total amount of appropriations heretofore legally made from the Annual Tax
Levy for the year 2018 and contained in the Annual Appropriation Bill (hereinafter set forth in the
Ordinance) for the Fiscal Year 2018 duly adopted by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County on
November 21, 2017, is hereby levied on and upon all taxable property in the said County of Cook for the
Fiscal Year 2018,.

As provided in the Fiscal Year 2018 Annual Appropriation Bill, three percent of the property tax levy
revenues separately allocated to the Public Safety Fund, Health Enterprise Fund, and Election Fund are to
be made available to each Fund for purposes of covering the loss and cost of collecting taxes levied for
said Funds, for the amounts of taxes for which the nonpayment will result in forfeiture of real estate, and
for abatements in the amounts of such taxes as extended upon the collectors’ books. To ensure the
County meets its obligations for indebtedness as represented by the Bond and Interest Fund, and that the
actual collections of property taxes received by the Annuity and Benefit Fund are commensurate with the
amounts so levied, the County Clerk is authorized, in consultation with the County’s Chief Financial
Officer, to extend loss and collections for these funds in a manner that is sufficient for these purposes.
The specific amounts herein levied for the various purposes heretofore named are stated in this Ordinance
and Tax Levy, by being listed and itemized by Fund in the Revenue Estimate of the Annual Appropriation
Bill, including a column captioned: “ANNUAL TAX LEVY”. The tax hereby levied for said Fiscal Year
2018 for said appropriations, to be collected from this Levy, being the aforesaid total, consists of the

The grant award of $547,673.00, spanned the period from 10/1/2010 - 9/30/2012. The entire

award amount was advanced but actual program costs were $520,791.62, with a remaining balance of
$26,881.38. That difference was credited to county corporate accounts in 2015 with the understanding that
expenses would ultimately be reallocated to the grant. However, that turned out not to be the case.
Therefore, the U.S. Department of Justice will be refunded the $26,881.38, with a charge to current
period operations.
