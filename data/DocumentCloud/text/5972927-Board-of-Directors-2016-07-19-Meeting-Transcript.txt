Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

just some calendar items and I am going to pay

2

particular attention to this.

3

MS. DARLING:

These are the same dates that

4

we've been mentioning every meeting.

5

simple reminder that we will be meeting again on

6

Tuesday, October 18th, and Tuesday, December 6th,

7

both at 10:00 a.m.

8
9

Just a

We are starting to discuss 2017 board
meeting dates.

I will be reaching out to you

10

individually and sort of taking an informal

11

survey about whether this is the right number of

12

annual meetings.

13

etcetera.

14

one-on-one discussions on that and what works for

15

you.

16

to set some possible meeting dates so we can have

17

those far in advance so everyone can plan for the

18

year.

19

that, please let me know.

20

If we should go to quarterly,

So we will be having some further

And I'll be working with Chairman Summers

And so if anybody has any questions on

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So we are going to go to

21

the -- you guys have seen maybe a couple new

22

faces and probably heard about interesting things

23

we have been doing.

24

by Leslie.

You've been briefed I know

We will go through operations which

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 5

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1
2

will lead into the budget.
MS. DARLING:

So a couple of things that I

3

just wanted to share with you.

First, I want to

4

thank Mary Sue Barrett and the Metropolitan

5

Planning Council for hosting us and continuing to

6

be our host.

7

MS. BARRETT:

No problem.

8

MS. DARLING:

We really appreciate your

9

gracious hospitality and kindness in allowing us

10

to hold our meetings here.

11

space for such a meeting at our offices, so we

12

appreciate your assistance in hosting us here.

13

So we do not have the

I also want to quickly introduce

14

Nicole Karwowski who is our summer intern.

15

she's been with us for three weeks and will be

16

with us throughout the summer and perhaps longer

17

if we can talk her into it.

18

terrific asset.

19

studying international business and economics and

20

she has been a really terrific help to us these

21

last few weeks.

22

joined us and want to welcome her and introduce

23

you to her.

24

And

She has been a

She's a junior at Loyola

So we're grateful that she

I know last time that we met we

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 6

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

discussed briefly that we had gotten some pro

2

bono assistance or were about to sign an

3

engagement pro bono assistance from a then

4

unnamed firm.

5

Grant Thornton who is assisting us on a policy

6

and procedure assessment.

7

results of that work coming up at the next board

8

meeting, but I did want to share with you that

9

Grant Thornton was very gracious in giving us

We have now been able to engage

We will have the

10

some assistance on our policy and procedure

11

assessments.

12

organization thought was really pertinent and

13

they have been a great help as we -- as we embark

14

on that endeavor.

15

Something that we as the

As you also know we are working on

16

engaging an independent auditor for 2015 and

17

2016.

18

as that proceeds, but I expect that will move

19

relatively quickly as we move forward.

20

That is ongoing.

I will update you more

For recruiting outreach as we

21

attempted to find summer interns and have started

22

to put out job postings for program analyst

23

positions, we have been posting that at Chicago

24

State, UIC, Roosevelt University, University of

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 7

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

Chicago, Loyola and Northeastern.

2

posted on a website called Handshake which is an

3

online career services platform for recruiting

4

students.

5

sites including LinkedIn.

6

We've also

And also on some social networking

Obviously as we continue to recruit, I

7

know I have discussed this with some of you; but

8

we are obviously interested in making sure that

9

we are having appropriate outreach and we're able

10

to reach the best candidates.

11

continue to try and recruit diverse candidates.

12

Make sure our staff reflects the City that we

13

live in.

14

ideas or feedback on that as we move forward in

15

staffing up through 2017, we would be happy to

16

continue to discuss that with you.

17

We also want to

So to the extent that any of you have

When we last met in April I was

18

preparing to go to Washington D.C. during

19

Infrastructure Week to meet with the

20

infrastructure accelerators which I was able to

21

do.

22

in briefings where we talked to the U.S.

23

Department of Transportation and the many other

24

federal agencies.

We also -- we spent a day long in -- a day

And also had the opportunity

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 8

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

to meet with BATIC, the Build America

2

Transportation Investment Center.

3

the single point of contact and coordinations for

4

states and municipalities and project sponsors

5

working to utilize federal transportation

6

expertise and assist them in providing for

7

federal transportation credit programs.

8

they're exploring ways to access private capital

9

in a similar way, of course, that we are.

10

They serve as

And also

So we had the opportunity to meet with

11

them and also work with the other infrastructure

12

accelerators.

13

quarterly conference calls.

14

about a week ago.

15

best practices.

16

We are now engaging in having
We had our first one

And we'll continue to share

As we discussed last time, the

17

infrastructure accelerators throughout the

18

country there's about five of them, and only the

19

Federal City Council in Washington D.C. is also

20

focussed on actual project delivery in the same

21

way that we are.

22

discussing performance based infrastructure and

23

sharing ways to evaluate whether a public/private

24

partnership opportunity is -- is a positive one

The others are focussed more on

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 9

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

for a state or municipality.

2

So besides the Federal City Council we

3

are the only ones that are doing project

4

delivery.

5

And we think in a very good and positive way to

6

show that the infrastructure accelerators can

7

actually -- not only be able to share expertise

8

around the information on public/private

9

partnerships and other alternative financing

So that sets us a little bit apart.

10

vehicles, but also to deliver those projects that

11

we are doing with the Smart Lighting Project.

12

Finally, I've been invited to an

13

invitation-only conference also in Washington

14

again, the U.S. Infrastructure Law Forum.

15

where a very small group of only 45 participants

16

with expertise throughout the country are invited

17

to discuss financing infrastructure, also

18

challenges and benefits facing the lack in

19

alternative financing.

20

forward to attending that in September and will

21

brief you of my learnings from that as well.

22
23
24

And

So I'm really looking

So moving onto -- unless anyone has
any questions.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Just really quickly and

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 10

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

this is going to be appropriate as we get into

2

the project updates.

3

an answer to this as well.

4

locally or regionally the, you know, what's the

5

last kind of body of work, credible body of work

6

that was done that, you know, meets the case and

7

need for local infrastructure development as it

8

sort of ties to Chicago's competitiveness as to

9

the growth of our local economy?

10

MS. BARRETT:

And, Mary Sue, you may have
I'm just wondering

Well, multiple sources I --

11

some of them are specific to our region and

12

others are, you know, national sources.

13

when assessments were done of the Recovery Act

14

Investments from President Obama's first term

15

that the return on investment was the greatest

16

across the board in every state and community on

17

the infrastructure investment.

18

ROI.

19

I know

So that's more

Locally we've seen that -- the

20

depressing news that Chicago, Illinois, and the

21

region have lost more population than any other

22

place in the country.

23

last 12 months in the City.

24

22,000 in the state.

3,000 people just in the
6,000 in the region.

And I think there's a

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 11

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

growing recognition that our lack of investment

2

in infrastructure is directly -- can be directly

3

mapped to that.

4

kind of predictability in your economic building

5

blocks, people don't have confidence.

6

Because if you don't deliver

So there's lots of -- many -- there's

7

many, many good things happening in Chicago.

8

we're, you know, relocating companies.

9

expanding some companies downtown.

But

We're

And meanwhile

10

the population is fleeing.

11

millennials in the, you know, kind of slightly

12

older slice of the millennials are departing

13

according to the -- some LinkedIn statistics.

14

I think the linkage between infrastructure and

15

job growth is very -- is very strong.

16

And some of the old

So

And there's been data both from CMAP

17

about the needs as well as on the state wide

18

basis.

19

calculation side of the $43 billion in over 10

20

years need.

21

It's been documented just on the

MR. O'SHEA:

Mary Sue, when we talk about

22

those numbers 3,000 City; 6,000 region; 22,000 in

23

the state, where are they going?

24

that and what are the breakdown of the ages?

Do they have

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

Are

 12

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

these strictly seniors who retire and/or is it

2

families moving out?

3

MS. BARRETT:

I would be happy to share some

4

of the resources that we found useful.

It's not

5

a simple snapshot is the answer.

6

arrows moving in all directions out -- out from

7

the metropolitan Chicago region.

8

metropolitan areas.

9

Milwaukee, etcetera.

You would see

So it is nearby

Places like Indianapolis,
And then Texas pops up on

10

the list because of job creation as a place

11

that's receiving a lot of Illinoisans.

12

It is not as big of the, you know,

13

snow bird phenomenon as you would think.

14

a piece of it.

15

magnet that we are both because we're a higher ed

16

powerhouse of graduates choosing to stay in

17

Chicago and midwestern universities graduates

18

coming to Chicago has long been true.

19

really a bright spot.

20

not staying.

21

That's

But largely it's the -- the

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

They're leaving.

It's
They're

I ask that -- thank you,

22

Mary Sue.

I ask the question in part because

23

we've got, you know, Leslie is doing great work

24

engaging, you know, sort of national conversation

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 13

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

and international conversation.

And, you know,

2

part of our job here is to make sure that we make

3

the right connections locally.

4

know, because we are going to get into our

5

pipeline and where we are going in order to be

6

able to do and continue to have the support

7

behind it and have, you know, kind of everybody

8

pulling to think through creative financing

9

options for us to do this work, you know; I think

And that, you

10

it helps us for that, you know, for that

11

conversation to be sort of more present and the

12

need for --

13

MS. BARRETT:

I appreciate that.

14

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

-- infrastructure.

You

15

know, it's not something that we have to kind of

16

dive into today.

17

MS. BARRETT:

18

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

19

to kind of raise.

20

MS. BARRETT:

No.
But it's a thing I wanted

It's the connection between

21

transactions and the broader economic transitions

22

that are underway is an important one.

23

demonstrate that these kinds of, you know,

24

getting -- getting business done, financed and

And to

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 14

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

executed can be tied to the -- because we need to

2

change that trajectory.

3

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So maybe we can sort of

4

follow up offline on things that we can do to

5

better facilitate or elevate that conversation

6

and make that connection.

7

MS. DARLING:

Mary Sue and I are already

8

scheduling a meeting for the end of -- in the

9

coming month actually to discuss that as well.

10

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

11

MS. DARLING:

Great.

So we talked the other day

12

about additional opportunities for us to

13

collaborate locally.

14
15

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

No surprise Leslie is

ahead of me.

16

MS. DARLING:

No, no, no.

17

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

18

MS. DARLING:

Again --

But we -- I completely agree,

19

Kurt.

I think it's really important that we

20

think about how we can collaborate and continue

21

to expand -- expand our pipeline and think about

22

the opportunities for the Infrastructure Trust to

23

continue to not only collaborate, but to continue

24

to contribute to the -- to the City and the local

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 15

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1
2

region.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Just hosting the -- a

3

forum for the conversation or elevating in the

4

right, you know, place specifically on

5

infrastructure.

6

of conversations about, you know, you're well

7

aware, sort of planning, mapping economic

8

development strategies, regional, local,

9

etcetera.

But I think there have been lots

Plenty.

But, you know, I think this

10

particular topic and its -- its kind of critical

11

importance I think deserves its own conversation.

12

So I'm glad to know you guys are on that.

13

MS. DARLING:

So if there are no further

14

comments on that, let's move on to the operations

15

overview and get into the budget a little bit.

16

And you all have been provided the documents in

17

advance, of course, for this meeting so you were

18

able to review.

19

But we have as you know the 2015

20

financials are substantially complete which is

21

allowing us to proceed with our infinite audit

22

for 2015 and 2016.

23

continue to quickly manage our expenses, so to

24

date we are -- we are under budget for the year.

And as we discussed and

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 16

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

We expect that will ramp up as we continue to

2

staff up to 2017, but we are here today to

3

request your approval on our 2016 budget.

4

So as you know from what you see here

5

you're looking at our current staff which

6

includes myself, George Marquisos is our Managing

7

Director, Patty Dominguez is our Manager of

8

Administrative Services and Nicole Karwowski is

9

our intern.

10

We do have a hiring initiative to add

11

additional staff including a managing director of

12

finance which I'm hoping is somebody who will be

13

able to start this fall.

14

additional program analysts by the end of the

15

year.

16

have the appropriate staff into 2017 to do the

17

work necessary.

And adding one to two

And then continuing to make sure that we

18

I do want to thank the staff.

We have

19

been doing quite a lot with very little.

20

had very deep project involvement.

21

particularly has taken the laboring or on -- so

22

much work on the smart lighting procurement.

23

it's really been a terrific team effort.

24

want to thank the whole team at CIT who has been

We've

And George

And

And I

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 17

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

working nonstop on drafting the -- RFQ documents,

2

running the evaluation process.

3

around the clock for many, many, many months.

4

And so I'm really grateful to everyone for all

5

the extra work that they've put in to make sure

6

this process is going smoothly.

7

It's really been

As you know we successfully launched

8

two major projects for the smart lighting and

9

home buyer's assistance with more in the pipeline

10

that we expect to ramp up through 2017.

11

talk about that in more detail, but want to share

12

with you the operating budget summary.

13

Happy to

You can see the 2015 unaudited numbers

14

that we have.

15

2015, as I said, substantially complete.

16

won't see a major substantive change in these

17

numbers, but they may change slightly once we

18

have the audit.

19

2016.

20

Those will be audited and we have
So you

And then you see the numbers for

So overall we are planning for a lower

21

budget amount than what was spent in 2015.

22

have found ways to manage our expenses in a

23

meaningful way.

24

labor.

And

Obviously our major expense is

And obviously to do the work we have to

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 18

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

have the competent staff.

2

are looking forward to continue to ramp that up

3

to the end of the fiscal year and calendar year.

4
5
6

And so as I said we

So are there any specific questions
about this before I request your approval?
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Leslie, what do you think

7

are -- obviously we were sort of delayed in

8

approving the '16 budget.

9

'16, right.

It's the middle of

Maybe give some insight into what

10

our prospective process will be for next two

11

years.

12

MS. DARLING:

Certainly.

I think that part

13

of doing the reboot of the organization required

14

us to spend a little bit more time on 2015.

15

so it took us a little bit longer than we would

16

have liked to really do the correct planning and

17

-- for 2016.

18

present a budget to you, I think we have a -- our

19

end-of-the-year meeting where I'll present the

20

2017 budget obviously before the start of 2017.

21

And so we'll be on target as we move forward.

22

And we'll have a, you know, prospective plan to

23

present the budget to the board obviously before

24

the calendar year would end and the fiscal year

And

But my goal will be obviously to

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 19

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1
2

would start.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Got it.

And does the

3

City know yet that, you know, we're spending less

4

money than our income?

Yes.

Yes, they do.
They are getting off

easy.

8

MS. DARLING:

Yes, they do.

9

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Okay.

10

other questions on the budget?

11

have a motion to approve it.

12

MS. CAFARO:

So moved.

MR. O'SHEA:

Second.

All right.

Any

So we need to

All in favor?

(Chorus of ayes.)
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Any opposed?

All right.

Motion passes.
MS. DARLING:

Thank you.

Now, we are going

19

to get into the much more fun part where we are

20

talking about the work we are doing on the

21

projects.

22

First we are going to focus on the

23

smart lighting where today I am pleased to share

24

with you that we are prepared to recommend the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

 20

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

short list of respondents to the RFQ for the

2

Smart Lighting Project here today.

3

If, Julie, the record could reflect

4

that Jorge Ramirez has joined the meeting.

5

you.

6

Thank

So I wanted to give you an update and

7

a summary of our RFQ evaluation process and how

8

we came to bring this group of short list of

9

respondents to you today.

10

We had a very extensive process that

11

included a 15-member evaluation committee that

12

was made up of stakeholders from all of the

13

different City of Chicago departments that have

14

been working on the Smart Lighting Project and

15

also our sister agency, the Chicago Park

16

District, who is involved in this project and

17

your team here from the CIT of course.

18

Each evaluator spent a tremendous

19

amount of time scoring the statement of

20

qualifications.

21

think people spent on it and it is approximately

22

over 700 hours of person time.

23

just reviewing the SOP's which is -- was a

24

substantial list especially from many of the

And we totaled up the time we

And -- spent on

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 21

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

people at the City who are relatively senior in

2

their departments and we asked a lot of them to

3

review so many statements of qualifications.

4

people were extraordinarily careful and

5

thoughtful about their scoring and spending the

6

time that was necessary to going through these

7

evaluations -- the evaluation process.

8
9

But

We held evaluation kick-off meetings
to establish our guidelines.

And we unanimously

10

agreed on how to weight the scoring and determine

11

a work flow.

12

discuss process issues and confirm our very tight

13

schedule which everyone agreed to stay on and

14

did.

15

We held a check-in meeting to

We also built an extensive scoring

16

survey that automatically and accurately

17

tabulated our results which we were very pleased

18

about.

19

things went extraordinarily smoothly with the

20

data.

21

Did not have any technical glitches and

And then we had two very lengthy

22

consensus meetings where the evaluation committee

23

unanimously recommended that 9 respondents

24

proceed to the RFP phase of the procurement.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

So

 22

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

you can see here this is the list of 30

2

respondents that responded to -- that responded

3

to the RFQ.

4

after the due date.

5

This list was posted online shortly
So this list is public.

And this is our list of 9 respondents

6

that will be moving on to the RFQ -- I'm sorry,

7

RFP process with your approval.

8

Aldrige Electric; Ameresco; Black & Veatch, Cisco

9

& Sprint as one team; ComEd; Itron and Petune

So that is

10

Light as one team; John Burns Construction;

11

Philips Lighting; Siemens and Silver Spring

12

Networks.

13

We expect that many of these teams

14

have an expertise in electrical work or an

15

expertise in technology.

16

during the RFP phase that many of these teams and

17

others will be pairing up to submit one

18

individual response that will encompass all of

19

the needs of the City and the park district for

20

the RFP stage.

21

anything?

22

And we expect that

George, do you want to add

MR. MARQUISOS:

Only that we were incredibly

23

pleased with the quality and the number of the

24

responses to the RFQ.

There are quite a lot of

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 23

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

people who are very interested in participating

2

in this.

3

of view, we had to make a narrowing of the field,

4

if you will, to kind of make it somewhat

5

manageable.

6

wouldn't be manageable to kind of get this

7

project going.

8

decisions.

9

And we felt just from a logistics point

Reviewing 30 to 40 proposals just

So we had to make some hard

The 9 organizations that you see here

10

we see as being kind of key or primes.

11

the ability to recruit others in supporting

12

roles.

13

submitted qualifications will be able to team up

14

with these 9.

15

But we're saying that we don't want to have more

16

than 9 responses to the next phase.

17

meeting with these folks one on one as part of

18

the iterative process that we have established to

19

kind of verify the industry -- get some industry

20

input on our RFP and our specifications to make

21

sure that we're doing things that are in line

22

with what are best practices.

23
24

They have

And maybe some of the people who

MR. SCOTT:

So they're in no way precluded.

And we'll be

Alderman?

Just so I'm clear, so the 9

people that are on this short list, can --

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 24

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

they'll be primes when they submit.

2

would like, the 30 respondents from the other can

3

team up with them if they go out just to make

4

that -- that's correct?

5

MR. MARQUISOS:

6

MR. SCOTT:

7

That's correct.

Anybody that is not on that 30,

can they -- they can also --

8

MS. DARLING:

9

MR. SCOTT:

10

And if they

Absolutely.

Okay.

MS. DARLING:

Yes, there is, you know, as we

11

said in the RFQ, these are the teams that

12

submitted -- we're really selecting these folks

13

as possible primes, but the teams are not

14

formalized.

15

ventures or other teaming agreements to us and

16

were not required to during the RFQ phase.

17

those teams can still be formed and reformed not

18

only with those 30, but any other company that

19

wishes to participate as long as they're teamed

20

with one of these 9.

21

They have not submitted joint

So

And, again, you know, just to be 100

22

percent clear, we are following the City of

23

Chicago procurement rules.

24

goals of the City of Chicago which is 26 percent

And also the MBE/WBE

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 25

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1
2

MBE and 6 percent WBE as a goal.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

They should also note I

3

think that the names that are on this nine are

4

not reflective of that group in its entirety,

5

right?

6

individual name, they were -- they were part of a

7

submission.

8

the 30.

9

Some of these where you'll see an

Folks that you won't see there or on

MS. DARLING:

Right.

So we went with sort

10

of the teams that were referenced in the RFQ

11

cover letters and who the signatories were on the

12

cover letter and the submission.

13

this list sort of reflects.

14

right, there is certainly other team members of

15

some of these companies that are part of these

16

teams that, you know, certainly we expect would

17

be -- continue to be parts of those teams as they

18

moved forward.

19

And that's what

So, yes, you're

And also to be clear, we haven't --

20

these teams have not submitted what kind of light

21

fixture they would use.

22

get to that in a few minutes after we -- when we

23

talk about our light specs and our technology

24

specification committees and give you an update

And George is going to

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 26

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

on that.

2

about what light necessarily or we have not asked

3

them to say what light they would necessarily

4

use.

5

But nobody has provided information

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Any other questions on

6

the short list of respondents?

7

we --

8
9

MR. RAMIREZ:

Okay.

I think

So I do have a question and I

think this is more directed towards you, George.

10

So you said that you expect then moving forward

11

that some of these folks may jump in together and

12

move forward?

13

MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes, so we evaluated based

14

on the 12 criteria that we stated in the RFQ and

15

we scored them in a weighted capacity.

16

we looked at the scores and the standard

17

deviations.

18

evaluation committee whether there was general

19

consensus or there's some disagreement.

20

And then

So we kind of looked at how the

And after, as Leslie said, a pretty

21

thorough and involved conversation, we felt that

22

these 9 entities had the capacity and the proven

23

track record to not only deliver the project; but

24

be around 10 to 15 years from now when these

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 27

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

guarantees and other things -- so this is really

2

a list of people that we feel are qualified to

3

give us a proposal that is going to be of the

4

quality that the City needs for this kind of

5

project.

6
7
8
9

MR. RAMIREZ:

I think I recognize all but

one on that list and I would agree.
MS. CAFARO:

I think maybe you're getting to

the same question I have.

We understood from

10

your question that these people can team with

11

others in the 30 and others, but can they -- what

12

are the rules around them teaming with each

13

other?

14
15
16

Was that your question?

MR. RAMIREZ:

Yes, yes.

Look, I think it's

-- I think it's wide open.
MS. CAFARO:

Because of information flow and

17

things like that.

18

have for them teaming with each other?

19

MR. MARQUISOS:

What's the guidelines that we

The tricky part that we're

20

trying to balance here is to put it perfectly

21

clear is we're asking for qualifications without

22

fully defining the scope of work.

23

vision for what we think the project will look

24

like that we think is feasible, but we haven't

We have set a

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 28

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

really given -- this is exactly what we want you

2

to do.

3

them to put together teams to meet that undefined

4

scope.

5

to their approach and given us who their key

6

people are and what past projects they've done.

7

And based on that information we said, yes,

8

you're qualified and you have the capacity to

9

deliver.

10

And, therefore, it's not reasonable for

So they have given their best effort as

And now that we give them the scope of

11

work, they will go out and assemble the teams

12

that they feel are best suited to meet the

13

specific scope.

14

MR. RAMIREZ:

Because there are a couple now

15

that I think for sure would join and would be

16

smart for them to do it.

17

MR. MARQUISOS:

I think at the end of the

18

day we will probably get five or six responses

19

instead of nine, but we're just saying that these

20

folks have the ability to --

21
22
23
24

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

To Deb's question, there

won't be a limitation on teaming with each other?
MR. MARQUISOS:

Well, the general -- the

guidelines that we gave in the RFQ is if you are

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 29

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

performing more than 30 percent of the scope of

2

work which is somewhat undefined, then you're

3

considered to be a key or prime member.

4

less than 30 percent, you're considered to be a

5

supporting member and you can enlist as many

6

supporting members if you wish.

7

prime, then you really would be submitting your

8

own proposal.

9

MS. CAFARO:

Right.

If it's

But if you're a

I guess where I'm going

10

with it is we would have to end up with enough

11

proposals obviously to have a deeper pool of --

12

and then also information flow.

13

example, when we are bidding on deals and we have

14

a lender and maybe one lender is going to give

15

certain terms.

16

amongst all the different people, it could color

17

the bidding.

18

rules around --

19
20
21

Because, for

And if that information goes

And that's my question, are their

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

You're talking about

exclusively.
MS. CAFARO:

Information flow.

Exclusivity.

22

Both, right.

Either one person teaming up with

23

everybody which then could color the bids one way

24

or one person only be willing to team up with one

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 30

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

other person which is the opposite problem.

2

what are the, you know, are we thinking about

3

operating principles amongst the primes to make

4

sure we get the outcomes that we want without --

5
6
7
8
9

MR. MARQUISOS:
now.

Yes.

So

I get your question

And, yes, we -MS. CAFARO:

Sorry, it was not clear at

first.
MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes, so that is part of the

10

next process.

So when we inform these folks that

11

they're the successful shortlisted respondents,

12

they will also be signing nondisclosure

13

agreements.

14

one-on-one conversations where we ask for their

15

input on the draft documents, they will limit

16

their communications.

17

that, there is nothing hidden here.

18

we're trying to --

So when they enter into these

19

MS. CAFARO:

20

MR. MARQUISOS:

And -- but having said
I mean,

Right, I'm sure.
We are trying to balance

21

that having a fully transparent process, but also

22

like you say not to have a competitive one as

23

well.

24

MS. CAFARO:

It's a delicate balance that

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 31

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1
2

you, I'm sure, will get right.
MS. DARLING:

It is.

And it's very

3

important to us to drive the right amount of

4

competition for this process and be sure that

5

we're getting the best value for the state.

6

MS. CAFARO:

7

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

8

MR. AFFRUNTI:

9

Sure.
Ralph, did you have a --

It just seemed to me like you

-- that there were no technology based companies.

10

I would have expected Google to get involved in

11

something like this.

12

way that you sent it out not being very specific

13

on, you know, what type of fixture and things

14

like that that you eliminated people in the

15

technology field?

16

MR. MARQUISOS:

Do you think because of the

It's a very good question.

17

And so we -- we were looking for the AT&T's and

18

Googles to -- and Google is a part of the ComEd

19

team in kind of a supporting role.

20

evaluating the City of Chicago for their

21

broadband Google fiber initiative.

22

might be a synergy there.

23
24

They are

And so there

We met with the Google folks
informally prior to this process starting and

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 32

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

they are acutely aware of it.

2

interested.

3

how best to play in this arena.

4

folks interested.

5

we'll see.

6

phasing, I think we will get better answers to

7

these questions.

8
9

They are

They are just trying to figure out
So there are

How they ultimately team up

Once we define the scope and the

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I think Ralph's question

is an informative one as it relates to the

10

delivery of the RFP and sort of clarity around

11

the desire to seek new technology and making sure

12

that that's abundantly clear and widely sort of

13

known amongst potential respondents.

14

MR. AFFRUNTI:

I think it's huge because of

15

the way technology works now, you know, most of

16

the time by the time you have a print for

17

something, by the time you actually put it in the

18

building --

19

MR. O'SHEA:

There's a better one out there.

20

MR. AFFRUNTI:

There's another one out

21

there.

22

you might have a better chance to having the

23

newest greatest thing.

24

So if we can get more technology based

MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes, it's a big challenge

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 33

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

and you have to jump into the stream or the

2

rapidly flowing river at some point.

3

kind of walk that line of creating a bankable

4

project, something we think is visible and real

5

versus -- and then -- and allow for the capacity

6

to be innovative and forward thinking and future

7

ready, whatever the term you want to use.

8

we're cognizant of it, but I think you have to do

9

something to kind of start somewhere.

10

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

We tried to

So

Any other questions

11

regarding the list here?

13

the team to request final proposals for the

entertain a motion.

MR. LINGENFELTER:

2

contracting and, you know --

3

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Great question.

4

MR. LINGENFELTER:

-- starting?

5

MS. DARLING:

That is a great question.

6

What we have previously discussed is hopefully

7

having the process completed by year's end with

8

construction beginning in Q1 of 2017.

9

I think we are still likely on target for that.

10

We hope there won't be slippage, but, you know,

11

obviously we are cognizant of our timeline now.

12

I think we are hoping to stay in that timeline.

13

MR. LINGENFELTER:

Right now

I would say it's

14

important to include that timeline and get

15

feedback on that as you go into those vendor

16

discussions, you know, because that will be part

17

of the planning process.

18

MS. DARLING:

Absolutely.

And we know that

19

the timeline that we set out at the beginning of

20

this process was very aggressive.

21

working diligently to stick to it as much as

22

possible.

So we're

23

MR. MARQUISOS:

And I think, you know, just

24

to comment on that.

I think we have a very good

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 35

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

shot at getting something started.

I don't think

2

it will be the entire City.

3

information we got both from the RFI process and

4

from discussing with other metropolitan -- large

5

metropolitan areas, New York, Philly and LA;

6

everyone kind of recommended a phased or tiered

7

approach.

8

change and you adapt.

9

up with a plan.

And I think that the

Because you learn as you go and things
And so we're going to come

Obviously vetting with these

10

nine folks to kind of rolling this out in a way

11

that makes sense and allows us to kind of develop

12

as we go.

13

MS. DARLING:

And what we have said from the

14

beginning is this would be a phased project and

15

we believe it's going to take 3 to 4 years before

16

it's completely built and the LED's are fully

17

installed in 85 percent of the City.

18

though we expect to be able to start the project,

19

it's still going to take a significant amount of

20

time to do the whole City.

21

So even

That is also an aggressive timeline, 3

22

to 4 years.

Other cities are taking longer.

23

We're hoping to do it more quickly in order to

24

achieve the energy savings on a faster timeline.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 36

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

But it will take a ramp up to get all the

2

installations and infrastructure stabilization

3

work done.

4

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And, Ralph, to your

5

point, you know, technology can change in the

6

next four years.

7

we're hitting in the stream and the need for

8

technology we use to be adaptable and sort of

9

flexible for future iterations.

10

So they're very aware of where

MS. DARLING:

Okay.

Thank you for your

11

approval.

12

more detailed update on where we are on both the

13

lighting specifications and the technology

14

specifications.

15

to George and sharing those efforts.

16

We do want to give you a little bit

And so I'm going to turn it over

MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes, so it's a fascinating

17

process.

And they're -- I don't know if you're

18

aware of it like I am, but there is a lot of --

19

it's a kind of a hot-button topic right now.

20

Like are LED's bad for you?

21

consequences?

22

things going on here that -- you know, we're not

23

sure this is a good idea.

24

but at what cost?

Are there health

And beware, Chicago, there's

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 37

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

So we're acutely aware of the -- I

2

would call the emerging information.

I think the

3

AMA recently came out with a recommendation, if

4

you will.

5

be summarized in more research is needed.

6

there are a couple of concerns and -- that we are

a lot of discourse that's happening right now as

we are specifying light levels as to what the

best thing to do with LED's.

MR. SCOTT:

And the
And the

And so there is

So I know that in other cities

17

they've started projects similar to this.

18

research have we gathered from -- and New York is

19

on a similar program, correct?

20

MR. MARQUISOS:

21

MR. SCOTT:

What

New York is ahead of us.

What have we gathered from the

22

research that they've had?

Have they had any

23

adverse effects with this kind of lighting in

24

their Cities?

MR. MARQUISOS:

So I'm in communication with

2

the head of CDOT in New York or NDOT I guess it's

3

called.

4

-- we can spend hours talking about lighting

5

specifications.

6

very complex topic, but the thing that everyone

7

was talking about is what color temperature.

8

you doing warm white or cool white?

9

And they have a current light spec.

I

I've come to understand it's a

Are

And New York is currently speccing

10

4100.

4000 Kelvin cool.

Which is pretty cool

11

like plus or minus 500 degrees Kelvin.

12

anything between 3500 and 4500 meets the New York

13

spec.

14

spec based on --

So

And they are currently not changing that

15

MR. SCOTT:

Their research.

16

MR. MARQUISOS:

-- anything that has come

17

out to this date.

18

what the lighting specification is going to be

19

other than to assure you that it's going to be a

20

thoughtful process.

21

going I am happy to share a little bit on.

22

I am not going to state today

The way that our process is

So we have half a dozen experts on

23

this committee.

Some are City folks who have

24

specified lighting for years.

And some are

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 39

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

outside such matter experts who are telling us

2

what the latest and greatest and what other

3

people are doing.

4

we are adapting to our current City of Chicago

5

spec.

And we have a model spec that

6

And the path that we have decided to

7

do is a lot of these health concerns are really

8

less about the color of the light.

9

the light is kind of a perception thing.

The color of
I view

10

this warmer and I like it better.

And this is

11

cooler and I like it less.

12

Circadian rhythm thing and disrupting sleep

13

patterns and everything has much less to do with

14

the color of the light than it does the exposure

15

and intensity of the light.

But the whole

16

And so we're trying to make sure --

17

very sure regardless of the color of the light

18

that we land on that we are putting that light as

19

accurately as we can where we need it.

20

distribution aspect is more critical to us at

21

this juncture from a specification point of view.

22

So the

And so right now a bulb technology we

23

just turn on the light; it goes wherever it

24

wants, up, down, all around.

It doesn't matter.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 40

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

It's a light bulb.

2

direct that light much more accurately.

3

We now have the ability to

For sure we're not going to have any

4

light that is transmitting above the head, right.

5

So there is not going to be any light allowed

6

above the horizon line of the lamppost.

7

minimum.

8
9

That's a

We know that for sure.
How we disperse lights given that we

have an existing set of poles at a distance and a

10

height is a difficult question.

11

defining a lot of different typical contexts.

12

this an alley context.

13

context.

14

we're specifying distribution patterns and light

15

levels for each of those contexts.

16

be different products that better meet those

17

needs for individuals.

18

in-depth analysis we're doing now.

19

So we're
So

This is a residential

This is a residential new context.

MR. SCOTT:

And

And there may

So that's the kind of

So when you do that analysis

20

will there be a different, you know, you talk

21

about the warmness and the coolness and the

22

degree of the light; will we be changing those

23

for alleys and -- so we can have some that are a

24

little bit warmer and a little bit cooler

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 41

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

depending on where they're placed and their

2

height.

3

the same -- the same degree of light, but just

4

angled a little bit differently?

5

Or are we going to spec across the board

MR. MARQUISOS:

Okay.

I think I understand

6

your question.

7

general specification that all LED lights must

8

meet.

9
10

MR. SCOTT:

So we are going to have one

Okay.

MR. MARQUISOS:

Okay.

So that is this is

11

how they are going to have to prove they're built

12

and then testing.

13

that's associated with them and how they dim.

14

All that stuff is going to be universal to

15

whatever LED gets installed.

16

MR. SCOTT:

17

MR. MARQUISOS:

And how they -- the data

Right.
Specifically we are going to

18

give photometric requirements on how the light

19

gets dispersed and the light levels and the light

20

trespass based on a context.

21

So you will have a photometric

22

requirement for the alley.

Photometric

23

requirements for the corner.

24

requirements for -- you know, we have right now

Photometric

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

working eight to ten different contexts that we

2

think are, quote, unquote, typical Chicago

3

situations.

4

MR. SCOTT:

Okay.

5

MR. MARQUISOS:

And so it will be up to the

6

industry to come back with the best products that

7

they feel meet that specific need.

8

MR. SCOTT:

Okay.

9

MS. DARLING:

But we do expect, Alderman,

10

for example, your residential streets will be

11

handled different than your arterial streets and

12

your alleys.

13

and that's what this group has spent so much

14

time --

15

So there will be different contexts

MR. SCOTT:

I got it.

16

answered the question.

17

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

18
19

You more than

I got it.

I got it.

Good transition to

adaptive lighting.
MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes.

And so in addition to

20

kind of specifying, you know, how we want to

21

distribute the light and the intensity of the

22

light; we also want these fixtures to have the

23

capability to dim, right.

24

engaged in -- I'm not promising anything, but

And we are currently

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 43

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

there is a movement afoot that suggests that

2

Chicago might be a really good candidate to be

3

the kind of leader in adaptive lighting.

4

So when we define these contexts we

5

not only define them based on worst case

6

scenarios, but we define them on -- throughout

7

the day and throughout the year.

8

example, if this intersection needs a lot of

9

light during rush hour, let's provide it.

So, for

If it

10

needs much less in the middle of the night, let's

11

tone it down.

12

Because if the light isn't needed

13

because there really isn't any kind of pedestrian

14

conflict situation, then we have the ability to

15

reduce accordingly.

16

will be a leader in that regard.

17

leader in converting to LED, but I think we can

18

be the leader in how we implement LED and how we

19

control it.

20

And so we think that Chicago

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

We're not the

One thing that I think is

21

an important note here and something I think we

22

should look at with the staff, you know, there is

23

a -- we talked about early on in this project;

24

but there is a significant public safety element

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 44

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

to this as well.

2

capabilities not only allow us to have better

3

energy efficiency and have usage meet demand and

4

needs, but part of demand and needs also enable,

5

you know, better lighting for public safety aid.

6

And the adaptive lighting

If there is an incident in an area,

7

the ability to turn up the lights.

If there is a

8

pursuit of a perpetrator, you know, any of those

9

type of things happen, there has been a violent

10

event, something like that which we know happens

11

far too often in the City.

12

And I think, you know, speaking with

13

the Mayor it's one of the things that he is most

14

excited about.

15

Superintendent last week.

16

should go over and sort of brief him proper about

17

it.

18

immediately thought about all the ways this helps

19

him do his job better.

20

who fight to serve and protect us.

21

I just spoke with the
And I think that we

But just sort of in conversation he

And his team and people

So I think, you know, this is -- and

22

as George said not a promise, but sure has a lot

23

of upside for us in more than traditional ways

24

here in Chicago.

I think we should -- I know

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 45

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

he's out of town this week, but maybe in the next

2

couple weeks try to find time to talk to him.

3

MS. DARLING:

4

MR. MARQUISOS:

5

-- go ahead, Damon.

6

MR. SILVERS:

Of course.
And the other part I wanted

Yes, thank you.

Let me just

7

add to our Chair's comments about this.

I think

8

the focus on adaptive lighting is a good idea.

9

just have a question now about the kind of

I

10

problem that I think, you know, is the kind of

11

problem that it's all too important to address as

12

you are pushing the sort of technology envelope

13

which is how are you all thinking about the

14

question of how not -- how to have, you know,

15

technology platform here that can adapt with

16

time.

17

improves.

That can be improved upon as technology

18

As I was listening to the description

19

of types of adaptive lighting kind of structures

20

you were describing in certain things, sometimes

21

that can kind of get locked into a certain way of

22

doing it as technology moves.

23

you were thinking about with the -- with the

24

project managers, the companies that we're

And I wondered how

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 46

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

selecting to make the technology we choose

2

initially as kind of adaptable themselves as

3

possible going forward?

4
5

MR. MARQUISOS:

That's a great question and

it's a perfect segue to the next slide.

6

MR. SILVERS:

7

MR. MARQUISOS:

So --

Okay.
This is the process we are

8

deploying for lighting luminaire specification.

9

So basically this is at the end of the day we

10

will have a document that will get sent out to

11

various folks who manufacture LED fixtures.

12

it will say this is what we need -- this is what

13

we need from your products.

14

Now, go to the next slide.

And

So we also

15

have another subcommittee equally comprised of

16

dedicated experts both inhouse and nationwide to

17

help us define the technology that we're going to

18

be using for this centralized lighting management

19

system.

20

Right.
So what we're selling here is that not

21

only do the -- not only do the lights have the

22

ability to dim, but we will have realtime

23

information of when they're on or off or whether

24

they're failing and all that.

And we want to be

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 47

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

able to kind of remotely control and monitor that

2

system.

That's a core functionality.

3

But to Damon's point we also want the

4

technology to be adaptable and also integrate

5

into our current systems which is a big

6

challenge.

7

ward calls 311 and says the light is out in front

8

of my house.

9

goes through a process.

Right.

So right now someone in your

That generates a work order that
We are now going to have

10

a system that supposedly supplants that call, but

11

that doesn't stop the call from coming in.

12

Right.

13

about the same light.

14

out how do we integrate that work order so we're

15

not duplicating.

16

So we could have simultaneous information
And so we have to figure

And so these are all kind of somewhat

17

intricate questions that we are trying to specify

18

as openly and concisely as possible so we can get

19

the feedback from these folks who are experts and

20

issue this kind of technology.

21

But it is a -- it is a very

22

interesting question about certainly if you're a

23

leader in this field.

24

there's national standards about light levels

Because right now we know

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 48

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

that you have to maintain based on certain

2

intersections and how many cars and how many

3

pedestrians and all that kind of stuff.

4

also know that it's recognized that those

5

conditions change over time or during the course

6

of a day or during the season.

7

real recommendations about what light -- when you

8

make those changes, how do you make those

9

discretionary changes and when do you raise the

And we

But there is no

10

light levels because you suspect a heightened --

11

so that is where Chicago will be leading.

12

will be making those kind of discretionary

13

decisions.

14

MR. SCOTT:

We

So that's what I was just

15

thinking like in the future will there -- you

16

know, we're talking about traffic patterns and

17

how the nodes will be savvy technologically.

18

Will there ever be a point where -- and I know

19

this might be in the future, but where, you know,

20

if traffic increases on this block that the

21

lights kind of raise because there is a heavier

22

traffic either driver or pedestrian wise.

23
24

And we're talking about public safety
when there are certain people gathered -- not

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 49

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

certain people, but an amount of people gathered

2

on a corner, those lights will come up because of

3

the movement of the individuals that are there or

4

the traffic that is going by.

5

technology will allow that down the future.

6

I am sure

In the future is that something that

7

we're thinking of long-term?

I know not now, but

8

having the ability to move when that -- that sort

9

of thing moves.

10

MS. CAFARO:

11

MR. SCOTT:

12

MR. MARQUISOS:

13

technology exists today.

14

who are doing it in Europe.

There's not a lot of

15

people doing it in the U.S.

And it's a question

16

at what cost.

17

things and get validation from the industry as

18

to, you know, how best to deploy this, quote,

19

unquote, adaptive lighting strategy.

20

Like sensors versus decisions.
Correct.

Correct.

Correct.

The reality is the
And there are people

And we are trying to weigh those

But we're -- I think we're committing

21

to the notion that we're no longer just turning

22

the whole City at dusk full intensity everywhere.

23

Right.

24

something a little bit different.

And we're just kind of -- think about
And I think

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 50

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1
2

we'll progress as we learn more.
MR. SCOTT:

And I know that over time, you

3

know, smart phones used to be $500, $600.

4

They're now $2, $300.

5

go down.

6

then, those are other options that we can look at

7

down the line.

And they are continuing to

So as the price continues to decrease

8

MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes.

9

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Yes, I think that what we

10

talked about early on was having sort of maximum

11

flexibility of the technology and to -- to add

12

potentially going in the future things we can't

13

afford now.

14

know, it's a difficult thing because then you

15

incur the cost potentially of going back up and

16

then, you know, doing the work again, right.

17

it's, you know, sort of measure twice, cut once

18

is the ideal.

19

But what happens with that, you

MR. MARQUISOS:

So

And to that point visiting

20

the poles twice maybe that's really to Damon's

21

question, we are specifying what we think is the

22

latest technology in terms of receptacles.

23

There's the seven pin technology.

24

ability to add to it, either sensors underneath

It has the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 51

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

or nodes on top or different type of

2

communication devices.

3

into the luminaires.

4

with them now.

5

recognizes this is the direction.

6

manufactures are offering it at little to no

7

extra cost.

8

utilize those seven pins is still to be

9

determined.

We will have that built
We expect all of them come

It's no longer even -- everyone
So all the

So that will be there.

10

MR. SCOTT:

11

MS. DARLING:

How we

Okay.
And there is a cost associated

12

with all that new technology.

So we are -- we

13

are going to be very budget driven on this

14

project.

15

very much as we possibly can within the financial

16

constraints that we have.

17

priority that we want to include as technology to

18

serve the residents of the state.

And so we are going to accomplish as

But it is certainly a

19

MR. MARQUISOS:

And, okay, two more points

20

then we'll move on.

To the previous slide part

21

of our specification process involves a proof of

22

concept trial installation.

23

once we think we know what we want and how the

24

light should be dispersed in a particular

So this is where

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 52

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

context, we'll install some.

2

Alderman and their constituents go visit those

3

areas and give their opinions on whether the

4

light is adequate, whether it's cool, too warm.

5

And we'll let the

And we'll collect that kind of

6

information and kind of -- because right now

7

we're working pretty much on calculated light

8

levels based on what we currently have on the

9

City.

And so what we expect the LED will

10

comprise.

11

large variation in the way that people perceive

12

light.

13

So until we actually see it, there's a

And so right now I may be delivering

14

two-foot candles with the high pressure sodium

15

and I can deliver one foot candles with LED.

16

people will say that's way brighter than what you

17

used to have even though I'm delivering more --

18

half the light than I was previously.

19

about perceptions.

20

it as well as put it down on paper.

21

And

It's all

And so we're going to approve

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

This is an area I'm sure

22

our two Aldermen here can appreciate this.

You

23

know, the Mayor is very focussed on this part of

24

the process in getting public feedback.

Leslie

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 53

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

is focussing -- committed to that.

2

you know, there is a view about how we will get

3

it done and how long it takes.

4

know, we want to rely on your counsel there to

5

make sure that, you know, it's sort of done the

6

right way with the adequate amount of time and we

7

are able to capture the feedback in a way that

8

doesn't make promises we can't deliver on.

9

make sure that everyone's voices are heard in

10
11

And I think,

But I think, you

But

kind of an ability to provide the feedback.
MR. RAMIREZ:

I just think that what is

12

going to help us with that is the adaptive

13

lighting piece of it.

14

that were raised and a lot of the criticisms

15

around the country, if they had the adaptive

16

lighting concept this would be a whole different

17

ball game.

18

other than run towards the adaptive lighting

19

stuff.

20

I mean, a lot of concerns

I don't think we should do anything

Having been to a lot of meetings on

21

this stuff and you guys are all over it, all the

22

points that need to be hit are being hit on this.

23

So the adaptive lighting piece is absolutely

24

critical for this and from a policing perspective

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 54

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

as well.

2

You know, I would love to be a part of

3

that meeting with the Superintendent because his

4

eyes are going to pop out of his head when you

5

tell him.

6

well.

7

future to the Alderman's question, you know, a

8

lot of the policing strategies can be

9

complemented maybe through the police department

I'm sure they're researching it as

But that's another thing that in the

10

themselves.

11

can do with these later on.

12

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

13
14
15
16

You know, there's things that they
They could --

Agreed.

I think, you

know -MR. RAMIREZ:

Maybe they can purchase on

their own.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

-- we had a conversation

17

about another topic and I kind of mentioned this

18

in passing.

19

get pretty wide and I think he is excited and

20

looking forward to it.

21

MS. DARLING:

You're right, his eyes did -- did

And we are going to look at --

22

you know, I don't want to get too deep into this

23

conversation because it's really in the

24

preliminary stages; but I think that, you know,

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 55

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

we'll look at every which way to get that

2

finance.

3

the police department has a Homeland Security

Fund or --

You know, perhaps there is -- perhaps

MR. RAMIREZ:

9

That's what I'm getting at.
Or the county.

The hot spot areas I think

that -MS. DARLING:

So we are going to look at

10

that and be thoughtful about what all our options

11

are to bring to bear the most resources to this

12

project.

13

MR. RAMIREZ:

Right.

And I just think the

14

last piece for folks, the adaptive lighting

15

piece, will actually save money over time which

16

is nice as well.

17

MR. MARQUISOS:

18

MS. DARLING:

Okay.
Shall we move on?

Any other

19

questions on this?

20

brief update on the Home Buyer Assistance

21

Program.

22

I wanted to give you a very

So this is officially -- the program

23

has officially launched.

Lenders began accepting

24

loan applications in June.

Last week the program

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

closed on its first loan -- a condo in the 2nd

2

Ward.

3

loan reservations and that equals 43 loans.

4

you can see the average loan amount is 204 --

5

about $204,000; $205,000.

6

income is just over 100 percent of the City's

7

median, about $76,000.

As of last Wednesday about $8.8 million in

As

And the qualifying

So we are really pleased about the
great start that this program has had.

We are

continuing to work on signing up additional

11

lenders.

14

website and the City's website all have

15

information about the Home Buyer Assistance

16

Program.

17

We have 6 so far.

Inland came online

And will be posted on our

But both our website the Treasurer's

It's getting a lot of good attention

18

in the lending world.

And, in fact, I think

19

there may have been some -- a little bit of media

20

this morning.

21

personally, but I think there was something out

22

there.

23

did come out.

24

great start that we've gotten and are looking

I wasn't -- I didn't catch it

But I will send you some clips if that
But we are really pleased at the

 57

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

forward to really growing this program

2

exponentially, you know, through this year and

3

well through next year so.

4

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Can you give the context?

5

I think originally we -- when we sort of talked

6

about this and talked to George K. Baum, we

7

talked about, you know, roughly maybe $20 million

8

in transactions was your estimate, $20 or $30

9

million from the last time the program was done.

10

MS. DARLING:

Yes, in the early 2000's the

11

City had a program.

12

largest year of the program.

13

will be a ramp up to that.

14

know, people are learning about the program.

15

know that Guaranteed Rate has been marketing it

16

very -- you know, they've put in a lot of effort

17

to market it and they have the most loans so far.

18

And I think that was the

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So I think there
But certainly, you
I

So I say that to say that

19

I think, you know, we're almost half way at where

20

the City was in its peak the last time they did

21

this program.

22

you know, the team and in large part, but it also

23

speaks to the need.

24

think we can -- we have something here that is a

That's due to the great work of,

And, you know, I honestly

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 58

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

real value and not enough people still know about

2

it.

3

You know, I know the Aldermen and

4

community -- some community members have included

5

it in their newsletters and things like that,

6

but, you know, I think you can expect to see from

7

us a more active proactive approach with this now

8

that we know, hey, this works.

9

right sort of target.

You know, average

10

qualified income of 76,000.

11

a $200,000 home.

12

below median.

13

and where we want to be.

14

It's hitting the

We're talking about

And these are all sort of at or

And this is exactly where we're at

And so we will be reaching out to

15

folks.

16

program for City employees.

17

program for trade members.

18

program for, you know, sort of folks in your

19

wards.

20

this makes a lot of sense for and we want to be a

21

lot more proactive about it now that we sort of

22

have the proof point that it works and something

23

that people are excited about.

24

I mean, my view is this is a great
This is a great
This is a great

Everybody here has a constituency that

MS. DARLING:

We know that -- you're exactly

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 59

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

right, Kurt.

I think that we know that as people

2

come back from the recession, ways of keeping

3

people from investing and being able to become a

4

homeowner is that they don't have a savings to

5

pay for a down payment.

So this assists people

6

with that down payment.

So that these are folks

7

that have stable income, good jobs.

8

don't have a savings.

9

across that hurdle, and we are pleased to be

They just

So this helps people

10

working on that and will continue to spread the

11

word and work with you on making sure that people

12

know about this program.

13

MR. RAMIREZ:

Leslie, can we have the

14

previous slide?

15

to us that we -- can we get that slide?

16

Is that something you sent out

MS. DARLING:

17

I just received.

18

you.

19

MR. RAMIREZ:

Sure.

That's information that

So I'm happy to share that with

Yes, because I don't remember

20

seeing that.

I'll tell you why.

There are a few

21

hundred thousand folks that have good,

22

well-paying jobs in City that can probably take

23

advantage of this through all the different labor

24

organizations.

They have a steady stream income.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 60

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

So now that we have the numbers.

2

talked about this before as well.

3

now that we have some of this, we can use that to

4

promote this.

5

And, Kurt, we
So but I think

And I think you'll see an uptake.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

What we may want to do,

6

and you can tell if this works; but we've got

7

some good collateral to sort of put an easy thing

8

together.

9

out at meetings.

They can put in newsletters or pass

10

already.

11

the lenders are.

12

You know, we've got material

The only thing that gets updated is who

MR. RAMIREZ:

You know, so it would be -And, Kurt, it might even be

13

worth paying for a mailing with some of these

14

folks.

15

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Yes.

It would be an easy

16

maybe -- first of all, it makes us money as an

17

organization, right.

18

thing to.

19
20
21

MR. RAMIREZ:

Good news for our bonuses,

guys.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:
get paid double.

Jorge, you're going to

For the record that is a joke.

3

MR. RAMIREZ:

And for the record 100 percent

4

of nothing is nothing.

5

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And I do think that a

6

thing we can make -- you don't have to take that

7

and figure out a graph.

8

graph it and sort of broadly distribute it.

9

MS. DARLING:

I think we can kind of

We will do that and we'll work

10

to get that out to you as soon as possible.

11

that information as it stands is on our website,

12

the Treasurer's website and the City's website

13

right now.

14

MR. RAMIREZ:

Yes, this is great.

15

MS. DARLING:

We're excited about it.

16

you.

17

update on Retrofit One.

18

MR. MARQUISOS:

So we are slowly losing our

audience here so I'll tailor my remarks

20

accordingly.

22

Thank

So now George is going to give you a quick

19

21

But

MR. RAMIREZ:

Save street lighting for last

next time.

23

MS. DARLING:

24

MR. MARQUISOS:

Exactly.
All right.

So Retrofit One

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 62

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

is, for those of you who haven't heard, have

2

completed or substantially completed in June of

3

2015.

4

ESCO's responsibility to deliver an annual

5

savings report to the City that documents,

6

monitors and verifies whether the savings that

7

they promised in their performance contract was

8

actually achieved.

It was the ESCO's responsibility -- is the

9

We just -- we not just over the last

10

couple of months, we've received various drafts

11

of the first year.

12

report, but it's not a full annual year.

13

from June 1st to December 31st.

14

them to come back with the report that says what

15

did we actually do after a year worth of all of

16

these efforts.

17

It's called a stub-year
It goes

And so we asked

And the news is largely very good.

I

18

think the stub-year posts some challenges in a

19

couple of large buildings that kind of held the

20

savings back a little bit because it took us a

21

while to get things right, especially the

22

building automation systems; but the outlook for

23

the next 14 years is very good.

24

We are actually going to achieve in

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 63

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

excess of not only the guarantee, but the

2

projected.

3

calculate how much energy the City will save if

4

they do these measures that they recommend.

5

they say we will guarantee that you will get at

6

least this much which is a subset of the

7

projected.

8

I come back next year, you'll see we'll be

9

something in excess of the projected.

So just as a refresher the ESCO's

And so we're on track.

And

I think when

Okay.

We

10

didn't get there.

11

the stub year, but we are short of the projected.

12

We're above the guarantee for

But I think in viewing every one of

13

the buildings we're seeing a pattern of just

14

progressively better and better savings.

15

things are getting better.

16

we're 110 percent, 115 percent of what the

17

projected was.

18

MR. RAMIREZ:

So

And in most cases

George, can you answer this, I

19

mean, I think it's obvious; but I don't

20

understand how the even a larger scale would --

21

how the numbers would work.

22

been done according to the original size that was

23

proposed, I know it would have been even greater

24

a savings on a per unit basis; but how much -- do

But had this project

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 64

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

we have a ballpark for how much better it could

2

have been if we had gone with the larger

3

scaled-up version?

4

MR. MARQUISOS:

Okay.

So we ended up saying

5

that this project is going to save a

6

million-and-a-half dollars over 60 projects and

7

with the 15-year payback.

8

assumption that the cost of energy would not

9

escalate at all.

10
11

And having an

So what you are paying in 2012,

you will be paying 15 years later.
If we defined a project that had a

12

20-year term and a slightly escalating rate of

13

energy costs which I think is realistic although

14

we're now in kind of a market that is flat, but I

15

don't think it's unreasonable to expect that at

16

some point we are going to start seeing energy

17

costs creep up again.

18

think you're talking about a project that would

19

be 2 to 3 times as large without -- and still be

20

a conservative project.

21

If you did that then I

The challenge with the City in energy

22

only projects is when President Obama's

23

Reinvestment Act money came out they were looking

24

for several ready projects and the City took

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 65

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

advantage of that.

And they picked a lot of

2

loaning fruit by converting lights all over the

3

City.

4

fluorescent bulb anywhere in a City owned

5

building.

6

to convert all that stuff.

So you will be hard pressed to find a D12

7

And that was because we used our money

And that leaves kind of deeper

8

retrofits, bigger pieces of equipment.

And they

9

have longer paybacks and it's tougher to justify

10

on an energy only basis.

11

monetizing the operational savings which are

12

real, but are difficult to quantify and difficult

13

to kind of -- kind of politically tough to sell

14

too.

15

You have to start

So that's a long winded way of saying

16

there is possibilities of doing bigger and more

17

things and we're looking at that as part of our

18

2017 pipeline, but as we get into this we want to

19

be very cognizant of the kind of project we

20

choose.

21

how successful you are going to be.

22
23
24

Because that really is the key factor in

MR. RAMIREZ:

I have a lot of ideas around

that.
MR. MARQUISOS:

Well, you're timing is

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 66

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

perfect because we are meeting with 2FM to talk

2

about Retrofit Two.

3

MR. RAMIREZ:

Which should include

4

geothermal.

You look at some of these places

5

that are doing it now.

6

installation of one of them at one of our locals

7

in Countryside is doing it for their entire

8

operation.

9

things like that, you can pipe that stuff into

I went and saw the

But you talk about snow removal and

10

the walkways and wouldn't have to worry about

11

snow removal or salt or anything like that.

12

easy to do and very cost efficient to do it.

13

We have about 20 companies in the

Very

14

Chicagoland area alone that can do it which would

15

allow you to get some good healthy competition as

16

well.

17

the point where you can afford to do it on a

18

residential basis; but definitely the schools and

19

the City buildings and things like that, we

20

should be looking at that in the Retro Two.

21
22
23
24

But they've got it down.

MS. DARLING:

It's almost to

We would like to talk to you

more about that.
MR. RAMIREZ:

Yes, I can take you to see it.

It's amazing.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 67

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

MS. DARLING:

Great.

2

MR. MARQUISOS:

Okay.

There is much more

3

detailed information about what each building did

4

and didn't do.

5

into it here, but it's certainly available to you

6

if you wanted to drill down further on these

7

savings reports.

8

versions right now and they'll be available for

9

you review any time.

10

And we can -- I'm not going to go

We're finalizing the final

The next slide is talking a little bit

11

about -- and I'm going to really make this brief

12

because you can go on and on.

13

energy efficiency projects people tend to focus

14

about, okay, great, you saved a million, four.

15

That's fantastic, but really -- is that worth

16

doing?

17

a $6 billion budget, but there are other very

18

compelling reasons to do energy projects --

But talking about

And it's a relative drop in the bucket on

19

MR. RAMIREZ:

20

MR. MARQUISOS:

Thanks to David Hoffman.
And some of the uses -- some

21

of the projects that we ended up doing and how

22

they evolved during the installation period

23

really offered some I think valuable insight as

24

to how valuable these projects are from

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

 68

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

non-energy.

2

are really kind of extraordinary.

3

having people come in and start focussing on how

4

a building is consuming energy really gives

5

insight into what is the optimal way to manage

6

and operate this building.

7

So the kind of ancillary benefits
And just

So it's all about adding another

8

perspective.

And those who are operating a

9

building based on customer comfort or complaints,

10

that's one way.

11

other perspectives, you start getting significant

12

opportunities for changes that you never kind of

13

envisioned.

14

But if you start adding in some

Real briefly one example that I found

15

fascinating was the Harold Washington Library.

16

It's a very unique building in that all those

17

beautiful lights that you see there are

18

metal-halide lights.

19

perspective highly inefficient because they

20

generate a tremendous amount of heat when they

21

produce light.

22

And they are from our

And in 1990 this building was

23

conceived of as being incredibly innovative by

24

saying we're not even going to put a heating

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 69

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

system in the building.

2

so big and so dense with all the books that the

3

lights alone will provide the heat.

4

an all electric building.

5

you see there are the heaters as well as the

6

lighters of that building.

7

We'll just make the mass

And so it's

And those lights that

So the ESCO's looked at it and said,

8

well, you know, that building consumes a whole

9

lot of electricity.

And turns out that most of

10

the time you were trying to cool that building

11

rather than heat -- rather than try to heat it.

12

And so we think there is an opportunity to kind

13

of reduce the wattages of these inefficient bulbs

14

and still save you some money.

15

And we said, well, you know, that's a

16

great idea, but we don't want people cold, right.

17

So don't take away our heat.

18

we've done the calcs.

19

stand behind it.

20

35 watts and every one of those bulbs you'll

21

still have plenty of heat and you get all these

22

savings.

23
24

And they said, no,

We'll guarantee.

We'll

We can reduce the wattages by

We signed up for it.

And they went in

and they installed the lights and what did they

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 70

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

discover?

2

turn out to be white at all.

3

green and gray.

4

going on with that?

5

The new bulbs that they put in didn't
They were mostly

And they were like, well, what's

So we brought Phillips and all the

6

experts in from around the country and said,

7

what's going on here?

8

discover is that over the last 30 years this

9

building's lighting system has slowly been

And what we came to

10

degrading and no one has really perceived it

11

because it's been so gradual.

12

levels that we were delivering in the Harold

13

Washington Library were significantly lower than

14

when the building opened.

15

So the light

And so we found a cost effective way

16

of upgrading the ballast system that provides the

17

energy to those lights by changing a $20

18

component.

19

to the levels it did on day one.

20

beautiful, right.

21

And low and behold the library lit up
Which is all

As we rolled this out on a floor by

22

floor basis, people starting migrating to the

23

floors that had the new lights and new ballasts

24

because the light was so much whiter and brighter

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 71

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

and you could read clearer.

2

really good except that we started burning more

3

electricity.

4

capacitors so the reduction that we were

5

expecting based on the wattage reduction was

6

offset by the fact that they were now powering

7

the lights like they were supposed to be powered

8

and we didn't realize it had degraded over this

9

time.

10

Right.

And that was all

Because we fixed the

So what do we do now?

We had this

11

guarantee that they said you owe us this much

12

money, how are you going to fix that?

13

these are the kind of unintended, unforeseen

14

circumstances that happen when you start touching

15

buildings.

16

go into the whole thing.

17

other things at Harold Washington Library to

18

control when the lights are on and the building

19

automation system.

20

saving $27,000 a month based -- and we are having

21

light levels that are 20 percent higher than what

22

we were before.

23
24

And so

And the good news is that -- I won't
We did a number of

And the end result is we are

So it's a win win.

The library is lit

like it's supposed to and you are still saving

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

 72

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - July 19, 2016

1

25,000 a month on your electric bill.

2

-- it's a fascinating case study, but no one was

3

even aware that this was happening because the

4

building manager basically changed lights when

5

the lights went out.

6

going out, they were just getting dim.

7

the only time they changed the ballast was when

8

it failed not when it was just kind of

9

diminished.

10

Okay.

So it's a

But they weren't really
And so

That's one case study.

And then the next one is City Hall.

11

So this is a picture of the basement of City

12

Hall.

13

that were installed as part of this project.

14

Previously the bottom portion of City Hall was

15

cooled by chilled water that was purchased from a

16

supplier near the Congress Expressway.

17

piped underground into the City and that's the

18

way we cooled the bottom half of City Hall.

19

These are brand new chillers and pumps

So it was

And the ESCO's looked at it and said,

20

you know, it's a nice idea.

And if you didn't

21

have operating engineers, it's pretty much

22

problem free to buy that chilled water from

23

And so we said, okay, great.

That's a

Let's do it.
So they installed this beautiful

6

chilled water system and it operates beautifully.

7

The unintended consequence was we now have

8

chilled water piping that runs through the

9

basement of City Hall that affords us the ability

10

to provide adequate cooling to the server rooms

11

that also exist in the basement of the City Hall.

12

So previously we had highly

13

inefficient cooling systems that operated -- that

14

forced us to operate chilled water systems for

15

just a bunch of servers and equipment when the

16

building was largely unoccupied.

17

we have this chilled water piping that goes up to

18

the roof and the chilling tower, we have the

19

ability -- so the City invested a little bit of

20

extra money and they are now saving considerably

21

22

And so those are the kinds of

We're saving electricity.

longevity of the equipment we installed.

these kinds of unintended consequences as a

8

result of increasing the capability by adding the

new equipment.

We're saving water.
We're increasing the

MS. DARLING:

I think you can see why George

11

is -- has basically become one of the world's

12

leading experts on his energy efficiency work and

13

how wonderful it is that he chooses to work with

14

us at the Chicago Infrastructure Trust.

15

obviously do this kind of work pretty much

16

anywhere in the country and he chooses to engage

17

in this service for us.

extraordinarily grateful and we're also really

proud of these projects.

He could

This is the very first project that

the Infrastructure Trust did.

And it really is
