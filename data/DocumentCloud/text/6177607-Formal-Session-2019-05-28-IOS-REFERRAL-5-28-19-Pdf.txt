Dear Taxpayer:

This is in response to your request dated Feb. 16, 2013, for
information about your tax?eXempt status.

Our records indicate we issued a determination letter to you in
July 1958, and you're currently exempt under Internal Revenue
Code (IRC) Section 501(c)(04).

We also recognized the subordinates on the list you submitted as
exempt from federal income tax under IRC Section 501(c)(04).

Because you're not an organization described in IRC Section 170(c),
donors cannot deduot contributions they make to you. You should advise
your contributors that their contributions to you are not deductible.

Please refer to for information about filing
requirements. Specifically, IRC Section 6033(j) provides that, if you
don't file a required return or notice for three consecutive years,
your exempt status will be automatically revoked on the filing due
date of the third required return or notice.

In addition, each subordinate organization is subject to automatic
revocation if it doesn't file a required return or notice for three
consecutive years. Subordinate organizations can file required returns
or notices individually or as part of a group return.

For tax forms, instructions, and publications, visit or
call 

If you have questions, call 1?877-829-5500 between 8 a.m. and 5 
local time, Monday through Friday (Alaska and Hawaii follow Pacific
