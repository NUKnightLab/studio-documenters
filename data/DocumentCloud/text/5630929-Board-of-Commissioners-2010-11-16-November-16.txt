Commissioner Ivers then presented an Omnibus Motion for adoption of the Resolutions for
Items A1 thru A6.
(Items A1)
In January 2010, a Request For Proposal (RFP) was advertised for Client Management Tracking
System services. The solicitation sought both Software and Implementation Services for the
CMTS initiative. Prior to release of the RFP, over 40 potential bidders were contacted to
encourage them to review the RFP, and possibly submit a bid if they were interested. Of the
eight proposals received, six vendors were selected based on the competitive range that was set.
After Oral Presentations were completed, all scoring was submitted and the second competitive
range was set that resulted in two finalists to move forward through the negotiation process. The
CMTS Team worked with both finalists on the development of a Statement of Work (SOW),
including a detailed project schedule and pricing information that would assist CHA in selecting
the vendor who would implement the best solution. Upon careful evaluation of each of the
vendor’s software products, implementation approaches and pricing, the CMTS Team
recommended Model Metrics as the proposed awardee for the Client Management Tracking
System project. The determination was based upon technical, pricing and other factors, and was
the result of the evaluation team’s conclusion that Model Metrics’ proposal represented the best
solution and overall value to the CHA for the CMTS project. Model Metrics’ Best and Final
2

 offer proposes Salesforce.com’s “Software as a Solution” (SAAS) product, which is a 100%
outsourced, hosted solution. The Salesforce.com software solution was most cost effective with
a less complicated pricing model and significantly lowers total cost of ownership. For the end
user, the system is easier to navigate, very user friendly and appealing. For the power users and
technical staff, the product is much easier to manage, configure and extend when changes are
needed. Finally, Salesforce.com and Model Metrics are proven partners with the CHA with a
demonstrated implementation history. Accordingly, the resolution for Item A1 approves contract
award to Model Metrics and Salesforce.com in the total fixed fee amount of $2,270,592.00 to
implement a Client Management Tracking System.
RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-137
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated November 10, 2010
entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH MODEL
METRICS AND SALESFORCE.COM TO IMPLEMENT A CLIENT
MANAGEMENT TRACKING SYSTEM”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief
Executive Officer or his designee enter a contract with Model Metrics, Inc. and
Salesforce.com to provide a Client Management Tracking System in the total
fixed-fee project amount of $2,270,592, which includes funding for the two year
base term and one option year. This authorization includes funding for the
implementation phase of the project in the fixed-fee amount of $990,780, with
optional Consulting Services in the amount of $137,280 with Model Metrics, Inc.,
for a total of $1,128,060, and also includes funding for User License fees with
Salesforce.com in the amount of $780,612 for the two year base term and
$361,920 for the option year term, for a total fixed-fee amount of $1,142,532.

(Item A2)
In March 2010, CHA advertised a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Creation of SharePoint
Portal, Intranet Portal, Extranets & Related Tools. The solicitation sought both business
requirements gathering and implementation of a SharePoint Portal and externally facing sites for
the CHA. Of the eleven proposals received and evaluated, 6 vendors were selected to conduct
Oral Presentations. To ensure that Oral Presentations provided a detailed understanding of the
key components of the proposed solution and the requirements outlined in the RFP, the
evaluation team devised an intensive Oral Presentation script that each vendor was required to
follow. After Oral Presentations were completed and scoring submitted, Rightpoint Consulting,
LLC was selected as the best vendor for this engagement. Accordingly, the resolution for Item
A2 approves award of contract to Rightpoint Consulting, LLC for Microsoft Sharepoint
implementation services.
RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-138
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated November 10,
2010, “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH
RIGHTPOINT CONSULTING, LLC FOR MICROSOFT SHAREPOINT
IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

The Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a contract with Rightpoint Consulting, LLC for SharePoint
Implementation Services in an amount not to exceed $750,000.00.

(Items A3)
In June of 2001 the Department of Information Technology Services purchased Oracle products
to replace the legacy systems and to be the platform for the CHA Systems@Work. At the time
that the CHA purchased Oracle database system, maintenance costs and services were negotiated
in the agreement and were provided for the first year. Support and maintenance services for the
software products have been continuously provided directly to the CHA from Oracle for each of
the subsequent years since the initial purchase of the database on a sole-source basis. Product
support, enhancements, upgrades and updates are available only from Oracle. As the developer,
licensor and owner of the database software (and the exclusive provider of comprehensive
3

 support and maintenance services), the software maintenance and support services were
originally procured from Oracle on a sole-source basis, on the same prevailing terms and
conditions as have been in effect since the original acquisition of Oracle database software. In
2008, the CHA determined it would be in its best interest to put its maintenance and support
contract with Oracle on a fiscal year basis and the contract was extended through December 31,
2010. Due to the recent addition of systems to the CHA technology operations which use the
Oracle software platforms, the Department of Information Technology Services (ITS) is seeking
to enter a one (1) year contract with Oracle Corporation for support and maintenance of the
following technologies: Oracle Database, Primavera, and Oracle Data Warehouse. Accordingly,
the resolution for Item A3 approves award of contract to Oracle Corporation for support and
maintenance services of Oracle database software.
RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-139
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
memorandum dated November 10, 2010, titled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER
INTO A CONTRACT WITH ORACLE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT AND
MAINTENANCE SERVICES”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a one (1) year contract with Oracle Corporation for the
support and maintenance services for Oracle database software, Oracle Business
Intelligence software, and Primavera software for the period of January 1, 2011
through December 31, 2011, in an amount not-to-exceed $225,546.40.

(Item A4)
In 2004, the Lawson System was procured as a result of a competitive procurement process for
the purposes of designing and implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning system. Because
of the proprietary nature of the software, platform and applications comprising the Lawson
System, sole source procurement continues as a necessary requirement for the application’s
support and maintenance needs, including foundation upgrades. The Department of Procurement
and Contracts approved the original sole source procurement for the original Lawson
Maintenance Service Agreement in 2004 as part of Contract No. 9777, formalizing the initial two
year maintenance term with fixed pricing for additional annual maintenance and support terms
for up to five years in total. Additionally, the Department of Procurement and Contracts later
approved sole source procurement for the Lawson 9 Foundation Upgrade to the Lawson System
implemented in 2007 to assure continued optimal performance and usability in accordance with
the agency’s designated intent. Accordingly, the resolution for Item A4 approves award of
contract to Lawson Software, Inc. to support and maintain the Lawson System.
RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-140
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated November 10,
2010, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH
LAWSON SOFTWARE FOR SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee, to enter into a two (2) year contract with Lawson Software for Lawson
Support and Maintenance in an amount not-to-exceed $430,115.75.

(Items A5)
On October 1, 2010, the CHA received official written notice of a grant award in the amount of
$11,700,000.00 from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO).
The purpose of the funding is to implement the demolition of 55 low rise buildings at LeClaire
Courts, which are located within the Garfield Ridge community on the southwest side of
Chicago. The property, which was developed in 1950, has been deteriorating as a result of
decades of reduced resources and is in need of revitalization to better integrate and complement
this middle-class enclave within the city. The LeClaire Courts residents, consisting of 68%
single-parent households, were relocated to other housing units in 2009 to prepare for the
demolition and transformation of the project. The grant funds will be used for the demolition of
the LeClaire Courts buildings, site cleanup, and the re-establishment of the property site in
4

 preparation for future development. Additional funding will be sought for future housing
development within the project site. Grant-funded activities during the period of October 1, 2010
through the ending date of September 30, 2012 will specifically include: securing site fencing
and on-site security management, as mandated; proper legal abatement and disposal of hazardous
materials; removal and disposal of all trash and debris; site extermination prior to and during
demolition; coordination of all utility terminations with utility firms and capping all utilities at
the site lot line, structural demolition; removal and disposal of all surface/attached pavements
and other site features associated with the referenced buildings, as well as removal of terminated
and abandoned underground utilities; removal and disposal of all demolition debris; filling,
grading and restoration of the site; and hydro-seeding for new grass. Accordingly, the resolution
for item A5 ratifies the acceptance of a Grant Award from the Illinois Department of Commerce
and Economic Opportunity in the amount of $11,700,000.00 to implement the LeClaire Courts
Demolition and Environmental Cleanup Project.
RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-141
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated November 10, 2010, entitled “RATIFICATION OF
ACCEPTANCE OF A GRANT AWARD FROM THE ILLINOIS
DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND
INCREASE TO THE FY2010 COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET’;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners ratifies the acceptance of a grant award from the
Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity in the amount of
$11,700,000.00 for implementation of the LeClaire Courts Demolition and
Environmental Cleanup Project and increase to the FY2010 comprehensive
budget by the same amount

(Item A6)
The resolution of Item A6 approves increase funding to Humana HealthCare contract, not-toexceed $161,000.00 for CHA Employees’ Medical Coverage. In October 2008 the board
authorized the CHA to enter into a contract with Humana HealthCare for the CHA’s Employee
Health Benefit Plan for medical benefits covering eligible participants of the CHA and eligible
participants of the CHA’s affiliates for the benefit year of January 1 through December 31, 2009
for an amount not-to-exceed $4,800,000 for the base term and an amount not-to-exceed
$5,l00,000.00 for the option year January 1 through December 31, 2010. In September 8, 2009
the broker for employee benefits, Mesirow Financial, presented a renewal for Humana’s 2010
medical rates that showed an increase of 5.75%. The estimated combined annual premium for
HMO and PPO enrollees, based on the number of employees and current enrollments at the time,
was approximately $5,070,000 and did not exceed the amount authorized by the Board.
However, the CHA has now determined that due to increased employee headcount and employee
enrollment changes in FY2010, the total annual premiums for FY2010 will surpass the original
authorized amount for FY2010 by approximately $161,000.00, which will be needed to pay the
premium for medical coverage on December 1, 2010. The following factors impacted the
change from the 2009 projections: increase of 86 PPO enrollments from HMO in the beginning
of the year, enrolled headcount increased by 10 new members, new dependent coverage
legislation change in 2010 covering dependents up to the age of 26, CHA Domestic Partner
coverage policy revision, and qualified life events changes.
RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-142
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated November 10, 2010, entitled, “AUTHORIZATION TO
INCREASE FUNDING TO CONTRACT NO. 8073 WITH HUMANA
HEALTHCARE FOR CHA EMPLOYEES’ MEDICAL COVERAGE”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

The Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer, or his
designee, to increase the funding to Contract No 8073 with Humana Healthcare
by an amount not-to-exceed $161,000.00 for CHA Employees’ medical coverage.
The contract’s new aggregate not-to-exceed funding amount for medical coverage
will be $5,261,047.00.

include: increased foot patrols; customized policing strategy collaborated by CHA, CHA’s
private property managers, and CPD; attendance at monthly community security meetings and
maintenance of high visibility in the community; monitoring and prevention of gang activities;
monitoring of drug and other illegal activities and taking appropriate action as necessary;
attendance at all court hearings for all arrests made by the police officers; deterrence of and
response to acts of domestic violence and deterrence of and response to unauthorized or unlawful
activities or entries into residences. In addition to these services the CPD will continue to

RESOLUTION NO. 2010 CHA-151
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letters dated November 10,
2010,
entitled,
“AUTHORIZATION
TO
EXECUTE
AN
INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY OF CHICAGO
POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR SUPPLEMENTAL POLICE SERVICES”:
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement with the Chicago Police
Department for a one (l) year period from January 1, 2011 through December 31,
2011 for an amount not-to-exceed $6,000,000.00 with two (2) one year options to
ensure various CHA sites have supplemental police services.

(Item B11)
The resolution for Item B11 approves the second three-year option to renew the
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City of Chicago Fleet Management Department,
not-to-exceed $190,212.00. Under the terms of the IGA, The City of Chicago Fleet Services
provides fuel and car washes, road and towing services for all forty CHA owned vehicles.
During the term of the IGA, the CHA has closely monitored the prevailing fuel prices in the
private market and has found that the prices extended to the CHA by Fleet remains considerably
lower than those in the private market. The price of car washes through Fleet’s vendors has
remained constant and remained less than other local car washes, although an annual increase
due to the increasing cost of energy is anticipated from both Fleet’s vendors and the private
market. Fleet’s increased price will, however, continue to be lower than if the CHA procured this
service from the private market.
RESOLUTION 2010-CHA-152
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated November 10,
2010, entitled “Authorization to Exercise the Second Three-Year Option to

CHA owned vehicles.”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to exercise the second three-year option to renew the Intergovernmental
Agreement with the City of Chicago acting through its Department of Fleet
Management for fueling, car washes and emergency towing and repairs for CHA
10

 vehicles for the period of January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013 for an
amount not-to-exceed $190,212.00.
(Item B12)
The resolution for Item B12 approves the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between CHA
and the Housing Authority of Cook County (HACC) to perform unit inspections. The CHA and
HACC both administer Project Based Voucher programs in Chicago and Cook County
respectively. HACC, together with its instrumentality Turnstone, is developing a 52-unit project
in the City of Riverdale of which seventeen (17) units will be designated with project based
vouchers. The CHA, under its Housing Choice Voucher programs performs HQS unit
inspections and determination of rent reasonableness, through an independent contractor, on
units rented or to be rented by its HCV holders from private landlords. To comply with 24 CFR
983.59 and 24 CFR 983.103, which requires a housing authority to obtain independent HQS
inspection services for project based units owned by the housing authority, HACC desires to
enter into this IGA to allow CHA to serve as the independent entity to perform the HQS
inspections and determine initial rent reasonableness for the PBV Units in the Project. When
requested by HACC, CHA will perform unit inspections pursuant to 24 CFR Part 982, HQS
Special Requirements, and the Inspection Process as indicated by HACC’s Section 8
Administrative Plan. Also, during any initial inspection, and when requested by HACC, CHA
will determine rent reasonableness. HACC will pay the CHA for the inspections performed as
stated by the terms of the agreement.

RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-154
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated November 10, 2010, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO
ENTER INTO AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT WITH THE
CITY OF CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY AND SUPPORT
SERVICES”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement with the City of Chicago,
acting through its Department of Family and Support Services, in an amount not
to exceed $3,012,660 for the period of January 1, 2011 through December 31,
2011 to provide supportive services to Chicago Housing Authority residents.

(Item C2)
The Resolution for Item C2 approves an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the Chicago
Park District (CPD) to provide year round access to recreational programs for CHA youth. The
current IGA between CHA and CPD, which expires on December 31, 2010, has had a positive
impact on thousands of CHA youth who otherwise may not have been able to participate in CPD
programs due to cost. In 2011 CPD will be enhancing the teen clubs at parks located around
CHA properties to accommodate the anticipated increase in participation through the voucher
program. Additional programming will be added for CHA youth in 2011 including, but not
limited to, an expanded softball program, Jr. Bears Football and other CPD activities and
initiatives. It is anticipated that this new level of collaboration will continue to yield new and
enhanced programming and increased participation.
Commissioner Reidy voted “Nay” on Item C2. Commissioner Young recused herself from
voting on Item C2.
