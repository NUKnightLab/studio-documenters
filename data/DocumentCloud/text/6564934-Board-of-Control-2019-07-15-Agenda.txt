The following item was held at the request of the Board of Control members.
BC2019-514

extension and not an expansion to the scope of services. Ms. Greene confirmed that is the case. Mr.
19

 McAleer asked why it took 7 months to submit the amendment to the expired contact, if this was only for
an extension of time; asked if the County is paying for any related services for this project outside of their
respective contracts and recommended that the item be held until these questions are answered.
Nan Baker asked whether it is a permitted or if it is good policy to extend an expired contract and whether
this has happened on other occasions. Jerad Zibritosky, Department of Law, stated that if both parties
agree to amending an expired contract, it is acceptable but would leave the policy decision to the Board
members; and offered to follow up with the Board members to further discuss this issue.
Trevor McAleer commented that considering the relationship between Hyland Software, Inc. and the
County over the past several years, he would like to explore the possibility whether there are any other
vendors who may perform these services; however, expressed his struggle with the fact that this contract
is 7 months late but does not want to delay the Enterprise Resource Planning Project (ERP); and requested
that the department follow up with responses to the Board members’ questions.
The Board members agreed to hold this item pending receipt of additional information.
BC2019-515
Department of Human Resources,
a) Submitting an RFP exemption on RQ46178, which will result in an award recommendation to Worxtime,

Funding Source: Self Insurance Fund
Patrick Smock, Department of Human Resources, presented. Dennis Kennedy asked whether the rate is a
flat fee and how much was spent last year; asked if the 1095 forms could be available electronically, similar
to W-2’s, rather than sending by U.S. mail or if there is a statutory requirement that would not allow

Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Dale Miller seconded. Item BC2019-515 was unanimously
approved.

20

 BC2019-516
Department of Human Resources,
a) Submitting an RFP exemption on RQ45814, which will result in an award recommendation to Lee Hecht
Harrison, LLC in the amount not-to-exceed $33,300.00 for outplacement programs and related services

for the period 7/8/2019 – 12/31/2019.
Funding Source: General Fund
Patrick Smock, Department of Human Resources, presented. Trevor McAleer asked if the recommended
vendor was the best and lowest bid received. Nan Baker asked for clarification on the contract dates and
asked if the vendor will be paid if there are no participants in the program. Dennis Kennedy motioned to
approve the item; Trevor McAleer seconded. Item BC2019-516 was unanimously approved.
BC2019-517
Department of Human Resources, on behalf of the Fiscal Office/Board of Revision, submitting an
amendment to Contract No. CE1900134 with GPI Enterprises, Inc. for temporary staffing services for the
period 3/1/2019 – 6/30/2019 to extend the time period to 12/31/2019, to expand the scope of services
to add the Department of Human Resources and the position of Records Management Assistant, effective
7/1/2019 and for additional funds in the amount not-to-exceed $28,500.00.
Funding Source: General Fund
Patrick Smock, Department of Human Resources, presented. Dennis Kennedy asked for clarification as to
why this request is being presented on behalf of the Fiscal Office/Board of Revision when services are for
the Department of Human Resources and asked whether the item description should be amended. Andria
Richardson, Clerk of the Board of Control explained that the original contract was presented by the Fiscal
Office for temporary staffing services provided to the Board of Revision and that the Department of
Human Resources now requires similar services and piggybacked off the Fiscal Office contract; further
stated that the original language must remain the same in order to provide a paper trail and accurate
history for any subsequent actions taken from the original contract. Dennis Kennedy asked for
confirmation that the funds used will be from the Department of Human Resources budget. Nan Baker
asked if this is a new position and why has a title of Records Management Assistant been assigned if this
is a temporary position only. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Trevor McAleer seconded.
Item BC2019-517 was unanimously approved.

21

 BC2019-518
Department of Health and Human Services/Cuyahoga Job and Family Services on behalf of the Division of
Children and Family Services, submitting an amendment to Contract No. CE1200560 with Burlington
Stores, Inc. for emergency assistance services for the period 9/1/2012 – 4/30/2019 for additional funds in
the amount not-to-exceed $475,000.00.
Funding Source: 79% Federal; 21% Health and Human Services Levy 100% Federal Funds
Christine Alexander, Cuyahoga Job and Family Services and Audrey Beasley, Division of Children and
Family Services, presented. Andria Richardson, Clerk of the Board of Control stated that the correct
funding source for this amendment is 100% Federal Funds. Trevor McAleer asked for clarification on Ms.
Alexander’s response to County Council’s advanced questions, as to whether the current vendor’s
contract will require an amendment also and what the estimated amount would be; recommended that
due to the number of amendments on this contract to increase funding, that the next contract for
emergency assistance services include a larger awarded amount and be considered by County Council, so
as not to present the perception that the intent of these amendments are to avoid bringing the item to
County Council for consideration; asked if the funding source for the current contract is also 100% Federal
funds. Nan Baker asked what the contract term for the current vendor’s contract is and why was it not bid
out for a 3-year term. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Dale Miller seconded. Item BC2019518 was unanimously approved as amended.
The following item was held at the request of the Board of Control members.
BC2019-519
Department of Health and Human Services/Division of Children and Family Services,
a) Submitting an RFP exemption on RQ46193, which will result in an award recommendation to Cedar
Point in the amount not-to-exceed $9,816.40 for the purchase of (110) any-day admission passes and
beverage and meal vouchers for 55 graduating youths aging out of custody and 55 adult chaperones.
b) Recommending an award on RQ46193 to Cedar Point in the amount not-to-exceed $9,816.40 for the
purchase of (110) any-day admission passes and beverage and meal vouchers for 55 graduating youths
aging out of custody and 55 adult chaperones.
Funding Source: 70% Health and Human Services Levy Fund (which will be reimbursed by TANF Funds)
and 30% Title IV-E
Daniel Basta, Division of Children and Family Services, presented. Dale Miller asked whether graduation
incentives, including Cedar Point tickets, have been provided in the past and why the graduation incentive
has changed from prior years; and asked if parking and transportation is provided for attendees.
Dennis Kennedy asked if the tickets are for a specific day and what happens to the tickets that remain
unused; asked if the department can establish an account with Cedar Point and purchase tickets on an asrequested basis.
Dale Miller expressed his concern regarding unused tickets and recommended tracking the utilization this
year to aid in future planning.

22

 Nan Baker asked if it is possible to negotiate a deal for lower ticket prices, given the number of tickets
being purchased; asked if there are any restrictions with the use of Title IV-E or Temporary Assistance to
Needy Families funds being used for this purpose; and asked if tickets are transferable if the child is unable
to attend.
Trevor McAleer asked who the 55 chaperones are and if tickets can be purchased on an on-going basis, as
needed, rather than purchase all tickets at one time; and commented that it may be better to split invoice
the purchase of these tickets rather than purchase tickets that may remain unused.
Lenora Lockett said that a not-to-exceed award could be made on a partial payment basis and did not
want to go on the record as approving split invoicing.
Dennis Kennedy indicated that while he supports the incentive for graduates, he does not agree with the
logistics of the purchase and will cast a dissenting vote on this item.
The other Board members also expressed their support of the incentive but would like to see if there are
alternatives for processing the purchase of tickets so that the County is not paying for tickets that may
not be used. Mr. McAleer asked if there is any concern if this item is delayed.
The Board members agreed to hold this item pending receipt of additional information.
BC2019-520
Department of Health and Human Services/Division of Children and Family Services, recommending an
award on RQ46168 and enter into an agreement with Corporation for National and Community Service in

Funding Source: 50% - Federal Funds and 50% Health and Human Services Levy Funds
Christine Alexander, Cuyahoga Job and Family Services, presented. There were no questions. Dennis
Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Trevor McAleer seconded. Item BC2019-520 was unanimously
approved.
BC2019-521
Court of Common Pleas/Corrections Planning Board, recommending an award on RQ43795 and enter into
a contract with Microgenics Corporation/Thermo Fisher Scientific (15-4) in the amount not-to-exceed
$349,399.39 for on-site drug detection services for the period 7/1/2019 – 6/30/2022.
Funding Source: General Fund
Linda Lagunzad and Shannon Gray, Corrections Planning Board, presented. Dale Miller asked how it is
determined who is eligible to be out on probation pre-trial as opposed to incarceration and asked what
circumstances would lead to a person being on pre-trial probation; asked how many of those tested are
pre-trial and post-trial. Nan Baker asked if the prior vendor was one of the 3 bids submitted. Dennis
Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Dale Miller seconded. Item BC2019-521 was unanimously
approved.
