 Letter From The Commissioner
We are pleased to submit the 2011 Third Quarter Progress Report, which presents the Department of
Housing and Economic Development’s progress on the goals set forth in the City’s fourth Affordable
Housing Plan for the years 2009-2013.
Through the third quarter of 2011 the Department has committed over $250 million to support more
than 6,100 units of affordable housing. This represents approximately 57% of our annual resource
allocation goal and 76% of our units assisted goal.
During the third quarter, the Department approved financing for four multifamily developments and
sponsored two house tours featuring residences newly rehabilitated and available for purchase under
the Neighborhood Stabilization Program.
Despite ongoing challenges in the housing and lending markets, the Department continues to successfully work toward achieving our annual goals under our three main program priorities: Create
and Preserve Affordable Rental, Promote and Support Homeownership, and Improve and Preserve
Homes.
As always, we would like to thank all of our partners for their continued support and cooperation.
Working with them, we will continue to progress in our goals to create and preserve affordable housing for the people of Chicago.

       
Andrew J. Mooney     
Commissioner

 CREATION AND PRESERVATION
OF AFFORDABLE RENTAL UNITS
Multifamily Rehab and New Construction
Zapata Apartments
In July the City Council approved a TIF redevelopment agreement and fee waivers for the
construction of affordable apartments on four
vacant sites in the Logan Square community.
The developer, Zapata Apartments L.P., will
construct four buildings containing a total
of 61 units at 3230 and 3503 W. Armitage
Ave., 1955 N. St Louis Ave. and 3734 W.
Cortland St. Each building will include 3,700 feet of commercial space and a mix of one- to
three-bedroom apartments ranging in size from 600 to 1,300 square feet. They will be made
available to households earning up to 60 percent of Area Median Income (AMI).
The City will invest $4.6 million in Tax Increment
Financing revenue from the Fullerton/Milwaukee
TIF District to assist construction of the $25 million project.
Zapata Apartments will include off-street parking,
laundry facilities and wiring for cable and highspeed internet.

Pullman Suites Senior Apartments
Also in July the City Council authorized a loan agreement, the conveyance of two Cityowned parcels and fee waivers for the construction of Pullman Suites Senior Apartments in
the Roseland community. The developer, Pullman Suites L.P., will construct the development at 17-29 E. 112th Pl. in the 9th Ward.
Pullman Suites Senior Apartments will create 60 units of affordable rental housing for independent seniors in a five-story building. The units will be available to renters earning up to
50 percent of Area Median Income. The 36,000-square-foot development will include various green design elements, including a green roof, Energy Star appliances, energy efficient
lighting, permeable concrete paving and rain gardens to reduce stormwater runoff.

Quarter ending June 2011

 All Saints Residence
In September the City Council approved a loan agreement, the sale of one City-owned parcel,
and fee waivers for the construction of All Saints Residence, an $8.4 million independent living facility for low-income seniors.
On a site located at 11701 S. State St. in the 9th Ward, All Saints Senior Housing NFP
(sponsored by Catholic Charities Housing Development Corporation) will construct a
42-unit building offering monthly rents starting at $630. Tenants, who will be restricted
to those with incomes at or below 50% of AMI, will pay only 30 percent of their income
towards rent and utilities. Assistance with medications, bathing and dressing, laundry, housekeeping, and transportation will be provided by on-site staff.
The City will invest up to $900,000 in loans and $162,800 in donations tax credit equity
in the project. The development is eligible for donations tax credits because of the donation
of land from the City and Catholic Charities of Chicago valued at $370,000. The land will
be provided for $1. The project’s main source of funding is HUD’s Section 202 Supportive
Housing Development program, which helps support the construction of affordable housing
with supportive services for seniors.
The five-story building will incorporate a number of green features, including a 50% green
roof, energy efficient windows and lighting, Energy Star appliances, and low-VOC paints.  
The new construction will link to an existing one-story annex building.

Viceroy Apartments
Also approved in September was an ordinance authorizing $3.9 million in Tax Increment Financing
(TIF) assistance for the redevelopment of the former
Viceroy Hotel on the city’s Near West Side.
The 81-year-old landmark building, located at
1517-21 W. Warren Blvd. in the 27th Ward, will
be converted into 89 low-income, studio apartments
by Heartland Housing in conjunction with First
Baptist Congregational Church. The rehabilitation
calls for full kitchens and private baths in each apartment, along with ground-floor office space and a coffee shop. All units will serve individuals at risk
of homelessness with incomes at or below 60% of Area Median Income. Eighteen units will be set
aside to house formerly incarcerated women.
The project’s sustainable features will include the use of permeable pavers, rain barrels to capture
storm water runoff, a community garden, open space with a rain garden for storm water mitiga-

 tion, geothermal HVAC, a green roof, solar hot water heating, Energy Star appliances, sustainably
harvested lumber, recycled carpet, cork and bamboo flooring and low-VOC paints.
The building, which opened in 1930 as the Union Park Hotel and later became an SRO, was designated as an official City landmark in 2010. The City acquired the property in 2005 to preserve it
for future affordable housing development. Currently valued at $2.3 million, the building will be
conveyed to the developer for $1.
The City will invest up to $7.4 million in loans; $800,000 in low-income housing tax credits, generating $6.4 million in equity; and $127,500 in donations tax credit equity, through the donation
of City-owned land valued at $300,000.

Updates on Previously Reported Developments
Grand Opening of Independence Apartments Phase V
On September 15, the fifth phase of the
Independence Apartments complex was dedicated
at 927 S. Independence Blvd. in the 24th Ward.
At a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by Housing
Bureau Deputy Commissioner Bill Eager, seven
new six-flats containing a total of 33 affordable and
nine market-rate units were opened. Rents for the
42 one- to three-bedroom units will range from
$695 to $1,095, depending on unit size and tenant
income. Nine of the affordable units are reserved
for households holding CHA vouchers.
The $8.8 million project was developed by the Shaw Co. in partnership with the Foundation for
Homan Square, supported by $3.1 million in loans from HED. Earlier phases of the project—
located at the Homan Square site of the former Sears, Roebuck and Co. headquarters—include more
than 200 units of housing, as well as offices, schools, community spaces and park facilities.

 PROMOTION AND SUPPORT OF
HOMEOWNERSHIP
House Tours Showcase Newly Renovated NSP Homes
Fourteen single-family homes and two-flats newly rehabilitated through the Neighborhood
Stabilization Program (NSP) were featured during two open-house tours in the Pullman/
Roseland and Auburn Gresham communities. The tours were sponsored by HED and Mercy
Portfolio Services (MPS), in conjunction with NSP developers, community organizations,
and the local aldermen. The renovated properties were move-in ready with new, energyefficient appliances and affordably priced mortgages. These events built on the success of
previous tours held in Humboldt Park and Chicago Lawn.
The first event, held on Saturday, July 30, showcased six homes in the Pullman and Roseland
neighborhoods. A trolley carried potential homebuyers from house to house. The tour,
attended by more than 40 people, was hosted by the Pullman branch of U.S. Bank, which
provided free lunches and, in collaboration with Neighborhood Housing Services, advice to
prospective homebuyers.
On Saturday, August 27, more than 50 people
attended a similar open-house event that featured
eight homes in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood.
Carlos Nelson, Executive Director of the Greater
Auburn Gresham Development Corporation, led
the tours and shared information about the neighborhood. The tour embarked via trolley from the
office of 17th Ward Alderman Latasha Thomas.
At her office, potential homebuyers attended
workshops conducted by Neighborhood Housing
These historic row houses, recent recipients
Services and JPMorgan Chase, our sponsor for the of a Preservation Excellence Award from the
event.
Commission on Chicago Landmarks, were featured on the Pullman/Roseland Open House
Tour.

Two of the homes featured on the Pullman/
Roseland tour recently received a Preservation Photo by Bill Healy
Excellence Award from the Commission on
Chicago Landmarks. Of the 14 homes showcased in the two tours, one has been sold and six
are currently under sales contracts. HED and MPS plan to hold additional open-house tours
in the spring of 2012.

 POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS
2011 First Half Foreclosures Decline in Chicago
According to a new report released by the Woodstock Institute, Chicago experienced a substantial slowdown in foreclosure activity during the first six months of this year. Woodstock’s
data show 9,821 foreclosure filings in the city of Chicago in the first half of 2011, an 11.5%
decrease from the same period last year. Filings were down in 55 of the city’s 77 Community
Areas. During the same period, completed foreclosure cases declined at an even greater rate of
57.5% to 2,579 citywide. Of this total, 2,382 properties (92.4%) reached REO (Real Estate
Owned) status.
These changes mirror similar trends across the entire six-county Chicago region, where completed foreclosure activity in the first half of 2011 was at its lowest level since the housing crisis
began in 2007. Woodstock attributes this in part to “[l]onger foreclosure process times, which
are currently at record highs [and] are likely resulting from the legacy of the robo-signing
scandal.” Moreover, “the data indicate that existing foreclosure cases will take longer to cycle
through the process, potentially delaying the stabilization of the housing market.”

Chicago Neighborhood Stabilization Program Update
Progress on the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) continues to move forward, and
the City is on track to meet all deadlines associated with these funds, as set forth by the federal
government.
Through the end of the third quarter, 742 units in 145 properties have been acquired using
Chicago NSP funds. Construction has started on 388 of those units in 70 properties, while
55 units (28 properties) are complete or substantially complete. Ten units in eight properties
have been sold to qualified homebuyers, and the first multifamily units to be completed are
now in the process of being leased up. For the most updated status report on NSP activity,
please visit www.chicagonsp.org.
In addition, the City recently received approval from the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) to move forward with a “lump sum drawdown” of NSP funds.
HED and Mercy Portfolio Services (MPS), the City’s NSP sub-grantee, worked very closely
with HUD to develop this strategy, which will improve program efficiency and help ensure
that the City meets its NSP deadlines. Per the lump sum drawdown regulations, once the
City receives the NSP funds from HUD, MPS will deposit the funds with NSP’s financial
partners, including Community Investment Corporation and PNC Bank. The financial
institutions will use the funds as a loss reserve to make loans to approved NSP developers for
the rehabilitation of NSP homes. The financial institutions and MPS will then monitor the
rehabilitation of the homes through completion.

 The Neighborhood Stabilization Program was created by Congress through the Housing and Economic
Recovery Act of 2008, which provided $4 billion to state and local governments to acquire and redevelop
foreclosed properties. The City of Chicago has been awarded a total of $169 million in NSP funds to assist
communities that have been hardest hit by foreclosure.

* Residents of these units will pay no more than 30% of their incomes toward the stated rent; the project rental
assistance will make up the difference. Tenants will not pay any utilities. The rent received by the owner under the
project rental assistance contract may exceed the rents required under the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program,
as long as the household pays no more than 30% of its adjusted income for rent. Should the project rental assistance
contract be terminated, the owner would be required to keep nine units at or below 30% of the area median income
and the balance (80 units) at or below 60% of the area median income.

MAXIMUM AFFORDABLE MONTHLY RENTS 2011

Page 4 of 6

NOTE: Gross rent limits for 50% and 65% AMI and the Fair Market Rent are published by HUD. All other rent limits are calculated assuming 1.5 occupants per bedroom and 1 occupant for an apartment with no bedrooms.
* For HOME-funded developments, rents are the "lesser of" the FMR for the unit size or 30% of the adjusted income of a family whos income equals 65% of the area median. This is known as the "High HOME Rent." In HOMEfunded developments with 5 or more units, 20% of the HOME-assisted units must be occupied by very-low income families whose rents do not exceed 30% of the annual income of a family whose income equals 50% of the area
median. This is known as the "Low HOME Rent."
