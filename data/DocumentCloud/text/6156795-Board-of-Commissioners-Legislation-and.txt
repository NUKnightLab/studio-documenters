and
WHEREAS, the Federal government, the State, the County and local municipalities
have separate roles in assisting with emergency management and each of these
entities have a specific role and monies to address certain emergencies. A
collaborative effort among these agencies will allow Cook County to better assist
suburban municipalities in water drainage management.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County
Board of Commissioners establish an Intergovernmental Task Force consisting of
department heads from the following agencies; Metropolitan Water Reclamation
District, Cook County Department of Highways, Bureau of Capital, Planning and
