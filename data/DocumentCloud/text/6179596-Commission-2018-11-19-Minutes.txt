b. Public Way Beautification
i. Snow Removal Strategy – Anthony from Cleanstreet discussed
their strategy for snow removal in the Devon SSA district. Will start
at Western then spread out from there. Main part is Wester to
Kedzie on Devon and will focus on the south side of the street
because it does not get the sun for melting. Shovelers are behind
the bikes so they get what the bike misses. They clear a path at the
crosswalks only. Use two ATVs, one on each side. The crew goes
over area twice, sometimes three times, and salt with a spreader.
Avi said they crew is not doing the Kedzie portion of the SSA by
Devon and should make sure they cover this area.
