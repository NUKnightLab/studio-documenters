I. Minutes of the September 4, 2018, Budget Committee Meeting
Motion: Mr. Kocerka moved to approve the minutes of the September 4, 2018, Budget
Committee Meeting. Ms. Dunne seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
II. Justice Assistance Grants FFY14, FFY16 and FFY17 Plan Adjustments
Mr. Stevens said while ICJIA had received the FFY17 Justice Assistance Grant (JAG)
award, funds will not be available until certifications are completed. He said six-month
grant designations were made at the previous Budget Committee meeting to support JAG
programs in their second years. He said FFY17 funds will allow full-year funding, as
originally intended.
To ease the grant administration process, Mr. Stevens recommended combining the
funding for the second six-month period with a full year of funding for the third and final
year, thus creating 18-month grants. If the Grant Accountability and Transparency Unit
does not approve creation of 18-month grants, staff will recommend creating two nine-

3

 10/18/18 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 3

month grants, he said. The FFY17 funds also will allow staff to reconsider notices of
funding opportunity that had been set aside due to the lack of available funds.
Mr. Stevens referred the committee to a memo located at Page 8 of the meeting materials,
dated October 18, 2018, regarding FFY14, FFY16, and FFY17 JAG plans.
A. 1. Designation Reduction
Mr. Stevens said the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office returned $14,219 in FFY16
JAG funds designated to support a Human Trafficking Task Force due to personnel,
supplies, and travel costs being less than expected. He said staff recommended making
the funds available for future programming.
Motion: Ms. Dunne moved to approve the recommended FFY16 JAG designation
reduction. Mr. Kocerka seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
A. 2. Designation Adjustment
Mr. Stevens said that on September 4, 2018, the Budget Committee reduced a FFY14
JAG designation to the City of Springfield for its Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent
Crime Program from $197,313 to $148,909. He said a recent rule change by the Office
of Justice Programs forced FFY14 fund expiration on September 30, 2018, causing
Springfield’s grant to end two months and 12 days earlier than anticipated. He said that
at the September 4, 2018 Budget Committee meeting, the pro-rated balance of the
FFY14 designation, $48,404, was included in a new FFY16 designation of $146,933 to
support the program through June 12, 2019. Staff has since discovered an accounting
error; the original FFY14 designation should have been reduced to $130,590 and the
new FFY16 continuation designation should have been for $145,765. He said staff
recommended adjusting these designations accordingly.
Motion: Ms. Malowitz moved to approve the recommended FFY14 JAG designation
adjustment. Ms. Dunne seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
B. New Designations
Mr. Stevens said at its August 18, 2017, and September 16, 2017, meetings, the Budget
Committee designated funding to four jurisdictions through the competitive Partnerships
and Strategies to Reduce Violent Crime Request for Proposals. The Year One
designations supported research-informed planning to identify the drivers of violent
crime in each jurisdiction through formation of local multi-disciplinary teams,
community surveys, the Scanning, Analysis, Response and Assessment (SARA)
process, and other analytical tools.

 10/18/18 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 4

Mr. Stevens said staff recommended designations to these jurisdictions, as described in
the table, to complete their planning initiatives and begin implementation of focused
deterrence strategies targeting offenders at highest risk of reoffending, offering social
supports, and imposing swift, certain, and fair sanctions for non-compliance. He said the
designations support ongoing research partner contracts and salaries for local program
coordinators and community-based program navigators who facilitate offender call-in
meetings and foster offender participation.

Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
III. FFY17 Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Plan Adjustment
ICJIA Program Supervisor Shataun Hailey referred Budget Committee members to a
memo located at Page 16 of the meeting materials, dated October 18, 2018, regarding
FFY17 Residential Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) plans. She said staff
recommended the following continuation designations to support residential substance
abuse treatment and aftercare services for inmates:

Ms. Dunne seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
IV. Victims of Crime Act Plan Adjustment FFY15 and FFY16 Plan Adjustments
ICJIA Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt referred the Budget Committee members to a
memo located at Pate 19 of the meeting materials, dated October 18, 2018, on FFY15
and FFY16 Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) plans.

 10/18/18 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 5

A. Designation Reductions
ICJIA Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt described funds recently returned to ICJIA.
He said FFY15 funds expired on September 30, 2018 and are no longer available for
use. He said staff recommended making the returned FFY16 funds available for future
programming.
Ms. Hora inquired about funds returned from the University of Illinois at Chicago/Cure
Violence program. Mr. Reichgelt said that the program was not implemented because
many of its proposed expenditures were not allowed under VOCA rules. He said despite
receiving a great deal of technical assistance from ICJIA, UIC decided not to pursue the
program.
Mr. Kocerka inquired about funds returned from Illinois Coalition Against Domestic
Violence (ICADV) and the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA). Mr.
Reichgelt said the coalitions have been long-standing pass-through entities that
distribute VOCA funds; ICJIA issues the coalitions the grants to pass on to partner
agencies. The coalitions then take on monitoring responsibilities for the funds that they
pass on, he said. He explained the FFY15 grant awards were for significantly more
money than the coalitions had received in prior years; with a $14-million increase to
ICADV and a $10-million increase to ICASA.
Director Maki said the programs began during the state’s budget impasse and many of
the partner agencies were not ready to receive so much money so quickly. He said staff
does not anticipate these issues in the future.
Motion: Mr. Kocerka moved to approve the recommended FFY15 and FFY16 VOCA
designation reductions. Ms. Dunne seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
B. New Designations
ICJIA Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt described recommended FFY16 designations
to support Community Violence Programs for another six months.
Mr. Kocerka called attention to the fact that the $3,595,948 figure representing the total
of the FFY16 recommended designations in the paragraph describing the Community
Violence Programs designation table did not match the $2,545,946 figure listed in the
table itself. Mr. Reichgelt said that the $2,545,946 figure in the table was the correct
figure.
Motion: Ms. Dunne moved to approve the recommended FFY16 VOCA designations.
Mr. Kocerka seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.

V. Public Comment
Mari Christopherson of Illinois Court Appointed Special Advocates (ICASA) said last
year, ICJIA provided $2.1 million to 11 ICASA programs. She said that the 11 programs
serve 45 counties, but provide only spotty coverage. She said local programs had a lot of
questions about the granting process and that the Grant Accountability and Transparency
Act has proven difficult for the programs to navigate.
Old Business / New Business
None.
Adjourn
Motion: Ms. Dunne moved to adjourn the meeting. Mr. Kocerka seconded the motion.
The motion passed by unanimous voice vote. The meeting was adjourned at 11:19 a.m.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Community – Law Enforcement Partnership for Deflection and Substance Use
Disorder Treatment

Funding Source:

SFY19 General Revenue Funds: $500,000.00

Agency Budgets:

See table

Request Type:

Community – Law Enforcement Partnerships: NOFO #1705-572

Program Description
Law enforcement agencies have recognized that overreliance on arrest and subsequent prosecution of low-level
offenders with substance use disorders does not enhance community safety or effectively reduce demand.
Individuals repeatedly cycle through the criminal justice system without adequate treatment and support to
address their disorders. In response, law enforcement agencies have crafted new models to reduce demand by
deflecting individuals with substance use disorders from involvement in the criminal justice to treatment and
services. These models are built on police partnerships with community health and substance use disorder
treatment organizations. The goal of this solicitation is to increase public safety by reducing the significant
social and economic cost of drug misuse by emphasizing the use of treatment over criminal justice involvement.
ICJIA administers the Community-Law Enforcement Partnership for Deflection and Substance Use Disorder
Treatment Act Program (CLEP) in Illinois. CLEP provides law enforcement officers critical funding to
facilitate connections to community-based behavioral health interventions that provide substance use treatment,
help reduce drug usage, reduce drug overdose incidences and death, reduce criminal offending and recidivism,
and help prevent arrest and conviction records from destabilizing health, families, and opportunities from
community, citizenship, and self-sufficiency.
Goals
The goal for all CLEP Models is to increase public safety and reduce the large social and economic cost of
drugs use through treatment and service referrals. Programs must:







Hire Program Coordinator by the first month of the program.
Develop and adopt protocols for deflection program by second month of the program.
Develop and execute referral and treatment placement MOUs with substance use disorder treatment
providers by second month of the program.
Train officers on the deflection program and substance use disorders by third month of the program.
Train dispatch/911 staff on deflection program and substance use disorders by third month of the
program.
Implement public information initiative(s) by the third month of the program.

On June 21, 2018 Elk Grove Village Mayor Craig Johnson announced the inception of Elk Grove Village
Cares (EGV Cares). A multi-faceted approach to address the opioid crisis. One of the six points of EGV Cares
is to facilitate treatment for those seeking assistance with a substance use disorder. Elk Grove Village police
officers have been trained on the use of naloxone (Narcan) in the event they encounter an opioid overdose.
Each sworn officer has been issued Narcan and, to date, have been responsible for 20 opioid overdose
reversals. Some of the reversals have been to the same people for a second time. To reduce the number of
possible reversals and to avoid second or subsequent reversals, the Elk Grove Village Police Department will
refer these people to the department’s social services coordinator to begin a treatment strategy.

will be implemented and Program Model 2 will be expanded. Program Model 1, a Post-Overdose Response
model, will be adhered to for a Heroin Abuse Response Team (HART). The HART would enhance the public
safety response to the life safety needs throughout McLean County by implementing a standardized method,
through a law enforcement, treatment, and Fire/EMS partnership, to engage in proactive police/medic/SUD
interventionist patrols to positively intervene in life safety related incidences. This intervention would also
include disbursement of naloxone in response to opioid overdoses. This team would partner with trained
intervention staff from Chestnut Health Systems to provide in home triage and assessment of the overdose
victim post an overdose episode.

Mercer County, Mercer County Sheriff, and the Mercer County Health Department Mental Health Action
Program (MHAP) will implement Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD). LEAD is an evidence-based
model allowing police officers to exercise discretionary authority at point of contact to divert individuals to a
community-based harm reduction intervention for law violations driven by unmet behavioral health needs.
Instead of advancing directly to booking and possible conviction, individuals are instead referred to case
management, support services and treatment programs. LEAD will be built in to the current MHAP. Mercer
County will be the implementing agency on behalf of the Mercer County Sheriff Department, which will act as
the program agency and take the lead in development, training personnel, and implementation. Mercer County
Health Department will be subcontracted to provide program and fiscal management, provide case
management and navigation services to identified participants through MHAP, and provide reporting and
quality improvement/evaluation activities

response and community engagement response. The post overdose response model is achieved by an officer or
firefighter that responded to an overdose emergency event, which may have included the administration of
naloxone, notifying the behavioral health unit at Northwest Community Healthcare (NCH) that an overdose
patient will be arriving at the hospital. All individuals that experience an overdose and are initially treated by
Arlington Heights first responders are transported to NCH. Once they arrive at the emergency room, NCH’s
behavioral health unit connects with the individual, informs them about the CARE initiative, and offers to
schedule an appointment for an initial screening and assessment. Since the program is completely voluntary,
mandatory sessions cannot be enforced on the individual. This procedure was put into place as it has been
identified as a best practice, according guidelines issued under “The Naloxone Plus” framework.

Program Description
The Office for Victims of Crime made $25 million available to eligible state victim assistance programs to
apply for noncompetitive funding to support training and technical assistance for victim assistance service
providers and others who work with crime victims.
Program Activities
This program will provide four (4) initial and advanced trainings for mental health providers. Trauma Focused
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TFCBT) training and certification will be provided for therapists working with
Child Advocacy Centers (CACs). The goal of this training is to increase the number of TFCBT Certified
Therapists in Illinois. The second part (follow up) to the TFCBT training, is the advanced training for forensic
interviewers. This training for forensic interviewers is a required 40-hour training to achieve a greater expertise in
the forensic interview process, thus providing a higher level of response to victim’s needs. This training would be
offered in three phases regionally and throughout the year, building on basic training to enhance abilities and
skills.

Goals
1. To provide a variety of high quality, specialized training needed by the CACs to fulfill their mission and
meet NCA accreditation standards.
2. To provide more regional training opportunities to CACs at reduced or no cost.
Priorities
The 2017 Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee identified training as a funding priority. Only VOCA
administrative funds can support training grants, which limits funding opportunities for that purpose.

Program Description
The Office for Victims of Crime made $25 million available to eligible state victim assistance programs to
apply for noncompetitive funding to support training and technical assistance for victim assistance service
providers and others who work with crime victims.
Program Activities
The Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV) has developed and will continue to host a
Leadership Academy for professionals who interact with domestic violence victims and their children.
Individuals who complete this academy will receive a solid foundation in leadership skill building within their
organization and within the violence against women movement, with a focus on the area of cultural diversity.
Due to the success of the Leadership Academy, in September of 2018, ICADV began a third cohort of the
Leadership Academy series. In addition to the Leadership Academy, ICADV will also hold an Advocacy
Training series. Individuals who complete this academy will have a better focus on advocacy skills as related to
inclusive, welcoming, and client-centered services; have a deeper understanding of how trauma effects a
person’s ability to respond to multiple demands and to present themselves as what is often described as a “good
client”; and better understand the barriers advocates and domestic violence agencies put in front of survivors.
This advocacy training takes a two-pronged approach: training of front line staff and training of
managers/directors to support buy in, and administrative support in this approach to service delivery.
Each cohort will complete a one-year, six-session course. In addition, the third session of the Advocacy
Training will be held in the Spring of 2019, this consists of a (1) two-day session for advocates and (1) single
day session for supervisors/managers/directors. Additional sessions of each will be offered in years two and
three of the grant. Throughout the process, ICADV will evaluate and refine the curricula to meet the needs of
each cohort of individuals.
Goals
The goal of ICADV is to develop inclusive and accessible services for all victims of domestic violence and their
children by raising the voices of diverse leaders within ICADV and within local domestic violence service
providers throughout Illinois. This will be done through the Leadership Academy and Advocacy Trainings.

the Leadership Academy. During the second year, the fourth cohort will begin September 2020. Finally, during
the third year, the fifth cohort will begin in September 2021.
Past Performance
ICJIA has no concerns with this grantee. When grant staff attended a two-day advocate training as part of a site
visit, this training was at capacity and well received by the attendees. ICADV has a 35-year history of
successfully providing training to domestic violence professionals with positive evaluations. All reports have
been on time and completed with few or no errors.

Program Description
The Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) trains nurses to perform medical forensic examinations on victims
of sexual assault and sexual abuse. The Illinois Victim Assistance Academy (IVAA) trains advocates how to
effectively provide services and assert and enforce victims’ rights. Both trainings are performed by the Attorney
General’s Office throughout the State.
Program Activities
Funding will support a variety of SANE programs, including three 40-hour adult/adolescent trainings, one 16hour advanced SANE training, one 24-hour pediatric SANE training, ten 8-hour foundation trainings and two
16-hour clinical trainings. The IVAA program will offer one basic and one advanced training.
Goals
The goal of the SANE program is to increase the number of practicing SANE’s by providing educational and
clinical opportunities throughout the state. The goal for the IVAA program is to offer victim advocates the
training resources they need to serve victims and survivors.
Priorities
The 2017 Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee identified training as a funding priority. The Victims of Crime
Act (VOCA) only allows administrative funds to be used to support training grants, which limits funding
opportunities for that purpose.
Funding Prospectus
This grantee should receive further funding, not only for its past performance, but to address the demand for
SANE trainings, as state law has made it mandatory for hospitals to staff SANE nurses.

RE:

FFY18 Paul Coverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act
Plan Introduction

On September 21, 2018, ICJIA received an FFY18 Paul Coverdell National Forensic
Sciences Improvement Act (NFSIA) award to Illinois in the amount of $759,283. After
deducting $18,529 for administrative costs, $740,754 is available for grants.
Recommended Designations
NFSIA funds principally are used to purchase new lab equipment and support required
proficiency testing, lab accreditation, and conference travel. In addition, these funds
support staff overtime and contractual toxicology testing to help labs meet the demand
for testing.
Staff proposes using FFY18 NFSIA funding to support ongoing improvements at the
Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office and nine crime labs across Illinois. These
improvements will be made through agreements with the DuPage County Crime Lab, the
Northeastern Illinois Regional Crime Lab, the Office of the Cook County Medical
Examiner and the Illinois State Police.

Program Description
Illinois State Police (ISP) will use this funding to purchase equipment to identify compounds that contribute to
the opioid crisis. Equipment purchases will include two DiscovIR systems and two gas chromatographs. In
addition, funds will be used to purchase an analytical balance and laser upgrade to increase system
compatibility.
Program Activities
The instruments purchased from this grant are used in the screening and confirmation of opioids. Opioid deaths
are often caused from highly potent drugs, such as carfentanyl or synthetic derivatives mixed in low dosages
with other less lethal drugs. The DiscovIR is specifically designed to identify these compounds. Additionally, a
small portion of the grant will be used to update existing equipment to enhance system compatibility.
Goals
DiscovIRs will increase ISP’s ability to identify designer drugs and trace levels of drugs. The two gas
chromatographs will offer universal screenings determine presence of specific drug mixtures. These types of
evidence are prevalent in opioid cases where low levels of highly potent drugs are mixed with high contractions
of other drugs. Integration of the balances and the laser into the new Laboratory Information Management
System (LIMS) will improve the credibility of reports being issued.
Priorities
The National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act authorizes funding to improve the quality, timeliness, and
credibility of forensic science services for criminal justice purposes.
Funding Prospectus
This funding will be spent within one year. Equipment will be purchased via competitively bid contract. To
proactively manage the typically lengthy ISP equipment purchase approval process, the purchase process began
when the grant application was submitted.

RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
On January 10 and 11, 2017, ICJIA convened an Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee to review
past priorities and define new ones for the use of STOP VAWA funds. The committee
recommended that FFY17-FFY20 VAWA funds be used principally to continue to support
programs previously funded through VAWA.
At the 2017 planning meeting, multi-disciplinary team (MDT) response programs were once
again identified as a funding priority. In August 2018, ICJIA issued a notice of funding
opportunity seeking proposals for the continuation or enhancement of sexual assault or domestic
violence MDTs.
Five proposals were received and were recommended for funding by the review panel. These
projects are expected to begin January 1, 2019. Staff recommends designating funds to the

Multidisciplinary Team Response Program: NOFO #1629-559

Program Description
MDT programs are designed to bridge the gaps in service for victims of domestic violence
through the establishment and implementation of model protocols and model guidelines to
enhance the criminal justice response to victims. MDT programs are multi-disciplinary and
require, at minimum, the involvement of prosecutors; law enforcement; probation; victim service
agencies; and an MDT Coordinator who convenes regular meeting of team partners to examine
the operation of team response to victims.
Program Activities
The overall focus of this Domestic Violence MDT expansion project are to identify households
that are at high-risk for future violence, proactively connect families to services, strengthen
investigation and prosecution of domestic violence offenders, provide inter-disciplinary
trainings, and to conduct ongoing self-evaluation to ensure that our pilot program continues to
benefit victims of domestic violence in the communities served.
The MDT partners will be responsible for ongoing monthly case reviews identifying trends from
case reviews that inform practices of all agencies involved, identification of training needs, long
term planning and assuring that leadership from all agencies remain involved and committed to
the MDT approach for addressing domestic violence in the City of Chicago. Various cases will
be reviewed, including cases where charges were not filed, cases that have reached disposition
and cases that have ongoing involvement with Adult Probation. During case review, team
members will have the opportunity to discuss what other evidence may have been considered,
what other questions may have been included in the victim and witness interviews, what other
sanctions may have been effective in terms of sentence and court monitoring as well as
additional services that could have proved beneficial to the survivor. These meetings will be led
by the designated Assistant State’s Attorney on the project and will be confidential in nature.

minimum, the involvement of prosecutors; law enforcement; probation; victim service agencies;
and an MDT Coordinator who convenes regular meeting of team partners to examine the
operation of team response to victims. MDTs often also include unfunded partners such as
Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANE).
Program Activities
The Sexual Assault Multidisciplinary team will utilize a model that encompasses a core team for
leadership as well as a broad based multi-disciplinary team (MDT) approach through the Cook
County State’s Attorney’s Office (SAO) Sexual Assault Advisory Group. The core team will
function as a steering committee for the project and will be made up of the SAO, Rape Victim
Advocates (RVA), Chicago Police Department (CPD), The Cook County Probation Department,
Life Span and a designated SANE Nurse. This team will be responsible for ongoing monthly
case reviews (led by the Assistant State’s Attorney), identifying trends from case reviews that
inform practices of all agencies involved, identification of training needs, long term planning and
assuring that leadership from all agencies remain involved and committed to the MDT approach
for addressing sexual assault in the City of Chicago with a primary area of focus on Area North.
This core team will be responsible for ensuring a proactive, results-oriented process that
purposefully achieves the goals of the MDT model.

The original Sexual Assault Multi-Disciplinary Team Response Project funded through the
Authority has grown over the years and has expanded into a designated Sexual Assault
Response Team (SART) with the addition of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) at
Presence St. Mary’s Hospital.
The success of the Kankakee County Sexual Assault and Stalking Response Team (SART)
lies within the responsibilities of its core funded and match funded team members who meet
monthly to discuss issues related to sexual assault and stalking, problem solve, conduct case
reviews, network to build relationships and explore training needs. The focus of the Kankakee
County SART is to heighten sensitivity to victims of sexual assault and stalking while
improving the initial response, evidence collection, victim interviews, victim referrals, and
prosecution and conviction rates. The SART follows the Model Guidelines for Sex Crimes
Investigation Manual for Illinois Law Enforcement which has been updated and expanded on
to accommodate each discipline participating in the SART.

Program Activities
The Peoria County Domestic Violence Multi-Disciplinary Team (PCDV-MDT) is a
coordinated community response to domestic violence in Peoria County. The PCDV-MDT
will be comprised of 17 funded and match positions which will be utilized to assist victims
and deal with domestic violence offenders. The PCDV-MDT has team members co-located
in downtown Peoria, at The Peoria County Family Justice Center. Located across the street
from the Peoria County Courthouse, it co-locates partner agencies creating a confidential,
secure, neutral "One Stop Shop" for victims of domestic violence to access to receive
services and emotional support. The PCDV-MDT initiates contact with victims of domestic
violence as soon as possible after the incidents occur. From the time the domestic violence
occurs, until resolution of the case in civil or criminal court, as well as for the duration
offenders are participating in domestic violence counseling, or on probation, the PCDVMDT provides extensive one on one follow up to victims of domestic violence in Peoria
County. The PCDV-MDT also actively network with community agencies to assist victims

Through this program expansion, the State’s Attorney’s Office (SAO) will, for the first time,
incorporate sexual assault and related offenses into the MDT grant. All misdemeanor classified
sexual offenses will be transferred to the courtroom that previously only handled domestic
violence and violations of orders of protection misdemeanors to facilitate the targeted

prosecution by attorneys specifically trained in the unique aspects of prosecuting sex crimes.
Additionally, a comprehensive training program by prosecutors will be implemented by the SAO
for law enforcement agencies throughout the county on the protocols of investigating cases of
this nature. In addition, law enforcement training will incorporate a partnered approach with
Violence Prevention Center staff and Call for Help, Inc. staff to afford victims of domestic and
sexual violence immediate services whenever possible, which is critical to not only the victims’
safety, but also their continued cooperation in the prosecution of cases.

3. Residential Treatment for Justice-Involved Girls
Staff recommends designating $844,268 in FFY17 funds to Maryville Academy to implement an
intensive residential treatment program for girls ages 14 through 18 who are in the custody of the
Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice (IDJJ) and have histories of trauma and abuse. The
program will provide services based on the Attachment, Regulation, and Competency (ARC)
treatment model. The program will target each girl’s specific needs, such as addressing previous
victimization and trauma through individual and group therapeutic treatment, and by offering
intensive family and relational support with a focus on positive youth development. Restorative
justice also will be a critical component of the program as effective treatment for girls because
must address relationships, healing, mutual and shared responsibility, and meaningful
accountability.
Maryville currently operates an ARC treatment program for boys in the custody of IDJJ. This
designation will allow IDJJ to test the efficacy of this treatment model for girls in their custody
who have been identified as suffering significant trauma because of their victimization.
Staff will be available at the meeting to answer any questions.
