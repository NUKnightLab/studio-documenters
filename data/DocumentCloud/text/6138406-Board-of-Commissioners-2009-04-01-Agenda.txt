WHEREAS, Mr. Franklin, a Harvard Ph.D., was, as Chairman of the History Department at Brooklyn
College, the first African-American to chair a history department at a major, predominantly white
university; Mr. Franklin went on to teach at numerous illustrious universities, including Cambridge
University, Harvard University, Howard University, the University of Chicago and Duke University,

African-American studies; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Franklin’s work also had popular reach as well; Mr. Franklin was best known as the
author of the groundbreaking chronicle, From Slavery To Freedom: A History of African-Americans; first
published in 1947 when no comprehensive history of African-Americans existed, the book has sold more
than three-and-one-half million copies and continues to be relevant, as evidenced by the most recently
updated and published 8th edition in 2000; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Franklin was also involved in the Civil Rights Movement; he performed research for
Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP as they argued Brown v. Board of Education before the Supreme
Court in 1954 to overturn public school segregation; in the 1990s, President William Jefferson Clinton
appointed Mr. Franklin as Chairman of his National Commission on Race Relations; and

RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, this year the Jewish holy day and Festival of Pesach (Passover) is honored beginning at
sunset on Wednesday, April 8, 2009 and continuing through Wednesday, April 15, 2009; and
WHEREAS, Passover commemorates God’s sparing of the Israelites, their liberation from slavery, and
their exodus from Egypt; and
WHEREAS, in the Biblical story of Exodus, God inflicted ten plagues upon the Egyptians before the
Pharaoh would release his Israelite slaves; the tenth plague was the killing of firstborn sons; the Israelites,
however, were instructed to mark the doorposts of their homes with the blood of a spring lamb and, upon
seeing this, God passed over these homes, hence the origin of the name, “Passover”; and
WHEREAS, also called “The Festival of Unleavened Bread,” when Pharaoh freed the Israelites, it has
been said that the Israelites left so quickly that they had no time to let their bread rise; therefore the
unleavened matzah is one of a number of symbolic foods eaten during Passover and, as the primary
symbol of the holiday, is eaten instead of bread throughout the eight days of Passover; and
WHEREAS, during Passover Jewish families gather in their homes at a ceremonial feast called the
Seder; at the Seder, Jews read aloud the story of the Israelites’ journey to the Promised Land from the
traditional book known as the Haggadah.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Todd H. Stroger, along with the Cook County Board
of Commissioners, on behalf of the more than five million residents of Cook County, do hereby recognize
the Jewish holy day and Festival of Passover, and do urge all residents to be cognizant of this holy day
and Festival, which are cherished and highly observed by members of the Jewish faith.

AUTHORIZATION FOR EMERGENCY REPLACEMENT
ITEM #51
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 18, 2009 from
JAMES D'AMICO, Director, Department of Facilities Management
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into and execute a contract with Carrier
Corporation, Elmhurst, Illinois, for the emergency replacement of the starter control panel on one chiller
and a ten (10) year tear down and rebuild on a second chiller unit at the Juvenile Temporary Detention
Center.
Reason:

Currently, both 38 year old chillers have failed and are in need of major repair. The control
panel has been jumped from one chiller to the other to have one functional chiller, however
this is only a temporary solution with no backup should this band-aid fail. The equipment is in
the east building where the juveniles are housed and monitored by the court.
One chiller has an internal oil seal leak on the compressor. As much as eight gallons of oil
per day was leaking into the refrigeration side. It was only a matter of time before that unit
would become laden with oil and fail, possibly beyond repair. So it was used as the
secondary unit while we waited for the Capital Budget to be passed. The other chiller’s
control panel contacts are worn and in some places welded together. Repair parts are not
available due to the age of this equipment.
Three (3) proposals were obtained and Carrier Corporation provided the lowest cost.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $105,000.00. (32000 Bond Account).
Approval of this item is contingent upon the issuance of general obligation Capital Improvement Bonds.
