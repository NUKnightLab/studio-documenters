Submitting reso. autho. Amending an Approved Industrial Facilities
Exemption Certificate Amendment, in the area of 7000 Georgia Detroit, Michigan in
Accordance with Public Act 198 of 1974 on behalf of Flex-N-Gate. (Petition #1185).
(Prior to the requested amendment, the original IFEC for Flex-N-Gate Detroit, LLC
was approved on October 11, 2016. Then in 2017, as required by State Tax
Commission (STC) rule number 54, which states, “if the final costs of a project are
greater than the original application amount by more than 10%, then the certificate
holder shall request that the local government unit approve the additional costs”;
Flex-N-Gate Detroit, LLC requested an amendment to IFEC #2016-158 to update
their real and personal property costs from $95,075,000 to $160,000,000. The IFEC
amendment was officially approved by the Council of the Whole on October 17, 2017.
However, upon submitting the approved amendment to the STC it was discovered
that the original IFEC was only approved for the real property component and that
the personal property component was abated under the Eligible Manufacturing
Personal Property Tax Exemption program. As such the originally approved
amendment should have only amended the real property costs from $40,000,000 to
$100,000,000.) (REFERRED TO THE PLANNING AND ECONOMIC
