Your Committee has considered the following item and upon the adoption of this report
the recommendation is as follows:
289040

DOCKET #8308 – J. PETITO, Owner, Application (No. V-07-78):
Variation to reduce north side yard setback from 10 feet to 2 feet 6
inches for a one story attached garage addition in the R-5 Single Family
Residence District. At the present time the applicant is storing a bobcat,
which he is renting out for commercial uses. This is not an allowable use
in a residential zone. The Zoning Board of Appeals felt that the applicant
did not prove a hardship to build an additional garage of approximately
550 square feet in addition to his approximate 240 square foot garage.
The subject property consists of approximately 0.21 of an acre, located
on the west side of Linden Avenue, approximately 54 feet south of
Gregory Street in Norwood Park Township, County Board District #9.
Recommendation: To remand the application to the Zoning Board
of Appeals to consider amendments to the plan.
Conditions: None
Objectors:

Two (2) neighbors spoke against allowing a 2 feet 6 inches
side yard setback stating that this was not the trend of
development in this neighborhood, although there are twocar garages, but none of them come within 2 feet 6 inches
of the lot line.

*Deferred at the Board meeting of September 6, 2007.

SECTION 3
Your Committee has considered the following item and upon the adoption of this report
the recommendation is as follows:
294365

AN AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY BUILDING ORDINANCE,
AMENDING THE DEFINITION OF BUILDING HEIGHT (PROPOSED
ORDINANCE AMENDMENT).
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance
Amendment sponsored by Gregg Goslin and Peter N. Silvestri, County
Commissioners.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AMENDMENT TO THE DEFINITION OF BUILDING HEIGHT
WHEREAS, the definition of building height in the Cook County Building
Ordinance is ambiguous and contradictory on the issue of measuring
height in the absence of curbs; and
WHEREAS, due to this oversight significant grade changes have
become an ongoing problem in unincorporated Cook County going forth
relatively unfettered by County Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, a small change in the definition of building height will
address this contradictory language by clarifying the manner in which
building height is measured when there is no curb present.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that the Cook County Building Code be amended as
follows:
BUILDING CODE
ARTICLE III RULES AND DEFINITIONS
Building Height: is the vertical distance measured from the curb level or
its equivalent opposite the center existing lot grade five feet in front of the
center of the front of the building, to the highest point of the under side of
the ceiling beams in the case of a flat roof; to the deck line of a mansard
roof; and the mean level of the under side of the rafters between the
highest eaves and the ridge of a gable, hip, shed, gambrel, or any other
pitched roof. Where no curb level has been established the height of a
building shall be measured from the mean elevation of the existing lot
grade at the front of the building.
*Referred to the Committee on Zoning and Building on 6/3/08.
