(Item A1)
In October 1999, the CHA embarked upon its Plan for Transformation. One of its major goals is
to promote self-sufficiency for CHA residents and relocatees. The Office of Resident Services
is the arm of the organization responsible for achieving this goal. As a next step in ensuring that
services are provided efficiently and effectively to residents by the Office of Resident Services
and its contracted and intergovernmental partners the Office of Resident Services plans to
evaluate and map its existing plan for social service provision to residents, develop a
collaborative process for identifying best practices that includes key stakeholders, and create a
plan for realigning services. The goal of this plan would be to reduce duplication of services,
develop accountability for contractors, potentially reduce costs, and maximize the effectiveness
of services provided to CHA residents. A Request for Proposal was advertised in May 2007. In
addition to advertising, 43 firms were directly solicited. Of the five respondents who submitted
proposals, three were determined to be within the competitive range. Based upon an evaluation
of the written proposals, the evaluation committee recommended contract award to DAH
Consulting, Inc. Accordingly, the resolution for Item A1 approves award of contract to DAH
Consulting Inc.
RESOLUTION NO. 2007-CHA-102

(Item A2)
The resolution for Item A2 approves contract extension with LR ABLA LLC. Based upon LR
ABLA’s performance on the Contract to date and the availability of funding, the CHA desires to

30, 2008. The requested additional funding for the Contract’s 1-year extension, when added to
the remaining balance available at the end of the current term of the Contract, will allow LR
ABLA to continue servicing the 125 families who moved into the redeveloped Roosevelt Square
community in FY2006 as well as the 695 families being screened for move-in. The services to
be rendered during the extension year will continue to focus on assisting residents through the

Proposal for an annual requirements contract was advertised in May 2007 in area newspapers. In
addition, the solicitation was placed on CHA’s website and Buy-Speed. Of the three proposals
received and evaluated it was determined that all three firms were in the competitive range. After
negotiation of the Best and Final Offers, the evaluation committee determined that General
Electric Company had the best overall customer service, training and warranty programs, as well
as providing the best overall economic value to provide the required appliances. Accordingly, the
resolution for Item B1 approves award of contract to General Electric.

RESOLUTION NO. 2007-CHA-106

The resolutions for Items B2, B3, B5, B6, B7 and B8 approves ratification of the extension of
contracts of the private property management agreements with the respective property manager
to manage various CHA residential properties. The CHA first introduced private management of
its public housing in the 1980s with its scattered sites programs as a condition of court
receivership. Private Management of public housing was expanded thereafter to a limited
number of troubled high-rise family properties in the late 1980’s. By 2000, all CHA residential
properties had been turned over to private managers. The units owned by CHA in mixed
income properties are also privately managed. Some of the primary responsibilities of the
property management companies are: rent collection, emergency and non-emergency work
orders, resident eligibility re-examinations, unit and building systems inspections, property
budget/expenditure reporting and assessments, lease enforcement, referral of residents to social
services and risk management. The overall performance of the property managers in the
following areas were considered satisfactory and have consistently shown marked improvement:
lease management, financial accountability, risk management and compliance.

All-Bry Construction Company / Sandsmith J.V. was determined to be the lowest responsive,
responsible bidder. The Zelda Ormes Apartments located at 116 West Elm Street is a 13 story

(Item B10)
Altgeld/Murray Development is currently undergoing modernization. Part of the modernization
efforts include the construction of two laundry facilities. Accordingly, an RFP for the supply,
delivery and maintenance of washers, dryers and laundry room equipment was advertised on
CHA’s website in June 2007. In addition to advertising, seven laundry firms which includes
two MBEs were directly solicited.
A highly recommended site visit and pre-proposal
conference were also held. Of the two responses received it was determined that Coinmach was
the most responsive and responsible vendor since they would provide: high-efficient equipment;
an extensive preventative maintenance program; a fixed percentage of gross revenues not tied to
occupancy levels; a convenient and secure debit card laundry system; guaranteed response time
to all service calls within nine business hours of receipt; and a computerized dispatch system
that logs all service calls, which increases efficiency. The resolution for Item B10, therefore,

Application and Evidentiaries to HUD; commit up to $9,000,000 of CHA Funds to the Robert
Taylor Phase C-2 rental redevelopment and execute ground lease(s) for four parcels of CHA
land to Legends C-2, LLC. Brinshore-Michaels development team was the successful
respondent to CHA’s solicitation for planning and implementation of the redevelopment of
Robert Taylor Homes. The master plan for Robert Taylor Homes (now known as Legends
South) is a holistic urban redevelopment plan that transforms, revitalizes the current site and
surrounding neighborhood, and reintegrates Robert Taylor residents into the broader community.
Phase C-2 rental, the second phase of the Robert Taylor Homes Phase C off-site redevelopment,
will consist of approximately 118 units of rental housing and a management office. Of the 118
units, it is expected that 23 will be market-rate and that 95 will be affordable low-income
housing tax credit units, including 52 which will be set aside for public housing residents. The
development will be located in an area bounded by State Street on the West, 39th Street on the
North, Prairie Avenue on the East and 43rd Street on the South. The development consists of a
variety of building types ranging from 3-flats and multi-unit buildings to townhomes in twentyone building structures to be constructed on four parcels of vacant CHA owned Washington Park
Homes properties, which will be ground leased at a nominal rent to Legends C-2, LLC for 99
years. The ownership entity, Legends C-2, LLC, consists of Legends C-2 Manager, LLC as
Manager and/or managing member, and is owned equally by Michaels Chicago Holding Company,
LLC and Brinshore Holding, LLC. The investor member will be TRGHT, Inc. and/or an affiliate
of TRGHT, Inc. The subject Mixed Finance Proposal sets forth the financing structure for the
Phase C-2 project, to which the CHA, Daniel E. Levin and The Habitat Company, LLC, as
Gautreaux receiver, and other investors and lenders have agreed in principle. The total estimated
development cost of Legends South - Phase C-2 Rental is $32,452,846. The capital funds being
requested for Phase C-2 are in addition to the HOPE VI funding committed by the Board. The
development agreement projected that additional CHA funds would be required for Phase C, but
only obligated the Authority to commit the remaining 1996 HOPE VI funding for Phase C.

as the selected development team for the Phase II homeownership area of the redevelopment of
Madden Park/Ida B. Wells/Darrow Homes. Granite Partners For Oakwood Boulevard was the

justification by staff, it is in the best interest of the CHA to proceed with the same developer for
Phase II. Granite Partners will be responsible for preparing funding applications, assembling
financing, obtaining necessary approvals, construction, and managing the second
homeownership phase of Madden/Wells. Madden/Wells Homeownership Phase II will consist
of approximately 341 units; 159 units in phase IIA and 182 in phase IIB. A goal of
