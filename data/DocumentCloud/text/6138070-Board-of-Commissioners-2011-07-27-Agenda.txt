(b)
Every person who is given an offer of employment with the County shall file an affidavit
with the Bureau of Human Resources disclosing any unpaid court-ordered child support obligations owed
by the applicant, and including the court number of their child support case and the county and state in
which the child support case is pending.
(c)
Where an applicant’s affidavit discloses, or the department of human resources otherwise
determines, that an applicant owes any unpaid court- ordered child support, such applicant shall only be
hired by the County on the condition that he or she establishes one of the following within six months of
the start of employment:
(1)
the applicant has paid to the obligee all child support due under the court order, as
evidenced by a certified court order or official clerk’s record that no support is due and owing; or
(2)
the applicant has entered into a court- approved agreement for the payment of all child
support owed and is in compliance with that agreement; or
(3)
the applicant is not an obligor under a court-ordered child support obligation. Failure to
establish one of the above criteria within six months of the start of employment shall be grounds for
discharge.
(d)
In addition, all new and existing County employees must take all steps within their power
to ensure that an income withholding notice for any current, ongoing child support obligation has been
served upon the County, and amounts are being deducted from their salary or wages in compliance
therewith.
(e)
All County employees must comply with all court-ordered child support obligations as a
condition of employment. Noncompliance shall be grounds for discipline.
(f)
The Bureau of Human Resources is authorized to treat administrative child support orders
in the same manner as it does court-ordered child support obligations under this section and to promulgate
rules and regulations to govern the treatment of such administrative orders. As used herein,
“administrative child support orders” are orders or findings by the Illinois Department of Public Aid (or
any other state agency authorized by statute to so act in its stead), pursuant to Article X of the Illinois
Public Aid Code, 305 ILCS 5/10-1 to 1-022, or any similar statute, imposing child support payment
obligations.
(g)

The Bureau of Human Resources is further authorized to do the following:

investigate the child support payment records of employees and applicants to determine
compliance with court-ordered child support obligations;

(2)

provide information on employees and applicants to the appropriate Cook County, City
of Chicago, and State of Illinois governmental entities, to the extent allowed by law, to
assist those offices in enforcement of child support obligations;

(h)
Reporting by committees. Notwithstanding any action to be undertaken by committees or
subcommittees pursuant to this section, only the Board may take final action on any item referred to a
committee or subcommittee. Committees shall report to the Board, and subcommittees shall report to
their parent committees, subsequent to adjournment of a meeting of the committee or subcommittee.
The report of any committee or subcommittee shall be comprised of two sections. The first section of the
report, "the text," shall constitute the minutes of the meeting for which the report was prepared and shall
contain: a list of the attendees; an account of the items considered; a summary of the deliberations,
including motions and amendments proposed and/or adopted; all votes taken; the result of said votes; and,
any attachments to the record as ordered by the Chair. The second section of the report shall include a
summary of certain actions taken at the meeting for which the report was prepared. For purposes of this
paragraph, action is defined as motions, duly seconded and carried, to adopt one of the six (6) following
statements of intent with respect to a Communication Numbered item:
(1)

Recommend for Approval;

(2)

Recommend for Approval as Amended;

(3)

Not Recommended for Approval;

(4)

Not Recommended for Approval as Amended;

(5)

Recommended for Receiving and Filing; and

(6)

Returned With No Recommendation.

The committee's adoption of any one of the above six statements of intent, as reported to the
Board, shall constitute conclusive action by the committee on a Communication Numbered item, and
shall automatically discharge the committee from further jurisdiction of the item. Absent the attachment
of one of these six statements of intent to the Communication Numbered item, such item will remain in
committee unless discharged by the Board.
The Board's approval of a committee report that contains a statement(s) of intent as set forth in
numbers (1) through (5) above in this section will constitute final Board action on the item(s) attached to
the statement(s) of intent. The Board's approval of a committee report that contains a statement of intent
as set forth in number (6), "Returned With No Recommendation," places the item before the Board for
immediate consideration.
Commissioners present and voting on a motion to approve a committee report retain the right to
divide their vote with regard to each item contained in the second section of the report, or to request a
separate vote, either by voice or roll call, on such items, regardless of whether the first section has been
approved.

Chair, be designated as a public hearing; provided that the following requirements are satisfied:

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
POLICY FOR RESPONDING TO ICE DETAINERS
WHEREAS, Cook County is a “Fair and Equal County for Immigrants,” as defined in 07-R-240; and
WHEREAS, there is ongoing confusion regarding the proper boundaries of the relationship between
local law enforcement and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”); and
WHEREAS, this is especially true in the context of ICE detainers, which are issued pursuant to 8 USC §
1226 or 8 USC § 1357(d), and used by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to advise local law
enforcement agencies that DHS seeks custody of an individual presently in the custody of that agency;
and
WHEREAS, 8 CFR § 287.7 expressly provides that ICE detainers are merely “requests” that local law
enforcement advise DHS when the individual is due to be released, and that the agency continue holding
the individual beyond the scheduled time of release for up to 48 hours, excluding weekends and federal
holidays, in order for ICE to arrange to assume custody; and
WHEREAS, due to troubling inconsistencies in ICE policies, many local law enforcement agencies
erroneously believe ICE detainers are mandatory and that local law enforcement agencies are legally
required to comply; and
WHEREAS, ICE detainers are generally issued before a finding of probable cause that an individual is
deportable, and have even been imposed on U.S. Citizens by mistake; and
WHEREAS, ICE detainers are routinely imposed on individuals, including minors, without any criminal
convictions or whose cases are dismissed, but the federal government only reimburses part of the costs
associated with ICE detainers imposed on undocumented individuals who are convicted of a felony or
two misdemeanors and detained for four or more consecutive days if there is a written agreement with the
State or local subdivision of a State, pursuant to 8 USC § 1231(i); and
WHEREAS, ICE will not indemnify local agencies for costs or liability incurred as a result of wrongful
detainers; and
WHEREAS, it costs Cook County approximately $43,000 per day to hold individuals “believed to be
undocumented” pursuant to ICE detainers, and Cook County can no longer afford to expend taxpayer
funds to incarcerate individuals who are otherwise entitled to their freedom; and
WHEREAS, the enforcement of immigration laws is a responsibility of the federal government; and
WHEREAS, ICE detainers encourage racial profiling and harassment; and

PROPOSED ORDINANCE continued
ITEM #7 cont’d
WHEREAS, having local law enforcement participate in the enforcement of ICE detainers places a great
strain on our communities by eroding the public trust that local law enforcement depends on to secure the
accurate reporting of criminal activity and to prevent and solve crimes; and
WHEREAS, by means of this ordinance, Cook County joins states, cities, and counties across the nation
that are informed about the discretionary nature of ICE detainers and refuse to enforce them, except in
situations where federal reimbursement may be available.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter
46 Law Enforcement, Section 46-37 of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
Sec. 46-37. Policy for responding to ICE detainers.
(a)
No individual shall be asked about his/her place of birth, country of origin, citizenship, or
immigration status upon admission or booking to the Cook County Department of Corrections or Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center.
(b)
Local law enforcement shall not facilitate or allow any telephone communication
between an individual and any ICE official without a court order requiring it.
(c)
Any individual who has bondable charges upon admission shall be allowed to post bond
to secure his/her release.
(d)
Local law enforcement shall not comply with ICE detainers unless the following
conditions are met:
(1)

The individual who is the subject of an ICE detainer has been convicted of at least one
felony or two misdemeanors, excluding sealed or expunged criminal records, by the
scheduled time of release; and

(2)

There is a written agreement with the State or local subdivision of a State, pursuant to 8
USC § 1231(i), by which all costs incurred by Cook County in complying with the ICE
detainer shall be reimbursed.

(e)
If the conditions for compliance provided in subsection (d) above are met, then the
individual shall be provided with a copy of ICE Form I-247 and ICE officers will be given up to 48 hours,
excluding weekends and federal holidays, from the time the individual would otherwise be entitled to
release to pick him/her up. If the individual is not picked up by ICE within the 48 hour period, he/she
shall be released.
(f)
Unless ICE agents have a criminal warrant, they shall not be given access to individuals
or allowed to use County facilities for investigative interviews or other purposes, and County personnel
shall not expend their time responding to ICE inquiries or communicating with ICE regarding
individuals’ incarceration status or release dates.

(g)
There being no legal authority upon which the federal government may compel an
expenditure of County resources to comply with an ICE detainer issued pursuant to 8 USC § 1226 or 8
USC § 1357(d), there shall be no expenditure of any County resources or effort by County personnel for
this purpose, except as expressly provided herein.
(h)
Any person who alleges a violation of this policy may file a written complaint for
investigation with the Independent Inspector General of Cook County.
Effective Date: This Ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

A RESOLUTION URGING THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO PASS LEGISLATION
REQUIRING ALL UNITS OF GOVERNMENT IN ILLINOIS TO POST THE WAGES AND
BENEFIT PACKAGES OF ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois has the greatest number of governmental bodies in the nation at nearly
7,000 units of government; and
WHEREAS, it is the responsibility of government to be committed to the highest standards of integrity,
honesty, efficiency and accountability among its officials and employees; and
WHEREAS, it is of tantamount importance that the taxpayers of every unit of government trust that their

A RESOLUTION CALLING ON CONGRESS TO FULLY FUND THE
FEDERAL HIGH-SPEED RAIL PROGRAM IN THE 2012 BUDGET
WHEREAS, the Upper Midwest region of the United States is one of the world's largest and most
dynamic economies, but struggles to compete in the global market; and
WHEREAS, the Upper Midwest offers a diverse base of manufacturing, agriculture, academic and
government research, and business services that are often too distant from our cities and from one another
for effective business development and sharing of intellectual capital; and
WHEREAS, the Upper Midwest represents roughly one-third of the population of the United States but
job growth in the region lags behind other regions of the world; and
WHEREAS, our reliance on oil-fueled airplanes and automobiles for intercity travel hurts the Midwest
economy, especially with the rising price of oil; and
WHEREAS, fast, convenient and affordable travel is needed to facilitate a strong and vibrant economy;
and
WHEREAS, an integrated network of 220-mph bullet trains and 90-110 mph regional trains linking cities
and towns across the Midwest would transform the way we travel and do business by making travel more
affordable and better connecting our business, manufacturing, agricultural, and research and development
centers; and
WHEREAS, high-speed trains would strengthen our economy, drive productivity in the region’s existing
commercial arenas, encourage job growth, and help foster potential for business investment,
entrepreneurship, technology development and advanced manufacturing; and
WHEREAS, the investment in a high-speed train network would lower our consumption of foreign oil,
saving nearly 130 million gallons of gasoline a year while dramatically reducing carbon dioxide
emissions into the environment; and

Re: VISION CARE BENEFITS – EYEMED VISION CARE, LLC
On November 5, 2008, the Cook County Board of Commissioners authorized the Purchasing Agent to
enter into a contract with EyeMed Vision Care requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter
into a contract to provide eligible Cook County employees and their dependents with a Vision Care
program from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2011.
EyeMed Vision Care and its corporate affiliate and third party administrator, First American
Administrators, Inc., have been providing the contracted services since January, 2009. It has recently
been determined that the contract did not proceed to Contracts and Bonds nor was the contract executed
by the County. The final contract was not fully negotiated until late 2010 and First American
Administrators, Inc., the licensed third party administrator and corporate affiliate needed to be added to
the contract per a State Consent Order entered into between EyeMed Vision Care and the Illinois
Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. As a result of the above, it is hereby requested that
the November 5, 2008 authorization be amended as follows:

Re: VISION CARE BENEFITS – EYEMED VISION CARE, LLC

affiliate and third party administrator to provide eligible Cook County employees and their dependents
with a Vision Care program from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2011.
The Request for Proposal (RFP) for Vision Care Benefits was joint initiative by the various municipal
agencies and issued by the Chicago Transit Authority. Six (6) national vision care companies responded
to this Request for Proposal. Based on an extensive financial analysis and overall evaluation of benefits
from the respondents, the Department of Risk Management recommends the selection of EyeMed Vision
Care. EyeMed Vision Care, previously known as Cole Managed Vision, offers the following advantages:
lowest costs for examinations, spectacle lenses, contact and frames; largest provider network in Cook
County with 730 locations; high level of satisfaction for Cook County employees since 1995; responsive
service and ease of administration to covered members; very competitive administrative fee; and a fiveyear rate guarantee for materials and services (three year term, with two one-year renewal options). The
proposal from EyeMed Vision Care includes Minority Business Enterprises (MBE)/Women Business
Enterprises (WBE) direct participation and has been found responsive to the Contract Compliance
guidelines. This will allow Cook County employees to continue to participate in the Vision Care program
as part of the fringe benefit package.
All fees and expenses will be paid from the following accounts:
Corporate/Grant: 490-179
Public Safety: 499-179
Health Fund: 899-179
Estimated Annual Fiscal Impact: $2,900,000.00.
The actual charges for each fund will vary based on the actual monthly utilization.

Transmitting a Communication, dated June 17, 2011 from
HERMAN BREWER, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into and execute a contract with Johnson
Controls, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin (JCI), for a Guaranteed Energy Performance Contracting Project.
Phase 1 of this contract provides for engineering services for an investment grade energy audit of the
Stroger Hospital of Cook County Campus. Johnson Controls was selected through a Request for
Qualifications/Request for Proposals process as highly qualified and offering a competitive price.
Reason:

This contract provides for a guaranteed energy performance contracting project at the Stroger
Hospital of Cook County Campus. The goal of the project is to identify and implement
identifying energy conservation measures (ECMs) that will result in at least a 10% reduction
in emissions and energy costs as compared to a Base Year, throughout a 15 year financing
period. Phase 1 consists of a comprehensive investment grade audit. If the ECMs identified
are estimated to achieve cost savings sufficient to cover financing of the ECMs, the parties
will negotiate in good faith the terms of Phase 2, pursuant to which JCI will perform

 page 52
POST BOARD ACTION AGENDA
Meeting of July 27, 2011
engineering and construction services to implement the agreed upon ECMs. If adequate cost
savings to cover the financing costs cannot be identified, the County has no obligation to pay
for the audit. If adequate savings are identified but the County chooses not to enter into a
GEPC or chooses not to finance the conservation measures, the County will pay the actual

JAMES D'AMICO, Director, Department of Facilities Management
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $5,940.00 from and to the

ITEM #35
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 17, 2011 from
ABISHI C. CUNNINGHAM, JR., Public Defender
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Leann Horrocks,
Venice, Florida, for development of an interface between the Public Defender's Legal Edge system and
the Circuit Court Clerk's data system.
Reason:

This office has a case management system to assist in tracking cases and helping attorneys
handle their caseload. The reason for the request is we must expand our usage of the current
case management system in order to properly fulfill our mission of defending the indigent. In
addition, the data provided by the Circuit Court Clerk's Office will help us provide data for
our performance management objectives as requested by the President's Office. This office is
appointed to over 100,000 cases a year and does not have the manpower to manually input
case information into our system. The Clerk's Office already has the case data this office
requires in their electronic system and has a data file which they make available to other
agencies in the criminal justice system. The Chief Information Officer, Greg
Wass, has reviewed the proposal and concurs with the need.
After submitting a Request For Proposal to purchasing and going through the appropriate
bidding process, we found Ms. Horrock's qualifications to be the best in terms of meeting the
specifications and award amount. Her proposal is slightly higher for startup but is more
efficient and less expensive in the long run for maintenance and support. Her hourly rate was
the lowest of the three bids.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $131,100.00. Contract period: August 15, 2011 through August 14, 2012.
(717/260-579 Account).

JOSEPH BERRIOS, Cook County Assessor
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Michael J. Shine
Consulting, Chicago, Illinois, to be the management consultant for the transition of the Assessor's Office.
Reason:

Michael J. Shine was chosen because of his experience as a senior executive in providing
advice to elected officials during the office's initial transition. He has ten years experience
working as a chief of staff for an elected official in Cook County government, responsible for
advising County offices employment practices; labor/union relations and negotiations;
government budget preparation and process; government procurement procedures; legislative
agenda actions; and coordination of intergovernmental communications and operations. He
was brought in specifically to aid the Cook County Treasurer's Office when the new Treasurer
and administration was transitioning into place. Michael J. Shine was responsible for
planning, organizing and implementing management reorganization along with consulting and
coordination with local unions that represented a majority of the staff. He is likely the only
management consultant with the necessary skills and abilities to meet the requirements set
forth by the CCAO in its search for a consultant to aid in the current transition.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $32,000.00. Contract period: June 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. (040260 Account).

& Repair of Auto Equipment for the repair of a van that was involved in an accident in May 2011.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
In May 2011, one of the Clerk of the Circuit Court vehicles was involved in an accident. Three
estimates were obtained for the repair of the vehicle, the vendor providing the lowest estimate was
selected, and the repair services were performed in June 2011. A Payment Only Requisition was
completed immediately following the repair services using available funds in Account 528-449. On
July 18, 2011, it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds as
the County Budget Department determined that Account 528-449 is not the appropriate account for
payment of the repair. Account 528-444 was not budgeted in FY 2011, therefore, the balance on
July 18, 2011 and thirty days prior to that date was $0.00.

the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention for the Cook
County Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force Program. This extension will enable the

The ICAC funding allows the Office to dedicate one administrative assistant to support the work of the
Task Force, one Assistant State’s Attorney to focus on ICAC cases, as well as continue to provide
funding to equip and train the Cook County ICAC Task Force partner agencies in an effort to
aggressively identify, investigate and prosecute persons who use the Internet to sexually exploit children
as well as prevent such exploitation through community outreach and education. The Cook County ICAC
Task Force partners include representatives of the State’s Attorney’s Office, the Chicago Police
Department and law enforcement agencies from throughout Cook County. Task Force partners from
local law enforcement agencies concentrate their investigative efforts in the City of Chicago and the
entire outlying suburban Cook County area. This grant does not require a match contribution.
The authorization to accept the original grant award was given on December 3, 2008 by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners in the amount of $300,000.00.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Funding Period Extension: July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012.
