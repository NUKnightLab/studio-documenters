REALLOCATION OF INDEMNITY RESERVE. Transmitting a Communication,
dated February 27, 2004 from Peter N. Silvestri, Chairman of the Finance
Committee's Subcommittee on Litigation:
Re: Reallocation of Indemnity Reserve
Contract Modification #8 approved by County Board on April 15, 2003
Contract #97-50-1104 Rebid (Walsh/Riteway)
Please be advised that on December 3, 2003, the Litigation Subcommittee
granted authority to the Department of Risk Management to reallocate
$450,000.00 of the Indemnity Reserve ($8.3 million) for payment of defense
costs and fees to the law firm of Christiansen and Ehret for general liability
covered claims. John L. Hibbett, Director of Risk Management, submitted this
request.

 FINANCE AGENDA
MARCH 9, 2004
P AGE 34

On April 15, 2003, an indemnity reserve of $8.3 million was established to
administer and settle worker's compensation and liability claims arising out of
the construction of the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County. These
are claims which will not be paid by insurance due to the liquidation of Reliance
Insurance Companies. This reallocation was accommodated within the
Reserve without an increase in the total reserve.
For information purposes, the focus of the work performed has been the
exploration of other sources of funds , such as insurance through
subcontractors and the Illinois Guaranty Fund, while initial discovery continued.
This phase is now complete. $350,000.00 of the requested amount is intended
to cover fees and costs for discovery necessary to file summary j udgment
motions or settlement discussions. Additional funds, about $100,000.00, are
reserved for such experts and trial costs.
