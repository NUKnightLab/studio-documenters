STAFF REPORT 9-11-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER
ADDRESS: 228-266 EDMUND PLACE
HISTORIC DISTRICT: BRUSH PARK
APPLICANT: MELISSA DITTMER
DATE OF COMPLETE APPLICATION: 9-5-2019
DATE OF STAFF SITE VISIT: 9-9-2019

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

SCOPE: ERECT A NEW BUILDING (REVISION TO PREVIOUSLY-APPROVED PROPOSAL)
EXISTING CONDITIONS
The project site includes three adjacent empty parcels that are located within the 200 block of Edmund
Place. The general surrounds are dominated by newly constructed, 2-6 story, mixed-use (multiple-family
and commercial) buildings. Four, ca.1880, 3-story dwellings are located to the north of the project area.
The historic buildings are clad with red brick.

PROPOSAL
The applicant appeared in front of this body at the 2-17-2016 special meeting with a proposal to establish a
new mixed-use, multiple-building development (to include commercial and multiple family) within the
area bounded by John R, Brush Street, Alfred, and Edmund Place. The development included several
building typologies to include apartments, duplexes, townhomes, and carriage homes. The Commission
approved the proposal as presented. With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s
approval to replace the approved duplex or “duplette” building at 228-266 Edmund Place with a 12-unit, 3story townhome design. Note that the Commission approved this same townhome design for erection on
John R, Brush, and Alfred Streets, within the City Modern development. Specifically, as per the applicant:

 •
•

The townhome building measures 46’-2” to the top of the parapet wall whereas the approved
duplette building measures 47’-5 ½”. In re: to the building footprints, both measure 223’-8” x 64’10”. The setback for both buildings is consistent as well.
The new townhome building will feature red brick exterior walls to reflect the red brick found at
the nearby historic homes. The rooftop penthouses will display wood cladding with metal copings.
Windows are aluminum units with aluminum spandrel panels. Patios are located at the front and
rear elevations, second story. The building will also feature rooftop patios.

None
RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommends that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the work as proposed
because it meets the Secretary of the Interior Standards for Rehabilitation, standard #9) New additions,
exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the
property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size,
scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
However, staff recommends that the Commission issue this COA with the condition that staff be given the
authority to review and approve minor revisions to the approved design. Should staff determine that any
such revision does not meet the Standards, staff shall forward the project to the Commission for review at a
meeting.

RE: City Modern - Townhome Building 6

Dear Ms. Ross:

After careful thought and consideration, Hunter Pasteur Homes Brush Park, in coordination with
Bedrock, respectfully requests to replace the previously approved Duplette Building l'Dl") with a block
of 12 Townhornes 

It is important to note that as part ofthe design PFDCESS, we were very cognizant of the previously
approved height of the structure and building envelope. The TH structure measures 4652? to the top of
the parapet wall, whereas the DP structure measures 47?-5 1/2? to the top of the parapet wall. With
respect to the building envelope, both TH and DP measure 223'~3" wide and 54'-10? deep. Moreover,
will use a similar combination of masonry, metal coping and cedar siding as the previously
approved Townhomes. While the materials will remain the same, in an effort to differentiate the block,
the color palette will vary from the previously approved TH blocks.

To accommodate the larger footprint when compared to other TH blocks, the unit sizes ofTH?6 are
larger. Unit sizes range from 2,300 SF 3,170 SF, including the finished interior rooftop space. Based on
prospect and purchaser response, there is a shortage of inventory for Townhomes larger than 2000
interior SF. Functional and private exterior space is also in strong demand. Therefore, the design
features an array ofoutdoor spaces including rooftop decks, 1H and Floor patios as well as a second-
floor deck above the garage. As such, we believe TH-E is the right typology to meet market demand.

The attached package should provide you the additional detail and background needed for your review.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Seth Herkowitz

 Brush Park elements of design
(d)
The defined elements of design, as provided for in section 25-2-2, shall be as follows:
(1)

Height. Height varies in the district from one (1) to eleven (11) stories. In the area between Woodward and

(2)

Proportion of building's front facade. Buildings in the district are usually taller than wide; horizontal

(3)

Proportion of openings within the facade. Areas of void generally constitute between fifteen (15) percent and
thirty-five (35) percent of the total facade area, excluding roof. Proportions of the openings themselves are
generally taller than wide; in some cases, vertically proportioned units are combined to fill an opening wider
than tall.

(4)

Rhythm of solids to voids in front facade. Victorian structures in the district often display great freedom in

(5)

Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The area between Woodward and Brush appears to have been

(6)

Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Most buildings have or had a porch or entrance projection.

(7)

Relationship of materials. By far the most prevalent material in the district is common brick; other forms of

Brush, the original development was almost exclusively two and one-half (21/2) story houses. Later changes
included the construction of apartment buildings among the houses, the majority of which are three (3) stories
in height. The tallest building, the former Detroiter Hotel, is located on Woodward Avenue in the
commercial strip. All other buildings more than four (4) stories in height are located between Woodward and
John R., and generally on or immediately adjacent to buildings on those streets. East of Brush, the original
development ranged from one (1) to two and one-half (21/2) stories. Later redevelopment includes
apartment buildings not more than four (4) stories tall, most often located on Brush. In the case of the
nineteenth century houses located between Woodward and Brush, the two and one-half (21/2) story height
implies more height in feet than usual, since ceiling heights in these houses are unusually high.
proportions exist only in incompatible later buildings, except for row house buildings.

the placement of openings in the facades, although older examples are generally more regular in such
placement than later examples. In later apartments, openings tend to be very regular.
developed in a very regular spacing, with fifty (50) foot lots. This regularity has been disrupted by the
demolition of many of the houses, and the vacant land resulting, as well as the occasional combination of lots
for larger structures, particularly close to Woodward. East of Brush, smaller lots were used in subdividing, but
many buildings stand on more land than one lot, and the parcel sizes are now quite irregular, as is the
placement of buildings.
The variety inherent in Victorian design precludes the establishment of any absolute rhythm, but such
projections were often centered. On Woodward, the commercial nature of most buildings and the widening
of Woodward has effectively eliminated such projections.

brick, stone and wood trim are common; wood is used as a structural material only east of Brush. Some later
buildings have stucco wall surfaces. Originally, roofs were wood or slate with an occasional example of tile;
asphalt replacement roofs are common.

(8)

Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is the low-relief pattern of

(9)

Relationship of colors. Brick red predominates, both in the form of natural color brick and in the form of
painted brick. Other natural brick and stone colors are also present. These relate to painted woodwork in
various colors, and there is an occasional example of stained woodwork. Roofs of other than asphalt are in

mortar joints in brick contrasted to the smoother or rougher surfaces of stone or wood trim. Slate, wood, or
tile roofs contribute particular textural values where they exist, especially in the case of slates or shingles of
other than rectangular shape.

 natural colors; older slate roofs are often laid in patterns with various colors of slate. Original color schemes
for any given building may be determined by professional analysis of the paint layers on the building, and
when so determined are always appropriate for that building.
(10)

Relationship of architectural detail. On the buildings of the Victorian period, elaborate detail in wood, stone,
or sheet metal was common; areas treated include porches, window and door surrounds, cornices, dormers,
and other areas. Later buildings are generally simpler, but include less elaborate detail in similar areas.

(11)

Relationship of roof shapes. Examples of many roof shapes, including pitched gable roofs, hip roofs, mansard

(12)

Walls of continuity. Between Woodward and Brush, the houses originally honored common setbacks which
provided for front lawns. Some of the later apartments have not been set back to the same line as the houses
amongst which they were built, thus disturbing the original line of continuity. On Woodward, the
commercial development is typically at the sidewalk, creating a wall of continuity; this is not entirely
continuous due to parking lots and some buildings set well back. On John R. and Brush, and east of Brush,
buildings are typically placed at or near the sidewalk with little or no front yard. Where buildings are
continuous, a wall of continuity is created.

(13)

Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The major landscape feature of the

(14)

Relationship of open space to structures. There is a large quantity of open space in the area, due to

(15)

Scale of facades and facade elements. In the large houses between John R. and Brush, the scale tends to be
large, and the facade elements scaled and disposed to emphasize the large size of the houses. Towers, setbacks,
porches and the like divide facades into large elements. On Woodward, the scale ranges from very large, and
emphasized by many small window openings, as in the former Detroiter Hotel, and very large, made up of
large architectonic elements, such as the churches, down to quite small, with large windows emphasizing the
small size, as in some commercial fronts. East of Brush, the scale is smaller and the detail less elaborate,
creating a more intimate setting with the buildings closer to the street. Later apartments are large in scale with
simple but large elements near the ground and repetitive window openings above, frequently capped by a
substantial cornice.

(16)

Directional expression of front facades. A substantial majority of the buildings in the district have front

roofs, and gambrel roofs are present. Different types are sometimes combined in a single structure, and tower
roofs, cupolas, lanterns, belvideres, monitors, conical roofs are used on various Victorian houses. Flat roof
areas in the center of hip or mansard roofs are frequent. Later apartment and commercial buildings generally
have flat roofs not visible from the ground. The generally tall roofs add height to the houses of the Victorian
period.

district is the vacant land, which creates a feeling that buildings are missing in the district. Some houses have
more than the standard fifty (50) foot lot, and have wide side yards. Individual houses have front lawns often
subdivided by walks leading to the entrance; lawns are exceedingly shallow or non-existent in the area between
Beaubien and Brush. Side drives are rare, access to garages or coach houses being from the alleys. The closing
of Watson and Edmund Place between John R. and Brush has created landscaped malls uncharacteristic to the
district. Some walks of stone slabs have survived; others have been replaced in concrete. Sidewalks are
characteristically close to the curb.
demolition of buildings. The character of this open space is haphazard as it relates to buildings, and indicates
the unplanned nature of demolitions due to decline. The feeling created is that buildings are missing and
should be present. On Watson and Edmund between John R. and Brush, the streets have been removed and
replaced with landscaped malls. The traditional relationship of houses to street has thus become a relationship
between houses and landscaped strip open space.

facades vertically expressed. Exceptions are some commercial buildings on Woodward, row houses on John

 R. or Brush, and some duplexes or row houses east of Brush.
(17)

Rhythm of building setbacks. Buildings on the north-south streets generally have little or no setback, while

(18)

Relationship of lot coverage. Older single family houses between Woodward and Brush generally occupy
about twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) percent of the building lot, not including coach houses or garages. Later
apartments and commercial buildings often fill a much higher percentage of the lot, sometimes approaching or
reaching complete lot coverage. Between Brush and Beaubien, lot coverage for residential structures is
generally about forty (40) percent, with commercial and later apartment buildings again occupying larger
percentage of their lots.

(19)

Degree of complexity with the facades. The older houses in the district are generally characterized by a high

(20)

Orientation, vistas, overviews. Houses are generally oriented to the east-west streets, while apartments and

(21)

Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. In the Victorian structures, examples of both symmetric and

(22)

General environmental character. The environmental character is of an old urban neighborhood which has
undergone, and is undergoing, considerable change. The original development, reflected in the Victorian
period houses, has been altered by the provision of more intensive residential development in the early
twentieth century, the change in character of Woodward from residential to commercial at about the same
time, and a long period of decline. (Ord. No. 369-H, ' 1, 1-23-80)

older houses on the east-west streets between Woodward and Brush have some setback, which varies from
street to street, though generally consistent in any one block. Later apartments and commercial structures in
that area often ignore the previously established setback. Between Brush and Beaubien, setback is generally
very limited, only a few feet, if any, lawn space being provided between sidewalk and building.

degree of complexity within the facades, with bay windows, towers, porches, window and door hoods,
elaborate cornices, and other devices used to decorate the buildings. Newer houses in the northern end of the
district and older houses in the southern end tend to be somewhat simpler than high Victorian structures
between them; later apartments and commercial buildings tend to more classical decorative elements of a
simpler kind.
commercial structures are more often oriented to the north-south streets. The construction of the Fisher
Freeway has created an artificial public view of the rear yards on Winder between Woodward and Brush. The
vacant land in the area, largely the result of demolition, creates long-distance views and views of individual
buildings from unusual angles which are foreign to the character of the neighborhood as an intensely
developed urban area. Garages and coach houses are located in the rear of residential properties, and are
generally oriented to the alley.
asymmetric design occur; symmetry is more characteristic of the earlier houses, while the high Victorian
examples are more likely to assemble elements in a romantic, asymmetric composition. Later houses to the
north are more often symmetrical, especially when derived from classical precedent. Asymmetrical but
balanced compositions are common. Later apartments are generally symmetrical.
