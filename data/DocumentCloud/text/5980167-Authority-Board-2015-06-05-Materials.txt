Executive Director’s Remarks
Mr. Cutrone stated that matters have been proceeding normally, noting the Authority’s
work with the National Governors Association Data Exchange and its pilot projects in
multiple jurisdictions. He went on to report that the Community Violence Prevention
Program (CVPP) had been closed and that the Authority was still responding to
information requests from the Office of Auditor General regarding OAG’s audit of the
Neighborhood Recovery Initiative (NRI). Mr. Cutrone added that the Authority was in
the process of an audit of its handling of the CVPP program and is not exactly sure when
that report will be released, but speculated either next spring or early June and said that
the Board would be advised.
He said he thought the Authority was operating in a way that speaks well for the agency
and for the Board, and announced that later in the meeting there would be a presentation
on the Authority’s evaluation of the Chicago Police Department’s Crisis Intervention
Team (CIT). He added that the study was authored mainly by ICJIA Research Analyst
Rebecca Skorek who also recently completed an evaluation of the River Valley Detention
Center’s program that screens incoming detainees for mental health issues. He further
explained that River Valley Detention Center provides an assessment for necessary
treatment, and then develops a corresponding plan.
In conclusion, he welcomed new Board Member Ramon Escapa and turned the meeting
back to Chairman Ellis, who thanked Mr. Cutrone and announced that a Budget
Committee Meeting would take place. Chairman Ellis appointed all Board Members
present as Members of the Budget Committee as a whole pursuant to Authority rules and
called upon Budget Committee Designees representing absent Members to identify
themselves for the record.
Budget Committee Meeting
(Please See Attached Minutes of the Budget Committee Meeting)
Upon adjournment of the Budget Committee Meeting, Chairman Ellis called upon D.
Lorenzo Padron, Chief Financial Officer, to report on financial matters.

Fiscal Report by D. Lorenzo Padron, Chief Financial Officer
Mr. Padron thanked Chairman Ellis and presented the Office of Fiscal Management’s
(OFM) Performance Report for the period ending October 30, 2014. He explained that
the OFM Performance Report covered the first four months of Fiscal Year 2015 and was
divided into two parts, with the first part summarizing OFM performance for the four
months ending October 30, 2014 and including the following sections: Reports
completed and submitted by OFM during the period, including each report’s title, its
purpose and the recipient entity’s name; Federal Grants describing the activities and
identifying the results of the OFM grant proposals’ fiscal evaluation process, the
disbursement value of grant funds, and the check and balance mechanism established by
ICJIA to ensure that sub-recipients comply with federal rules and regulations regarding
internal controls and application of grant fund cost principles; and Other Fiscal Activities
describing several of the interagency fiscal reports that bind the Authority to comply with
statute and regulation and also the Office of Fiscal Management’s role in overseeing the
financial administration of the Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Fund.
Mr. Padron proceeded to explain the second part which he said was a graphical
representation of ICJIA’s fund appropriations compared to expenditures/obligations
during the four months ending October 30, 2014 and including the following: Exhibit #1,
General Revenue Operations, which showed that as of October 30, 2014, the Authority
spent or obligated $486,229 or 28 percent of the $1,733,800 General Revenue Funds
appropriated for Fiscal Year 2015; Exhibit #2, which showed the value of the
appropriated funds administered by the Authority versus their respective percentage
utilization/commitment, pointing out that the last quadrant represented the aggregate
value of the funds relative to the total utilization/obligation of 34 percent, as of the end of
the reporting period; and Exhibit #3, Federal Funding Sources, which identifies the
Authority’s individual federal funding source, the value of each grant award, the amount
of fund expenditure, and the remaining available balance of each grant award.
He then summarized as of October 30, 2014, the percentage of expenditures/obligations
per fund category as follows: General Revenue Operations, 28 percent; Criminal Justice
Trust Fund (Federal), 32 percent; General Revenue Matching Funds/Other, 48 percent;
Criminal Justice Information Projects Fund, 4 percent; Other Funds, 33 percent; and
Total Awards and Grants, 34 percent.
In concluding, he called for questions or comments. With no response, Chairman Ellis
thanked Chief Financial Officer Padron and announced the presentation referenced earlier
on the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) in Chicago: Using Data for Program Improvement
and Enhanced Linkage Capacity by Kurt Gawrisch, Chicago Police Department; Rebecca
Skorek, ICJIA; and Amy Watson of the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Presentation on Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) in Chicago: Using Data for
Program Improvement and Enhanced Linkage Capacity by Kurt Gawrisch,
Chicago Police Department; Rebecca Skorek, ICJIA; and Amy Watson, University
of Illinois at Chicago
Rebecca Skorek introduced her co-presenters and said that the presentation would cover
the origins and development of CIT in Chicago, how data can be used for program
improvement, and the next steps moving forward to enhance the CIT program. She then
called on Kurt Gawrisch, who stated that CIT training was designed not only to increase
education and training for law enforcement about recognizing mental illness, and about
de-escalation and intervention, but also about linking individuals out of the criminal
justice system to community-based mental health services. He added that it also is about
collaboration between law enforcement, advocates, and mental health service providers.
In citing CIT’s history in Chicago, he pointed out that it is based on a model developed in
Memphis in 1988, starting here in 2002, currently with 2,500 adult CIT programs existing
throughout the United States. He reviewed the role of then Executive Director of the
National Alliance on Mental Illinois of Greater Chicago, Suzanne Andriukaitis, in
reaching out to the Chicago Police Department in 1999 to encourage mental health
training. He traced how the training has grown from a pilot program of 40-hours for
veteran law enforcement officers to a full-fledged embedded program within the Chicago
Police Department with protocols, and that it is voluntary in addition to eight hours of
mandatory training.
He added that the training has been well received citing the response of a 19-year
member of the Chicago Police Department, “Best training I’ve had in the 19 years with
CPD… (I’m) proud to be a CIT member.”
Officer Gawrisch then described how the CIT specially-trained officers were brought in
for focus groups and asked what else they thought was needed, with the outcome that two
additional 40-hour training programs were added: one dealing with returning veterans
experiencing PTSD, and the other, addressing youth with mental health problems. He
noted that in 2015 there will be two new pilot programs regarding diversion from an
emergency room for individuals who do not meet the criteria for inpatient hospitalization
to community services.
At that point, Ms. Skorek covered how data is used for program improvement and
enhanced linkage capacity. Ms. Lisa Jacobs then inquired when or how a CIT officer is
brought into an incident or call, with Officer Gawrisch explaining the process. In the
ensuing discussion, Ms. Watson addressed additional CIT training so that there is better

availability of CIT-based-trained officers, as well as some of the advanced youth and
veteran officers. Officer Gawrisch then reported that the goal for the Chicago Police
Department is to train 25 percent of the force, which follows the recommendation of the
International Memphis Model on which the CPD program is based.
In closing, both Ms. Skorek and Officer Gawrisch announced that the 2016 CIT
International Conference will be held in Chicago, with the date to be determined in either
March or April. At that point, Chairman Ellis thanked them and Ms. Watson for their
presentation and asked if there were any questions or comments. Hearing none, he then
asked if there were any old or new business. With no response, he thanked everyone for
their participation, wished them happy holidays, and adjourned the meeting.

MEMORANDUM

To:
Members of the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority Board and

From: Lisa Stephens, General Counsel
Re:

Rules on Public Comment at Open Meetings

Public Act 96-1473, effective January 1, 2011, amended section 2.06 of the Open
Meetings Act to provide:
(g) Any person shall be permitted an opportunity to address public officials under
the rules established and recorded by the public body. 5 ILCS 120/2.06(g), added by
public Act 96-1473.
The intent of the legislation is clear: the public has a right to address a public body, and
that body has a right to promulgate rules concerning that right. The public policy of
Illinois is to give citizens advance notice of and the right to attend all meetings where
public business is discussed or acted upon. 5 ILCS 120/1; see also 735 ILCS 110/5 (it is
public policy of the State of Illinois to encourage involvement and free participation of
citizens in the process of government… opinions and arguments of citizens are vital to
the continuation of representative democracy).
The public body may impose reasonable time, place and manner regulations that are
content neutral if those regulations are narrowly tailored to serve a significant
governmental interest and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.
Perry Education Association v. Perry Local Educators’ Association, 460 U.S. 37, 45
(1983). Time limits on public comments are reasonable. See Wright v. Anthony, 733
F.2d 575, 577 (8th Cir. 1984) (three minutes). Furthermore, public comment limited only
to the subjects on the agenda is reasonable. See White v. City of Norwalk, 900 F. 2d
1421, 1425 (9th Cir. 1990). Also, speakers can be stopped if the comment becomes
irrelevant, repetitious or disruptive. Id at 1425-26.

The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority Board should adopt rules that govern
how public comments are to occur at Authority Board and Committee meetings. These
rules may include, but are not limited to, reasonable time limits on commenting. The
Office of General Counsel recommends that the Authority Board promulgate rules
governing its open meetings consistent with the law and public policy. The
recommendations are as follows:
•
•
•
•

Set aside a specific portion of the meeting for public comment.
Limit the length of public comment to three minutes per speaker.
Require public comment to be limited to subjects on the meeting’s agenda.
Allow the Chair of the Board or Committee to cut off a comment if it is
irrelevant, repetitious, or disruptive.

The Authority Board shall establish rules by a majority vote. Once established, the rules
shall be published on the website.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), authorized by Title IV of the Violent Crime
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and subsequently reauthorized as the Violence
Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 and 2013, provides
?nancial assistance to states for developing and strengthening effective law enforcement and
prosecution strategies and victim services in cases involving violent crimes against women. To
be eligible, states must develop a plan in accordance with requirements set out in the Act. The
Act specifies that states must allocate at least 25 percent of the VAWA funds it receives to law
enforcement, 25 percent to prosecution, 30 percent to nonpro?t. non- governmental victim
services, and at least 5 percent to courts. The remaining 1:5 percent may be allocated at the state?s
discretion within the parameters of the Act. un1ls may not be used to replace dollars already

committed to a service or program.

The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (15111111101111: is the state agencyiestablished to
promote community safety by providingpublic policy makers. criminal justice professionals, and
others with the information, tools, and technologyneeded to make effective decisions that
improve the quality oferin1in11l justice in Illinois. '111e'iliuthority is giSVemed by a 25-member
board of state and local leaders in? the criminal justice commUnin, plus experts from the private
sector. In addition, the Authority it supported by 1?17 full-time and 3 part-time professional staff.
Authorized under the 111111151111 power to Eipply 1111'. receive, establish priorities for, allocate,
disbu1se. and spend grant ?mds,? the \uthorit} is responsible for administering a variety of grant
funds, including 15 federal proerams and 15 state programs The combined budgets for these
programs exceeded $169 million in FF Yl 3 As the state agency charged with administering the
Services*Training*t 11 ticers?l?Prusecutors (STOP) VAWA award in Illinois, the Authority is

responsible for developihg the plan for distributing these federal funds.

The current STOP VAWA Implementation Plan will guide the use of the STOP VAWA awards
received by the State of Illinois for a three-year period, 2014 through 2016. The plan will be
introduced for approval by the Authority Board at its June 6, 2014 meeting. The plan is
organized in the format pursuant to the 2013 STOP VAWA reauthorization and explained in the

2014 application.

 

Violence Against women Implementation Plan Page I

II. DESCRIPTION OF PLANNING PROCESS

On October 22 and 23, 20l3, the Authority convened meetings to review past priorities and
de?ne new ones for the use of STOP VAWA and Victim of Crime Act (VOCA) funds. The Ad
Hoc Victim Services Committee, comprised of criminal justice and victim services professionals
as well as members of the community (please see appendix A for full membership list), reviewed
crime and victimization trend data, information on current efforts, and data from funded
programs. Participants included the executive directors of thebmajor statewide victim service
associations (including the coalitions against domestic ,viulehce and sexual assault) and
individual agencies representing underserved communities such as Mujeres Latinas en Accion,
Arab American Family Services and the Center. on Halsted al gay/lesbian/bi/transgender
organization There are no recognized tribes in Illinois but discussions have begun as to how to
identify and include agencies representing Native Americans living 1n the, state, especially the

metropolitan Chicago area.

The Committee considered:

. The need for a unified understanding and response across the criminal justice/victim
service system. . i .

The need to identil} and retina data coiiectiOn.

The to increase Ser? iLLs and geographically isolated victim
populations ., . i i 
113;.- need for cross-training andinterdisciplinary training.
0 The needincreate partnerships to coordinate the effective use of resources.
0 The need to ensure a minimum provision of basic services to all victims of crime and
prioritize fundingtor direct services.
Based on the above information and mindful of the differences in purposes and allowable
activities between the two funds and in consideration of the information detailed in the following
sections of the plan, the Victim Services Ad Hoc Committee developed priority program types
for the use of VAWA funds and funding priorities for the use of VOCA funds. This plan will be
reviewed for approval by the Authority Board at its June 6, 2014, meeting.

 

Illinois Violence Against Women Implementation Plan I - Page 2

In summary, the Ad Hoc Committee recommended that VAWA funds are used
principally to continue to support programs that:

0 Increase victim services for linguistically and geographically isolated populations.

0 Support services that improve the justice system?s response to underserved or special
needs groups.

I1 Provide support to reduce barriers in criminal justice system for special populations.

0 Support specialized criminaljustice victim services.
0 Fund multidisciplinary models and training.

0 Promote multidisciplinary approaches to sexual assault or domestic violence 1n other
communities that are not currently funded. 

0 Increase community?based legal advocacy-.1.

0 Identify, re?ne and share data and other inforJ-nutinn aniongjustice systerh?agencies.

The planning process for the Illinois STOP VAWA funds 101111111111 throughout the year in
meetings of the Victim Ad Hoc Committee, 1l1e Authority Budget Committee, and
meetings with 1nd1v1d11111subgranlees as needed. I he recommendation made by the Victim
Services Ad Hoc Committee once approved by the Authority Board, will be utilized 1n future
funding r1111m1111ndauons m11l1- Stall to the Authority Budget Committee for all STOP

Health Services Act: Rape Prevention Education program. Both agencies were asked to
participate in the VSAHC meetings and present information. Since both agencies indicated that
they were working on plans for the related programs, the VSAI-IC meetings would occur first and

d. 20% Sexual Assault Set a Side

 

In the past, the Authority has designated all of each federalfiscal year's allocated Service Provider funds
to the two coalitions in Illinois; the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault and the Illinois
Coalition Against Domestic violence (ICADV) in equal amounts. These funds were then subcontracted to
their program agencies for service to underserved areas art-Eerim groups. The VSM It? has recommended
that the Authority continue designating the seruiee provider funds in this manner. As we implement the
priorities established by the Victim Services Ad Ilue Conunittee ith the 20% sexual assault set aside as
guidance, we will strive for minimum of a 75325 it in funding for future programing with all Request
for Proposals under each of the funding areas: Law Enforcement. ?Prgsecution, Discretionary and Courts.

C. Grant-making Strategy and Funding pole

The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority uses two methods in making subgrant awards?
through a request for proposals and via needs-based analysis. Most VAWA designations have been made
in the recent past through needs-based analysis. The IA Research Analysis Unit partners with the
Victim Services Ad Hoc Committee to identify service needs and gaps in service areas. Staff then works

with selected agencies within those geographical areas to:
1) Give priority to areas of varying geographic size with the greiitesi showing of need.
2) Consider the population of the geographic area tobe served when determining subgrants.

3) Equitably distribute monies on a geographic basis, including non- -urban and rural areas of various

geographic sizes .
4) Ensure that the needs of previousl} underserved populations are 1dent1f ed and addressed.

These grants run on a 12-month basis. Grantees weregiVen an initial?three year funding period, but have
been continued as per the r1111111111111d11t1on of the Victim He riices Ad Hoc Committee at their subsequent
meetings. Grant writing trainings are periodically provided by the 111.1:ncy, and technical assistance is
given through the grant monilur assigned to each grant in the way of desk monitoring and site visits, and
are particular to the federal prog111111. 111111111 are desrgnated for a single year, and renewed each year upon
analysis of goals and objectives. The parameters and 1111.- priorities identi?ed 111 this plan will be forwarded

to the Authority Budget Committee for the designation of funds.

Programs receiving Violence Against Women Act funds have measurable objectives and grant recipients
are required to submit data ?rt-pom In the Authority on a or quarterly basis. Standard reports were
developed by the Department ol:~ Justice to capture information about the victims served, including
demographic information; primary language; county of residence; disability; relationship of the victim to
the offender; the nature of the victimization; services provided and the community collaboration in which
each program participates. A narrative report is also required describing major accomplishments, barriers
confronting the program, and plans for overcoming these problems. These data reports are reviewed by

Authority staff to determine each program's progress toward its objectives.

 

llh?nois VioIence Against Women implementation Plan

Each program is assigned a monitor who offers information and technical assistance in accordance with
the federal grant guidelines. Monitors oversee program progress throughout the performance period
through daily desk monitoring, the review of quarterly ?scal and data reports, and annual site visits. All
monitoring activity is reviewed and approved by the Victim Services Programs Administrator, as well as
legal and ?scal staff members of the agency. The information gathered is presented to the Victim Services

Ad Hoc Committee for funding recommendations.

Each VAWA application, Exhibit A, for any governmental unit requesting VAWA funding is asked to
explain the consultation process for their appiication including the name of the victim service agency
within their service area consulted. A letter of support is also rtqun'ed from each agency listed.

Responses to this question are reviewed as part of the application proc1 95 by the monitor.

D. ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF UNDERSER VED VICTIMS
a. State or A Me for Qalturallr Speci?c Communities

As the state administering agency for the S.T.O.P. VAWA funds in Illinois, 1A splits the victim
service funds from each award evenly between the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA) and
the Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV). To ensure that we meet the mandated 10
percent of the victim service funds for culturally specific and linguistically sensitive programs, each of the

coalitions are mandated to report, through quarterly data reports which show the numbers of victims from

culturally speci?c underserved populations, to exemplify how this requirement is met.

 

 subcontracted with 17 local domestic violence programs that implemented 19 projects funded by
Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). The projects addressed the needs of three categories of

underserved survivor groups: rural women, Latinas, and chemically dependent survivors.

These funds also supported 11 Latina services projects in Illinois. Because of these grants, 2,024 new and
1,300 ongoing survivors received services and information available in Spanish. These clients were
provided 9,425 hours of services including counseling and advocacy. In agencies receiving VAWA
funding, Latinos comprise 33 percent of the total client population. This compares very well to 2000
Census ?gures for the percentage of Latinos in Illinois (12.3 percentinnd to our statewide domestic

violence program average, which places Latinos at 19 percent?of the total population of clients.

subcontracts with l3 agencies that use S.T.0.P. VAWA funds provide services to victims of

sexual assault. Funds have been made available annuallyto these agencies to implement 14 projects that
target previously unserved or underserved victim populations in Services provided by all of the

grantee programs include a minimum of a 24 hour hotline and 34 hour access to individual medical and
criminal justice advocacy. The primary lows 1.11 to provide crisis counseling and advocacy services

Additionally, grantees provide on- going counseling, educational programs, and professional training
