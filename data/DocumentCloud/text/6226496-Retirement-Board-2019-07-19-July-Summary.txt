MONTHLY NEWS AND INFORMATION FROM YOUR RETIREMENT BOARD
EMWQ Update
I would like to take this opportunity to commend the July of 2019 CFD candidate class for their
generosity and interest in the EMWQ and the CFD related charities. Of the 100 candidates to enter
service with the CFD this July, 94 candidates voluntarily elected to donate to the EMWQ or other
charities that support the members and the mission of the CFD.
Alternative Minimum Formula Annuities
Over the years, many participants have questioned how an FABF annuitant could be awarded an annuity
that is greater than 75% of annuitant’s average salary. The average salary is defined as the average of the
Fireman’s highest four consecutive 4 years of salary with the last 10 years of service. This occurs when a
member is awarded an alternative minimum formula annuity. Please see below for an explanation of how
the benefit is calculated.
Tier 1 participants are eligible to receive Alternative Minimum Formula Annuities for participants that
have attained age 53 and have at least 23 years of accumulated service credit.
The calculation of an Alternative Minimum Formula Annuity is equal to 50% of average salary, plus 1%
of average salary added for each year of service or fraction thereof after attaining 23 years of service up to
age 53, plus 2% of average salary for each year of service or fraction thereof after attiring age 53 with 23
years of service.
This amount cannot exceed 75% of the highest salary attained by the firefighter.
Entered Service

23 YOS

1% for each year of service

Age 53

50%

Retirement

2% for each year of service

For example, a firefighter who entered service at age 20 would receive 1% for each year of service after
completing 23 years of service (at age 43) until age 53 which is 10%. Then the firefighter would receive
2% for each year and fraction thereof after attaining age 53. If the firefighter stayed until his 63rd
birthday, that would be an additional 20%. This firefighter (as shown in the graph below) would receive
80% of his final average salary (50% for attaining age 53 with 23 years of service, plus 10% for the time
period between 23 years of service and attaining age 53 and 20% for the years of service from attaining
age 53 until retirement). An annuity cannot exceed 75% of the highest salary attained by the firefighter.

Alternatively, a firefighter who entered service at age 26 would receive 1% for each year of service after
completing 23 years of service (at age 48) until age 53 which is 5%. Then the firefighter would receive
2% for each year and fraction thereof after attaining age 53. If the firefighter stayed until his 63rd
birthday, that would be an additional 20%. This firefighter would receive 75% of his final average salary
(50% for attaining age 53 with 23 years of service, plus 5% for the time period between 23 years of
service and attaining age 53 and 20% for the years of service from attaining age 53 until retirement).
