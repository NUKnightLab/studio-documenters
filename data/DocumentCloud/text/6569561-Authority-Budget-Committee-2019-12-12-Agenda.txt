related to trauma recovery services. He said that staff requested approval of a designation
of up to $2.9 million of the appropriation to issue one or more NOFOs in the fourth
quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020 to expand the availability of comprehensive
services to address trauma, including trauma recovery center services, in Illinois.
Motion: Mr. Turpeau moved to approve the recommended SFY20 TRC funding. Ms.

No action was required on this item.
Justice Assistance Grant Strategic Plan Implementation
Mr. Stevens summarized the Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Strategic Planning
Overview, including allowability, administrative limitations, and fund allocations by
goal.
A discussion ensued on funding client transportation and its allowability under both JAG
and the Victims of Crime Act.
Mr. Kelly noted the JAG funding decline of $100,000 for the anti-drug metropolitan
enforcement groups (MEGs) and task forces. He said ICJIA’s analysis of MEGs and task
forces illustrated the value of the work that they perform. He asked that the value of
MEGs and task forces be considered in plans for future JAG funding.
Ms. Wolff suggested researching the degree to which there is an intersection involving
substance use disorder and other areas such as trauma, domestic violence, and other
forms of victimization.
Notice of Funding Opportunity Timeline
Mr. Stevens called attention to the proposed NOFO schedule.
Motion: Mr. Turpeau moved to approve the recommended notices using $424,053 in
designated FFY17 funds. Ms. Barnes seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
4. Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Act (RSAT)
Ms. Haley said the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Act (RSAT) assists states and
local governments in the development and implementation of substance use disorder
treatment programs in state, local, and tribal correctional and detention facilities. Funds
also were available to create and maintain community reintegration services for
individuals after they are released from incarceration, she said. She said staff
recommended designating $130,775 in FFY17 RSAT funds to support the third and final
year of the following RSAT programs:
PROGRAM
Dual Diagnosis Treatment for Women
IYC Harrisburg Treatment
Total

FFY17
$84,715
$46,060
$130,775

 10/17/19 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 5

Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
5. Violence Against Women Act
Ms. Hailey referred members to a memo detailing FFY15 and FFY16 Violence Against
Women Act (VAWA) designation reductions. She said staff recommended making the
funds available for future use. She said FFY15 and FFY16 funds had performance period
end dates of June 30, 2020, but that staff requested a six-month extension for use of the
funds from the Office on Violence Against Women. She said if the extension was
approved, FFY15 and FFY16 funds could support programming for another year.
Motion: Mr. Perez moved to approve the recommended FFY15 and FFY16 VAWA
designation reductions. Ms. Barnes seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote, with a recusal by Ms. Kramer due to
her involvement with the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office.
6. Violence Against Women Act Sexual Assault Service Programs
Mr. Stevens said that the memo incorrectly made a reference to RSAT FFY18 and that it
should have read Violence Against Women Act Sexual Assault Service Programs
(VAWA SASP) FFY18.
Ms. Hailey said the VAWA SASP Formula Program directs grant dollars to states and
territories to assist them in supporting rape crisis centers and other nonprofit,
nongovernmental programs that provide direct intervention and related assistance to
victims of sexual assault. She said the FFY19 SASP award to Illinois was $566,484 and
that $538,160 was available for grant funding after an administrative set-aside of
$28,324. She said staff recommended setting aside $538,160 in FFY18 VAWA SASP
funds to issue a competitive NOFO in the first quarter of 2020.
Motion: Ms. Kramer moved to approve the recommended SFY19 VAWA SASP NOFO
funding. Ms. Wolff seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
7. Victims of Crime Act
Mr. Reichgelt said that staff recommended issuing a NOFO for Residential Treatment for
Justice-Involved Girls programs using FFY18 funds. The NOFO will generate
designations that will support the development of an intensive residential treatment
program for girls ages 14 through 18 who are in the custody of the Illinois Department of
Juvenile Justice (IDJJ) and have histories of victimization, abuse, and trauma. He said the
program would work in partnership with IDJJ to identify girls in custody whose history
of victimization and trauma could be addressed in a non-correctional setting. He said staff

recommended setting aside $844,268 in FFY18 VOCA funds to support the funding
opportunity.

Ms. Wolff seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.

Program Description
The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority’s (ICJIA) Crime Strategy Analysis and Evaluation Program
supports a team of researchers in three centers that identify priority criminal justice issues for the state, conduct
research and analysis on these areas, and disseminates this information to guide decision-making both locally
and within the agency.
Program Activities
The program operates under three centers. The Center for Criminal Justice Data and Analytics collects, analyzes
and disseminates statistical information on a variety of topics. The Center for Justice Research and Evaluation
focuses on program assessment and evaluations and produces publications that includes key findings and
implications for policy and practice. The Center for Sponsored Research and Program Development works with
experts in the field to conduct research and program evaluation, refine program performance measures, and
identify promising practices for programs to replicate.
Goals
Four main functions of this program include conducting applied research and evaluation that examines critical
criminal justice topics; expanding the development, collection, analysis and dissemination of research and
statistical information; engaging experts in the field to inform practitioners and other partners to assist them in
their local efforts; and informing and advising on evidence-based and promising practices and identifying areas
of program development.
Priorities
This program supports the JAG priority area of Planning, Evaluation and Technology Improvement Programs.
This program clearly fits within this priority area as it focuses on providing a body of research and data that will
inform and guide funding decisions, policy decisions, and expansion of promising and evidence-based
programming.

Program Funding Detail
This designation would continue support of this program for a period of approximately three months from
March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020. Any future designation recommendations for this program will be pursuant to
staff analysis of program performance and will depend on fund availability.
Past Performance
This grantee is in full compliance and is in good standing. Past performance demonstrates achievement of its
goals, including publishing a wealth of research on a variety of topics, program evaluation, expansion of the
ICJIA website to accommodate user-friendly data tools, and briefs that highlight main research findings and
implications for policy.
ICJIA expects to recommend continued funding of this program as the need for the program continually grows
and expands to accommodate informed decision making and planning.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

Budget Committee Members

FROM:

Greg Stevens, Federal and State Grants Unit

DATE:

December 12, 2019

RE:

FFY19 Violence Against Women Act Plan Introduction
FFY15 Violence Against Women Act Plan Adjustment
FFY16 Violence Against Women Act Plan Adjustment
FFY17 Violence Against Women Act Plan Adjustment
FFY18 Violence Against Women Act Plan Adjustment

This memo describes the VAWA FFY19 plan introduction and proposed adjustments to the
FFY15 through FFY18 Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) plans.
VAWA FFY19 INTRODUCTION
VAWA enhances the capacity of local communities to develop and strengthen effective law
enforcement and prosecution strategies to combat violent crimes against women and victim
services in cases involving violent crimes against women.
Illinois’ FFY19 VAWA award was $5,224,955 and expires June 30, 2021. After setting aside 10
percent of the award for administrative purposes ($522,495), the remaining $4,702,460 is
available for program purposes and must be distributed as follows:






25 percent to law enforcement
25 percent to prosecutors
30 percent to victim services (of which at least 10 percent must be distributed to
culturally specific community-based organizations)
5 percent to state and local courts
15 percent to discretionary distribution

RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
Services for Underserved Areas or Victim Groups
The designations recommended in this memo are consistent with the priorities set forth in the
VAWA FFY17- FFY20 Multi-Year Implementation Plan.

13

 VAWA FFY15, FFY16, FFY17, FFY18, FFY19
December 12, 2019
Page 2 of 4

Historically, ICJIA has designated all VAWA victim services category funds to the Illinois
Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV) and Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault
(ICASA) in equal amounts. These funds are then granted via subcontracts with their program
agencies for services to underserved areas or victim groups.
Staff recommend continuing to designate VAWA funds in this manner. They recommend
designating $705,369 in FFY19 funds to each coalition.
Multi-Disciplinary Team Response Programs
On January 10 and 11, 2017, ICJIA convened an Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee to review
past priorities and define new ones for the use of STOP VAWA funds. The committee
recommended using FFY17-FFY20 VAWA funds to continue to support programs previously
funded through VAWA.
At the 2017 planning meeting, multi-disciplinary team (MDT) response programs were identified
as a funding priority. In August 2018, ICJIA issued a notice of funding opportunity seeking
proposals for the continuation or enhancement of sexual assault (SA) or domestic violence (DV)
MDTs.
Five proposals were received and were recommended for funding by the review panel. These
projects began January 1, 2019. Staff recommends designating funds to the entities and programs
listed below to support a second year of programming from January 1, 2020, to December 31,
2020. Further details are provided in the attached Grant Recommendation Reports.

Subject:

FFY16 Victims of Crime Act Plan Adjustment
FFY17 Victims of Crime Act Plan Adjustment

This memo describes recommended FFY16 Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) designation
reductions and recommended FFY17 VOCA designations.
A. DESIGNATION REDUCTIONS
Funds returned to ICJIA by agencies at the ends of the funding performance periods are listed in
the tables below. FFY16 funds have expired and are no longer available for use.
Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault
The Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA) Lead Entity Services to Victims of
Sexual Assault program will lapse $2,286,212 of its $18.2 million FFY16 designation. This lapse
was caused by delays in ICJIA’s release of the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), which
caused delays in the opening of the ICASA competitive application process. There was also
miscommunication between ICJIA and ICASA concerning allowable use of funds.
The initial designation given to ICASA was not completely awarded during the first application
process, and an additional RFP was let to supplement those programs that were originally
selected. This was caused by initial confusion by the agency on new Lead Entity requirements.
Additional FFY16 funds provided to the Lead Entities for technology and equipment were also
not completely spent as budgeted.
Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence
The Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV) Lead Entity Services to Victims of
Domestic Violence program will lapse $2,055,122 of its $19.2 million FFY16 designation. This
lapse was caused by delays in ICJIA release of the NOFO, which caused delays in the opening of
the ICADV competitive application process, so subgrantee programs were not provided with the
entire 12 months to expend the funds awarded. Additional FFY16 funds provided to the Lead
Entities for technology and equipment were also not completely spent as budgeted.

Children’s Advocacy Centers of Illinois
The Children’s Advocacy Centers of Illinois Lead Entity Services to Child Advocacy Centers
program will lapse $1,315,412 of the $9 million in FFY16 funds. Funds awarded for equipment
and technology were not fully obligated by the end of the performance period.
Community Violence
The Community Violence programs listed below returned large percentages of their designations
because of contractual delays and program staffing issues. These agencies were funded under a
new program area developed to support 2017 VOCA priorities. Subcontract and unallowable
cost issues delayed the review process and program start dates. Many grantees are hospitals that
cannot hire without a signed agreement, further delaying program implementation. Many
programs were not fully implemented until six to nine months after the designated start date.

Program Description
ICJIA was awarded a U.S. Office of Victims of Crime grant to implement the Illinois Helping Everyone Access
Linked Systems (Illinois HEALS) initiative, a six-year project that seeks to improve the identification,
connection, and service engagement of those impacted by violence. Informed by a 15-month planning process,
the Illinois HEALS Action Plan encourages cross-system collaboration to strengthen community capacity for
recognizing when victimization has occurred and connecting and engaging young victims and families in
needed services.
ICJIA set aside $2.7 million in FFY17 VOCA funds to support cross-system projects based on the Illinois
HEALS Action Plan. Grant ranges were set at $150,000 to $500,000. Seventeen applications were received for
a requested total of $5,755,450. Applications were sorted and reviewed by region. Regions included Chicago,
Suburban Cook County, Northern, Central and Southern Illinois, and resulted in at least one recommended
application from each region. Each recommended applicant proposed a minimum of two systems that would
collaboratively improve victim identification, connection, and engagement in services.
Program Activities
Individual program activities are described on pages 4 through 8.
Goals
All grantees will report on the following goals, objectives and performance measures:

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Child Advocacy Centers of Illinois Discretionary Training Technical
Assistance

Program Agency DUNS:

102034282

Funding Source:

FFY18 Victims of Crime Act Discretionary Training Technical Assistance:
$45,566; No Match

Agency Budget:

$949,190

Request Type:

Limited Use Discretionary Award

Program Description
The Office for Victims of Crime made $25 million in noncompetitive funding available to support training and
technical assistance for victim assistance service providers and others who work with crime victims.
Program Activities
This program will provide four initial and advanced trainings for mental health providers. Trauma-Focused
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TFCBT) training and certification will be provided for therapists working with
Child Advocacy Centers (CACs). The goal of this training is to increase the number of TFCBT Certified
Therapists in Illinois. The second part (follow up) to the TFCBT training is the advanced training for forensic
interviewers. The advanced training is a required 40-hour training to achieve a greater expertise in the forensic
interview process, thus providing a higher level of response to victim’s needs. This training would be offered in
three phases regionally and throughout the year, building on basic training to enhance abilities and skills.
Goals
1. To provide a variety of high quality, specialized training needed by CACs to fulfill their mission and meet
NCA accreditation standards.
2. To provide more regional training opportunities to CACs at reduced or no cost.
Priorities
The 2017 Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee identified training as a funding priority. Only VOCA
administrative funds can support training grants, which limits funding opportunities for that purpose.
Funding Prospectus
ICJIA expects to fund this program for one year, with a two-year renewal. Staff will analyze this grantee at the
end of the first year to ensure it is meeting all goals and objectives prior to recommending future funding.

Funding Source:

FFY18 Victims of Crime Act Discretionary Training Technical Assistance:
$90,367; No Match

Agency Budget:

$1,446,098

Request Type:

Limited Use Discretionary Award

Program Description
The Office for Victims of Crime made $25 million in noncompetitive funding available to support training and
technical assistance for victim assistance service providers and others who work with crime victims.
Program Activities
The Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV) has developed and will continue to host a
Leadership Academy for professionals who interact with domestic violence victims and their children.
Individuals who complete this academy will receive a solid foundation in leadership skill building within their
organization and within the violence against women movement, with a focus on the area of cultural diversity. In
September, a third cohort of individuals began the Leadership Academy series. In addition to the Leadership
Academy, ICADV will offer Advocacy Training series. Individuals who complete this academy will have a
better focus on advocacy skills related to inclusive, welcoming, and client-centered services; have a deeper
understanding of how trauma effects a person’s ability to respond to multiple demands and to present
themselves as what is often described as a “good client;” and better understand the barriers advocates and
domestic violence agencies put before survivors. This advocacy training takes a two-pronged approach: training
of front line staff and training of managers/directors to encourage buy in and administrative support in this
approach to service delivery.
Each cohort will complete a one-year, six-session course. In addition, the third session of the Advocacy
Training will be held in the Spring 2020, this consists of one two-day session for advocates and one single day
session for supervisors/managers/directors. Additional sessions of each will be offered in years 2 and 3 of the
life of the grant. Throughout the process, ICADV will evaluate and refine the curricula to meet the needs of
each cohort of individuals.
Goals
Leadership Academy and Advocacy Trainings will support ICADV’s goal of developing inclusive and
accessible services for all victims of domestic violence and their children by raising the voices of diverse
leaders within ICADV and within local domestic violence service providers throughout Illinois.

Priorities
The 2017 Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee identified training as a funding priority. The Victims of Crime
Act allows only administrative funds to be used to support training grants, which limits funding opportunities
for that purpose.
Funding Prospectus
ICJIA expects to fund this project for three years. Year 1 funds will allow completion of the third cohort of the
Leadership Academy. In Year 2 (2020), the fourth cohort will enter the academy. In Year 3 (2021), the fifth
cohort will begin.
Past Performance
ICJIA has no concerns with this grantee. When grant staff attended a two-day advocate training as part of a site
visit, this training was at capacity and was well-received by the attendees. ICADV has a 35-year history of
successfully providing training to domestic violence professionals with positive evaluations. All reports have
been on time and completed with few or no errors.

and services to marginalized groups including people of color, LGBTQ communities, ethnic and faith
groups, and others that are underserved.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Illinois Attorney General’s Office SANE/IVAA Training

Program Agency & DUNS: #806660148
Funding Source:

FFY18 Victims of Crime Act Discretionary Training Technical Assistance:
$90,367; No Match

Agency Budget:

$87,726,300

Request Type:

Limited Use Discretionary Award

Program Description
The Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) program trains nurses to perform medical forensic examinations
on victims of sexual assault and sexual abuse. The Illinois Victim Assistance Academy (IVAA) trains advocates
how to effectively provide services and assert and enforce victims’ rights. Both trainings are performed by the
Attorney General’s Office throughout the State.
Program Activities
Funding will support a variety of SANE programs, including three 40-hour adult/adolescent trainings, one 16hour advanced SANE training, one 24-hour pediatric SANE training, 10 eight-hour foundation trainings, and
two 16-hour clinical trainings. The IVAA program will offer one basic and one advanced training.
Goals
The goal of the SANE program is to increase the number of practicing SANE’s by providing educational and
clinical opportunities throughout the state. The goal for the IVAA program is to offer victim advocates the
training resources they need to serve victims and survivors.
Priorities
The 2017 Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee identified training as a funding priority. The Victims of Crime
Act (VOCA) only allows administrative funds to be used to support training grants, which limits funding
opportunities for that purpose.
Funding Prospectus
This grantee should receive further funding, not only for its past performance, but to address the demand for
SANE trainings, as state law has made it mandatory for hospitals to staff SANE nurses.
