PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION TO OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZE AND ADOPT NAMES OF FOREST
PRESERVE LANDS AND AMENITIES
WHEREAS, the Forest Preserves of Cook County (the “Preserves”) recognizes the need to protect the
natural and cultural history reflected in the names of the groves, trails, nature preserves, natural areas,
facilities, and other public places (the “Venues”) owned or controlled by the Preserves. The Preserves
seeks to ensure that these names are accurately represented so the residents of Cook County can easily
find the Venues and the amenities they offer; and
WHEREAS, in 2015, an internal Naming Committee was charged with discerning the correct and official
names of all Venues and reviewing requests for the purpose of determining which naming requests to
recommend to the Board of Commissioners of the Preserves (the “Board”) for approval; and
WHEREAS, the internal Naming Committee undertook an exhaustive review of the Venues to determine
which names had been formally adopted by the Board, were in common use, or had been abandoned; and
WHEREAS, the internal Naming Committee compiled a comprehensive list of the various names
associated with the Venues; and
WHEREAS, based upon the findings of the internal Naming Committee, it is recommended that the
Board reaffirm those names previously adopted by the Board for approximately 145 Venues as reflected
in Category 1 of the list of Venues provided as backup documentation to the Board in support of this
resolution (the “Venue List”); and
WHEREAS, it is also recommended that the Board officially adopt those names not previously adopted,
but that enjoy broad recognition among the general public, the Preserves, and other agencies that are
separately identified in Category 2 of the Venue List; and
WHEREAS, it is further recommended that the Board officially retire those names, which also are
identified in Category 3 of the Venue List, that, notwithstanding whether such names were ever adopted
by the Board, have been abandoned, are no longer in use, or have been replaced with other names, in
order to avoid future confusion.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that President Toni Preckwinkle, the Forest Preserve
District Board of Commissioners, and General Superintendent Arnold Randall do hereby recognize that
the presented list of names of Venues identified as such on the Venue List, represents the official names
of the corresponding Venues and adopts the recommendations stated above.
