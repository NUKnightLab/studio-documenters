 CHICAGO INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST
Contracting Manual

!

Introduction
In April 2012, the Chicago Infrastructure Trust (“CIT” or the “Trust”) was created via executive order
and Chicago City Council resolution. CIT will provide focus and leadership to build a pipeline of
executable Public-Private Partnership (“P3”) projects that will meet Chicago’s infrastructure needs,
drive economic development and create jobs. Public-Private Partnership contracting is valuable to
the people of the City of Chicago because it harnesses private investment, expertise and innovation
to complete important infrastructure projects that the City of Chicago could not complete using
traditional public finance. In addition, P3 contracting leverages the technical and operating expertise
of private industry to perform design, construction, operational and maintenance functions that may
not be core competencies of the City of Chicago.
This Contracting Manual explains how CIT will identify infrastructure projects and the process and
procedures for contracting using private partners.

It includes policy discussions that will help

architects, engineers, construction companies, financing sources, service companies, other interests
and citizens understand how CIT will operate.
Please note that terms in the manual will evolve over time, and you should look for the most current
version on CIT’s website, www.ShapeChicago.org

I.

Definitions
There are a variety of terms that are used regularly in discussing infrastructure contracting.
Definitions for a number of these terms are set forth in this Section.
a. Potential Roles for Private Partner
i. Design – Create design for a project as specified in the contracting process
through competitive bid, collaborative bid, unsolicited bid, citizen-proposed bid or
schedule contracting.
ii. Build – Provide a plan and complete construction of an approved design as
specified, within an agreed time-frame. The builder shall have the capability, in all
respects, to perform fully the contract requirements and has the business integrity
and reliability that will assure good faith performance.
iii. Finance – Secure and provide financing to build and operate project requested.
Methods to finance can include government grants, government loans, public debt,
private debt and private equity. In many projects, there will be a mix of these
sources. Financing approaches will be considered as part of the evaluation
process.

This will occur on a case-by-case basis, but generally CIT will be

concerned with the value for money, financial return, financial capability and
capacity of the bidder.
iv. Operate – Assume responsibility to manage and staff an asset for a defined
period, according to project specifications. Operational performance will be subject
to review at regular intervals and on an ad-hoc basis.
v. Maintain - Assume responsibility to maintain and support an asset for a defined
period, according to project specifications.

Maintenance performance will be

subject to review at regular intervals and on an ad-hoc basis.
b. Additional Relevant Terms
i. Availability Payment – Compensation made by CIT to a private concessionaire
for its responsibility to design, construct, operate, and/or maintain an asset for a set

!
period of time, based upon particular project milestones or facility performance
standards.
ii. Best Price – The proposal that provides the lowest price to fulfill the requirements
as predetermined by the RFP.
iii. Best Value - The overall combination of quality, price and various elements of the
required services that, in total, are optimal relative to CIT’s needs, as
predetermined in the RFP.
iv. Contract – The written agreement between CIT and a vendor for the provision of
goods and/or services to CIT by that vendor.
v. Evaluation Team – The board of directors and management personnel of CIT,
plus any additional third-party experts or advisors CIT deems necessary, to
evaluate proposals including RFI/RFQ/RFP, unsolicited bids, collaborative bids,
bids from citizens or schedule bids. The evaluation team may vary by project
depending upon the expertise required for evaluation.
vi. “Offeror” (also referred to as Bidder) - any individual, partnership, corporation,
or joint venture that formally responds to a Request for Information (RFI), Request
for Qualifications (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RPF). It also refers to suppliers
who submit unsolicited proposals, participate in collaborative proposals or submit
qualifications to be a schedule supplier.

Offeror or bidder can include any

company, firm, partnership, corporation, association, joint venture, or other entity
permitted by law to practice engineering, architecture, construction contracting, or
other services required in the City of Chicago. Any company, firm, partnership,
corporation, joint venture or other entity that is barred or ineligible to perform the
services required in the City of Chicago will be excluded. Typically, the term offeror
(or bidder) is used prior to the award of a contract.
vii. Private Entity (also referred to as a Contractor) – The private interest involved
in P3 contracting that partners with CIT to implement a project.
viii. Request for Information (RFI) – A solicitation sent to potential suppliers for the
purpose of securing feedback, developing strategy, building a database and

!
understanding potential project approaches based on the suppliers’ expertise.
While it is part of the competitive contracting process, it does not lead directly to
contracting, which is done based on a follow-up RFP or RFQ.
ix. Request for Proposals (RFP) – A solicitation to identify a preferred bidder to
implement a new project. This can include any or all phases of the project: design,
build, finance, operate and maintain. Bidders should expect to furnish evidence of
their experience and ability to meet CIT’s requirements along with a proposed price
when responding to an RFP.

This is because CIT is as concerned with the

Bidder’s capability as with its proposed price.
x. Request for Qualifications (RFQ) – A solicitation released to obtain qualifications
that will identify best-qualified bidders that possess a technical expertise in specific
disciplines, financial capacity, financing capability and operating capability. RFQs
differ from RFPs in that pricing information is not requested. Often, an RFQ will be
issued to identify a set of potential bidders to receive an RFP.
xi. Sister Agencies – A group of agencies that serve the people of the City of
Chicago but subject to approval by the Chicago City Council, including: Chicago
Public Schools (CPS); Chicago Housing Authority (CHA); Chicago Park District
(CPD); Chicago Transit Authority (CTA); City Colleges of Chicago (CCC);
Metropolitan Pier & Exposition Authority (MPEA); Metropolitan Water Reclamation
District of Greater Chicago (MWRDGC) and Public Building Commission (PBC).
xii. Special Purpose Entity (SPE) – Any one or more companies, firms, partnerships,
corporations, joint ventures or other entities created or used for the express
purpose of completing a project.

They may be multi-disciplinary in nature to

provide expertise for all required phases of a project. An SPE may be created in
order to execute a contract with CIT or with a bidder.

xiii. Value for Money – The process of developing and comparing total project costs
when considering traditional contracting vs. alternative contracting such as a P3.
Value for money exists when the risk-adjusted costs of alternative contracting are
less than the risk-adjusted costs of traditional contracting.

II.

Best Practices Concepts
CIT will structure each project to meet the specific needs of the people of the City of Chicago
for successful completion. In general, projects will typically reflect a set of key best practices
for Public-Private Partnerships:
a. Stakeholder Alignment – CIT will secure alignment among stakeholders from all
relevant departments and agencies of the City of Chicago and the Chicago City Council.
This will create stability in the contracting process and provide assurance to participants
of the commitment to projects for which bid requests are released. Approval of terms of
final bids may be subject to approval of the Chicago City Council or other Agency boards
or Commissions, prior to contracting.
b. Duration – Agreements will typically run for 20 – 40 years, to enable building of realistic
financial models.
c. Shared Revenue Streams – To create a true partnership between public and private
entities, agreements may be designed to create mutual on-going interest through shared
revenue streams.
d. Asset Ownership – CIT or City will typically retain ownership of underlying assets (e.g.,
real estate, roads, right-of-ways) even when procuring long-term operating and
maintenance.
e. Shared Risk and Risk Allocation – Risks associated with the project will be allocated
between the public and private sectors based upon the party best able to manage and
mitigate them. Shared risk is a cornerstone of alternative contracting models.
Risk Transfer - As the private entity assumes a greater share of responsibility via project

f.

requirements, the private entity assumes a greater share of the risk. The table below
describes the range of potential project requirements and the associated degree of risk
transfer.

g. Full Scale Projects vs. Demonstration Projects – CIT will target full-scale projects for
competitive bids as opposed to demonstration projects.
i. Full-scale projects demonstrate a more significant commitment on behalf of CIT
and the City of Chicago than demonstration projects
ii. Consequently, they present the greatest opportunity to attract the strongest interest
from private partners who respond to RFIs/RFQs/RFPs.

This will maximize

competition within the private sector and provide the most advantageous terms to
the people of the City of Chicago.
h. Evaluation Based on Short-term and Long-term Factors – CIT will consider a range
of short-term and long-term factors when evaluating project approaches and bids, to
ensure that completed projects best serve the needs of the people of the City of Chicago.
These will be discussed in greater detail in Section VII, Proposal Evaluation. In general
they include:
i. Financial
ii. Technical
iii. Timeline

III.

Initial Programs and Project Selection
a. Initial Programs - The broad mandate for CIT is to provide alternative, innovative
financing and project delivery for transformative infrastructure projects of all types –
including but not limited to renewable energy, transportation, utilities, social or cultural
facilities, government facilities, educational facilities, water, waste management, real
property, telecommunications, etc.

Over time, CIT anticipates working on projects

across the infrastructure spectrum; however, in order to focus its early efforts, CIT has
prioritized the following initial program areas:
•

Energy: Leverage energy technologies, systems or programs to provide more
cost effective and environmentally friendly energy or reduce energy consumption.

•

Transportation: Facilitate cost-effective renewal or expansion of transportation
infrastructure to provide better service at a lower cost and reduce congestion.

•

Underutilized Property: Repurpose underutilized city assets (land, improved
properties, rooftops, right-of-ways, etc.) to their highest and best use to reduce
cost and increase revenue.

At all times, CIT is open to exploring infrastructure projects of all types or receiving
unsolicited proposals related to any infrastructure project that aligns with its mandate.
b. Project Selection - CIT will identify projects from a range of sources: its own research
about emerging technologies and best practices; City of Chicago and Sister Agency
operational goals, infrastructure needs and capital budget constraints; and input from
potential investors, citizens, public interest groups and other potential users.

Both

greenfield and brownfield projects, defined as follows, will be considered:
•

Brownfield Projects:

Existing assets or structure that require improvements,

repairs or expansion and may be partially operational or generating income.
•

Greenfield Projects: Assets or structures that need to designed and constructed
where no infrastructure improvements exist.

CIT will maintain a pipeline of potential projects in different phases of pre-procurement that
will be prioritized based on their economic and social impact and their feasibility. As part of
the pre-procurement process, CIT will engage the appropriate stakeholders and subject
matter experts in the evaluation and development of the project business case and
procurement approach.

In all cases, CIT will endeavor to obtain the government pre-

approvals relevant to a given transaction that will increase project certainty for private sector
participants before the CIT project contracting process is initiated. A high-level overview of

potential conflicts of interest on a project specific basis.
c. CIT may, in its sole discretion, determine that a conflict of interest or a real or
perceived competitive advantage may be mitigated by disclosing all or a portion of
the work product produced by the organization or individual subject to the conflict.

VI.

Proposal Selection Process

a.

Solicited Proposals - Solicited proposals will be evaluated as part of an open bidding
process.

!
Request for Information (RFI) – CIT will issue RFIs for specific projects publicly via its

i.

website (www.ShapeChicago.org) and reserves the right to contact potential suppliers
directly with an RFI concurrent with public release.

The RFI will include project

objectives and provide evaluation criteria, and will request feedback, project strategy and
understanding potential project approaches based on the suppliers’ expertise. CIT will
not issue contracts based on RFI responses, but will instead generally follow the RFI
responses with an RFQ or RFP. Based on RFI responses, CIT has the discretion to:
1. Provide follow-up questions orally or in writing to all of the potential
suppliers who submit an RFI response or with a subset of the potential
suppliers;
2. Issue an open RFQ or RFP to all potential suppliers whether or not they
have submitted an RFI response;
3. Issue an RFP only to a subset of bidders who have submitted an RFI
response;
4. Suspend the project;
5. Permanently cancel the project;
6. Reissue the RFI at a later time.
Request for Qualification (RFQ) – CIT will release RFQs for specific projects publicly

ii.

via its website ("""#$%&'()%*cago.org), and reserves the right to contact potential
bidders directly with an RFQ concurrent with public release. The evaluation criteria for
a project will be published in the RFQ. The criteria will be consistent with the

! ! !

!

Version 4.0   June 12 2014

!
!

15

 !
CHICAGO INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST
Contracting Manual

!
!

!
qualifications requested and will include a description of CIT’s project understanding,
management approach and organizational structure; demonstration of applicable
experience, manpower and equipment resources; experience in obtaining permits,
obtaining right-of-way and successfully completing similar projects; and financial
capability and capacity to complete the work. Based on RFQ responses, CIT has the
discretion to:
1. Provide follow-up questions orally or in writing to all of the potential bidders
who submit an RFQ response or with a subset of the potential bidders;
2. Proceed to an RFP with all bidders who submit an RFQ response, or with a
subset of potential bidders;
3. Suspend the project;
4. Permanently cancel the project;
5. Reissue the RFQ at a later time.
Request for Proposal (RFP) – CIT will issue RFPs to all bidders, or to a subset of

iii.

all bidders, who respond to an RFQ. The basis of award will be clearly defined in the
RFP.

The RFP will also define proposal requirements, including technical

requirements and evaluation criteria.

The evaluation process will consider

understanding of the project, applicable experience, anticipated complex problems
and the solutions to those problems. Thoroughness and quality will also be
considered.
Economic Disclosure Statement (EDS) – In connection with any RFI, RFQ, or

iv.

RFP, CIT may request submission of the same information required of the bidder by
the City of Chicago in its Economic Disclosure Statement. The CIT may request such
information at the RFI, RFQ or RFP stage, as applicable for the particular
transaction.

b.

Pre-Development Proposals - CIT may enter into a pre-development agreement when a
project is not completely defined; financial feasibility has not been determined, but looks
financeable on a preliminary basis; or CIT is seeking private sector innovation and expertise
in accelerating an optimally feasible project.
1. The private partner participates in project planning and design and
prepares the master financial plan and master development plan.
2. The private partner absorbs initial phase work – “sweat equity.”
3. If project proves feasible, the private partner may deliver an unsolicited bid
or participate in a collaborative bid covering implementation.

c.

Unsolicited Proposals - Unsolicited proposals originate within the private sector. Private
entities or individuals may choose to submit proposals to CIT when no RFI/RFQ/RFP has
been issued. Unsolicited proposals may result from the identification by the private sector of
an infrastructure need that may be met by a privately financed project. They may also involve
innovative proposals for infrastructure management.
Once an unsolicited proposal has been received, CIT will undertake a process of due
diligence to determine if the proposal presents a clear public value and conforms to an
appropriate project type for CIT to pursue. If it is determined that the unsolicited proposal
does not meet the requisite criteria the Trust has the discretion to reject the proposal and will
formally notify the submitter. Any unsolicited proposal that meets the requisite criteria will be
evaluated by CIT staff to determine if (i) such proposal should be routed into a transparent,
open process where challengers will have a chance to participate in making a competing
proposal and may be selected over the submitter or (ii) due to the sensitive and/or
proprietary nature of the proposal, such proposal should advance to the negotiation stage
with the submitting party without being subjected to open bidding. Furthermore, CIT staff may
submit unsolicited proposals, on a case by base basis, to the Board of Directors.
CIT views the unsolicited proposal process as an important methodology for engaging the
private sector and for encouraging private entities to bring forward innovative approaches or
ideas. In order to encourage unsolicited proposals, private entities submitting unsolicited
proposals to CIT will receive:

! ! !

!

Version 4.0   June 12 2014

!
!

17

 !
CHICAGO INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST
Contracting Manual

!
!

!
1. A prompt response that includes evaluation of and feedback on the
proposal by CIT staff;
2. An initial opportunity to resubmit a refined proposal before it is presented to
the Board of Directors;
3. A commitment from CIT that, should it be in the best interests of the City
and its taxpayers not to subject any such proposal to open bidding, such
proposal will be excluded from any open bidding process;
4. A second opportunity to resubmit a further refined proposal as part of the
open bidding process, if any;
5. A guarantee that the submitting party will be included in the final bidding
round as part of any open bidding process; and

+# An assurance that confidential or proprietary information submitted by the
proposer will be treated as such.!
Public Requests for CIT Project Ideas: CIT will on occasion announce on www.ShapeChicago.org,
as well as in public meetings and other venues, a project idea. In such instances, it will be made
clear that CIT has identified a project concept that is still being explored. Instead of formally issuing
an RFI or an RFP, CIT will encourage interested parties to submit proposals. Responsive proposals
for project ideas will need to react to the basic project concept outlined by CIT, but submitters will
have the latitude to innovate and further define the specifics for the potential project. Such proposals
for project ideas will be treated in the same manner as any other type of unsolicited proposal.

Step 1: A company or group of companies that approaches CIT with an unsolicited proposal
for private infrastructure development shall be requested to submit an initial proposal
containing sufficient information to allow CIT to make a prima facie assessment of
whether the conditions for proceeding with the unsolicited proposal are met. In
particular, whether the proposed project is in the public interest. The initial proposal
should include, the following information:
1. A statement of the author’s previous project experience and financial
standing;

! ! !

!

Version 4.0   June 12 2014

!
!

19

 !
CHICAGO INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST
Contracting Manual

!
!

!
2. A description of the project (type of project, location, regional impact,
proposed investment, operational costs, financial assessment and resources
needed from CIT or third parties);
3. Details about the site (ownership and whether land or other property will have
to be expropriated);
4. And a description of the service;
5. Full disclosure regarding whether the submitting party has previously
discussed or proposed the project to any city of Chicago employee,
department or agency.
6. The proponent shall submit this preliminary project proposal to CIT at the
Submit Unsolicited Proposal link at ShapeChicago.org!
Step 2: Within a reasonable timeframe following receipt and preliminary examination of an
unsolicited proposal CIT will issue an initial response, assessing whether the project
serves a “public interest,” fits within a strategic infrastructure need/plan for the City
and is an appropriate project type for CIT. If the project is found to be in the public
interest, CIT will invite the proponent to submit a formal proposal in sufficient detail
to allow CIT to make a proper evaluation of the concept or technology and
determine whether the proposal meets CIT’s needs and is likely to be successfully
implemented at the scale of the proposed project.
Notice of Unsolicited Proposal Submission: CIT will publish a notice on ShapeChicago.org
that it has received an unsolicited proposal serving a clearly defined public interest. In this
notice, CIT will post a brief description of the project and invite other interested parties to
submit competing proposals or offer a potential supportive collaboration.
The notice will state that CIT has received and accepted an unsolicited proposal, that it
intends to further evaluate the proposal, that it may negotiate an interim or comprehensive
agreement with the proponent based on the proposal, and that it may accept any competing
proposals for simultaneous consideration. If the original proposal is modified or amended,
then the proponent will also be given the opportunity to add information during the initial
evaluation period. Absent unusual circumstances, the Notice of Unsolicited Proposal
Submission will be posted for no more than 30 days, and then removed until further notice.

CIT reserves the right to treat any other proposal received after the original proposal as
either a competing proposal or a non-competing unsolicited proposal.
Step 3: At this juncture, the proponent is invited to present a fully detailed proposal. CIT will
list all legal, financial, and environmental studies that the proponent will be required
to conduct at its own expense. At this point, CIT should have information on:

,#

The justification of project need;!

2.

The applicant’s ability to construct and/or operate the project;

3.

A technical feasibility study;

4.

An estimated total project cost and financing plan;

5.

An expenditure and income plan for operations specifying the

!

revenue stream(s);
6.

Environmental or other social impact studies;

Step 4: After a subsequent In-Depth Analysis Period, normally lasting no more than 90 days,
the project may be (i) approved to proceed via the processes outlined in this manual
or (ii) rejected. If the project is rejected, then the project proponent may resubmit a
modified version of the proposal or CIT may use the project concept in a public bid
at a later time. If necessary, once the preliminary project proposal is enhanced via
supplemental information requests and is accepted, the proponent receives formal
recognition as the original project bidder.
The total project review period will typically last between 90 and 120 days
depending on the technical and financial considerations of the project. Longer
review periods may be warranted by specific projects.

Additional time will be

needed for CIT to prepare public bid documents.

staff or Board of Directors recommends the received proposal should be pursued or (ii) an
open process will be implemented, in which case it will be advanced under a Best And
Final Offer System.
Best And Final Offer System: The key element of a Best And Final Offer System is multiple
rounds of bidding, in which the original submitter is given the advantage of automatically
participating in the final round. Once the project proposal completes the initial assessment
(see Stage 1: Approving Unsolicited Proposals, Steps 1–4) and the bidding
documents are ready, CIT will invite competing proposals from other firms. The procedure
continues as follows:
Step 5: The project concept and a Request For Proposals (RFP) are publicized on
ShapeChicago.org as well as in various local publications. Information about the
bid price is not disclosed to the other bidders and the original proponent has to
resubmit a formal bid.
Step 6: Bids are received, evaluated, and ranked. The two most advantageous bids are
selected in the first round, from which a final round of bidding will take place. If the
original proponent is not one of these two selected, it will then automatically be
allowed to compete in the final round as well
Step 7: The second round takes place where best and final offers are requested only from
those selected in the first round. All winning bidders from the first round are notified
and a request for each firm’s best and final offer is issued. Information about bid
prices is not disclosed. The preferred bid will only be selected in the second and
final round. Bidders selected as finalists will have the opportunity to meet with CIT
staff either telephonically or in person to discuss their proposal, if desired.
Stage 3: Notice of Project Award
Step 8: CIT will publish a notice of the awarded contract. This notice will identify the winning
firm or consortium and include a summary of the essential terms of the project
agreement.

Project agreements frequently include provisions that are of direct interest for
parties other than CIT and the winning firm and who might have a legitimate interest
in being informed about certain essential elements of the project. This is the case in
particular for projects involving the provision of a service directly to the public.
Therefore, CIT will publish a notice of the award of the project, indicating the
essential elements of the proposed agreements, including:
!

The name of the winning firm;

!

A description of the works and services to be performed by the winning firm;

!

The duration of the contract;

!

The price structure;

!

A summary of the essential rights and obligations of the winning firm and the
guarantees to be provided by it;

!

A summary of the monitoring rights of CIT and remedies for breach of the
project agreement;

!

A summary of the essential obligations of the City, including any payment,
subsidy or compensation offered by it; and

!

Any other essential terms of the project agreement, as provided in the
request for proposals.

Concerns Regarding The Bidding Process
Intellectual Property Rights: For infrastructure projects that require the use of a particular
kind of industrial process or method, CIT will have an interest in stimulating the
submission of proposals incorporating the most advanced processes, designs,
methodologies or engineering concepts with demonstrated ability to enhance the project’s
outputs. Enhanced project outputs may include significantly reducing construction costs,
accelerating project execution, improving safety, enhancing project performance,
extending economic life, reducing costs of facility maintenance and operations or reducing

!
negative environmental impacts during either the construction or the operational phase of
the project.
Companies proposing unsolicited projects often claim to use new techniques or
technologies that cannot be sourced elsewhere. As such, there exists the potential to
violate the proprietary rights of the submitter by exposing their methods in a competitive
process. However, it is often the case substitutes or equivalent technologies of similar
quality are available to complete the project.
When seeking alternatives, CIT will define a selection process that emphasizes the
expected output of the project without being prescriptive of a particular technology or
methodology that must be used to achieve the desired output. Competitive bidders are
then able to propose their own processes or methods. This will ensure the original
submitter’s proprietary rights remain secure as well as determining the offer with the
greatest public value. In such a situation, the fact that each of the bidders has its own
proprietary processes or methods will not pose an obstacle to competition, provided that
all the proposed methods are technically capable of generating the output expected by
CIT.
CIT will guarantee that all proprietary information submitted by each bidder will be kept
confidential by it throughout the bidding process. Proponents will retain title to all
documents submitted throughout the process and those documents will be returned in the
event that the proposal is rejected.
If the original submitter’s specific proprietary techniques are required, but the original
submitter is not the desired party to develop or operate the project for separate reasons,
then it is possible to set up either a licensing arrangement for only the specific proprietary
techniques or have two firms resubmit a Collaborative Proposal.
Proprietary rights to techniques or engineering technologies should not be confused with
the intellectual property rights to the project itself. The original submitter of an unsolicited
proposal does not possess an exclusive right to the project concept that would prevent
CIT from pursuing an open bidding process.

Confidentiality: Negotiations between CIT and all bidders will be confidential and one party
to the negotiations shall not reveal to any other person any technical, price or other
commercial information relating to the negotiations without the consent of the other party.
CIT will keep an appropriate record of key information pertaining to the selection and
award proceedings. Such records may be subject to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
requests.
In order to ensure transparency and accountability and to facilitate the exercise of the right
of aggrieved bidders to seek review of decisions made by CIT, CIT will be required to
keep an appropriate record of key information pertaining to the selection proceedings. The
record to be kept by CIT will contain, as appropriate, general information concerning the
selection proceedings as is usually required to be recorded for public procurement, as well
as information of particular relevance for privately financed infrastructure projects. Such
information may include the following:
!

The names and addresses of the companies participating in bidding consortia;

!

The name and address of the members of the bidders with whom the project
agreement has been entered into;

!

A description of the publicity requirements, including copies of the publicity use;

!

Information relative to the qualifications, or lack thereof, of bidders;

!

A summary of the evaluation and comparison of proposals, including the
application of any margin of preference;

!

A summary of the conclusions of the preliminary feasibility studies commissioned
by CIT and a summary of the conclusions of the feasibility studies submitted by
the qualified bidders;

!

A summary of any requests for clarification of the pre-selection documents or the
request for proposals, the responses thereto, as well as a summary of any
modification of those documents;

A summary of the principal terms of the proposals and of the project agreement;

!

If CIT has found most advantageous a proposal other than the proposal offering
the lowest unit price for the expected output, a justification of the reasons for that
finding by CIT;

!

If all proposals were rejected, a statement to that effect and the grounds for
rejection; and

!

If the negotiations with the consortium that submitted the most advantageous
proposal and any subsequent negotiations with remaining responsive consortia
did not result in a project agreement, a statement to that effect and of the grounds
therefor.

d. Collaborative Proposals – In some instances, CIT will work with a potential partner to
develop an approach or proposal to address a specific opportunity.
1. Based on discussions/joint work, the bidder will submit a proposal that meets
specific criteria.
2. CIT will then publish a note of interest on its website (www.ShapeChicago.org) to
request additional submissions of proposals or ideas within a specified number of
days.
3. Based on responses received, CIT will have the right to:
i.

Move forward with original responder.

ii.

Begin an open bidding process by publishing an RFQ or by issuing an
RFP. If an open bidding process is pursued, it will follow the same process
as outlined previously (See Stage 2: Open Bidding & Best and Final
Offers Steps 5 through 7 and Stage 3 Notice of Project Award Step 8).
Bidders selected as finalists will have the opportunity to meet with CIT staff
either telephonically or in person to discuss their proposal, if desired.

whether to pursue through competitive bid, publish a note of interest for a
collaborative bid or to forward to an appropriate City agency or department, or not
pursue the proposal.
3. All content in citizen submissions will be the property of CIT and the City of
Chicago, and the private entities or individuals who submit a proposal forfeit all
rights to ideas, confidentiality, financial interest and copyrights for the use of
registered trademarks for the purpose of evaluating proposals or bidding.
4. In taking any of the actions described above regarding citizen submissions, CIT
will not undertake any obligation for specific action. Also, when citizens submit
ideas to CIT, they surrender all ownership of the ideas, copyrights, confidentiality
and financial interest in the ideas.
Contracting Schedules – For some goods and services CIT will issue publicly on its

f.

website ("""#$%&'()%*-&./#/0.1 contracting schedules, similar to GSA or City of
Chicago schedule contracting, depending upon requirements or task order contracts or
master consulting agreements.
1. Schedule contracting is intended to reduce costs, shorten lead times, operate with
transparency and increase flexibility and choice.
2. CIT will request specific terms, including item or service, period of time/end date,
quantities required and price.
3. In addition, bidders will be required to demonstrate financial capacity, operating

person or entity that limits the liability of its members, owners or partners. Any
changes in the terms of the contract as may be agreed upon by the parties from
