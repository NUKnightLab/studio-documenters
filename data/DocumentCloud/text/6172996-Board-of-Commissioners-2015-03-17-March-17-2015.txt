(Item 3)
The CHA must annually renew its insurance coverage for the Property Manager’s Insurance
Program (PMIP). Underwriters were invited to a presentation by CHA staff and a tour of three
development locations. The tour was designed to give the underwriters a first-hand look at each
type of development (Senior, Family and Scattered Sites) and to allow informal question and
answer sessions with the PPM staff. Aon directly and indirectly (through one wholesaler)
solicited requests for insurance premium quotes from 19 insurance carriers for each line of the
coverage layers. Specifications were sent on January 9th and quotes were received by January
30, 2015. Aon was able to obtain competition in each layer of coverage. A list of the insurers
approached was compiled in Aon’s Quote Disclosure Report, which includes each insurer’s
response to the broker. Based on the foregoing, the resolution for Item 3 approves purchase of
the following insurance coverage(s) for the period of April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2016, in
the total amount of $967,805, through its insurance broker of record, Aon Risk Services, Inc.: (1)
Primary General Liability coverage written through Swiss Re American Holding/First Specialty
in the amount of $459,485; (2) Umbrella Liability coverage written through Swiss Re American
Holding/First Specialty in the amount of $373,320; and (3) Excess Liability written through
AWAC in the amount of $135,000. The recommended coverages and their respective premiums
represent a 16% reduction in total costs relative to the prior year.
RESOLUTION NO. 2015-CHA-18
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners has reviewed the memorandum dated March 6,
2015 entitled “Recommendation to Award Contracts for Property Managers’
Insurance Program coverage to Swiss Re American Holding/First Specialty for
General Liability and Umbrella Liability coverage, and to Allied World
Assurance Company for Excess Liability, for the Period of April 1, 2015 – March
31, 2016, in the Aggregate Amount of $967,805.”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

The Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to purchase the insurance coverage for CHA's Property Managers'
Insurance Program ("PMIP") through its insurance broker of record, Aon Risk

5

 Services, Inc., for the period of April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2016 for the

Nays:

There being no questions or discussion, Chairwoman Scott thereupon declared said Motion
carried and said resolutions adopted.
Committee Chair Bridget Reidy, Chairwoman of the Operations and Facilities Committee, then
presented her report. Per Commissioner Reidy, the Operations and Facilities committee met on
Wednesday, March 11, 2015, at the CHA Corporate Offices, 60 East Van Buren in Chicago.
Commissioner Sierra chaired the meeting and the following committee members were present as
well: Commissioners Harris and Washington. After presentation by staff, committee members
discussed and voted on items appearing on the agenda.
On behalf of the Operations & Facilities Committee, Commissioner Reidy then presented an
Omnibus Motion for the approval of Items 5 through 7.
(Item 5)
The resolution for Item 5 approves the FY2014 Moving to Work (MTW) Annual Report and
grants authorization to submit the document to HUD for approval. CHA and HUD signed the
original MTW Agreement on February 6, 2000, which allowed CHA to implement the original
Plan for Transformation. CHA’s Amended and Restated MTW Agreement with HUD was fully
executed on June 26, 2008, which extended CHA’s participation in the MTW Demonstration
Program through FY2018. In April 2013, CHA unveiled a new strategic plan, Plan Forward:
Communities that Work, which outlines the agency’s newly articulated mission and strategic
goals that will guide CHA’s current and future work. As CHA implements Plan Forward
initiatives, the agency will continue to pursue the three statutory objectives of the MTW
Demonstration Program: increase housing choices for low-income families; give incentives to
families with children where the head of household is working, seeking work, or is preparing for
work by participating in job training, educational programs, or programs that assist people to
obtain employment and become economically self-sufficient; and reduce costs and achieve
greater cost effectiveness in federal expenditures. As part of the MTW Agreement, CHA is
required to submit an Annual Report to HUD, due 90 days after the end of the fiscal year. The
FY2014 MTW Annual Report provides information necessary for HUD to assess CHA’s
performance in FY2014 regarding both operations and activities authorized by the MTW

6

 Demonstration Program. In May 2013, HUD issued a revised Form 50900 which outlines new
requirements for the content of MTW Annual Plans/Reports and for tracking the impact of MTW
activities. CHA continues to work with HUD to ensure compliance with the new Form 50900.
RESOLUTION NO. 2015-CHA-20
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 11, 2015
requesting approval of the FY2014 Moving to Work Annual Report, attached
hereto;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED BY CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners hereby approves the attached FY2014 Moving to
Work Annual Report and grants authorization to the Chief Executive Officer, the
Board Chairperson, or their designee to make any final updates as deemed
necessary.

THAT

the Board of Commissioners grants authorization to submit the FY2014 Moving
to Work Annual Report to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development on March 31, 2015. Such approval shall constitute conclusive
evidence of the Board’s approval of any and all such updates.

 (Item 6)
The resolution for Item 6 approves an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City of
Chicago Police Department (CPD) for supplemental police services for 2015 and 2016 for an
amount not-to-exceed $8,000,000. The CHA originally entered into an IGA with the CPD for
supplemental police services in 2000 after disbanding the CHA Police. Since that time, the CHA
has continued with this approach of providing supplemental police services through subsequent
IGAs and amendments. The IGA allows CPD to continue to provide specialized policing
programs at designated CHA properties as assigned. These supplemental police services
include: dedicated watches for Cabrini Rowhouses, Henry Horner/Westhaven, Altgeld/Murray,
Lake Parc Place, Brooks/Roosevelt Square, Oakwood Shores, Jackson Square, Wentworth
Gardens, Trumbull Park, and/or other CHA communities as needed; increased foot patrols;
customized policing strategy; attendance at monthly community security meetings to increase
visibility in the community; monitoring and prevention of gang activities and monitoring of drug
and other illegal activities. The IGA also allows CPD to continue to attend all court hearings for
all arrests made by the police officers; responding to acts of domestic violence; responding to
unauthorized or unlawful activities or entries into residences; providing a dedicated CPD staff
member for crime data analysis, statistics and crime reports and additional coverage for summer
surge and lease enforcement actions, as needed. CHA’s budget for 2015 for supplemental police
coverage includes $6M for daily coverage, summer surge, data analysis support, as well as police
assistance related to lease enforcement actions. This IGA permits an additional $2M annually in
police coverage subject to approval by the CEO and appropriate budget availability and
authorization.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2015-CHA-21
the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated March 11, 2015, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER

to not-to-exceed $8,000,000 annually subject to CEO approval and budget
authorization to provide supplemental police services for CHA properties and
programs.

(Item 7)

modernization, rehabilitation, and maintenance of the CHA’s real estate portfolio. These services
include, but are not limited to, evaluating construction feasibility, scope assessment, overseeing
the municipal permitting process, developing construction documents, providing construction
administration support, overseeing the substantial completion phase, and other related services.
The IDIQ Program funding increase and the contract amendments associated with the above

(Item 8)
The resolution for Item 8 approves execution of a Housing Assistance Payments Contract (HAP)

nursing homes. The Chicago units were acquired in 2 phases. Phase I, consisting of 20 units in
two stages, was approved by the CHA Board in August 2012 and in May 2013. Phase I is fully
leased. CHA Board approved Phase II Stage 1, consisting of 14 units, in July 2014. 8 of the 14
units are now leased and leasing is underway for the other 6 units. At this, time HFI has
acquired the remaining 11 units in the second and final stage of Phase II, consisting of 5 studio
and 6 one-bedroom apartments in six condominium buildings located in five community areas.
These units will count toward CHA’s 200-unit Section 811 commitment to the State. HFI, a

people with disabilities. HFI received $11.5 million in Build Illinois Bonds funds from IHDA in
2013 to develop accessible housing for households referred through the Money Follows the
Person (MFP) program. All 20 units in Phase I and 8 units in Phase II are now under a PRA
contract, with the other 6 pending HQS inspections. The units will be managed by Affordable
Property Management Specialists, which has been in business since 2006 and currently manages
four LIHTC projects in 10 buildings totaling 275 units in the City. The owner/manager of IAHI
Phase II Stage 2 will lease all of the PRA-assisted units to physically disabled applicants referred

CHA’s waiting list will be given a priority preference. Initial contract rents will be determined
by market comparables and fair market rents applicable at the time the HAP contract is executed.
All rent determinations will comply with federal regulations and Chicago Housing Authority
(CHA) policy.

and fitness room for the exclusive use of residents as well as a community room for meetings
and special events. All 181 units will be Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) units, with
66 of those units set aside for public housing eligible families with ACC operating subsidy being
provided by CHA. All public housing units will be distributed throughout the building. The
projected direct costs for the 181 total rental units in the Sterling Park development total
$54,889,367 and include the approximate $19,715,758 CHA loan. CHA will issue a tax-exempt
Multifamily Housing Revenue Note in an amount not to exceed $30,000,000 which will generate
4% Low Income Tax Credits. Citibank, N.A. will purchase the Note and loan the funds on
behalf of CHA and pursuant to a Funding Loan Agreement among the Authority, as
Governmental Lender, Citibank, N.A., as Funding Lender, and U.S. Bank National Association,
as fiscal agent. The proceeds of the Note will be used by the Authority to make a loan to New
Sterling Park LLC pursuant to a Borrower Loan Agreement between the Authority and the
Borrower. Upon construction completion, lease-up and stabilization, LIHTC and Historic Tax

11

 Credit equity will be used to partially redeem the Note down to a projected permanent loan
amount not greater than $4,025,000. The Authority will provide permanent financing through its
loan of capital or other funds in return for the agreement of the Borrower to rent 66 units at the
site to public housing eligible tenants. The Note will be a special limited obligation payable
solely from the sources set forth in the Funding Loan Agreement and does not constitute an
indebtedness, liability, general or moral obligation, or a pledge or loan of credit, of the Authority,
the City of Chicago, the State of Illinois or any political subdivision of the State of Illinois.

The Note shall be issued in fully registered form, in an aggregate principal amount not
