I. Minutes of the August 14, 2018, Budget Committee Meeting
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the minutes of the August 14, 2018, Budget
Committee Meeting. Mr. Kocerka seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
II. Bullying Prevention
ICJIA Program Supervisor Shai Hoffman referred to a memo dated September 4, 2018,
drafted for informational purposes on ICJIA’s appropriation for Bullying Prevention
(BP). He said ICJIA received a state appropriation of $443,000 in the state fiscal year
2019to support BP. He said staff recommended using BP funds to support one or more
grants to Illinois HEALS (Helping Everyone Access Linked Systems) pilot locations to

support trauma-aware schools. He said staff wanted to expend the funds by June 30,
2019, which left little time for a proper competitive bidding process.
ICJIA Strategic Policy Advisor & Project Director Reshma Desai said that the Illinois
HEALS program was started with a discretionary grant that Illinois received from the
federal Office for Victims of Crime. The program seeks to improve the identification of
youths who are victims of violence and to improve the coordination of care. Staff is
conducting an assessment planning process to identify community sites for the program.
Mr. Hoffman said staff would request BP designations at a future Budget Committee
meeting. He said that it would not be necessary to release a Notice of Funding
Opportunity and proceed with the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act’s
competitive funding award process if the Grant Accountability and Transparency Unit
grants ICJIA an exemption for this program.
No action was taken.
III. Justice Assistance Grants FFY13, FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16
ICJIA Federal & State Grants Unit Acting Associate Director Stevens referred Budget
Committee members to a memo dated September 4, 2018, regarding FFY13, FFY14,
FFY15, and FFY16 Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG) plans.
A. Designation Reduction
Mr. Stevens described $161,095 in FFY14, $37,816 in FFY15, and $4,152 in FFY16
JAG funds recently returned to ICJIA. He said the FFY14 funds will expire on
September 30, 2018, and were no longer available for programming. He said staff
recommended making the returned FFY15 and FFY16 funds available for other
programming.
Motion: Ms. Vollen-Katz moved to approve the recommended JAG FFY14, FFY15, and
FFY16 designation reductions. Ms. Wolff seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote, with a recusal by Hon. Robb.
B. Fund Reallocations
Mr. Stevens discussed a staff recommendation to terminate FFY14 funding for four
programs on September 30, 2018, and replace the funding with FFY16 dollars to
support the remainders of those programs as described in the memo. He said the Office
of Justice Programs unexpectedly announced that FFY14 funds will expire on
September 30, 2018. He said staff requested additional funds to support continuation of
the City of Springfield’s Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent Crime program. He said
the continuation would reduce the administrative burdens associated with executing two
separate grant agreements.

Human Trafficking Task Force funds mistakenly taken back via Budget Committee

Total

FFY13
$208,200
$204,350
$412,550

Mr. Stevens said the funds would allow the municipalities to purchase an acquisition
station, an analysis station, and a Stereo Zoom Microscope that would allow them to
utilize National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) technology.
Deputy Chief David Shaffer of City of Champaign Police Department said local access to
NIBIN technology would dramatically reduce the time it takes to produce ballistics test
results and that the equipment would be shared with other law enforcement agencies.
Motion: Hon. Robb moved to approve the recommended FFY13 JAG designation
recommendations to support purchases of mobile ballistic test equipment. Mr. Kocerka
seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
3. Crime Strategy Analysis and Evaluation Program
Mr. Stevens described a staff recommendation to designate $178,788 in FFY15 and
$86,329 in FFY16 state-use funds to continue support of the ICJIA’s Crime Strategy
Analysis and Evaluation Program for about five-and-a-half months in 2019.
Motion: Mr. Olson moved to approve the recommended FFY15 and FFY16 JAG
designation recommendations to continue support of the ICJIA’s Crime Strategy Analysis
and Evaluation Program. Hon. Robb seconded the motion.

4. Comprehensive Law Enforcement Response to Narcotics
Mr. Stevens described staff recommendations to designate $147,137 in FFY13, $60,292
in FFY15, and $1,793,958 in FFY16 JAG funds to support Comprehensive Law
Enforcement Response to Narcotics programs. He said the designations would support
grants for six months from October 1, 2018, to March 31, 2019. The shorter, six-month
designations were recommended due to the delay in the state’s receipt of its FFY17 JAG
award.
Motion: Mr. Olson moved to approve the recommended FFY13, FFY15, and FFY16
JAG designation recommendations to continue support of the Comprehensive Law
Enforcement Response to Narcotics programs for a period of six months. Hon. Robb
seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
