February 15, 2018, Meeting Overview

The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority’s (ICJIA) Quarterly Board Meeting will be held
Thursday, February 15th, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:30 pm. at the Michael A. Bilandic Building (160 N.
LaSalle in Chicago), room N-505. To enter the Bilandic Building, visitors must present a valid State I.D.
and pass through a metal detector. All ICJIA Board meetings are subject to the Open Meetings Act.
Members of the general public are encouraged to attend.
ICJIA’s statutorily-created oversight Board serves a unique and vital role in improving the State’s public
safety outcomes. Composed of state and local public safety officials, policy experts, and community
leaders, the Board is designed to embody and represent the state’s criminal justice system. It is tasked
with setting agency priorities, tracking the progress of ongoing programs, and overseeing the agency’s
grant-making. To that end, ICJIA’s quarterly Board meetings bring research and practical insights to bear
on important and emerging issues affecting public safety in Illinois, with the goal of identifying how the
agency should address them through research and grant-making.
At the February Board meeting, executive staff will provide Members with essential updates on the
agency’s work. This will include updates on our federal formula grants, state-funded programs, and our
strategic policy initiatives. ICJIA’s Executive Director will also provide an overview of how the agency’s
work aligns with the priorities Members identified and discussed at our December meeting. He will also
give update on the state of Illinois’ Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) for Federal Fiscal Year 2017.
The meeting’s Research and Practice Presentation will present on how ICJIA’s funding has responded to
the priorities that the Board has set around addressing victimization. Additionally, in order to determine
gaps in violence prevention programming for the state Violence Prevention Plan, we must first map what
is currently active. We will be reaching out to Board members to collect this information about their
agencies over the next few weeks.
We look forward to your participation and guidance.

Executive Director
