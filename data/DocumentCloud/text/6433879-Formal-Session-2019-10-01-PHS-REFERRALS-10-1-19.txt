My office has received numerous calls from bicycle safety advocates requesting support
from the City of Detroit to implement a mandatory bicycle helmet law. According to the
Bicycle Safety Institute only 22% of adult riders in severe accidents were wearing
helmets. Please provide an opinion on Detroit?s ability to require adults and/or minors
riding bicycles to wear helmets while riding in Detroit.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Ron Brundidge, Director, Department of Public Works
THRU: Council President Brenda Jones

FROM: Council Member Raquel Castaneda-Lopez .. {gel
DATE: September 23, 2019

RE: Public Works District 6 DFD Concerns

 

- a - 

I
. 
I A: ?rll-?l 

I request that the alley behind Engine 33 (104] Lawndale) between Olivet Lafayatte be vacated. On a
recent visit to ?re houses in my district it was brought to my attention that the petition to vacate the
portion of the alley from the cross section to the street was submitted several times and a response was
not received. I look forward to working with you on this matter.

What is the process for notifying the Detroit Fire Department about street repairs and closures for work
and events? How frequently does this happen?

Both residents and Fire Engine 48 (2300 Fort) have met with MDOT and advocated for an additional
light/crosswalk to be placed at the entrance of the ?re house and near Kemeny Recreation Center to
provide greater safety for pedestrians crossing and the ?re department. Has DPW worked on this issue?
What is position?

Engine 1 (l Montcalm): Both the alley and the parking lot for this ?re house are in very bad
condition. What is the timeline for repairing them?

Please look into the feasibility of installing signs in front of Ladder 22, 6830 McGraw.
Given the current layout it makes it dif?cult and dangerous to pull out of the ?re house.

Please conduct a study of the existing street markings in front of all the ?re houses in District 6 to ensure
they are meeting the individual needs of each ?re house. Speci?cally, the markings in front of Engine 52
(5029 Manistique) are insuf?cient.

Engine 34 (6345 Livernois):

a. There are multiple trees in the alley that cover the electrical wires behind the ?re house that
contribute to multiple electrical outages. What is the status of trimming or removing these trees as
the alley is directly behind city owned property?

b. I request the alley be vacated behind this ?re house. Please let me know what is needed to move
this process forward.
