 EXPLANATION
CHA seeks to enter into a contract with the Urban Institute for the term of November 1, 2010
through December 31, 2011 to conduct research and analysis for the CHA. The contract’s
primary focus will be to conduct research on two initiatives: 1) tracking long-term outcomes for
the Chicago Family Case Management Demonstration project and 2) an impact analysis on crime
patterns as a result of HCV residents in Chicago’s neighborhoods.
The Chicago Family Case Management Demonstration project is a partnership of the Urban
Institute, CHA, Heartland Human Care Services and Housing Choice Partners which has
provided enhanced, wrap-around case management and relocation services to approximately 450
residents at Ida B. Wells and Dearborn Homes since the inception of the project in March 2007
through its completion in the spring of 2010. The proposed agreement will enable the Urban
Institute to conduct a follow-up survey with participants in 2011 and perform an analysis of the
results. The survey will be beneficial to CHA in assessing the longer-term effects on residents’
outcomes and, ultimately, in long-term planning for services to residents.
Another purpose is to further study the impact of CHA relocatees who have used a HCV, and
HCV recipients in general, on patterns of crime in Chicago’s neighborhoods. The MacArthur
Foundation funded the initial study, and CHA seeks to fund further analysis. MacArthur will
match CHA’s funds for the proposed projects.
CHA desires to enter in this contract with Urban Institute based upon its expertise in research on
public housing, and its previous involvement in the Chicago Family Case Management
Demonstration project. The staff of the Urban Institute has been dedicated to conducting
impartial, fact-based research, which has been instrumental in CHA’s strategies to meet the goals
of the Plan for Transformation, including delivery of services to residents.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Officer or his designee to enter into a contract with the Urban Institute for the period of
November 1, 2010 through December 31, 2011, in an amount not-to-exceed $174,320 for
professional research and analysis services related to the Chicago Family Case Management
Demonstration Project, and with respect to crime patterns as a result of the presence of HCV
residents in a community,.
