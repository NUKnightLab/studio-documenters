GENERAL BACKGROUND/EXPLANATION

 The CHA must annually renew its insurance coverage for the Property Manager’s Insurance Program
(PMIP). The aggregate limit of coverage, $22 million, is constructed using 3 different layers of
coverage: (1) primary general liability up to $2 million; (2) umbrella liability, which provides coverage
in the $2 million – $12 million layer; and (3) excess liability, which provides coverage for the $12
million - $22 million layer.
A property tour has become an integral component of the marketing plan. Underwriters were invited
to a presentation by CHA staff and a tour of three development locations. The tour was designed to
give the underwriters a first-hand look at each type of development (Senior, Family, Scattered Sites)
and to allow informal question and answer sessions with the PPM staff. This strategy supports the
touted success of the Plan for Transformation and the resulting improvement in CHA's real estate
portfolio, which is reflected in improved claim results and an increase in competition by insurers
willing to provide coverage.
PROCUREMENT INFORMATION
Aon directly and indirectly (through one wholesaler) solicited requests for insurance premium quotes
from 19 insurance carriers for each line of the coverage lines. Specifications were sent on January 9th
and quotes were received by January 30, 2015. Aon was able to obtain competition in each layer of
coverage. The Housing Authority class of business is still challenging for insurers, but our program is
growing more attractive to potential insurers as evidenced by multiple quotes for each coverage line.
A list of the insurers approached was compiled in Aon’s Quote Disclosure Report, which includes each
insurer’s response to the broker.
RECOMMENDATION
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the Chicago Housing Authority to purchase the
following insurance coverage(s) for the period of April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2016, in the total
amount of $967,805, through its insurance broker of record, Aon Risk Services, Inc. (“Aon”): (1)
Primary General Liability coverage written through Swiss Re American Holding/First Specialty in the
amount of $459,485; (2) Umbrella Liability coverage written through Swiss Re American Holding/First
Specialty in the amount of $373,320; and (3) Excess Liability written through AWAC in the amount of
$135,000. The recommended coverages and their respective premiums represent a 16% reduction
in total costs relative to the prior year.
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies and applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.
The EVP of Finance concurs with the recommendation to purchase insurance coverage through its
Broker of Record with the same policy limits and retention levels for all lines as in the prior year’s
program.
The CEO/President recommends the approval to purchase insurance coverage for CHA's PMIP for the
period of April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2016, in a total amount of $967,805, through its insurance
broker of record, Aon Risk Services, Inc. (“Aon”): (1) Primary General Liability coverage written
through Swiss Re American Holding/First Specialty in the amount of $459,485; (2) Umbrella Liability
coverage written through Swiss Re American Holding/First Specialty in the amount of $373,320; and
(3) Excess Liability written through AWAC in the amount of $135,000.
