The Chairperson thereupon declared said Motion carried and said Resolution adopted.
Commissioner O’Keefe, Chairperson of the Finance and Audit Committee, then presented her
monthly report. Per Commissioner O’Keefe, the Finance & Audit Committee held its regular
meeting on Wednesday, March 12, 2008 at 1:00 p.m. at the 60 East Van Buren Corporate
offices. Mike Gurgone, Treasurer, presented the Committee with the Treasury & Cash Flow
Report for the month of February 2008.
Commissioner O’Keefe then introduced an Omnibus Motion for adoption of Resolutions for
Items A1 thru A4 discussed voted and recommended for Board approval by the Finance and
Audit Committee.
(Item A1)
The resolution for Item A1 approves award of contracts with Lexington Insurance Company,
National Union, and ACE/USA for the Private Managers Insurance Program’s ( PMIP) Liability,
Workers Compensation and Commercial Crime Insurance Coverage. The PMIP ensures that
Private Management Companies and Resident Management Corporations (RMCs) have the
necessary insurance coverage contractually required by CHA. All costs associated with the
program are deducted from the participating Private Management Companies' and RMCs'
operating budget. Aon, the broker of record, directly and indirectly solicited requests for
insurance premium quotes from 27 insurance carriers in January 2008 and received two or more
quotes for General and Auto Liability and Crime and only from the incumbent carriers Worker
Compensation and Excess Liability. Many carriers are still not interested in writing habitational
risk, especially public housing risks. This was the first time in almost ten years that another
insurance carrier was willing to quote the General Liability coverage, including auto. The results
of the Plan for Transformation are becoming obvious to insurance carriers both appearance wise
and through the reduction of the number and severity of claims. Due to the increased
competition this year, Aon was able to negotiate a 24% reduction from Lexington for General
Liability from last year’s premium. Although Lexington revised the quote for General Liability
due to increased competition, there were no other carriers willing to quote the Excess Liability
coverage and, therefore, Lexington did not revise its Excess Liability quote.
Commissioner Mendenhall recused from voting on this item only.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-19
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated March
entitled “Authorization to enter into contracts with Lexington
Company, National Union, and ACE/USA for the Private Managers
Program’s Liability, Workers Compensation and Commercial Crime
Coverage”;

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into contracts with Lexington Insurance Company for General,
Auto and Excess Liability Insurance, ACE for Workers Compensation insurance,
and National Union for Commercial Crime insurance in the aggregate amount
not-to-exceed $2,125,960 for the CHA’s Private Managers Insurance for the
period April 1, 2008 through March 31, 2009.

(Item A2)
In March 2004, the CHA adopted a high level Information Security Policy Manual which was
subject to formal modification and approval, as required. In order to strengthen and improve the
Authority’s internal controls, the policy has been revised. The revised Information Security
Policy maintains the essential elements of the previous policy in a streamlined and more
manageable version. It more clearly articulates the rules and expectations the CHA requires of
its employees and designated agents to protect its information systems and resources. The
revised Information Security Policy establishes a foundation for protecting the organization’s
information resources and defines the overarching approach to systems’ preservation and the
3

 required internal controls by which the protection of IT resources and integrity of IT systems is
to be safe guarded. The Policy provides guidelines for ensuring adequate security for
information collected, transmitted, processed, stored or presented via the CHA’s systems. It is
established to ensure appropriate information confidentiality, integrity and availability.
Accordingly, the resolution for Item A2 approves the revised Information Security Policy.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-20
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 12, 2008
requesting adoption of a revised Information Security Policy, and approves
recommendation contained therein;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

effective as of the adoption of the revised Information Security Policy, the Board
of Commissioners hereby rescinds the Information Systems Security Policy, dated
December 2003, and effective as of March 2004 (the “2004 Information Systems
Security Policy”).

THAT,

the Board of Commissioners adopts the revised Chicago Housing Authority
Information Security Policy dated March 18, 2008, attached hereto as Exhibit A,
which supersedes the 2004 Information Systems Security Policy in its entirety.

THAT,

the revised Information Security Policy dated March 18, 2008 shall be effective
immediately upon approval.

(Item A3)
The resolution for Item A3 approves award of contracts to Quadel Consulting Corporation and
CVR Associates, Inc. to provide the administration and operation of CHA’s Section 8 Moderate
Rehabilitation and Housing Choice Voucher Programs (Programs). In April 2007, the Authority
issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) soliciting firms to administer the Programs. The two
respondents to the RFP were Quadel Consulting Corporation, the CHA’s current administrator of
the Programs, and CVR Associates Inc. The RFP’s primary objectives included i.) improving
customer service, ii.) increasing competition for potential vendors to administer the program, iii.)
gaining operational efficiencies; iv.) reducing operating costs, and v.) optimizing capacity and
expertise to handle future growth of the program. Through a series of meetings and negotiations
with both vendors, the evaluation committee determined that it was in the best interest of the
CHA to bifurcate the administration and operations of the Program amongst the two vendors. In
addition, a leading public housing consulting firm provided program and procurement subject
matter expertise as the evaluation committee navigated through logically bifurcating program
operations between the two vendors. The result is a plan that uses the best features of the
proposals from both vendors. The plan also includes transitioning some functions and processes
back to the CHA. The CHA’s Finance Department will assume financial management
responsibilities for the Programs that include the payment of approximately $333,000,000
annually in housing assistance payments to more than 15,600 landlords participating on the
program. This transition will allow the CHA to improve internal controls and monitoring. The
CHA’s ITS Department will assume responsibilities for network support and help desk functions
for both vendors. These changes will eliminate duplicate costs and improve operational
efficiencies. Both vendors have proven track records in administering and operating Section 8
programs.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-21
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board letter dated March 12, 2008, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO EXECUTE
CONTRACTS WITH CVR ASSOCIATES, INC.
AND QUADEL
CONSULTING CORPORATION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND
OPERATION OF THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY’S SECTION 8
MODERATE REHABILITATION AND HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER
PROGRAMS”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to execute contracts with CVR Associates, Inc. (for a contract term of
4

 two (2) years and nine (9) months) and Quadel Consulting Corporation for a
contract term of two (2) years and seven (7) months) for a combined amount notto-exceed $61,394,171.00, with one, 2-year option to extend, subject to the
Board’s approval, for the administration and operation of the Chicago Housing
Authority’s Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation and Housing Choice Voucher
Programs.
(Item A4)
The resolution for Item A4 approves execution of Amendment to the Annual Contribution
Contract (ACC) for Project Nos. IL06P002166, 168, 172, 202 and 232. The purpose of this
Amendment is to add units of five completed Projects to the CHA’s ACC for the operating
subsidy for those units. The New Addendum to the CHA’s ACC also reflects the additions of
these Projects to the CHA’s ACC.
RESOLUTION 2008-CHA-22
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 12,
2008, entitled Recommendation to Execute Amendment to the Chicago Housing
Authority’s Annual Contributions Contract C-1014 for Project Nos.
IL06P002166, 168, 172, 202 and 232.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Chicago Housing Authority shall enter into Amendment to the Annual
Contributions Contract C-1014 (“CHA ACC”) with U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development (“HUD”) to add Project Nos. IL06P002166, 168, 172,
202 and 232 to the CHA ACC and the Chief Executive Officer or his designee, is
hereby authorized and directed to execute such Amendment to the Annual
Contribution Contract C-1014 in quintuplicate and the Custodian and Keeper of
Records is authorized and directed to attest and impress the official seal of the
Chicago Housing Authority on each such counterpart. The aforesaid Amendment
shall be substantially in the attached form.

The Omnibus Motion to adopt resolutions for Items A1 thru A4 was seconded by Commissioner
Young and the voting was as follows:
Ayes: Hallie Amey

Nays: None

There being no questions or discussion, the Chairperson thereupon declared said Motion carried
and said resolutions adopted. The Finance & Audit Committee report was also accepted in total.
Commissioner Ponce, Chairman of the Operations Committee, then presented the Operations and
Facilities monthly report. Per Commissioner Ponce, the Operations and Facilities Committee
held its regular meeting on Wednesday, March 12, 2008 at approximately 1:55 p.m. at the 60
East Van Buren Corporate offices.
Commissioner Ponce then introduced an Omnibus Motion for adoption of the Resolutions for
Items B1 thru B4 discussed voted and recommended for Board approval by the Operations and
Facilities Committee.
(Item B1)
The resolution for Item B1 ratifies Contract Modification No.G-01 with H.L.F. Construction
Company in the not-to-exceed amount of $348,718.00 for the replacement of 960 LF of existing
3” water main with new 3” water main. While excavating for the 8” sewer line, the Contractor
5

 discovered the 3” water main. The 8” sewer line could not be relocated due to the specified
locations of the new and existing catch basins, and the Prime Design Consultant’s engineer
agreed that relocating the 3” water main was more feasible. To avoid any additional delays it
was the recommendation of the Project Manager that this work was started immediately while
the ground was already excavated and before the weather conditions deteriorated.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-23
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 12,
2008, entitled “RATIFICATION OF CONTRACT MODIFICATION NO. G-01
FOR THE UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE WORK AT FRANCIS
CABRINI ROW HOUSES (IL2-002)”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners ratifies Contract Modification No. G-01 to Contract
No. 7062 with H.L.F. Construction Company in the not-to-exceed amount of
$348,718.00 for additional infrastructure work related to the Family Housing
renovation of Frances Cabrini Homes (IL2-002). The new total contract amount
of Contract No. 7043 is the not-to-exceed amount of $4,264,718.00. This Contract
Modification is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and insurance requirements.

(Item B2)
The resolution for Item B2 approves Modification No. 4 with Partnership for Transformation
(PFT), to provide program management and capital maintenance management services for all
current CHA Capital Improvement and Capital Maintenance Plan Programs. Since June of 2006,
PFT has addressed the following needs: (1) the establishment of a single point of accountability
for the rehabilitation of the Senior, Family, and Scattered Sites properties, and Make-Ready
units; (2) the implementation of an efficient and comprehensive plan covering pre-construction,
construction and post-construction to ensure on-time delivery of housing units, and (3) the
imposition of tight fiscal guidelines, as well as change order protocols, to meet budget targets
and constraints. In January of 2008, PFT also took on construction management responsibilities
for the Capital Maintenance Program. During FY2008 the two year base period of Contract No.
6023 will expire. PFT has become an integral part of the CHA management team with respect to
the Capital Improvement and Capital Maintenance Programs and its central role in the Plan for
Transformation. The loss of the construction management services provided by PFT would be
detrimental to the timely achievement of the CHA’s Plan for Transformation. The CHA desires,
therefore, to extend the construction management functions of PFT through May 2009 by
executing the first (1) year option of Contract No. 6023 at a cost not-to-exceed $4,474,578.00.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-24
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated March 12, 2008,
entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO EXECUTE MODIFICATION NO. 04 TO
CONTRACT
NO.
6023
WITH
THE
PARTNERSHIP
FOR
TRANSFORMATION TO EXERCISE OPTION YEAR NO. 01”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to approve Modification No. 04 to approve funding, budget, and
organizational staffing in the not-to-exceed amount of $4,474,578.00 for Option
Year No. 1 for the period of June 1, 2008 through May 31, 2009. The new total
contract value of Contract No. 6023 is the not-to-exceed amount of
$11,586,857.00.
This modification is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and insurance requirements

(Item B3)
The resolution for Item B3 approves award of contract to Integrys Energy Services Corporation
for the supply of Natural Gas not to exceed $28,000,000.00. HUD has historically offered
incentives to housing authorities that purchase their natural gas supplies at wholesale costs
(wellhead) that are less than what the local retail utility would charge. The CHA seeks to
6

 continue to use wellhead purchasing practices to obtain its natural gas requirements for its
residential developments and facilities. The CHA’s wellhead contract for natural gas supply and
delivery with its current vendor, People’s Energy Services Corporation, expires on March 31,
2008. The CHA performed a solicitation to procure a vendor to supply and deliver natural gas.
Integrys is the corporate successor to Peoples, which was reorganized and merged under a
transaction in February 2007 involving Integrys Energy Group, Inc., the parent holding company
of Integrys Energy Services, Inc. The wellhead pricing options have many features that enable
the CHA to actively manage and hedge the risks of price fluctuations for its natural gas supplies.
The main method of price/risk management that the CHA utilizes in securing its natural gas
supply occurs through the nomination process that takes place within a given month. The terms
of the contract provide the CHA the flexibility to: (a) lock in supplies for CHA-designated
volumes of its monthly projected consumption; and (b) to acquire additional gas supplies needed
in excess of the designated amount(s) at prices tied to floating index costs of the wholesale gas
market. Under this arrangement, the CHA can “nominate” a particular volume of natural gas
which is “locked in” at the NYMEX price at the beginning of the month. The remainder of the
budgeted consumption for a given month is generally purchased at a blended rate that is tied to
the weighted average of NYMEX daily wholesale rates for the remainder of the month. The
combination of these two methods allows the CHA to procure its gas supplies on a partiallylocked/partially-floating basis within a given month. The secondary method of price/risk
management utilized by the CHA occurs as the CHA opts to hedge its supply and price risks
through forward pricing and extended-term supply contracts. In addition to the risk hedging
available through the blend of locked and floating wholesale rates for gas under the nomination
process, the CHA can exercise the additional option of purchasing gas supplies at a Fixed Price
Option (FPO). Under the Fixed Price Option, the CHA can lock in forward gas supplies at a
Fixed Rate per therm, in volumes elected by the CHA in its discretion. Where wholesale gas
prices are lower than the open Fixed Price Option, there is little incentive or benefit to exercising
the FPO. However, in some circumstances, the market price for gas can trend near or above the
Fixed Price Option, which may warrant the CHA’s use of the FPO to purchase forward gas
supplies at the Fixed Price – hedging the risk future price increases by locking in supplies at a
fixed rate per therm for a chosen volume. If the CHA chooses to make a forward contract using
the FPO, it executes a Fixed Price Agreement which fixes the purchase of a specific volume(s) of
gas supply for the current or future month(s) designated by CHA in the Fixed Price Agreement.
One additional complementary option available to the CHA is the ability to store gas supplies
with its supplier, which offers another flexible method of price/risk management that the CHA
can actively manage or have its supplier, manage at the CHA’s direction. The result of the
multi-layered supply options described above is a “blended cost” which results in an overall
savings to the CHA by hedging against fluctuations in wholesale prices and supplies. Given the
CHA’s anticipated consumption of approximately 31,049,380 therms of natural gas for the next
twenty-four months this agreement offers CHA the opportunity to purchase its gas needs at
wholesale instead of retail, and enables the CHA to hedge against potential market price
fluctuations through use of multi-tiered price/risk management options.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-25
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated March 12, 2008,
requesting “AUTHORIZATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT TO INTEGRYS
ENERGY SERVICES, INC. FOR THE SUPPLY OF NATURAL GAS TO
VARIOUS CHA RESIDENTIAL SITES AND FACILITIES FOR A TWO (2)
YEAR BASE TERM IN AN AMOUNT-NOT-TO-EXCEED $28,000,000.00.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

designee enter into an agreement for natural gas supply and delivery services with
Integrys Energy Services, Inc. in an amount not-to-exceed $28,000,000.00 for a

(Item B4)
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (IFB) in November 2007 for Exterior Masonry Façade
Repairs at Henry Horner Annex. The IFB was advertised in area newspapers and on the CHA
website. The CHA also directly solicited twenty-eight vendors. The CHA received and opened
eight bids of which the lowest bid received was determined to be non-responsive to the IFB, as
the bidder did not submit a Chicago license for general contractors. Accordingly, the resolution
7

was determined to be a responsible bidder with the lowest, responsive bid in the amount of
$714,581.00.

Committee.
(Item C1)
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (IFB) in January 2008 for Resident Relocation Services

advertised in area newspapers and on the CHA website. The CHA also directly solicited thirty
vendors. Of the four bids received, all four vendors were found to be responsive and

 FAMILIES MOVING INTO THE PRIVATE MARKET OR WITHIN CHA’S
DEVELOPMENTS UNDER PLAN FOR TRANSFORMATION”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into contracts for resident relocation and moving services with
Big “O” Movers and Storage, Smith Movers, Inc., REO Movers and Van Lines,
Inc., and Midway Moving and Storage, Inc. The initial base term for each

(Item C2)
In 2007, the Board of Commissioners authorized the CHA to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) with the Chicago Park District (CPD) to provide programs and services for
CHA youth. The resolution for Item C2 approves the first one-year option of the IGA with CPD.
The IGA positively impacts thousands CHA youth, who otherwise may not have been able to
participate in CPD programs due to cost. Since 2003, CHA has partnered with CPD to provide
safe, positive and structured activities during the summer months when CHA children are most
at risk.
During 2007 summer session, CPD served approximately 2,500 CHA children.
Throughout the CHA partnership with CPD, approximately 11,500 CHA children have
participated in Park District programs. In 2008, the CHA and the CPD plan to expand the
existing programming by creating a year-round voucher program. The year-round voucher
program would begin with CPD’s 2008 fall session. In addition to CPD’s regular summer
programming, the expanded services will also allow parents to send their children to recreational
CPD programs in the Fall, Winter and Spring. The goal is to provide activities for CHA children
to participate in safe, constructive, and educational recreational activities year-round.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-28
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 12,
2008, entitled “RECOMMENDATION TO AUTHORIZE THE FIRST ONEYEAR OPTION OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT WITH
THE CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT (CONTRACT NO. 7044)”;

designee to exercise the first one-year option of the IGA with CPD for the period
of January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008 to provide access to recreational
programs to CHA children and to increase the not-to-exceed compensation
amount by $203,400.00. The IGA’s new aggregate not-to-exceed compensation
amount will be $363,400.00.

(Item C3)
The resolution for Item C3 amends Contract No. 7078 with the Illinois Action for Children
(IAFC) to provide enhanced child care resource and referral services for CHA families. The
contract was initiated in 2007 to satisfy the Building Code Violation Settlement Agreement
between the CHA and the City of Chicago to fund administrative support and a childcare referral
program for CHA residents. Further, the settlement agreement requires the CHA to extend
services through 2008 and 2009. As a result, the CHA has requested IAFC to expand its current
program to further support CHA parents as they prepare to meet the work-requirement as
outlined by the FY 2008 Admissions and Continued Occupancy Policy (ACOP). Additionally,
IAFC program staff conducts home visits and provide personal support to parents and licensed
exempt child care providers in order to develop parenting skills and improve young children’s
language and literacy, and enrolling those CHA residents who elect intensive assistance in their
Parents as Teachers® program. To meet this need of the new FY 2008 ACOP work
requirements, IAFC has proposed enhancements to its current program, including additional
walk-in desks specifically for CHA residents at community offices and enhanced referrals to
after-school programs. Additionally, IAFC seeks to engage 100 families in Community
Connections activities, including participation in young parents groups, personal goal setting
sessions, and leadership development classes.

(“Contract”) to extend the base term for an additional four months through
December 31, 2008 and increase the Contract’s not-to-exceed compensation
amount by $350,000.00. The Contract’s new total not-to-exceed compensation

(Item C4)
The resolution for Item C4 approves an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the Chicago
Department of Children and Youth Services (CYS) for school-age and summer food programs.
This IGA is being initiated to satisfy a portion of the Building Code Violation Settlement
Agreement between the CHA and the City of Chicago to fund administrative support and
programming for CHA youth in 2008 and 2009. The funding provided under the IGA will cover
programmatic costs to ensure two-hundred-twenty-five slots for CHA children over the term of
the IGA. CYS shall also implement a youth workforce development program in the summers of
2008 and 2009 for CHA youth ages 16 to 18 that will result in a minimum of 50 employment
placements. The identified youth shall receive job readiness training and connections to
available internships and job opportunities through their local Youth Career Development
Center. Through the administration of the Summer Food Program, CYS will serve CHA
children and families who live in public housing or with a public housing subsidy. Through
servicing meals, CYS will maintain regular contact with CHA families and obtain an avenue for
determining other needed services, as well as increase the potential to enroll CHA youth and
their families in other CYS-sponsored programs.

WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 12,
2008, entitled “RECCOMMENDATION TO NEGOTIATE AND ENTER INTO
AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT WITH THE CHICAGO

(Item C5)
The resolution for Item C5 approves a contract extension with Stateway Associates, LLC to
provide community and supportive services to the revitalized Stateway Gardens community.
The Contract’s primary focus has been to assist CHA families that choose to return to the
revitalized Stateway Gardens mixed-income community. Services were specifically designed to
address site specific criteria and the barriers a family may face in meeting the screening criteria.
The provision of services at Park Boulevard, contemplated as part of the competitive
procurement of the Developer, is required by the Master Development Agreement governing this
development. Stateway Associates has met its contract obligations and remains committed to
servicing residents eligible to return to Park Boulevard to continue workforce and supportive
services to families for up to two years following the occupancy of units. The requested
additional funding for the one-year extension will allow Stateway Associates to provide services
10

 to approximately 400 families eligible to screen for 78 units that will become available at Park
Boulevard in 2008 and 2009.
