Quorum Meeting Minutes

With a quorum having been determined to exist, Mike motioned to accept the June,
2014 minutes; Kurt seconded; the minutes were approved unanimously by the
commissioners.

Finances/Administration

Year?to?date Profit Loss statements and Balance Sheet were prepared and
presented. The statements compared the current year with the previous year and
the actual versus the 2014 budget.

Kelly questioned the large amount of money held in reserves. It was explained that the
reserves are temporarily high due to the receipt of the second installment of property
taxes this year. In addition, the reserves are maintained at $500,000 in order to pay for
any extraordinary maintenance expenses.

Kelly also asked for clarification regarding the payroll expenses. The $177,635 payroll
expense pays largely for personnel that staff the parking facility 24/7/365. Currently, the
chamber employs six full?time and three part-time. The $23,111 fringe benefit pays for
mandated expenses such as Social Security, Medicare and unemployment taxes. The
chamber does not offer group health insurance nor pension/401K plans-

Garage Updates

Due to the improvement made by the installation of the 4' 4? glass block window in the
garage bathroom, Garage Manager Gary Harrity, Sr. has requested that a similar
window be installed in the garage office. Kurt motioned to install a similar window in the
garage office; John seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously by the
commissioners.
