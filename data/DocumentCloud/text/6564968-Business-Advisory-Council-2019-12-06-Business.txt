Key points

Ms. Caputo stated that NOACA will begin implementing the Air Quality Public Education
and Outreach Strategy and Communication Plan and staff will provide BAC with updates.
Ms. Benjamin asked how public-private partnerships would work when NOACA
implements the program. Ms. Caputo said staff will identify stakeholders in the private and
public sectors and work on consistent messaging for an idle reduction campaign.
Ms. Mary Samide asked if the recent reduction of rules by the Federal Government
affected local government on air quality.
Mr. Joe MacDonald stated that the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) have
not been rolled back by the current administration and the NOACA region is still
noncompliant on two of six air quality standards since those standards have been
tightened over the past few years.
Ms. Bethany Dentler asked for suggestions on how to get commuting strategies to Medina
County residents. She also asked if Cleveland and Akron could survey employers to find
out if people live and work in the same county.
Mr. Joe MacDonald stated that Gohio Commute is set up for NOACA to reach out to
employers across the region to encourage them to set up subsites on the platform, provide
incentives and create challenges within their own organizations so NOACA can capture a
broader audience and encourage them to learn about carpool, rideshare, and public transit
options. Mr. MacDonald stated that Gohio Commute is much more effective at growing
alternative commuting and covers all metropolitan areas in the state.
Ms. Gallucci informed members that the draft Air Quality Public Education and Outreach
Strategy and Communications Plan were included in the meeting packet. She asked
members to let staff know if they have any questions. She said staff will finalize and
implement the strategy and communications plan after all comments have been submitted
to NOACA.

Phase 4: Project Development Cost and Schedule

Ms. Gallucci stated that information on the above-referenced phases was shared with the
Hyperloop Technical Advisory Committees, but it is not public information. She asked
BAC members to respond in generalities when making comments about the feasibility
study. She noted that staff will present parts of the feasibility study to other stakeholders
and to the general public in the future.
Mr. Kevin Schmotzer asked if NOACA looked at the Hyperloop’s impact on the reduction
of carbon in Northeast Ohio. Ms. Sarli said yes and noted that the Hyperloop will benefit
the public at large. She mentioned that staff looked at the reduction of emissions of auto
and freight off the roads.
Ms. Parham asked if the implementation of the Hyperloop will offset or hurt Hopkins
International Airport’s chances to attract large businesses. Ms. Sarli said the potential for
economic development is a possibility and would enhance people’s travel.
Ms. Benjamin asked if staff knew how much it would cost for people to travel by Hyperloop.
Ms. Sarli said it would probably cost about the same as commuter rail or maybe a little
less.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the objective is to redefine a region into a megaregion so people
will be able to use the Hyperloop every day regardless of their income.
SFY 2021-2024 TIP Projects Recommended for NOACA Funding
Mr. Randy Lane stated that NOACA is in the process of developing its SFY 2021-2024
TIP. He noted that the TIP contains road, bridge, public transit and other transportation
projects scheduled for implementation and includes projects supported by federal funds
through NOACA, ODOT and transit agencies. Mr. Lane mentioned that over 700 potential
projects were identified through a comprehensive planning process. He noted that
approved projects represent the priorities in the LRTP and align with asset management
and performance measures initiatives. Mr. Lane reviewed the following:
•

 Mr. Lane stated that staff will work with the sponsors of approved projects to finalize
scopes, schedules and fiscal constraint for inclusion in the SFY 2021-2024 TIP. He noted
that the final draft TIP will be presented to the Planning and Programming Committee for
review and recommendation on January 17, 2020 and then to the Board for approval on
March 6, 2020.
Mr. Schmotzer asked if there has been any effort to bury or consolidate utility lines with
the streetscape improvements. Mr. Lane stated that some communities choose to bury
the utility lines for scenic reasons and/or coordinate with others to provide an upgraded
facility. Mr. Lane noted that the financing in the TIP will not be used for burying utilities.

TO:

NOACA Business Advisory Council

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

November 27, 2019

RE:

Planning Reviews (PPRs)/ Intergovernmental Review and Consultation (IGRC); 3rd
Quarter State Fiscal Year 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
Attached are PPR summary documents for the proposed project to be presented to the NOACA
Transportation Subcommittee, Planning and Programming Committee and Executive Committee for review
and recommendation.
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federal-aid
transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and federal
requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff; Board, including committees, subcommittees, and
councils: intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC); and public involvement. The end product of
PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPRs is
included on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained
from the public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed
projects are posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the project sponsor will be notified that their project has completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with the project sponsor to address any planning issues identified during PPR.

Attachments: Project Summary

Improvements along Cleveland Avenue in Elyria
Title: Improvements along Cleveland Avenue in Elyria
Sponsor: City of Elyria
Estimated Total Cost: $7,206,891
Proposed Source of Federal Funds: ODOT and NOACA
History/Background: The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) Safety program provides
funds to ODOT and local governments for highway safety treatments or corrective activity
designed to alleviate a safety problem or a potentially hazardous situation. The program is
funded at approximately $100 million annually. Priority is given to those projects with
recommended activities/countermeasures that improve safety at roadway locations with a high
frequency, severity, and rate of crashes.
There are two application cycles per year. Applications must be signed off by the respective
ODOT District Safety Review Team. A safety engineering study must typically accompany the
application unless the application is for preliminary engineering funds to complete the study.
The following project was selected for Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) funding.
The NOACA Board of Directors adopted Resolution 2019-045 approving the projects to be
funded with NOACA administered Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) funding and
STBG set-asides for Transportation Alternatives Projects (TAP) for the state fiscal year (SFY)
2021 – 2024 Transportation Improvement Program. The projects recommended for NOACA
funding included rehabilitation of Cleveland Street, in the City of Elyria.
Proposed Project: LOR CR-658 - 00.00 (CLEVELAND ST): PID No. 110986 - This project
involves rehabilitation along Cleveland Street, from East Bridge Street and Gulf Road to
Hawthorne Street in Elyria (maps and illustrations). The work will include full and partial depth
pavement repair, resurfacing, replacement of curbs, deteriorated culverts and roadway drainage
catch basins, and installation of a roadway underdrain system and conduit. The City will also
implement a road diet, reducing the number of lanes along Cleveland Avenue, from four (4)
through lanes to three (3) lanes (one lane in each direction and a center turn lane).
According to the sponsor, the number of curb cuts will be minimized, access point locations will
be controlled and bicycle lanes will be possible. The project will also include crosswalks, ADA
(Americans with Disabilities) ramps, intersection improvements, new sidewalk, lighting and the
creation of bicycle lanes. The project will also include pavement markings, signage and the
replacement of the traffic signal at the intersection of Olive Street and possibly Gulf Road. Traffic
calming measures will also be considered with the project including curb bump-outs and
contrasting pavements. The project will also involve improvements to the intersection at East
Bridge Street/Cleveland Street with four-leg non-circular roundabout.
The STBG funding is dedicated to the roadway rehabilitation component of the project. The HSIP
funding is dedicated to the road diet and roundabout components of the project.
The project’s estimated total cost is $7,206,891. The estimated cost of preliminary engineering
preliminary development (PEPD) is $352,952. The estimated cost of preliminary engineering
detailed design (PEDD) is $173,842. The estimated cost of right-of-way (RW) is $300,000. The
PEPD, PEDD and RW will be funded with HSIP funds ($744,115) and local funds ($82,679). The
estimated cost of construction (CO) is $5,900,097. The CO will be funded with STBG funds
($3,329,686), HSIP funds ($1,255,885) and local funds ($1,314,527). The estimated cost of
construction engineering (CE) is $480,000. The CE will be locally funded.

5-3

 Staff Comment (Summary):
RECOMMENDATION:
o A transition for the bike lane into the roundabout should be provided, such as wide
sidewalks/shared use paths and signage for bike traffic moving through the roundabout
intersection.
o Consider utilizing ladder-style crosswalk markings across Cleveland Street, in addition to
the contrasting pavement. The visual contrast of a differing pavement type tends to fade
over time, and ladder-style markings would maintain the safety benefit of a high-visibility
crosswalk. (Example: see West 25th Street and Detroit Avenue intersection crosswalks).
o Consider utilizing the center turn lane to create median refuge islands to improve the
safety of crosswalks along the corridor. Median refuge islands are an FHWA Proven
Safety Countermeasure.
o The work summarized in this PPR will occur within two subwatersheds: 1) Black River
Mainstem and Jackson Ditch-East Branch Black River. According to Ohio EPA’s 2018
Integrated Report (IR) Watershed Assessment Unit (WAU) summary, sampling results
along the Black River Mainstems subwatershed indicate that the river is in full and partial
attainment of its Aquatic Life Uses (ALUs). The WAU lists the causes of impairment as
due to nutrients and conductivity modifications associated with municipal point source
discharges. According to the 2018 IR WAUs, the Jackson Ditch-East Branch Black River
subwatershed's sampling sites are in full, partial and nonattainment due to
sedimentation/siltation due to natural causes (Black River falls) NOACA staff
recommends that ODOT maintain stormwater runoff on-site for as long as possible to
keep nonpoint source pollutants from reaching the Black River. NOACA staff also
recommends that ODOT consider incorporating habitat restoration along the river
wherever possible.

Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and discussion only.
BACKGROUND
NOACA's Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Program provides assistance to
communities for integrated transportation and land use planning and projects that strengthen community
livability. TLCI advances the goals of NOACA’s Regional Strategic Plan by:
• Developing transportation projects that provide more travel options
• Promoting reinvestment in underutilized or vacant/abandoned properties
• Supporting economic development
• Ensuring that the benefits of growth and change are available to all members of a community
• Enhancing regional cohesion
• Providing people with safe and reliable transportation choices
The TLCI Program has two components: The TLCI Planning Studies Program and the TLCI Implementation
Program. The TLCI Planning Studies Program assists communities to develop transportation planning studies
that facilitate and promote sustainable development, multimodal transportation, and complete and green
streets. The TLCI Implementation Program provides funding assistance for communities to implement priority
projects identified in TLCI or TLCI-like community developed plans.
This year NOACA is soliciting applications for its Planning Study program that promote regional
benefit. Applications for community-based planning studies that do not provide a larger regional benefit
are not considered to be eligible. Examples of studies that provide a regional benefit and that are being
considered this round by NOACA are:
• Downtown Cleveland Transportation Connectivity Study
• Regional Metroparks Trails/Transportation Connections Study
• Regional Lakefront Transportation Connections Study
An application round was opened for both planning studies and implementation projects on August 29, 2019.
On October 11, 2019, NOACA received 20 requests for funding: 4 planning study requests totaling about
$476,000 in funding and 16 implementation project requests totaling about $4.8 million in funding. NOACA’s

5 - 11

 anticipated three regional planning study projects total $700,000 in funding. All requests are being evaluated
based on the criteria established in the TLCI Policy. Projects requested for both the planning studies and
implementation projects are attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is $2 million in available funding for the 2020 TLCI program. The TLCI program is funded by an annual
set aside from NOACA’s Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) funds during the development of
NOACA’s annual Overall Work Program and biennial Transportation Improvement Program.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Input received from the Council will be incorporated into the application evaluations.

RE:

Membership Expansion of Advisory Councils

ACTION REQUESTED
The following is for information purposes only and no action is being requested at this time.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Governance Committee recently discussed expanding the membership of the Advisory Councils to
include emerging future leaders, which will advance the Charter count from 15 to 18 members.
The purpose of expanding the membership count to the Councils will allow emerging professionals
opportunities to help advance and reinforce NOACA’s mission and agenda. The inclusion of emerging
future leaders is expected to help spark new ideas, approaches and perspectives for growing NOACA’s
stakeholder and community connections, especially targeting specific messages to other future leaders.
The request includes the expansion of three seats for each council. The future leaders will help the Council
build and enhance relationships with various government agencies and subdivisions, the media and public.
NOACA advisory councils, whose make-up of business representatives, the general public and large
groups affected by transportation decisions, could better inform the Committee’s recommendations to the
NOACA Board of Directors and enhance NOACA’s advocacy on infrastructure-related and environmental
issues.
The Councils help monitor community reactions to agency policy, proposals, and progress early in the
planning process, and supplement the public involvement activities that NOACA staff performs. The
Council also assist the External Affairs Committee in developing agency policies for outreach to the
public, business and rural communities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact at this time.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
The External Affairs Committee and NOACA staff will recruit members for each advisory council and
establish meeting schedules.

SAVE: NOACA’s Plan for Transportation Safety

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND
NOACA has recently completed SAVE Plan; NOACA’s Plan for Transportation Safety. The purpose of the
SAVE Plan is to save lives in the NOACA region by identifying actions to reduce the most severe crashes
that too often result in fatalities and serious injuries. The SAVE Plan was developed with the vision that traffic
deaths and injuries can be prevented with appropriate planning, policies and programs, with a long-term goal
of reducing the number of fatalities and serious injuries by 50% by the year 2040. The SAVE Plan provides
direction that will enable NOACA and others to work together to set goals and work toward the vision this
Plan establishes for the region.
Achieving a safer transportation network requires addressing the interaction among the infrastructure,
vehicles and the skill and behavior of travelers. The SAVE Plan incorporates a “6 E’s” approach into the safety
planning process, acknowledging the key roles that engineering, education, enforcement, emergency
response, evaluation, and equity all play in preventing severe crashes and saving lives. After evaluating 10
years of crash data to identify trends, ten emphasis areas associated with fatal and serious injury crashes
were identified.

At the meeting, the presentation will provide more detail about the Plan. The full Plan is available on NOACA’s
website at this link.
In order to influence emphasis areas closely associated with driver behavior, the Ohio Traffic Safety Office
(OTSO) and ODOT work together to develop a rolling calendar of safety campaign messaging to raise public
awareness on specific emphasis areas and initiatives promoted by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA). Typically these campaigns involve messaging pushed out via social media and
press releases, supported with messaging by ODOT on freeway message boards, and often coupled with
increased enforcement. The full OTSO safety calendar may be viewed on their website at this link.
NOACA encourages local public safety partners to be aware of broad safety campaign messaging and to use
campaign materials provided by Traffic Safety Marketing and ODOT (including the “Your Move” campaign) to
educate and encourage road users in their jurisdictions to obey traffic laws and practice safer behaviors.
Continuing support of education and outreach programs is necessary to make and continue positive changes
in behavior of the traveling public. At the national level, significant reductions have been made in reducing
the rate of fatalities for unbelted motorists (reduced from 54% to 48% between 2007 to 2016) and alcoholimpaired driving fatalities (reduced from 32% to 28% between 2007 to 2016); however, both emphasis areas
still comprise a large fraction of all crash fatalities. (Source: Terry Shelton, Associate Administrator, National
Center for Statistics and Analysis, “2016 Fatal Crash Overview” presented on December 14, 2017.)
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
NOACA will develop and support key initiatives in partnership with other organizations to advance safe
projects and to encourage safer traveler behavior. Agencies within the NOACA region are encouraged to
assist the Ohio Traffic Safety Office with maximizing impact of statewide message campaigns by crosspromoting these messages at the community level.
