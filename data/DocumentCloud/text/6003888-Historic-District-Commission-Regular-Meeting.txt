STAFF REPORT 05-08-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6180
ADDRESS: 1127 SEMINOLE STREET
HISTORIC DISTRICT: INDIAN VILLAGE
APPLICANT: JASON FLIGGER, ARCHITECT
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 04-30-2019

PREPARED BY: A. PHILLIPS

PROPOSAL
The building located at 1127 Seminole is a 2½ -story single family residence constructed ca. 1905 in the Tudor
Revival style of architecture. The first floor of the house is clad in variegated red brick with limestone details while
the second floor is clad in stucco and features extensive half-timbering and wood detailing. The complex, multigabled roof is covered in dark gray dimensional asphalt shingles.
An 18’ x 20’ wood-frame garage is located at the far northwest corner of the lot and is accessed off of Agnes Street.
Based on building permit records, the garage was constructed in 1937, and appears to be similar in construction to at
least one other garage on the same block (behind 1039 Seminole, also a half-timbered Tudor Revival house). This
garage is at a prominent, highly visible street-side location immediately adjacent to the West Village Historic District.
It is clad in shiplap wood siding which is painted dark brown. The hipped roof is covered in dark gray asphalt
shingles. There is a single fixed-sash, divided light window with six lights on the south façade and a person-door on
the east façade.
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval for the following scope:
•

Demolition of existing 18’ x 20’ (370 sf) garage located at the rear of the lot including existing concrete slab
and rubble foundation and driveway to allow for proposed new construction (see attached photo).

•

Construction of new 28’ x 24’ (672 sf) garage with associated new concrete slab, foundation, and driveway
located approximately in the same location as the existing garage.

•

Removal of two existing trees located directly adjacent to the existing garage on the northeast façade to allow
for proposed new garage construction (see attached photo).

•

Demolition of existing wood fence running along the alley (west elevation) between the existing garage and
the neighboring garage to allow for proposed new and relocated wood fence (see attached photo).

•

Construction of new wood fence running along the alley (west elevation) between the new garage and the
neighboring garage. New fence to be located 1’ inside the rear lot line and will match the design of the
existing wood fence running along Agnes Street (north elevation).

•

Rebuild the existing wood fence running along Agnes Street (north elevation) with the addition of a new 3’
wide gate located approximately 3’ from the garage edge.

•

Construct new concrete slab and walkway for trash and recycling receptacles located directly adjacent to the
new garage on the east façade.

•

Construct new concrete sidewalk running between the existing house and the proposed new garage and out to
proposed new Agnes Street fence gate.

•

Demolition of existing short chain link fence at alley side (west elevation) of existing garage (see attached
photo).

 •

Install 5-6 new yellow-painted protective bollards centered 6” within lot line to match existing (see attached
photo).

STAFF OBSERVATIONS
In general, the design concept proposed for the garage appear to be influenced by the architectural detailing on the
existing tudor-style house, and does not appear to reference the existing historic-age garage (built thirty-two years
after the original home). The replacement garage is proposed to be constructed of brick up to 7’-3” in height (brick
color to match that of the existing house) with a limestone cap. A flared-eave gable roof with a 10:12 pitch is
proposed to top the garage. The gable ends are proposed to be clad in James Hardie HardiePanel Siding with a stucco
finish including 1 x 6 cedar half-timbering detailing that matches the existing house. The roof is proposed to be
shingled with dimensional asphalt shingles in the color of Charcoal to match the existing house. The siding is
proposed to match the color of the stucco at the existing in the color of yellowish white (C-5). The half-timbering is
proposed to be finished in the color of moderate olive brown (B:13).
A paneled “frieze” detail is proposed between the brick walls and the roof, allowing opportunities for fenestration to
allow natural light into the garage. There are two color schemes proposed for the finish color of the frieze (both
comply with associated Color System D). A man door and small entry canopy is proposed on the east façade, facing
the existing house. The door is proposed to be an insulated steel entry door featuring two vertical panels at the lower
half of the door and a simulated divided light window at the upper half of the door. The details of the canopy match
those of the house and it is clad with the same shingles as the body of the garage. The door will be grayish brown
(B:8). Two overhead garage doors are proposed on the north elevation (facing Agnes Street). The proposed doors are
steel with a woodgrain texture and feature a short traditional panel design. They are proposed to be grayish brown
(B:8). The proposed new driveway will shift slightly to the east from where it exists currently. The drawings note that
the new driveway will be wider than the existing but does not include the dimension of the existing driveway.
The new garage will be significantly larger, in both footprint and mass, than the existing. To accommodate the larger
footprint, two large trees will require removal, potentially impacting the tree canopy along Agnes Street.
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1) Height. Virtually all of the houses in the district have two (2) full stories plus attic or finished third floor within the
roof; these are generally called "two-and-a-half@ story houses. Additions to existing buildings shall be related to the
existing structure; new buildings shall meet the following standards:
(i) The eight (8) adjoining houses on the same face, excluding any houses built since 1930, churches, schools and
commercial structures, shall be used to determine an average height. If eight (8) houses are not available on the
same block face, then one or more houses as close as possible to being directly across the street from the proposed
structure may be used. On Jefferson Avenue, the five (5) existing houses shall be used. The height of the two (2)
adjoining houses shall be added into the total twice, with a divisor of ten (10) (seven (7) on Jefferson Avenue) used
to determine the average. Any new building must have a height of the main roof of at least eighty (80) per cent of
the resulting average; in no case shall a new building be taller than the tallest roof height included in the
computation. In determining the height of existing structures and proposed structures, the highest point of the main
roof shall be used, even where towers, cupolas, or other minor elements may be higher.
(ii) The level of the eaves of a proposed new structure having as much or more significance for compatibility as the
room height, an average eave or cornice height shall be determined by the same process as that described above.
The proposed new structure shall have a height at the eaves, or cornice, of not less than ninety (90) per cent of the
average determined from existing structures, and in no case shall the eaves or cornice of the proposed structure be
lower than the lowest eave or cornice height used in the computation, nor higher than the highest.
(2) Proportion of buildings’ front facades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on age, style, and location in a
specific subdivision. Height being established by the standards above, proportion will be established by permitting no
proposed building or addition to create a front facade wider or narrower than those existing on the same block.
(3) Proportion of openings within the facade. Window openings are virtually always taller than wide; several windows

 are sometimes grouped into a combination wider than tall. Window openings are always subdivided, the most common
window type being guillotine sash, whose area are generally further subdivided by muntins. Facades have
approximately fifteen (15) per cent to thirty-five (35) per cent of their area glazed: Sunporches with a very high
proportion of glass subdivided by mullions and muntins are common.
(4) Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. In buildings derived from classical precedents, voids are usually
arranged in a symmetrical and evenly-spaced manner within the facade. In examples of other styles, especially those of
neo-Tudor and Victorian substyles, voids are arranged with more freedom, but usually in a balanced composition.
(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The spacing of the buildings is generally determined by the setback from
the side lot lines; these tend to be consistent, even though lot width may vary. Because of the existence of several
subdivisions and their related subdivision and deed restrictions, the placement of buildings on lots varies from area to
area in the district. In the case of very wide properties, two (2) conditions exist. A very wide site may have a house
placed centrally upon it, with extensive side yard space; this occurs only with extremely large houses by district
standards. A more typical placement of houses of average size for the district is at the side of the wide site, placed
normally in relation to one of the adjoining houses. The rest of the property is a side yard on the other side of the house,
and the entrance is often oriented toward that side yard.
(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. In those examples of classical inspiration, entrances and porches, if
any, tend to be centered on the front facade. Other examples display more freedom with entrance and porch placement,
with some having the main entrance at the side. Porches, often permanently enclosed sun porches, are often placed at
the side of the building.
(7) Relationship of materials. The majority of the buildings are faced with brick, while many are partially or totally
stucco. There are some stone buildings; clapboard is rare, and almost never the sole material. Wood shingle is
occasionally used as a wall covering, usually at the second floor level, and never as the sole material. Roofing includes
slate, tile, and wooden and asphalt shingles. Stone trim is common. Wood is almost universally used for window frames
and other functional trim, and is used in many examples for all trim. Because of the existence of several subdivisions
and their related deed restrictions, the exterior textures and materials may vary from block to block in the district.
(8) Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that of the low-relief pattern of
mortar joints in brick contrasted to the smooth surface of wood or stone trim. The use of stucco or concrete, with or
without half-timbering, as a contrast to brick surfaces is not unusual. Tile, slate, or wood shingle roofs have particular
textural values where they exist. Asphalt shingles, generally, have little textural interest, even in those types which
purport to imitate some other variety.
(9) Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors (red, yellow, brown, buff) predominate in wall surfaces. Natural stone
colors also exist. Where stucco or concrete exists, it is usually left in its natural state, or painted in a shade of cream.
Roofs are in natural colors (tile and slate colors, wood colors) and asphalt shingles are predominantly within this same
dark color range. Paint colors often relate to style. The classically inspired buildings, particularly neo-Georgian,
generally have woodwork painted white, cream or in the range of those colors, including "putty." Doors and shutters are
frequently dark green or black. Colors known to have been in use on buildings of this type in the eighteenth or early
nineteenth centuries on similar buildings may be considered for suitability. Buildings of Medieval inspiration (notably
neo-Tudor) generally have painted woodwork and window frames of dark brown or cream color. Half-timbering is
almost always stained dark brown. Queen Anne or late Victorian examples may have several paint colors on a single
facade. These tend to be dark in tone and frequently of the "earth tone" family. The original colors of any house, as
determined by professional analysis, are always acceptable for that house, and may provide suggestions for similar
houses.
(10) Relationship of architectural details. These generally relate to style. Neo-Georgian buildings display classic details,
mostly in wood, and sometime in stone. Areas commonly, but not always, treated are porches, shutters, window frames,
cornices, and dormer windows. Details on Mediterranean style or vernacular buildings are often done in stone, brick,
tile, and sometimes in stucco. They include arched windows, door openings, and porches. Buildings of medieval
inspiration tend to have details in the form of carved wood or carved stone ornament on window frames, door frames,
and eaves. Queen Anne or late Victorian style buildings tend to have details in wood, stone, or molded brick commonly
embellishing cornices, window frames and door frames. In general, the various styles are rich in architectural details.
(11) Relationship of roof shapes. Roofs with triangular gables and hip roofs predominate. A few examples of the

 gambrel-type roof exist. Complex arrangements of the gabled and/or hip types, with subsidiary roofs, are not unusual.
Dormers are common. Flat roofs exist primarily on porches and sunrooms, and other minor elements; large hip roofs
sometimes have relatively small flat sections in the center.
(12) Walls of continuity. The major wall of continuity is created by the buildings, with their uniform setbacks within the
blocks. New buildings should contribute to this wall of continuity. Where gaslights are sufficiently numerous, and
where trees in rows have survived in sufficient numbers, minor walls of continuity are created. Fences across side lots
contribute to the major wall of continuity where placed at the front yard setback line.
(13) Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatment. The typical treatment of individual properties
is a flat front lawn area in grass turf, often subdivided by a walk leading to the front entrance, and sometimes with a
walk at the side leading to the rear. Materials for such walks are concrete, brick, or stone, or combinations of those
materials. Some front yards have rectangular raised earthwork terraces upon which the house stands. These unpaved
terraces have sloping embankments or brick and/or stone retaining walls at the change of grade. Foundation plantings,
often of a deciduous character, characteristic of the period 1895-1930, are present virtually without exception. Hedges
between properties, and ornamental front yard fences or hedges are not uncommon. The American elm is virtually
extinct in the district, though once the dominant tree. Replacement trees should be characteristic of the area and period,
though only a disease-resistant American elm would be a practical choice. Plantings of new trees should be directed
toward the restoration of the former straight-line rows of large trees on the front yards and "tree lawns." Straight side
driveways leading from the street to rear garages exist, but alley-facing garages are common, particularly in the
southern portion of the district. Where alley-facing garages are common, the lack of driveways lends a unity to the
succession of front lawns. Driveway materials include concrete, brick and gravel. Side lots are not uncommon in the
district, and a number of these form a part of the original site plan for the residence. Such side lots are usually
landscaped, often fenced at or near the setback line, and very occasionally contain paved areas such as a tennis court.
The street right-of-way of eighty (80) feet combined with a pavement width of between twenty-four (24) and twentynine (29) feet creates wide "tree lawns" or berm areas, which adds to the generous ambience of the urban landscape of
the district. Street pavements are now asphalt; cut stone curbs still exist in portions of the district. Alleys are frequently
paved with brick, particularly where alley facing garages are common. Fencing ranges widely in type; fencing in public
view was generally designed to compliment the style, design material, and date of the residence.
(14) Relationship of open space to structures. Open space in the district occurs in the form of vacant land, a city park,
school yards for the Waldorf and Nichols Schools, and side lots. Where an original or early arrangement of a house and
grounds included and still includes landscaped lots which form part of the landscaping plan for the residence, such
landscaped lots are significant landscape features.
(15) Scale of facades and facade elements. There is a variety in scale from block to block and style to style; most
houses have a large and substantial appearance. The size and complexity of facade elements and details either
accentuate or subdue the scale of the facades. Facade elements have been determined by what is appropriate for the
style. Large wings at the front are atypical, while small wings at the side, usually in the form of sunrooms and
sunporches, are common. Window sash are usually subdivided by muntins, which affects the apparent scale of the
windows within the facades.
(16) Directional expression of front elevations. In general, the expression of direction is neutral.
(17) Rhythm of building setbacks. Because of the existence of various subdivisions and their related subdivision and
deed restrictions, setbacks vary from area to area within the district, though they are consistent within each block or
area. The varying designs of the houses, occasionally with slight setbacks in the facades, cause the houses to relate to
the front setback line in different ways; this creates a slight variation in the setback line. Nevertheless, within each
block or area a wall of continuity is created.
(18) Relationship of lot coverage. Lot coverage ranges from fifty (50) per cent to twelve (12) per cent or less in the case
of homes with large yards. Most homes are in the twenty (20) per cent to thirty (30) per cent range of lot coverage.
(19) Degree of complexity within the facade. The degree of complexity has been determined by what is typical and
appropriate for a given style. The classically inspired buildings usually have simple, rectangular facades with varying
amounts of ornamentation. Other styles, such as "Queen Anne" and those of Medieval inspiration, frequently have
facades complicated by gables, bays, slight setbacks, porches, and occasionally, turrets.

 (20) Orientation, vistas, overviews. While most of the buildings are oriented toward the street, it is not unusual for an
entrance to face the side, especially in the case of a landscaped side lot or corner house.
The street facade in these cases is well coordinated with the rest of the street facades. Garages are frequently oriented
either toward an alley or a side street; almost all garages are detached and at the rear of the lot. In those few cases
where pre-1930 houses have attached garages, they are at the rear and are entered from the side or rear. The doors of
such attached garages are generally not visible from the street.
(21) Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Neo-Georgian and other classically inspired buildings are generally
symmetrical. Other styles, including the neo-Tudor, are generally asymmetrical, but balanced compositions.
(22) General environmental character. The Indian Village District, with its long, straight streets, its hierarchy of walls of
continuity (lamps, trees, buildings) and its large, dignified homes, has an urban, substantial, low density residential
character.

RECOMMENDATION
As an element towards establishing the character of Agnes Street in both Indian Village and West Village, demolition
and replacement of this garage building will have the potential to negatively affect both districts if it does not meet the
Standards. As such, staff was initially concerned with several aspects of the proposal, with respect to the following
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation:
•

3) Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a
false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from
other buildings, shall not be undertaken.

•

9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the historic property and its
environment.

Although the existing garage is of historic age, contributes to an understanding of the development of the property
through the pre-ware era, and is similar to other extant garages in the District, staff does not find it to be a significant
element in establishing the overall historic character of the property with respect to the District’s defined Elements of
Design.
Regarding the proposed replacement, a follow-up discussion with the architect (applicant) regarding the concerns,
staff believes that with a few minor modifications and simplifications to the architectural detailing, the proposed
garage will meet the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards listed above. Staff therefore recommends that the
Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) with the following conditions:
•
•
•
•

Remove half-timbering detail in the gable ends to allow a monolithic, consistent finish of the proposed
HardiePanel Siding with a stucco finish.
Replace flared-eave detail from new garage roof design with a straight eave detail.
Use color scheme “A” as it modernizes the design and helps differentiate the garage as a new element.
Staff is afforded the opportunity to review design changes prior to issuing a COA.

 Motion DRAFT—Demolition/New rear porch and raised terrace construction
I move that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the work proposed in
application #19-6180 because the work as proposed meets the Secretary of Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation Number 9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not
destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from
the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect
the historic integrity of the property and its environment. With the following conditions:
• Remove half-timbering detail in the gable ends to allow a monolithic, consistent finish of the
proposed HardiePanel Siding with a stucco finish.
• Replace flared-eave detail from new garage roof design with a straight eave detail.
• Use color scheme “A” as it modernizes the design and helps differentiate the garage as a new
element.
• Staff is afforded the opportunity to review design changes prior to issuing a COA.

Narrative
The historic Tudor Revival home at 1127 Seminole St. was constructed in 1905. The
home's first floor is constructed of brick and the second floor and roof gables are clad in
stucco with half-timber accents (Sheet 2, Drawing B1). There is also an existing
dilapidated garage on the property that bears no resemblance to the house (Sheet 2,
Drawing B2). The garage, which is located at the rear of the lot and faces Agnes Ave.
(Sheet 1, Drawing A1), appears to have been constructed at a later date. Its
architecture is similar to that of common garages located throughout the City of Detroit.
Problems with the existing garage


Structural Unsoundness and Cost of Repair Relative to Value:
o The garage was constructed on a concrete slab bounded by a shallow (8"
deep) rubble foundation composed of broken concrete slab pieces (Sheet
2, Drawing A1). Because of the inadequate foundation and the presence
of trees that grew up next to the garage (Sheet 2. Drawing A2), the garage
floor has cracked (Sheet 3, Drawing B1) and the building has undergone
uneven settlement (Sheet 3, Drawing B2). In addition, there is
considerable decay at the bottom of the wood garage walls (Sheet 3,
1

 Drawing A1) and this decay has exacerbated the unsoundness of the
structure. Rectifying these problems would require excavation and
construction of a new 42"-deep concrete footing and foundation wall,
repair of decayed wood walls and straightening of the overall structure.
The entire garage would need to be re-sided and a new roof would need
to be installed (Sheet 3, Drawing A2). In addition, a new concrete floor,
outside apron and street approach would be required since these are also
cracked and unsightly. The cost to make all the needed repairs would
exceed the value of this small garage.


Small Size:
o The existing garage is roughly 18' wide x 20' deep. This provides barely
enough room to park two mid-size automobiles with no additional space to
store lawn/garden equipment, seasonal lawn furniture or bicycles. The
proposed new garage would be larger to accommodate these additional
storage needs.



Quality of Original Construction:
o The existing garage is constructed of materials that are not befitting of the
quality of construction in the surrounding neighborhood. The proposed
new garage would be constructed of materials that better relate to the
quality of housing in the Indian Village Historic District (Sheet 8).
 Proposed Elevations: See Sheets 4 and 6
 Proposed Perspective Views: See Sheets 5 and 7

Proposed Solution
We propose a new 672 sq. ft. garage on the site of the existing 370 sq. ft. garage. The
new garage will be constructed of brick and siding with trim accents to complement the
existing historic home. At present, two color schemes are being contemplated.
Scheme "A" is depicted on Sheets 4 and 5 and Scheme "B" is depicted on Sheets 6 and
7. Both color schemes are based upon the Detroit Historic District Commission Color
System D. The size, lot coverage and height of the proposed new garage are all within
the guidelines set forth in the City of Detroit Zoning Ordinance. The larger garage will
accommodate parking for two full-size vehicles and provide storage space for bicycles,
lawn equipment and seasonal yard items. The new garage will improve the utility and
aesthetics of the owners' property and help to maintain the quality of the built
environment in the Indian Village Historic District.
