RE: TAX INCENTIVE REPORT
Please see the attached report in response to your request dated January 11, 2019.

This report addresses the four line items that were laid out in the memorandum. As a note, the
requirements for these projects which received tax incentives to complete their reporting to the
City is not due until the end of March, at which point more up to date data should be available.
Therefore the actual investment and jobs data in this report are the records as of March 2018.

The attached report examines all of the tax incentives approved since 2015, excluding
Neighborhood Enterprise Zone Certificates. Over that time period 93 projects have been
approved for tax incentives. Of those 93 approved, 40 projects have been completed at this
point. Of the 40 projects that have been completed, 30 of them have submitted their up to date
data as of March 2018.

Should any additional questions come up, please do not hesitate to contact me personally.

Best,

Tam/em WW- 3W

As a follow up to the report submitted in summer 2018, and to the request dated January 11, 2019, DEGC
has prepared the following responses. Additionally we have updated and prepared a line by line report of
all of the tax incentive certificates that have been approved since 2015.

1. Updated list of all tax incentives approved since 2014 including the duration and amount of the tax
incentive.

- DEGC has only been estimating the value of tax incentives since the beginning of 2015. So while the
list related to the request is attached, the time period is only from 2015 to 2018.

To summarize:
0 Of the 30 projects that have reported data, the total proposed investment was 
but the total actual investment was 
0 Of the 30 projects that have reported data, the total proposed jobs was 2,081, but the total
actual jobs is 3,403.
0 Additionally, 961 of those 3,403 jobs are Detroiters.

2. Methods used to determine the length of tax incentives.

DEGC does a comprehensive review of every project that requests a tax incentive in the City of
Detroit. The review involves a multitude of steps and an in depth investigation of a project and its
financials.

Initially DEGC examines whether a project is feasible for development and aligns with the City?s policy
goals. There is also consideration that the project has already exhausted all options for traditional
sources of financing, and that this project would not happen but for the requested tax incentive. The
?but for? analysis involves the DEGC team reviewing the project to confirm that the development
costs, post construction rental assumptions, and post construction operating expenses are all in line
with City and Region norms.

Once confirmed that the submitted financial data is reasonably within the established appropriate
range for that specific type of project, DEGC investigates the project under several different
scenarios. These scenarios are initially a review of the financials with and without the tax incentive.
Upon confirmation that the project exhibits a need for the incentive to make it financially feasible, a
sensitivity analysis takes place to determine the required number of years for the incentive. This
sensitivity analysis primarily relates to how the incentive affects the debt service coverage ratio
(DSCR) of a project.

EDD SIREEI SUHE 220i] HI 48228 - 953 2540 65X 3 39533333

The standard debt service coverage ratios that lenders are looking for is in the 1.30 to 1.50 range.
Anything less than that will likely damage a project's potential of receiving lending. DEGC determines
how long it takes for a project?s DSCR to exceed the 1.50 threshold and makes the recommendation
for number of years of incentive based on that. Due to the complex capital stacks of most projects in
Detroit, the full length of the incentive is necessary most of the time.

Additionally, DEGC utilizes a fiscal and economic impact analysis to determine that after accounting
for City costs (providing services to businesses and residents) the project still provides a net benefit to
the City. The model used for this analysis is custom geared for Detroit and was developed in
partnership with Impact Data Source, a regional economic impact consulting firm whose clients
include municipalities and regions across the United States. The model takes in data from a variety of
sources including, but not limited to: Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Census, American Community
Survey, and the City of Detroit Comprehensive Annual Fiscal Report.

Average length of tax incentives.

The average length of incentives awarded since 2015 is 10.8 years.
0 However,
I The percent of incentives reduced in time period in 2015 was 7%
I The percent of incentives reduced in time period in 2016 was 13%
I The percent of incentives reduced in time period in 2017 was 5%
I The percent of incentives reduced in time period in 2018 was 22%

Last year was the year where the largest percentage of projects were reduced in tax incentive time
penod.

Feasibility of reducing the maximum length of tax incentives to 6 to 9 years.
Because each project goes through the same standard underwriting process, reducing the length of

the tax incentives is always considered. However, due to a number of factors most projects do in fact
necessitate the full time period provided by the incentive statutes.
