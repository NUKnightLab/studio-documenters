Summary: The Forest Preserves of Cook County (the “Preserves”) would like to extend the Northwest
Conservation Corps internship program for an additional five (5) years. Total project costs are $232,307.00
annually, of which $155,000.00 is being directly contributed towards work within the Preserves. Funds are
being contributed by the Bobolink Foundation in conjunction with Friends of the Forest Preserves

The Preserves previously entered into an agreement with FOTFP, following FOTFP’s receipt of a grant

The Northwest Conservation
Corps engages four (4) participants, one (1) Crew Manager, and one (1) Assistant Crew Manager in
hands-on ecological restoration activities including chainsaw operation, herbicide application, prescribed
fire, native seed collection, and invasive species removal.
Ecological restoration is conducted in partnership with the Preserves, the Lake County Forest Preserves,
Citizens for Conservation, and Audubon Great Lakes to advance joint goals in support of volunteer
stewardship projects and invasive species management in the region. In the Preserves, the crew works at
Spring Creek Preserve, Poplar Creek Preserve, and Schaumburg Road Grassland in Northwest Cook
County. The crew also works on preserves owned and managed by the Lake County Forest Preserves,
as well as at various Citizen’s for Conservation holdings in the Barrington area.
This project will leverage the volunteer stewardship expertise of the participating partner organizations and
advance the Preserve’s Next Century Conservation Plan goal to mobilize people to heal and nurture the
land.
