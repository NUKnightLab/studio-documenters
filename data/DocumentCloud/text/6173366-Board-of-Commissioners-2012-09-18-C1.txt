GENERAL BACKGROUND

The purpose of these contracts is to have on call quali?ed asbestos and lead-based paint
abatement and mold remediation contractors to perform abatement in dwelling and non-dwelling
units of the CHA, in accordance with current laws and regulations governing such removal and
disposal. The CHA is mandated and has a compliance responsibility to ensure that environmental
hazards are safely abated and pr0perly disposed during any capital maintenance, deveIOpment or
rehabilitation activities in its public housing developments, or as a result of an emergency
response condition. The CHA utilizes professional environmental remediation services to
address these environmental hazards as they occur throughout the CHA. These contracts are
needed to replace the current contracts for these services which will expire on September 30,
2012. Compliance requirements will be based on individual task orders. All three (3) vendors are
essentially 100% self-performing, but expect to hire one (1) Section 3 hire per task.

The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.

The Acting EVP of Development concurs with the recommendation to execute these contracts
for Authority-wide environmental remediation services at various Chicago Housing Authority
locations with Eason Environmental Services, Inc., Enviroplus, Inc. and Tecnica Environmental
Services, Inc. for a total aggregate not-to-exceed amount for the three (3) contracts of
$2,000,000.00.

The CEO/President recommends the approval to execute these three (3) contracts for Authority-
wide environmental remediation services at various Chicago Housing Authority locations.
