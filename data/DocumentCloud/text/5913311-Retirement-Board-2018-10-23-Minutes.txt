MEMORANDUM
October 22, 2018

To: The Honorable Members of the Board of Trustees Laborers?
Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago

From: Robert S. Molaro and Associates

RE: Pre-Veto Session Update

 

The election for Governor, all other Constitutional Of?cers, all Illinois House Members

and 1/3 of the Illinois Senate will be held on Tuesday, November 6, 2018.

The traditional Fall Veto Session is scheduled for November 13-15 and November 27-29
(six 'days total). There is talk of an ?extended? veto session of four days in mid-January,

before the new General Assembly is sworn in, but no ?rm dates yet.

0 As you are aware the Governor used an Amendatory Veto on HB4811. This bill, that
passed both Housed unanimously, does two things. One, it allows the Chicago Municipal
Pension Board to extend the one year examination requirement by a physician for
members on disability and two, provides the needed changes to allow the City Municipal

and Laborers Fund to manage and administer Public Act 100?23 (Funding Law).

Governor Rauner used an amendatory veto to eliminate the ?rst and original part of the
bill, that would allow the extension of a physician?s examination, but it keeps the needed

technical changes intact.

0 Representative Michael Zalewski, the House and Originating Sponsor of HB 4811, has

three choices:

1. File a Motion to Override the Governor?s Veto. This Motion would

require 71 votes in the House and 36 in the Senate.

2. File a Motion to Accept the Governor?s Amendatory Veto. This Motion
requires only a simple majority of 60 and 30 votes to pass and would become law
immediately:

3. Do nothing, then the bill would die.

0 I have discussed all three options with Representative Zalewski.

The Speakers of?ce will be making a determination within a few weeks regarding which

Motion would be allowed to move forward.

Representative Zalewski has been informed that even though the Board would rather see
this Bill become law as passed, we will let him know our full position when he and the
Speaker decide which Motion will be ?led.
