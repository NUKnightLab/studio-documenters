PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property
Assessment Classi?cation 8 that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level
for an industrial facility; and

WHEREAS, the County Board of Commissioners has received and reviewed an
application from Brigham Construction Company/ U-Store-It Midlothian, LLC and
Resolution No. 13-0522-A from the Village of Midlothian for an abandoned industrial
facility located at 3647 W. 147th Street and 14723 S. Lawndale Ave. Midlothian, Illinois
60445, Cook County, Illinois, Cook County District 6, and Permanent Index Number 28-
11-305-016-0000, 28-11-305-017-0000 and 28-11-305-003?000 .

WHEREAS, Cook County has de?ned abandoned property as buildings and other
structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 months, are purchased
for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and

industrial real estate is normally assessed at 25% of its market value,
qualifying industrial real estate eligible for the Class 6b can receive a signi?cant reduction
in the level of assessment from the date that new construction or rehabilitation has been
completed, or in the case of abandoned property from the date of substantial re-occupancy.
Properties receiving Class 6b will be assessed at 10% of the market value for 10 years,
15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year.

WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the de?nition of abandoned
property, the municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special
circumstances justify ?nding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 8; and

WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of more than 24 months and no purchase for
value, by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct ?nancial interest, the County may
determine that special circumstances justify ?nding the property is deemed abandoned; and

WHEREAS, Class 8 requires the validation by the County Board of the period of
qualifying abandonment in cases where the facility has been abandoned for more than 24
consecutive months with no purchase for value; and

WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that the building
was abandoned for26 months at the time of application, and that special circumstances are
present; and

WHEREAS, the applicant estimates that the re-occupancy will create 2 new full-time jobs
and 3 part-time jobs; and create 15 or more construction jobs; and

WHEREAS, the Village of Midlothian states the Class 8 is necessary for development to
occur and that special circumstances exist which include the subject property has been
vacant for more than 24 months there has been no purchase for value; and that the subject
property is in need of substantial rehabilitation; and
