I Case No. 18 P13 295 l. President Foreman reported that the Superintendent ?led charges

I Request for Review Nos. 19 RR 19-! 1. Board Member O?Malley reported that pursuant
to Section 2-78-130 of the Municipal Code of Chicago, he considered one matter on
which the Chief Administrator of the Civilian Of?ce of Police Accountability and the
Superintendent of Police did not agree regarding the discipline of three of?cers. The
Chief Administrator recommended that Sergeant Tracy Walczak and Police Of?cer
Danielle erlito be discharged from the Chicago Police Department for failing to report
and making false statements about an altercation they witnessed involving fellow off-
duty of?cers; the Superintendent did not agree that the evidence was suf?cient to prove
they made false statements and recommended that they be suspended for 45 days. In
addition, the Chief Administrator recommended a 45-day suspension for Detective Jose
Cardo for failing to conduct a thorough investigation; the Superintendent recommended a
20-day suspension. Board Member O?Malley reported that, in his opinion, the
Superintendent did not meet the burden of overcoming the Chief Administrator?s
recommendations for discipline for these three of?cers. He noted that a copy of the
written opinion will be posted on the Board?s website as required by the Municipal Code.
