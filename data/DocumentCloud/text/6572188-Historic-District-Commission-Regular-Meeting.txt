STAFF REPORT: 12-11-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6578
ADDRESS: 19650 STRATFORD
HISTORIC DISTRICT: SHERWOOD FOREST
APPLICANT: BRENT MAHAFFEY, RENEWAL BY ANDERSON
DATE OF COMPLETE APPLICATION: 12/3/2019

PREPARED BY: A. DYE

SCOPE: PARTIAL WINDOW REPLACEMENT ON SIDE AND REAR ELEVATIONS
EXISTING CONDITIONS
This contemporary styled house was constructed in 1955. The strong horizontal lines, created through the
use of roman brick and stone, a continuous lintel spanning most of the second floor, the deep overhanging
porch roof (which returns to run along part of the side elevation) and multiple mulled window
openings combine to create an appearance of a post-war Prairie-style house.
The existing windows on the front of the house are casements, as are the window openings on the each side
of the house nearest the front elevation (first and second story). Sliding windows fill the remaining window
openings on the side elevations (near the rear of the house) and the rear elevation. Aluminum storm
windows cover the sliding windows and mask their operation and the dark brown trim.
According to the property owner and Renewal by Anderson, two windows were removed and replaced with
Renewal by Anderson casement windows approximately 20 years ago. Sherwood Forest was designated a
local historic district in 2002. The replacement windows are located on the sides of the house: one on the
north side, first floor, directly in front of the fireplace; the other on the south side, second floor, above the
side entry.

 PROPOSAL
The applicant contacted Building Hugger and H & R Window Repair for repair quotes. Building Hugger
declined to submit a proposal due to the younger age of the house (post-1950). H & R Window Repair did
inspect the existing windows and determined the extent of the deterioration is such that repairs would
likely exceed replacement cost. A copy of each company’s communications is included with the staff
report.
The applicant would like to replace four window openings located on the sides and rear of the house.
Side/North Elevation: Second floor, immediately adjacent rear-placed chimney, one double-slider
Rear/East Elevation: Second floor, large double-slider
Second floor, large, four-unit slider
Side/South Elevation: Second floor, near rear elevation, one double-slider
The double-sliders are to be replaced with sliding windows to match the existing operation and overall
window dimensions. The four-unit window is to be replaced with a three-window slider (wide center fixed
unit, with operable narrow side windows.
Replacement windows are Renewal by Anderson, Fibrex, operation, Low-E4 (clear) glass. Frames to be
cocoa brown, which matches B:8, Grayish Brown, on Color System E.
STAFF OBSERVATIONS AND RESEARCH
• The three double-sliders will be replaced to match the existing function.
• The four unit will be replaced with a three-part sliding window, which will break the rhythm
established by the remaining of window openings.
• The neighboring properties are close to the applicant’s property, reducing the visibility of the side
windows (and two are on the rear elevation).
• The proposed color matches one of the colors within Color System E, which is used for Prairiestyle architecture and looks to be a close match to the color of the remaining casement and slider
windows.
• The new windows will not have storm windows.

 •

The removal of the silver aluminum storm windows would be a positive change.

ISSUES
The size of the new frames will not match the existing frames. As Renewal by Anderson is specific to the
Fibrex material, there are no other options within the replacement system that could offer a thinner frame.

Window below is an example of an original sliding window (location: rear of
house and not to be replaced at this time.)
Window on the right is one of the two Renewal by Anderson casement
windows installed 20 years ago.
Renewal by Anderson also provided elevation comparisons within their
application packet.

RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion the removal of the four original sliding windows and installation of Renewal by
Anderson Fibrex replacement sliding windows will alter features that characterize the property. The frame
width for the proposed windows is too great and will not only reduce the glass size within each window,
the thick frames will create a heavier appearance for each window opening.
Therefore staff recommends the Commission deny a COA for the four window replacements as they do not
meet the following Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation, especially:
#2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic
materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided
#6) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. When the severity of
deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in
design, color, texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of
missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.

 SUMMARY
AN ORDINANCE to amend Chapter 25, Article II, of the 1984 Detroit City Code by adding Section
25-2-141 to establish the Sherwood Forest Historic District, to establish conservation as the design treatment level
for the district, and to define the elements of design for the district.
(D)
The design treatment level of the Sherwood Forest Historic District shall be conservation as provided
for in section 25-2-2(4) of this code.
(E)
The defined elements of design, as provided for in section 25-2-2 of this code, shall be as follows:
(1)
Height. The height of the majority of the residential structures full stories to two and one half (2½) stories
tall, and have at least eighteen (18) feet of studding. These standards shall be met by new single-family
residences and by two-family residences which are permitted only on Seven Mile Road. A few houses of
one (1) and one and one-half (12) stories exist. Additions to existing buildings shall be related to the
existing structure. Garages range from one (1) to two (2) stories.
(2)
Proportion of buildings front facades. The typical front facades of residential buildings in the Sherwood
Forest Historic District are predominantly wider than tall to their eaves.
(3)
Proportion of openings within the facades. Proportion of openings varies greatly according to the style of
the building. Typical openings are taller than wide, but individual windows are often grouped together to fill
a single opening which is wider than tall. Windows are usually subdivided; buildings designed in English
Revival styles frequently display leaded glass in casement windows and transoms. In buildings derived from
classical precedents, double-hung sash windows are further subdivided by muntins. A variety of arched
openings and bay windows exist throughout the district Modernistic style residential buildings have
openings with a variety of proportional relationships, sometimes extending around the corners. In general,
openings amount to between twenty percent (20%) and thirty-five percent (35%) of the front facades.
(4)
Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. In buildings derived from classical precedents, voids are usually
arranged in a symmetrical and evenly-spaced manner within the facades. In examples of other styles,
particularly those of English Revival sub-styles, voids are arranged with more freedom, but usually result in
balanced compositions. Windows are arranged by floor in asymmetrical arrangements in modernistic style
houses.
(5)
Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The spacing of the buildings is generally determined by the lot
sizes and setbacks from side lot lines. There is a general regularity in the widths of subdivision lots from
one block to another, with the exception of those in the Sherwood Forest manor subdivision where some lot
sizes are larger and single houses sometimes occupy more than one lot. Generally, all residences or part
thereof, including cornices, balconies, pergolas or porches, are not permitted nearer than five (5) feet to the
side lot line.
(6)
Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Entrance and porch types relate to the style of the building.
Entrances and porches on the English revival buildings exhibit freedom of placement and orientation, while
on buildings of classical inspiration they are centered on the front facade. Some houses have entrances that
recede while others have porches, steps and/or entrances that project. A common entry arrangement on
vernacular English Revival houses is that of a slightly projecting, steeply gabled vestibule or gabled wall
punctured with an arched opening. Side and rear secondary entrances and porches and enclosed sunrooms
are common. A rhythm of entrances and porches is not discerned due to the variety of house designs and the
winding street plan.
(7)
Relationship of materials. The majority of houses are faced with pressed, wire cut or glazed brick, often
combined with wood, stone and/or stucco. Stone trim is common, and wood is almost universally used for
window frames, half-timbering and other functional trim. Windows are commonly either of the metal
casement or wooden sash variety. Glass block exists as an original material in some window openings of
modern buildings. Original metal balconets, balustrades and light fixtures exist on some properties. Roofs
on the majority of the buildings in the Sherwood Forest historic district are either slate or slate-like asphalt

 (8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

shingles.
Relationship of textures. The major textural relationship is that of brick laid in mortar, often juxtaposed with
wood or smooth or rough-faced stucco and/or stone elements and trim. Textured brick and brick laid in
patterns creates considerable interest, as does half-timbering, leaded and subdivided windows, and wood
shingled or horizontal sided elements. Slate roofs have particular textural values where they exist. Asphalt
shingles generally have little textural interest, even in those types which purport to imitate natural materials.
Garages correspond in materials to the main residential dwelling.
Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors -- such as red, yellow, brown, or buff -- predominate in wall
surfaces. When brick is painted, it is in white or shades of cream. Natural stone colors also predominate;
where stucco or concrete exists, it usually remains in its natural state, or is painted in a shade of cream.
Roofs are in natural slate colors, and asphalt shingles are predominantly within this same dark color range.
Paint colors often relate to style. The buildings derived from classical precedents, particularly those of
classical styles, generally have woodwork painted the white or cream range. English Revival style buildings
generally have painted wood trim and window frames of dark brown, gray, buff or shades of cream,
depending on the main body color. Half timbering is most frequently stained or painted dark brown.
Stained glass, where it exists as decoration visible on the front facade, contributes to the artistic interest of
the building. The original colors of any building, as determined by professional analysis, are always
acceptable for a house, and may provide guidance for similar houses. Colors used on garages should relate
to the colors of the main dwelling.
Relationship of architectural details. The architectural elements and details of each structure generally relate
to its style. Residential buildings derived from characteristic elements and details displayed on vernacular
English revival-influenced buildings include arched windows and door openings, steeply pitched gables,
towers, and sometimes half-timbering. Tall, clustered chimney stacks and decorative chimney pots are
features of the district. Classical styles display modest detail, mostly in wood. Porches, shutters, window
frames, cornices, and dormer windows are commonly, although not always, treated. Modern style buildings
are generally characterized by smooth, unadorned wall surfaces, horizontal bands of windows, and curved
corners. A few cape cod style buildings and ranches are located in the northeastern section of the Sherwood
Forest Manor subdivision. In general, the district is rich in early to mid-twentieth century architectural
styles. Garages correspond in architecture to the main residential dwelling.
Relationship of roof shapes. A variety of roof shapes exist, relating to the style of the buildings. Common
on English Revival buildings are steeply sloped pitched or hipped roofs with complex arrangements of
secondary roof shapes, including steeply sloped gables, clipped gables, and shed roofs. These roofs are
commonly interrupted by gabled, shed and multi-sided dormers and substantial chimneys which are
sometimes clustered. Classically inspired buildings display pitched or hipped roofs with less slope, with or
without dormers. Roofs of houses built later in the period of development of the district, such as those of
modern inspiration, tend to have significantly lower slopes, with the exception of cape cod style houses in
the northeastern section of the district which display steeply pitched roofs with dormers. Flat roofs are not
typical except on porches, sunrooms, and other small extensions of a primary building with a pitched roof;
flat roofs as the main roof of a primary building shall not be permitted.
Walls of continuity. Where common setbacks of houses on relatively straight stretches of residential streets
exist, strong walls of continuity are created. This is augmented by tall, fluted light standards and mature
trees on the tree lawns. Where streets curve and the procession of houses is less visible, landscape features in
the public right-of-way create a sense of continuity.
Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The typical treatment of individual
properties is a that of a dwelling erected on a grade of approximately fifteen (15) to twenty (20) inches above
the inner grade line of the public sidewalk. The front lawn area is generally covered with grass turf,
subdivided by a straight or curving concrete, stone or brick walk leading to the front entrance and a single
width side driveway leading to a garage, which is most often located at the rear of the lot but sometimes
attached to the rear, side or, less frequently, the front of the main dwelling. On corner lots, garages are
located on the side streets and the width of the driveway corresponds to the width of the garage. A single

 (14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

storage building, including garden and tool sheds, shall be permitted provided that it is placed at the rear of
the property, is harmonious in color and design to the contiguous property, does not exceed six (6) feet by
ten (10) feet in length and width, and six (6) feet in height. Foundation plantings, often of a deciduous nature
and characteristic of the period between 1920 and 1960, are present virtually without exception. Large trees
of many varieties shield some houses from view. There is variety in the landscape treatment of individual
properties. Generally, boundary lines between lots forward of the building line are not marked with fences
of any kind, but may have hedges no greater than two (2) feet in height. Hedges and fences of up to four (4)
feet in height generally extend along boundary lines beyond the building line. On lots abutting the alley
behind Warrington Drive and Livernois Avenue, a tight board fence or masonry wall of a uniform height of
five (5) feet must be constructed on rear lot lines. The placement of trees on the tree lawn between the
concrete public sidewalk and masonry curb varies from block to block or street to street. Replacement trees
should be characteristic of the area and period. If American elm is planted, it should be disease resistant.
Original street lighting throughout the district is of the tall fluted standard with crane neck pendant variety.
Relationship of open space to structures. The Sherwood Forest historic district has, as its main open space,
the triangularly shaped Sherwood Forest Park, bounded by Warrington Drive, Saint Martins Road and
Canterbury Road. That park, as well as other triangular lots created between the intersection of winding
streets, are planted with grass and trees. All houses have ample rear yards as well as front yards. Where
vacant lots exist between residences, their landscaping tends to be continuous with the adjacent lots or
forested with mature trees.
Scale of facades and facade elements. The Sherwood Forest Historic District comprises a residential
neighborhood of moderate to large scaled dwellings. Elements and details within are appropriately scaled,
having been determined by the style, size and complexity of the individual buildings. Window sash are
usually subdivided by muntins and casement windows are leaded, affecting the apparent scale of the
windows within the facades.
Directional expression of front elevations. The houses in the Sherwood Forest Historic District are
horizontal in directional expression. Large architectural elements within facades are frequently vertical in
directional
Expression, such as multi-storied projecting gabled sections.
Rhythm of building setbacks. Front yard setbacks are generally consistent on each residential street in the
Sherwood Forest Historic District, although porch, entrance and window projections and irregular massing
result in the appearance of variety. Where lots are combined or irregularly shaped at corners, the rhythm is
sometimes irregular.
Relationship of lot coverages. The lot coverage for the single- and two-family residences ranges generally
from twenty-five percent (25%) to thirty-five percent (35%), including the either the freestanding or attached
garage. Where lots are combined, the percentage of lot coverage may be less.
Degree of complexity within the facades. The degree of complexity has been determined by what is typical
and appropriate for a given style. Overall, there is a higher degree of complexity in the English Revival style
buildings, where their facades are frequently complicated by gables, bays, irregularly placed openings and
entrances, and irregular massing, than those of other styles. The facades of classically inspired buildings and
modernistic buildings are straightforward in their arrangement of elements and details.
Orientation, vistas, overviews. The orientation of buildings is largely determined by the winding streets
created by the subdivision plans. All but a few buildings in the district are oriented towards the street;
buildings situated on corner lots sometimes face the side street or, when the corner lot is curved, the
intersection of the streets. The primary vistas are created by the winding streets. Sherwood Forest Manor
subdivision has a different character because of its later development and the elliptical shape of its plan.
While the streets through Sherwood Forest extend into the green acres subdivision on the north, they do not
extend into the palmer woods subdivision on the east.
Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Front facades of buildings range from completely symmetrical to
asymmetrical but balanced compositions. English revival style buildings are irregular in layout and

 (22)

asymmetrical in appearance. The classically inspired buildings are generally symmetrical; the modernistic
buildings are not symmetrical but result in highly ordered compositions.
General environmental character. The Sherwood Forest historic district is a fully-developed residential area
of well-maintained, substantial single-family residences of the second quarter of the twentieth century
complemented with fine examples of compatible houses from the 1950s and 1960s. On seven mile road, its
southern boundary, are several duplexes; the east side of Livernois Avenue, outside the district=s boundaries
to the west, is an intact commercial thoroughfare of 1940's vintage. With the residential subdivisions of
palmer woods to the east and green acres to north, Sherwood Forest is a part of a solid, well-maintained and
handsome urban residential community.

Janet,
  In looking at the photos sent it appears as though the window frames are out of
square. Which is 
why air is getting around the sash, also separation at the interior corners of main
frame indicates the frame is under pressure and twisting. This is most commonly
caused by interior structure frame lowering (settlement) and exterior wall surface is
not, house is trying to slide window down behind sill causing a "crowning" problem.
   Unfortunately the cost of repairs would most likely exceed replacement cost and
you would still have same old window framing.
Sorry H&R Window Repair cannot help.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.
Thank you for the opportunity in letting H&R Window Repair be of service to you!

Reinventing the window

Innovation has been a hallmark of Andersen Corporation
since its founding in 19113. From implementing ?mass
production? techniques in 19114 {nine years before Henry
Ford}, to producing the ?rst completely assembled
window unit in the industry {1926}, to becoming the
world?s largest specialized window ?'ame factory in 1929,
our guiding principle has always been to ?make a product
that is different and Each step of the way we have
incorporated the latest technologies, ?ne precision, and

high standards in our quest to be better.

FIBREXE MATERIAL:

A BETTER ALTERNATIVE, A BETTER WINDDW

Introducing Fibrex'i material

lUne of our most innovative ideas is Fibre}: material.

This revolutionary composite combines the strength

and stability of wood with the low-maintenance features
of vinyl. In fact, you might say it?s an evolutionary
product??ndersen scientists developed the ?rst hollow
vinyl window in the 1.1.5. in 1959, and engineered
composite window materials in the 1915?s and 197?s. In
1992, ?ndersen perfected composite window technology,
and patented Fibres: material. Today, Fibre}: material is the

perfect choice for your new replacement windows.

Fibrex? Material  Either Materials

Because Fibref-tEl material is strong, we can make our sash and frames narrower.
Narrower frames mean more glass, more view.

Stren 

 

Fibres material has superior thermal insulating properties. Combined with
Andersena?High?Performance" Low?Eli'?glass, this helps your home stay
warmer in winter and cooler in summer. You can save money on your energy
bills. Your home feels more comfortable.

Insulation

 

Low Fibres material never needs scraping or painting. It won't rot. decay or mold!"

Maintenance

 

Renewal byAndersen replacement windows preserve the architectural beauty
of your home. Frame and sash design reflect the shape and lines ofyour
original windows.

Beauty

The unique extruded Fibre: material can be made into any kind of window?
including cunred specialty windows.

 

Environmental 40% of the raw material by weight used to make Fibresr material is clean,

Responsibility reclaimed wood fiber. Reclaimed materials in the manufacturing process can
also be reground and reused. Renewal byl'itndersenlEJI windows meet Green
Seal's science?based environmental certification standards as well as being
qualified for meeting strict energy efficiency criteria set by the
Department of Energy.

 

 

Warranty Awindow is notjust glass and some framing material. It's a precise
combination of glass, frame and quality installation.We back it all with

a Limited Warranty*that is one ofthe best in the business.

1Il'inyl frames are known to have a higher ef-tpansionlr
contraction rate and can bow, breaking the glass seal.

Aluminum window frames conduct heat and cold.
Heat leaks out of your house in the winter and into
your house in the summer.

Fiberglass frames are painted and may need
regular maintenance.

Most replacement windows have square profiles that
may look artificial in your home. 1Il'inyl frame material is
often thicker, reducing glass area.

Fiberglass can only be made into straight lineals.

Andersen windows are the only windows with Green
Seal certification.

Fiberglass is a thermoset material and cannot be
reformed into new profiles.

More than half of all remodeling firms have been in
business less than four years.? Installation is rarely
covered in the written warranty.

Fibrex® Material:

a better alternative, a better window

Reinventing the window

Introducing Fibrex® material

Innovation has been a hallmark of Andersen Corporation
since its founding in 1903. From implementing “mass
production” techniques in 1904 (nine years before Henry
Ford), to producing the first completely assembled
window unit in the industry (1926), to becoming the
world’s largest specialized window frame factory in 1929,
our guiding principle has always been to “make a product
that is different and better.” Each step of the way we have
incorporated the latest technologies, fine precision, and
high standards in our quest to be better.

One of our most innovative ideas is Fibrex material.
This revolutionary composite combines the strength
and stability of wood with the low-maintenance features
of vinyl. In fact, you might say it’s an evolutionary
product—Andersen scientists developed the first hollow
vinyl window in the U.S. in 1959, and engineered
composite window materials in the 1960s and 1970s. In
1992, Andersen perfected composite window technology,
and patented Fibrex material. Today, Fibrex material is the
perfect choice for your new replacement windows.

Fibrex® Material

Other Materials

Strength

Because Fibrex® material is strong, we can make our sash and frames narrower.
Narrower frames mean more glass, more view.

Vinyl frames are known to have a higher expansion/
contraction rate and can bow, breaking the glass seal.

Insulation

Fibrex material has superior thermal insulating properties. Combined with
Andersen® High-Performance™ Low-E4® glass, this helps your home stay
warmer in winter and cooler in summer. You can save money on your energy
bills. Your home feels more comfortable.

Aluminum window frames conduct heat and cold.
Heat leaks out of your house in the winter and into
your house in the summer.

Low
Maintenance

Fibrex material never needs scraping or painting. It won’t rot, decay or mold.*

Fiberglass frames are painted and may need
regular maintenance.

Beauty

Renewal by Andersen replacement windows preserve the architectural beauty
of your home. Frame and sash design reflect the shape and lines of your
original windows.

Most replacement windows have square profiles that
may look artificial in your home. Vinyl frame material is
often thicker, reducing glass area.

The unique extruded Fibrex material can be made into any kind of window–
including curved specialty windows.

Fiberglass can only be made into straight lineals.

Environmental 40% of the raw material by weight used to make Fibrex material is clean,
Responsibility reclaimed wood fiber. Reclaimed materials in the manufacturing process can

also be reground and reused. Renewal by Andersen® windows meet Green
Seal's science-based environmental certification standards as well as being
ENERGY STAR® qualified for meeting strict energy efficiency criteria set by the
U.S. Department of Energy.

Fiberglass is a thermoset material and cannot be
reformed into new profiles.

A window is not just glass and some framing material. It’s a precise
combination of glass, frame and quality installation. We back it all with
a 20/2/10 Limited Warranty* that is one of the best in the business.

More than half of all remodeling firms have been in
business less than four years.** Installation is rarely
covered in the written warranty.

 Fibrex® Material: A Better Material, A Better Performance

Over

of innovation and excellence

Andersen Corporation was founded in 1903 and soon revolutionized the way windows
were installed by pre-cutting materials for carpenters to assemble on the building site.
Over the years, Andersen proudly introduced other industry milestones, including new technologies and
methods that made windows and doors last longer, look better, and function as intended for many years.
By the 1950s, Andersen’s research and development efforts were laying the groundwork for Fibrex® material and
a brand new way to provide homeowners with beautiful, high quality, and efficient replacement windows.

Andersen is the first company to develop a
hollow vinyl window in the U.S. but decides it
doesn’t have enough structural integrity. But
the low maintenance feature of the vinyl had
possibilities.

Andersen creates the “clad-wood” window
and door category (still the standard of
excellence in stock-size new construction).
Andersen Research & Development invents a
way to weld the corners together for airtight,
watertight performance.

its manufacturing process as a potential
material resource. The company develops
window sash made from reclaimed wood
fibers and thermoplastic polymers. The new
material performs and weathers well. But
manufacturing methods are inefficient until
developments are made in the next decade.

Andersen® products and patents have
revolutionized the window and door industry
for over 100 years, changing the home
construction industry, how homes are designed,
and even how we live in our homes.
We are constantly testing and introducing new
materials. Heat and cold chambers mimic
extreme temperature conditions. Simulating
devices produce extremes of dry and wet to test
all new products. Windows, hardware, finishes
and packaging materials all undergo testing.

“Renewal by Andersen benefits from the
rich tradition of the Andersen® brand.
Customers know that they can trust us,
that they will be treated well and that
we stand behind our products.”

prove stronger than traditional raw wood.

With Fibrex material, a special polymer formulation

The “material” difference

Pine

Fibrex material is twice as stable and rigid as vinyl.
Wood’s average stiffness is higher, but it’s less predictable
than Fibrex® material because of wood’s natural variations
like grain, knots and moisture content. Fibrex material is
strong so frames can be made narrower than with other
framing materials. Narrower frames mean more glass,
more view. Fibrex material can be made into any style of
window—including curved specialty windows—and in
colors to complement every home.
