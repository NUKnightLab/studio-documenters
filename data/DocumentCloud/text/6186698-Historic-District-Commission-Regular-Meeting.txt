STAFF REPORT 7-10-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6321
ADDRESS: 110 SPROAT
HISTORIC DISTRICT: EDDYSTONE HOTEL
APPLICANT: BRIAN REBAIN
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 7/8/2019

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

PROPOSAL
As per the Detroit Historic Designation Advisory Board:
The Eddystone Hotel is a thirteen story steel frame, brick, limestone, and terra-cotta-clad building
located at the northwest corner of Park Avenue and Sproat Street, six blocks north of Grand Circus
Park. The hotel’s overall footprint is rectangular, measuring sixty-two feet on Park and one hundred
and five feet on Sproat. The Eddystone is thirteen stories in height. The building’s Italian
Renaissance-inspired exterior treatment is modeled after urban palazzos, with a two-story base
finished in large “blocks” of limestone and displaying tall arched openings, a more plain central
section above the base, and a highly finished top or attic crowned by an elaborate entablature and
cornice.
Above the limestone-clad base, the primary façade material on the street-facing east and south
elevations is yellow brick. The yellow brick extends a few feet around the corners onto both the
north and west elevations. The remainder of the north and west elevations are finished in common
buff-colored brick. The east and south elevations, and the first bay of the west elevation, are similar
in composition with smooth limestone ashlar on the first and second floors forming the building’s
base and decorative terra cotta window treatments on the third, fourth and twelfth floors. A
denticulated cornice serving as a belt course separates the second and third floors. The building is
capped with a decorative terra cotta cornice. The windows from the second to the thirteenth floor
are one/one double-hung wood-frame windows.
The Eddystone exhibits the vast expanse of plain wall surfaces of a tall building relieved with
decorative Italian Renaissance-inspired detailing. The south elevation facing Sproat is symmetrical
and seven bays in width, the five center bays each containing paired windows and the end bays
each a single window in the third to thirteenth stories. The windows in the third story are framed
by terra-cotta trim – balustraded balconets below the window bays, window surrounds, and
spandrel panels above the window bays, each displaying an arch form containing a large rondel
above each window, that are topped with a dentiled cornice beneath the fourth-story windows. The
square-head windows of the fourth floor are outlined in terra cotta with raised outer edges. Those
in the central-height part of the façade between the fifth and eleventh floors are set into the brick
façade with no trim save plain slab limestone sills. The windows of the twelfth floor display terracotta surrounds echoing the design of those in the third story with balustraded balconets but of more
simple design, with rosettes in the frieze in place of the arches. A terra-cotta beltcourse separates
the eleventh and twelfth floors. The building is crowned with a tall decorative terra-cotta
entablature and cornice, the entablature with a chevron-like band below a projecting arcade with
detailed corbels supporting the bases of the arches, and a projecting cornice with a decorative
fringe. This decorative detailing continues along the east elevation and the first bay of the west
elevation.
The hotel entrance is located in the south elevation facing Sproat Street. The inner bays of the
smooth ashlar first floor contain five large arched openings with the lobby entrance doorway in the

 center arch flanked by two storefront window openings.. All first and second-floor windows have
been boarded up. The simple entrance retains remnants of an aluminum canopy.
The east elevation is composed of five bays, from the second to the thirteenth floors. The center
three bays of the first floor contain arched windows and the end bays contain storefront entrances
openings.
The north elevation is plain with no decorative detailing and with one casement stairway window
opening per floor. The west elevation contains five bays, four containing sets of paired window
openings. The words HOTEL EDDYSTONE are painted at the top of the north and west elevations.
The flat roof is covered in asphalt and has a small one-story brick penthouse, with industrial
windows, that houses the elevator machinery.

A field visit to the site revealed that all openings at the first story, to include door openings and
storefront windows, have been enclosed with masonry. Also, all window sash is missing with the
exception of a few remaining steel window sash at the rooftop penthouse.
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking to undertake a complete rehabilitation of the
building so that it might serve as a hotel. Specific exterior work items associated with the
building’s rehabilitation include the following, as per the attached submission:
Masonry Restoration
• The brick, terra cotta, and limestone will all be cleaned and inspected for damage. The
cleaning will be done according to the Secretary of Interior Standards, and NPS Technical
Preservation Briefs 1, 2 & 6. Despite using standard detergent wash, there is stubborn
graffiti staining that remains on the building. It is proposed that this staining be treated with
Quintek Corporation’s Rotec Vortex cleaning system, which creates a gentle swirling
vortex utilizing low volumes of water, low air pressure, and fine inert granulate. A certified
Rotec Vortex contractor will be performing the cleaning. Note that the National Park
Service has a team who uses this product to clean their monuments throughout the country.
A mockup will be done to find the right balance of cleaning without damaging the stone.
• All damaged, deteriorating, or spalling masonry units are to be removed and replaced with
new material to match original units. Missing units are to be replaced to match the
remaining adjacent materials and new brick, terra cotta, and limestone will match the
existing as closely as possible in size, color, texture, and compressive strength. Any
salvaged brick, terra cotta, and limestone will be reused where replacement is needed
before new materials are used.
• The glazed terra cotta detailing will be inspected for damage, cleaned, and repaired where
necessary. It is currently proposed that all missing terra cotta will be replaced with new
terra cotta units to match existing/historic. However, GFPR is also proposed as a bid
alternate for the replacement of the deteriorated glazed terracotta. Should GFRP be
chosen as the replacement material, final details and shop drawings will be provided to
HDC for approval prior to installation.
Exterior Storefront Systems and Doors
• At first floor, install new aluminum storefront windows and doors (based upon historic
photos) as per the attached (cutsheets and finish color not available/provided)

 Windows
• All window openings on the four building facades will have all remaining frame remnants
removed and abated. Masonry openings shall be stabilized, rebuilt if needed, and prepped
for new window units. New historic replica, one-over-one, single hung window units shall
be installed to match the limited historic evidence we have of those windows. The windows
shall utilize a decorative aluminum panning system, custom extruded to match the historic
brick mold profile. Aluminum sashes will have historic replica glazing profiles. Aluminum
frames shall be narrow profile units to replicate typical wood window frames from the era.
Frames will be set back in the masonry opening to match historic configuration.
•

Two additional columns of windows will be added to the north façade: punched openings
on floors 12-13 will be made on the north façade in the first bay and the last bay. Historic
replica single hung aluminum 1/1 window units will be added in these bays and will match
the middle column of windows.

Exterior Roof Scope
• Install a new EPDM roofing system.
• The chimney at the northwest corner of the roof will be removed as it is in very poor
condition with significant spalling and missing units. The roof structure, parapet, and
coping will be infilled at this location to match the historic parapet configuration.
• New rooftop mechanical equipment will be placed on the roof as indicated in the attached
plans. Due to the high visibility of this standalone high-rise building, the new units are
visible from certain views within a one block radius of the building, and a best effort has
been made to reduce the visibility of these units. Mechanical units have been located inside
the penthouse, and as close to the penthouse as possible. In addition, large central fresh air
HVAC units have been split into multiple zones in order to reduce footprint and height,
and low-profile cooling towers are proposed, at a higher cost, in order to reduce scale and
visibility from the ROW. Please see the attached sightline study regarding the visibility of
these rooftop units.
Exterior Metal Flagpoles
• Historically there were 2 flagpoles on either side of the main Sproat entrance and 2
flagpoles centered on the Park Avenue façade. All four flagpoles were historically
positioned in between the first and second floors, located just above the spandrel of the
arch below, and anchored by a limestone cartouche. The flagpoles will be retained, cleaned,
and painted. One flagpole is missing, and it will be replaced with a new unit to match the
historic flagpoles
Rooftop Penthouse
• The existing penthouse form will be retained; however, the east, south, and west walls will
be removed and rebuilt, due to extreme structural degradation, in the same shape and with
matching brick veneer as the existing. The north wall of the penthouse is contiguous with
the north façade wall and will remain and be repaired as necessary. The existing penthouse
roof and structural frame will also be retained.

 •

The rooftop penthouse, not visible from the public right of way, has five large punched
window openings with hot-rolled steel framed window units with projecting sashes. The
steel frame windows in the penthouse are in very poor condition as they have missing glass,
significant corrosion and deformed frames. These windows will be removed and infilled
while the sill will remain. The infilled brick will be set back 1” to maintain a sense of the
historic opening.

Exterior Lighting
• East Façade: Up lighting will be added to the north and south corners on the east façade
with the lights being located just above the second-floor cornice. Up lights will also be
added at the twelfth floor in between each set of paired windows. Sidewalk downlights will
also be added on the façade, in between each bay at the first floor. Finally, flagpole up
lights will be added at each cartouche that anchors the flagpoles (specific light fixture style
not available/provided)
•

South Façade: Up lighting will be added to the east and west corners on the south façade
with the lights being located just above the second-floor cornice. Up lights will also be
added at the twelfth floor in between each set of windows. Sidewalk downlights will also
be added on the façade, in between each bay at the first floor. Finally, flagpole up lights
will be added at each cartouche that anchors the flagpoles specific light fixture style not
available/provided)

•

West Façade: The ornamentation on the south façade wraps the corner onto the west façade
and runs for one bay. Accordingly, the lighting on the west façade will mirror the lighting
on the south façade: up lighting will be added on the southern-most bay of the west façade
at the second floor and at the twelfth floor. Additionally, sidewalk down lights will be
added on either side of the storefront on the southernmost bay of this façade specific light
fixture style not available/provided)

Exterior Signage
Historically, there was a blade sign at southeast corner of the building and a small hanging sign
on the south façade closer to the southwest corner. Additionally, there are two signs painted onto
the brick at the top of the building (located on the north façade and the west façade). The current
project proposes the addition of signage to the following location and of the size indicated in the
submitted drawing set:
•
•
•

•

A blade sign will be re-introduced at the southeast corner of the building on a similar
scale as the historic sign.
A small blade sign will be reintroduced on Sproat Street near the southwest corner of the
building.
A small blade sign will also be introduced on Park Avenue near the northeast corner of
the building. The two blade signs at the northeast corner and the southwest corner will be
kept to the scale of the historic hanging sign in the attached photos while the blade sign at
the southeast corner will be larger to advertise the main 1st floor tenant.
The signs currently painted on the brick at the top of the building will be repainted to
reflect the new name for the building.

 APPLICABLE ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
Proportion of openings within the facade. The east facade of the Eddystone Hotel is composed
of approximately forty percent (40%) openings; the south (front) facade has approximately
thirty-five percent (35%) openings. All openings on the first floor are presently filled in with
boards, concrete block, or glass block, making it difficult for original configurations of openings
to be discerned. According to the original plans of the building on file with the City of Detroit,
entrance openings were recessed and display window openings were not. The outer storefront
entrance openings of the south (front) and east facades are squarish in form, including their
transoms. The arched openings on the two primary facades had transom windows occupying
their arches. They were arranged with the main entrance in the middle. Flanking the entrance of
the south (front) elevation were recessed storefront entrances and flanking them were display
windows with metal grills in the apron walls. The east facade has a similar arrangement of
openings, with display windows flanking the central entrance. Paired rectangular window
openings above the ground floor contained double-hung sash windows that were twice as tall as
wide. The south facade has a similar paired window arrangement above the first floor, with the
outer bays containing a single window at each floor. Adjacent to the south facade at the
southwest corner, the west facade has a single bay fenestrated with a single windows in the same
manner as the end bays of the south side.
Rhythm of solids to voids in the front facade. A regular rhythm of solids to voids exists at the
first floor entrance/display window level, as well as stories two through thirteen, with the
placement paired window units per bay on the east facade and paired window units of the south
(front) facade flanked by an end bay of single windows units. The placement of openings in the
rear, or west elevation, is predictable as well, with paired windows, however some at the lower
floor levels have been altered by the elimination of the window sash and the brick wall between
the two (2) window openings, thus creating an opening inappropriately wider than tall. A vertical
row of single double-hung sash windows is approximately in the center of the north side
elevation which is otherwise unfenestrated.
Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Entrance openings were originally recessed and
display windows openings were not, which created a regular rhythm along the street that has
been altered with the subsequent blocking up of all openings.
Relationship of materials. Brick, limestone and terra cotta are the primary materials of the street
facades of the Eddystone Hotel. These materials continue around the southwest corner of the
building to the first bay of the west elevation. Above the limestone-clad base, the primary
material is brick. Decorative terra cotta window treatments are seen on the third, fourth and
twelfth floors. The building is capped with a decorative terra cotta cornice. Window sashes and
frames are wood above the first floor; on the ground floor, they are steel. There are metal grates
in long, rectangular, granite-faced foundation openings beneath the arched display windows on
the first floor. Other metallic elements are the flag poles extending above the two central
openings.
Relationship of textures. Brick laid in regular courses contrasts with the smoother textures of the
limestone ashlar of the first and second floors and the terra cotta decorative features. The large
blocks of smooth ashlar laid in a regular pattern on the first and second stories create the textural
effect of rustication. Repetitive terra cotta detail, such as balusters beneath the third and twelfth

 story windows, arcading in the entablature, and detailing around windows, create textural
patterns. Areas of textural interest occur at the rusticated first and second floor levels, and areas
surrounding the windows of the third, fourth and twelfth floors. The arcaded cornice at the top
of the building is particularly rich in textural ornamentation.
Relationship of colors. Light yellow brick is juxtaposed with white terra cotta and beige
limestone. Window frames and sash are currently painted brown.
Relationship of architectural details. The Eddystone Hotel is a classically arranged Italian
Renaissance-inspired building consisting of an ornate two-story base, a plain central section, and
an attic crowned by an elaborate entablature and cornice, Architectural elements and details are
located towards the top and bottom of the primary facades. In each spandrel flanking the central
arched opening is a cartouche bearing a torch and a flagpole projecting outward and upward. A
denticulated cornice serving as a belt course separates the second and third floors. Terra cotta
trim frames the third story windows, with balustrated balconets below the window bays, window
surrounds, and spandrel panels above the window bays. The spandrels display an arched form
containing a large rondel above each window, topped with a dentilled cornice running beneath
the fourth-story windows. Between the fifth and eleventh floors are untrimmed windows and
plain limestone sills. Twelfth floor windows display terra-cotta surrounds echoing the design of
those in the third story with simplified balustraded balconets, the central bay resting on heavy
console brackets. A terra cotta belt course separates the eleventh and twelfth floors. The building
is crowned with a decorative terra-cotta entablature and cornice, the entablature with a chevronlike band below a projecting blind arcade with detailed corbels supporting the bases of the
arches, and a projecting cornice with a decorative fringe. In general, the building is rich in
architectural detail. Eddystone
Relationship of roof shapes. The roof is not visible from the street. An elevator shaft rises above
the roof line at the northwest corner of the building, visible from the north and west.
RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the work as proposed will not result in the removal of historic materials or
alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property. Staff therefore recommends that the
Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the work as proposed because it meets the
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, standard number 6) Deteriorated historic
features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires
replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture,
and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall
be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence and number 7) Chemical or
physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be
used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest
means possible.
However, staff recommends that the Commission issue the above-referenced COA with the
following conditions:
•

HDC staff shall be afforded the opportunity to review and approve the final signage;
light fixture design; storefront, window and window specs; and HVAC equipment

 •

installation prior to the issuance of the project permit
HDC staff shall be afforded the opportunity to review and approve the final project CDs
prior to the issuance of the project permit

RE: Eddystone Hotel - HDC Submission
Dear Ms. Ross:
Kraemer Design Group (KDG) is writing to submit information to the Detroit Historic District Commission (HDC), on
behalf of Eddystone Renaissance, LLC regarding the proposed rehabilitation of the Eddystone Hotel located at 110
Sproat. The proposed exterior work at the Eddystone Hotel will include exterior masonry cleaning and restoration;
new storefronts; new exterior doors; new historic replica replacement windows; new signage in keeping in character
with the historic signage; new façade lighting; cleaning and repair of the iron flagpoles; new roofing, reconstruction
of the mechanical penthouse, and new rooftop mechanical equipment.
The Eddystone Hotel was constructed in 1924 for local hotel magnate Lew Tuller. Built at a time when Detroit was
experiencing explosive growth, the Eddystone Hotel was part of a grandiose plan on the part of Tuller and other
Detroit builders to duplicate the character and real estate market of New York City. Designed by Louis Kamper the
building has a rectangular footprint and contains 13 floors. The building has an Italian-Renaissance inspired façade
and is constructed of concrete encased steel frame with cast concrete slabs. There is a two-story base faced in large
blocks of limestone with tall arched openings, a plain central section above the base, and an elaborate entablature
with a glazed terra cotta cornice. The primary facades (east and south) are primarily composed of pale gray
limestone, honey colored common brick, and white glazed terra cotta detailing. The north and west facades are
primarily composed of gray concrete brick. Originally, the building contained 13 residential-style hotel rooms on
each floor. The Eddystone Hotel has two primary facades along Park Avenue and Sproat with the two secondary
facades facing onto two parking areas, one to the north (a parking structure) and one to the west (a flat parking lot).
The following is a detailed description of the proposed work and its historic implications:

Masonry Restoration
The exterior of the building is faced in honey colored brick, white glazed terra cotta, and limestone veneer on the
two primary facades (east and south). The honey colored brick, white glazed terra cotta, and limestone veneer wraps
the corner from the south façade onto the west façade and runs for one bay. The remainder of the west façade is
composed of gray concrete brick. The north façade is composed entirely of gray concrete brick. The honey colored
brick and limestone are in fair condition overall while the terra cotta is in poor-to-fair condition. The honey colored
brick has areas of staining, spalling, and damaged units. The glazed terra cotta cornice has been damaged by years
of weather and water infiltration with cracking, staining, and missing units. The glazed terra cotta engaged
balustrade that runs along the south façade at the twelfth floor is in poor condition with the majority of it completely
missing. The gray concrete brick found on the west and north facades are in poor-to-fair condition with weathering
and staining apparent.
The brick, terra cotta, and limestone will all be cleaned and inspected for damage. The cleaning will be done
according to the Secretary of Interior Standards, and NPS Technical Preservation Briefs 1, 2 & 6. All damaged,
deteriorating, or spalling masonry units are to be removed and replaced with new material to match original units.
Missing units are to be replaced to match the remaining adjacent materials and new brick, terra cotta, and limestone
will match the existing as closely as possible in size, color, texture, and compressive strength. Any salvaged brick,
terra cotta, and limestone will be reused where replacement is needed before new materials are used.
The glazed terra cotta detailing will be inspected for damage, cleaned, and repaired where necessary. It is currently
proposed that the missing terra cotta will be replaced with new terra cotta units, however, GFPR is also proposed as
a bid alternate. We would like approval for new terra cotta units as the primary option and we would also like
approval to replace the missing glazed terra cotta units with GFRP should it become necessary. Should GFRP be

 chosen as the replacement material, final details and shop drawings will be provided to HDC for approval prior to
installation.
Despite using standard detergent wash, there is stubborn graffiti staining that remains on the building. Standard
detergent washes will be the base bid but because of this staining, another cleaning system is being proposed as a
bid alternate: It is proposed that this staining be treated with Quintek Corporation’s Rotec Vortex cleaning system in
order to remove the remaining stains. Quintek’s Rotec Vortex system creates a gentle swirling vortex utilizing low
volumes of water, low air pressure, and fine inert granulate. A certified Rotec Vortex contractor will be performing
the cleaning. We believe this cleaning system uses the gentlest means possible while still achieving adequate
cleaning results. Note that the National Park Service has a team who uses this product to clean their monuments
throughout the country. A mockup will be done to find the right balance of cleaning without damaging the stone.
Kramer Design Group has completed a set of facade restoration drawings which are attached here for reference.

Exterior Storefront Systems and Doors
There are currently no storefront systems in the building as all historic materials have long since been removed and
the openings have been boarded or bricked over. Historically there were storefront systems on the Sproat Street
and Park Avenue facades. All non-original storefront materials will be removed, and they will be replaced with a new
storefront system designed to complement the historic character of the building without appearing falsely historic.
Historic photos and limited physical evidence will be used to guide the design process. The storefronts will be
aluminum framed with clear insulated glazing. The muntin pattern is based upon a historic photograph which is
included here for reference. The sightlines will be approximately 2 ½”. Please see drawings for storefront elevations.
Historically, there was a main double-door entrance into the historic lobby of the building on Sproat Street. The first
floor was occupied by various retail tenants and photos show there were additional doors into these ground floor
retail spaces, specifically, at:
•
•
•
•
•

A single door at the northern-most bay on the Park Avenue façade
A single door in the third bay on the Park Avenue façade
A entrance on the corner of Park and Sproat with openings on both the Park and Sproat façade providing
access to the entrance into the corner retail tenant
The main entrance, into the hotel, on the Sproat Street façade centered
An entrance on either side of the main entrance on Sproat providing access into the retail tenants on either
side of the main entrance

The double door main entry on Sproat street has been infilled with CMU and a temporary steel door has been
installed to provide security to the site. The corner entrance doors have been significantly altered over time with
CMU infill installed at both openings (on Park and Sproat).
New double entry doors with a fanlight will be re-installed in the centered, main entry on Sproat Street—they will be
fixed shut. The doors will be fully glazed stile and rail doors with new hardware compatible with the historic
character of the building—see drawings for additional details. A double door entry will also be installed in the
western-most bay on Sproat Street to provide access into the tenant space. A single door with sidelights and
transom will be added to each side of the southeast corner storefronts—one on Park Avenue in the southern-most
bay and one on Sproat in the eastern-most bay—to reinstate the corner entrance into the building that was
historically located at this corner. Finally, a single-entry door with sidelights and transom will be installed in the
northern-most bay on the Park Avenue façade to provide access to the new residential lobby and the residential
units on the upper floors.

Windows
There are no windows in the building although a few small fragments of the window frames and brick mold have
been found and salvaged. The salvaged pieces indicate that the original windows were wood, double hung units,
and will be used as the basis of design for the new replacement historic replica windows. All windows will be
replaced with new aluminum windows to match the original window as closely as possible and will also match the
position in the wall and the dimensions of the individual elements including but not limited to muntins, head, sill,
panes, jambs, sash, and overall depth. There will be no screens or screen rail additions. Accordingly, these new
windows will be compatible with the historic character of the building. The steel frame windows in the penthouse

Page 2 of 4
1420 Broadway   Detroit, MI   48226   p 313 965 3399   f 313 965 3555   www.thekraemeredge.com

 are in very poor condition and will be removed and infilled while the sill will remain. The infilled brick will be set back
1” to maintain a sense of the historic opening.
Currently the building has no intact existing windows on any of the four facades, with only remnants of the frames
and brick molds left in place. Photo evidence and examination of the existing wood trim and frame remnants
indicate that the windows on the east, south, and west facades were originally painted one-over-one wood double
hung sash units with decorative brick mold and wood sills. The windows were uniform in detail across the façade
and simple in design. There was a single column of punched window openings on the rear (north) façade located at
the “trunk storage” closet behind the elevator bank. Those windows are also missing, and no photo evidence or
frames remain to establish the original window type. The rooftop penthouse, not visible from the public right of
way, has five large punched window openings with hot-rolled steel framed window units with projecting sashes. The
remaining windows in the penthouse are in poor condition with missing glass, significant corrosion and deformed
frames.
All window openings on the four building facades will have all remaining frame remnants removed and abated.
Masonry openings shall be stabilized, rebuilt if needed, and prepped for new window units. New historic replica,
one-over-one, single hung window units shall be installed to match the limited historic evidence we have of those
windows. The windows shall utilize a decorative aluminum panning system, custom extruded to match the historic
brick mold profile. Aluminum sashes will have historic replica glazing profiles. Aluminum frames shall be narrow
profile units to replicate typical wood window frames from the era. Frames will be set back in the masonry opening
to match historic configuration.
Since no evidence remains of the window types at the rear of the building (the north façade), a new historic replica
single-hung aluminum window, similar to that being utilized on the rest of the building, will be used in this location
as well. Two additional columns of windows will be added to the north façade: punched openings on floors 12-13
will be made on the north façade in the first bay and the last bay. Historic replica single hung aluminum window
units will be added in these bays and will match the middle column of windows.
The penthouse windows are damaged beyond repair, and, as described below, the masonry wall construction is also
proposed to be demolished and replaced in kind for a new mechanical penthouse. As a result, all of the existing
windows and door will be removed. The penthouse shall be reconstructed out of new brick masonry to match the
existing penthouse enclosure. Window openings will not be recreated, but the historic window openings shall be
outlined in the new brick walls by recessing the brick veneer 1” at the historic window opening locations to simulate
the original window configuration.

Exterior Roof Scope
The asphalt roofing system is in poor condition and will be replaced with a new EPDM roofing system. The chimney
at the northwest corner of the roof will be removed as it is in very poor condition with significant spalling and
missing units. The roof structure, parapet, and coping will be infilled at this location to match the historic parapet
configuration. The existing penthouse form will be retained; however, the east, south, and west walls will be
removed and rebuilt, due to extreme structural degradation, in the same shape and with matching brick veneer as
the existing. The north wall of the penthouse is contiguous with the north façade wall and will remain and be
repaired as necessary. The existing penthouse roof and structural frame will also be retained.
New rooftop mechanical equipment will be placed on the roof as indicated in the attached plans. Due to the high
visibility of this standalone high-rise building, the new units are visible from certain views within a one block radius of
the building, and a best effort has been made to reduce the visibility of these units. Mechanical units have been
located inside the penthouse, and as close to the penthouse as possible. In addition, large central fresh air HVAC
units have been split into multiple zones in order to reduce footprint and height, and low-profile cooling towers are
proposed, at a higher cost, in order to reduce scale and visibility from the ROW. Please see the attached sightline
study regarding the visibility of these rooftop units.

Exterior Metal Flagpoles
Historically there were 2 flagpoles on either side of the main Sproat entrance and 2 flagpoles centered on the Park
Avenue façade. All four flagpoles were historically positioned in between the first and second floors, located just
above the spandrel of the arch below, and anchored by a limestone cartouche. The flagpoles will be retained,
cleaned, and painted. One flagpole is missing, and it will be replaced with a new unit to match the historic flagpoles

Page 3 of 4
1420 Broadway   Detroit, MI   48226   p 313 965 3399   f 313 965 3555   www.thekraemeredge.com

 as closely as possible. Any other broken or missing pieces shall be repaired or replaced to match the original as
closely as possible.

Exterior Lighting
It is proposed that exterior lighting be added to the building in the following locations:
East Façade: Up lighting will be added to the north and south corners on the east façade with the lights being
located just above the second-floor cornice. Up lights will also be added at the twelfth floor in between each set of
paired windows. Sidewalk downlights will also be added on the façade, in between each bay at the first floor.
Finally, flagpole up lights will be added at each cartouche that anchors the flagpoles.
South Façade: Up lighting will be added to the east and west corners on the south façade with the lights being
located just above the second-floor cornice. Up lights will also be added at the twelfth floor in between each set of
windows. Sidewalk downlights will also be added on the façade, in between each bay at the first floor. Finally,
flagpole up lights will be added at each cartouche that anchors the flagpoles.
West Façade: The ornamentation on the south façade wraps the corner onto the west façade and runs for one bay.
Accordingly, the lighting on the west façade will mirror the lighting on the south façade: up lighting will be added
on the southern-most bay of the west façade at the second floor and at the twelfth floor. Additionally, sidewalk
down lights will be added on either side of the storefront on the southernmost bay of this façade.

Exterior Signage
Historically, there was a blade sign at southeast corner of the building and at small hanging sign on the south façade
closer to the southwest corner. Additionally, there are two signs painted onto the brick at the top of the building
(located on the north façade and the west façade).
This project proposes to add signage to the building in the basic locations indicated on the attached drawings. A
blade sign will be re-introduced at the southeast corner of the building on a similar scale as the historic sign.
Further, a small blade sign will be reintroduced on Sproat street near the southwest corner of the building. Finally, a
small blade sign will also be introduced on Park Avenue near the northeast corner of the building. The two blade
signs at the northeast corner and the southwest corner will be kept to the scale of the historic hanging sign in the
attached photos while the blade sign at the southeast corner will be larger to advertise the main 1st floor tenant.
The signs currently painted on the brick at the top of the building will be repainted to reflect the new name for the
building.

Conclusion
The items listed above provide a synopsis of the proposed scope of work for the rehabilitation of the Eddystone
Hotel. We kindly request approval of the work proposed at 110 Sproat. Further detail is provided in the attached
drawings, photos, and documentation. Please contact Brian Rebain at Kraemer Design Group if you have any further
