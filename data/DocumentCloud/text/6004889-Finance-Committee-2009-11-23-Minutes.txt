Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. CCHHS trades and engineers’ consolidation with the Cook County Department of Facilities
Management
James D’Amico, Director of the Cook County Department of Facilities Management, presented information
on a proposal to consolidate the System trades and engineers within the System. It was noted that previous
presentations included a proposal to consolidate these services and positions under the County’s Department
of Facilities Management; that proposal was revised in order for the System to potentially realize savings
and efficiencies, while still maintaining these services and positions within the System. Currently, System
trades and engineers are housed at the separate affiliates, and as a result are not able to be temporarily
transferred to other areas if their services are needed elsewhere in the System.

III. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. CCHHS trades and engineers’ consolidation with the Cook County Department of Facilities
Management (continued)
During the discussion of the information, Director Zopp clarified that, should the System choose to
consolidate these services in-house, this action would take place at the System, not at the County. Mr. Foley
responded affirmatively, and stated that that consolidation of these services within the System is something
they are committed to doing. Mr. Foley noted that in Mr. D’Amico’s previous presentation, consolidation
within the System was presented as an option.
The Committee discussed the budgetary amendment recently passed by the Cook County Board which
transferred twenty-one trades/engineers positions from the System to the County’s Department of Facilities
Management. Mr. Foley informed the Committee that the original amendment recommended that the System
fund this transfer, which totalled $1.4 million. However, Mr. Foley explained to the County Board at that
time that the proposed System budget did not include those positions, because these positions were part of
the reduction in force. Therefore, the amendment was revised and the funding for the transfer was found
elsewhere.
During the discussion of existing human resource functions for the System’s trades and engineers, it was
stated that the County’s Department of Facilities Management is responsible for these functions. In
response to Director O’Donnell’s question regarding whether the System can bring that function in-house,
Dr. Anthony Tedeschi, Interim Chief Operating Officer, responded that the System will have that ability in
the future.
The Committee discussed the subject of trades and engineers at Cermak Health Services. Mr. D’Amico
stated that the System doesn’t have any of their trades working at Cermak; Cook County’s tradespeople are
sent to provide these services at Cermak.
B. Draft Request for Proposals (RFP) for professional services relating to performance improvement
plan implementation
Jeanene Johnson, Director of the Office of Performance Improvement, presented information on the draft
RFP for professional services relating to performance improvement plan implementation (Attachment #1).
Additionally, she reviewed the quality assurance process that will be put into place once the contractor is
selected, so their work can be evaluated during the course of their implementation effort.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
In response to Director Zopp’s question regarding whether the implementation includes the training of staff,
so that when the consultant leaves, the training, management and productivity remains, Ms. Johnson
responded affirmatively.
In response to Board Chairman Batts’ question regarding whether contract compliance efforts can be
tracked, Dr. Tedeschi responded affirmatively, stating that next month, there will be a report available on
that subject.
Director Lyne referenced the warehouses that are currently being leased for storage. Mr. Foley noted that
this subject is a performance improvement-related goal. The cost to lease this space is significant; if the
inventory is being managed correctly, there should be no need for warehouse space.

III. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
B. Draft Request for Proposals (RFP) for professional services relating to performance improvement
plan implementation (continued)
Director O’Donnell inquired regarding the Lawson system, and the work being performed by ACS. She
stated that she doesn’t want duplicative efforts. Dr. Tedeschi stated that the Lawson implementation is a
part of this; it will all be integrated. At the back end of the Lawson processes and implementation is the
rolling-out through the organization, so the supply chain can be managed all the way down to the patient.
He added that he is confident that it will interface well with them, and stated that a great deal of time was
spent ensuring that there would not be duplicative efforts.
Ms. Johnson provided information on the evaluation process for the RFP, including information on the
composition of the reviewing committee. Director Lyne stated that it is her experience that it can be
beneficial to include individuals outside of senior or executive-level staff in the reviewing committees.
C. Miscellaneous
In response to a request from Chairman Carvalho, Mr. Foley provided an update on the subject of contract
compliance. He stated that Betty Hancock Perry, Director of the County’s Office of Contract Compliance,
has been invited to the December 18th System Board meeting to give an overview of her department.
Mr. Foley stated that Chairman Carvalho inquired whether the System is going to continue to depend on the
County’s Office of Contract Compliance, or whether there a plan to move this function into the System. Dr.
Tedeschi responded that there is a plan to move this function to the System; it will take some time to prepare
for this, in order to ensure that processes are in place for a smooth transition, but he expects this to occur
sometime in 2010.
Chairman Carvalho stated that he posed the question not because he has issues with the way contracts are
processed currently, but as a general principle, if the System is to be truly independent, they should be
independent of the County processes.
