MONTHLY NEWS AND INFORMATION FROM YOUR RETIREMENT BOARD

EMWQ Update
I would like to take this opportunity to commend the 2019 CFD candidate classes for their
generosity and interest in the EMWQ and the CFD related charities. Of the 164 candidates to
enter service with the CFD in 2019, 138 candidates voluntarily elected to donate to the EMWQ
or other charities that support the members and the mission of the CFD. Additionally, I would
like to extend a most sincere thank you from the CFD family to City Comptroller Erin Keane and
Deputy Comptroller John Arvetis for all of their hard work in making the charitable
contributions via payroll deductions possible.

Fund Secretary,

Captain Anthony Martin
