Delinquency
Summary:

June 5, 2019

The City of Berwyn would like to participate in the No-Cash Bid program. We would like to

request the parcels of land with the following PINs: This request package contains a request for three (3)
properties on three (3) PINs. While Ordinance No.18-29 approves five (5) property index numbers
(PINs), this request package is only for the above listed three (3) occupied single-family homes: occupied
by son of owner-status of owner unknown; owner occupied; and in the name of a trust with unknown
occupants. The other two (2) PINs are not requested at this time. The intended use for the three (3)
occupied residential properties will be for redevelopment and/or rehabilitation, elimination of blight and
neighborhood stabilization. The occupancy of the properties is stated above next to the PINS. The City of
Berwyn will encourage redemption of delinquent taxes as its goal is not to displace residents, but return
the properties to the tax rolls.
A known Third Party, the Berwyn Development Corporation (the “BDC”) will be acquiring and managing
the properties on behalf of the City following acquisition through the No Cash Bid program. Should the
properties prove to be in stable condition with minimal rehabilitation costs, BDC staff recommends the
establishment of the Berwyn First Time Homeownership Program, a program for Berwyn Police, Berwyn
Fire and other qualifying individuals who may be seeking to buy property in and move closer to the
community. The process is described in further detail in the Third Party Requestor Package. If the
properties need to be rehabbed, the BDC will be responsible; the properties will then be sold. The City will
file for tax exempt status on said properties and maintain the status until parcels are transferred to new
owner(s). Legal counsel will be sought out in order to obtain the tax deed on behalf of the BDC and the
BDC will bear all legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of the parcels. Additionally, the
BDC will send a No-Cash Bid Report to the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development on the
status of the parcels for five (5) years or until development and/or rehabilitation is complete, whichever
occurs last.

Summary:

This letter is to express the Village of Chicago Ridge’s interest in receiving a No Cash Bid

for parcels located in Chicago Ridge. The permanent index numbers of the parcels requested are: This
Request Package contains 3 PINs (the “Subject Property”). The PINs requested currently contain a
partially occupied commercial structure on parcels in the Village of Chicago Ridge. It is the intent of the
Village of Chicago Ridge, as part of its overall economic development strategy, to acquire the Subject
Property and return it to a beneficial use for the citizens of the Village. Presently only one of the three
units is occupied by a dental lab which is a tenant of the Subject Property. The building sits directly south
of a large undeveloped piece of property suitable for redevelopment and north of a beautiful banquet
facility. Upon acquisition, it is the Village’s intent to remove the tenants, demolish the structure and
market it for redevelopment. This building is already a longstanding eyesore that brings down the value of
surrounding properties and it is located on Ridgeland Avenue, the main street through the middle of
Chicago Ridge.
The Village of Chicago Ridge has retained legal counsel in order to obtain the tax deeds and will bear all
costs associated with the acquisition of the parcels. In accordance with the requirements of the Cook
County No Cash Bid Ordinance, the Village of Chicago Ridge will submit to the Cook County Office of
Economic Development a No Cash Bid Report on the status of each parcel for five years or until
development is complete whichever comes last. In accordance with the requirements of the Cook County
No Cash Bid Program, the Village of Chicago Ridge hereby certifies that it does not have an identified
third party requestor associated with the filing of this application and will accordingly take the necessary
steps to have the Subject Property declared tax exempt for municipal use and will submit to the Cook
County Board of Review a Real Estate Exemption Complaint for tax exempt status which will be
maintained until title is transferred to a new owner.

Chicago Ridge, as part of its overall economic development strategy, to acquire the Subject Property and
return it to a beneficial use for the citizens of the Village. The Subject Property is being utilized as a
storage facility which is occupied and operated by the owner of the Subject Property. It is located within
the Village’s Harlem Avenue TIF District and this blighted structure presents a clear obstacle to serious
development of the 78 acre neighboring vacant property. The Village hopes to acquire the storage facility,
to remove the owner and renters, and demolish it in order to reduce the blight and accommodate possible
tollway improvements and potential commercial redevelopment of remaining land.
The Village of Chicago Ridge has retained legal counsel in order to obtain tax deeds and will bear all costs
associated with the acquisition of the parcels. In accordance with the requirements of the Cook County
No Cash Bid Ordinance, the Village of Chicago Ridge will submit to the Cook County Office of Economic

Village’s interest in the No Cash Bid for the following parcel: The number of parcels in this request is one
(1). The property is currently vacant, unoccupied and unused, and it is the intention of the Village to return
this parcel to tax-paying status through commercial redevelopment. The property is located nearby other
Village of Crestwood NCB PINs from prior rounds and we find that there is interest in this property for
use as a truck stop, gas station or convenience facility. This would benefit the Village by adding
commercial property and businesses to the Village and increasing the Village’s assessed valuation.
The Village will initially file for tax exempt status upon receipt and filing of tax deeds, but expects to
return the property to tax-paying status at the earliest possible time. At the present time there are no Third

South Wheeling Road, formerly occupied by the Evanger’s Dog and Cat Food Company, Inc. The former
occupant has relocated their operations outside the Village and the existing structures are unoccupied and

commuter parking to expand the availability of commuter parking within close proximity to the train
station. Acquisition of the parcels will also allow the Village to address ongoing issues with the vacated
industrial facility and allow for proper clean-up of the land, and further the Village’s efforts to relocate
heavy industrial uses from this area due to the expansion of commercial retail

and

residential

developments of nearby land.
The Village will file for tax exempt status as long as it retains the PINs for municipal use, maintaining that
status until any tax deed either or both properties is/are conveyed to a potential developer. The Village
does not, at the present time, have a Third Party Request by a developer, organization or other private
party, in which the Village would convey a certificate of purchase or the perfected tax deed of the
above-listed PINs to that Third Party Requestor. The Village agrees to submit, to the Cook County
Department of Planning and Development, No Cash Bid Reports on the status of each parcel for five (5)
years, or until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No Cash
Bid Ordinance. The law firm serves as Corporate Counsel to the Village of Wheeling, and will obtain the
tax deeds and bear all legal and other costs associated with acquisition of the parcels.
