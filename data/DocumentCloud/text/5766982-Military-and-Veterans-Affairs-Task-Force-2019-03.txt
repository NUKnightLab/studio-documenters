RE: DWSD Contract No. cs-1304, Amendment No. 3
?Technology Services)
Consultant: Diversified Data Processing and Consulting, Inc. dba DivDat

MOTION

Upon recommendation of Daniel A. Rainey, Chief Information Of?cer, the Board of Water

BACKGROUND

The use of DivDat Kiosks and mobile pay application has increased since its inception
in 2016. Kiosk usage has been recently growing at a rate of over 2,000 new users every month
and now stands at just over 18,000 kiosk transactions per month. Web usage jumped 50% between
March and May to just over 25,000 transactions and as DWSD migrates off of its current payment
processor, Invoice Cloud will approach 50,000 payments per month. IV was added in March (it
uses the same technology as the Web) and now accounts for over 18,000 transactions per month.

RECEIVED FEB 252019

 

The reoccurring kiosk operating cost of $12,000 and onetime implementation costs for
the PCI-DSS compliant Counter Payment solution of $25,000 are accounted for in the FY2019
lnfonnation Technology budget. The annual transaction costs are budgeted for in current DWSD
operating costs.

Honorable City Council:

RE: Petition No. 657 Department of Public Works, City Engineering Division, request
to dedicate a Public Easement in the area bounded by Warren, Canyon, Mack and
Radnor.

Petition No. 657 Department of Public Works, City Engineering Division, request to dedicate
a public access easement, 10 feet wide, adjoining part of a public alley, 20 feet wide running from
Mack Avenue, 120 feet wide to Canyon Avenue, 60 feet wide, and lying south of Warren Avenue,
105 feet wide and east of Radnor Avenue, 70 feet wide.

The petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for investigation (utility review)
and report. This is our report.

The request is being made as part of a commercial development known as EZ Storage at 18145-
18147 Mack Avenue. On February 6, 2011, your Honorable Body approved the rezoning
classi?cation for 18145 and 18147 Mack Avenue from a B4 (General Business District) and a P1
(Open Parking District) into a PD (Planned Development District). The approval was subject to
several conditions including the execution of a Maintenance Agreement with the City of Detroit
Department of Public Works City Engineering Division with respect to the 20 foot wide north-
south alley adjacent t018145 and 18147 Mack Avenue. The Maintenance Agreement was executed
and recorded August 5, 2011 in Liber 49309, pages 542?573, Wayne County Records.

At this time storage? aka Mack Avenue Investors, LLC wants to grant to the City of Detroit
an Easement for Public Access and Use. The existing Maintenance Agreement will be amended to
include the subject easement area. The request was approved by City Engineering DPW and the
City of Detroit Law Department.

I am recommending adoption of the attached resolution.

Respectfully su mitted,

RESOLUTION URGING MARATHON PETROLEUM COMPANY TO SUBMIT A
SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT PROPOSAL AS PART OF
CORRECTING VIOLATIONS REPORTED IN THE FEBRUARY 22, 2019 VIOLATION
NOTICE FROM MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
(MDEQ)

By Council Member Castaneda?Lopez

WHEREAS, In Detroit many low-income communities of color are located near concentrated
areas of major stationary sources of pollution. The severe, adverse impacts of air pollution
disproportionately fall on poor and People of Color populations and can lead to severe negative
health impacts such as increased rates of asthma, nuisances and other adverse consequences; and

WHEREAS, Residents living in these front line communities have long been concerned that air
quality is not adequately protected or enforced, violations are not severely punished, and even
when regulatory enforcement action is taken it fails to provide adequate remedies to those affected,
or deterrence to polluters; and

WHEREAS, After numerous complaints by residents of Southwest Detroit on and around February
2 and 3, 2019, of?cials from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ)
investigated a recent ?are incident at Marathon?s Detroit re?nery that emitted powerful, nauseating
odors. MDEQ issued a formal violation notice that included ?ndings of odors of suf?cient
frequency, duration and intensity to violate Rule 901(b) of the State administrative rules, when
vent gases were not properly combusted; and

WHEREAS, If MDEQ determines that such a violation of an air standard has occurred, the violator
is given an opportunity to enter into a formal consent agreement to correct the violation. Such an
agreement can provide monetary and other relief, such as operational, maintenance or monitoring
requirements, or a Supplemental Environmental Project and

WHEREAS, An SEP is an environmentally bene?cial project that a violator may agree to
undertake as part of the terms of a consent agreement. Some examples of SEPs are air ?ltration
systems for nearby schools to protect or improve indoor air quality, or vegetative green buffers to
minimize obvious effects of pollutants and noise; and

WHEREAS, In Michigan, monetary penalties for violating air quality standards go to the State
general fund, rather than to the front line communities who are most affected by pollution. The
inability of neighboring communities to receive direct bene?ts from funds assessed as ?nes often
leads residents of these communities to prefer an SEP rather than merely monetary ?nes; and

WHEREAS, According to the SEP policy, the violator may propose and SEP in lieu of
a portion of the monetary penalty. MDEQ has discretion to approve or disapprove of the proposed
SEP. Both MDEQ and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) policies
encourage considering community input in developing SEP proposals; and

RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF HOUSE BILL 4064 TO PRESCRIBE A
PROGRAM FOR TESTING AND REMOVING LEAD IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS
AND CHILD CARE CENTERS

WHEREAS, The mission of the Detroit City Council is to promote the economic, cultural
and physical welfare of Detroit?s citizens through Charter?mandated legislative functions;
and

WHEREAS, The Flint Water Crisis, brought the safety of our much neglected public fresh
water delivery systems into stark focus, although all the evidence has not come in yet, it
would appear that the public of?cials placement of budget constraints above the wellbeing of
their residents may have a major role in the catastrophe that followed, and

WHEREAS, This past error has encouraged of?cials to exercise a bit more diligence when
addressing water quality within aging infrastructure systems; and

WHEREAS, When faced with similar water quality issues in 2018, Detroit Public School
Community District Superintendent Dr.Vitti, acting on the behalf of the health and
safety of Detroit students, after initial testing results for 16 schools showed higher than
acceptable levels for copper and/or lead at one or more water sources, ordered that all of the
water fountains in the district?s public schools to be shut off, until it was certain that the
water system was safe and free from contamination; and

WHEREAS, Michigan House Bill 4064, introduced by Representative Sheldon Neeley (D),
would amend Section 2 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (MCL 325.1002) and by adding
section 7a. would require the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) to
establish a program to assist schools and child care centers in testing and remedying lead
contamination in drinking water from drinking water coolers or other sources under the
control of the schools or child care centers and to conduct periodic sampling and testing.
Upon receipt of the test results from each school and child care center, the MDEQ, would be
required to make the test results available to the public on the Department?s website. NOW
THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, That the Detroit City Council hereby supports House Bill 4064, in order to
protect the youth of Detroit from contaminated drinking water in schools and child care
centers; BE IT FINALLY

RESOLVED, That a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the House Committee on
Natural Resources and Outdoor Recreation, the Detroit Delegation in the State House and
Governor Gretchen Whitmer.

BY COUNCIL PRESIDENT BRENDA JONES

RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL 14 TO PRESCRIBE MAXIMUM
CONTAMINANT LEVELS IN DRINKING WATER

WHEREAS, The mission of the Detroit City Council is to promote the economic, cultural and
physical welfare of Detroit?s citizens through Charter?mandated legislative functions; and

WHEREAS, Per?uorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) and Per?uorooctanesulfonic Acid (PFOS) are
anthropogenic chemicals that are part of a larger group of chemicals referred to as per?uoroalkyl
substances (PFAS) and for decades, these chemicals have been used in a wide array of consumer
products, such as non-stick cookware, carpets, fabrics for furniture, paper packaging for food
and ?re resistant aviation hydraulic ?uids; and

WHEREAS, According to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality Remediation and
Redevelopment Division (RRD), which is responsible for implementing criteria as part of its?
ongoing efforts to clean?up sites of environmental contamination has reported that PFAS has
been detected in fresh water sources across the state; and

WHEREAS, According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, exposure to
PFAS is harmful. PFAS may affect growth, learning, and the behavior of infants and older
children, reduce a woman?s chances of getting pregnant, interfere with the body?s natural
hormones, increase cholesterol levels, affect the immune system and increase the risk of cancer;
and

WHEREAS, The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not established Maximum
Contaminant Levels (MCL) for PFAS chemicals. MCL is the legal threshold limit on the amount
of a substance that is allowed in public water systems under the Safe Drinking Water Act.
However, the EPA has issued a health advisory for PFOA and PF OS levels at 70 parts per trillion
for combined concentrations in drinking water; and

WHEREAS, A study conducted by Harvard University suggests that drinking water safety
levels should be much lower than the guidelines established by and

WHEREAS, While the science of health effects from exposure of these chemicals continues to
evolve, the EPA has issued an advisory level of 70 parts per trillion is not protective of human
health; and

WHEREAS, According to Senator Winnie Brinks (D), the sponsor of Senate Bill 14, if passed
this legislation would provide stronger lifetime protections from the adverse health effects of
these chemicals, by setting the maximum threshold at 10 parts per trillion for combined
concentrations of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water; NOW THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, That the Detroit City Council hereby supports the passage of Senate Bill 14; BE
IT FINALLY

RESOLVED, That copies of this resolution be forwarded to the Senate Environmental Quality
Committee, Committee on Natural Resources, Senator Winnie Brinks, and Gov.Whitmer.
