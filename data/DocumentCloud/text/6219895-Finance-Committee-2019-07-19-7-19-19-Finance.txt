Metrics
Financials: May 2019

Mr. Akpan provided an overview of the metrics and Financials through May 2019. The Committee reviewed
and discussed the information.
Acting Chair Hammock asked Mr. Akpan to provide a brief summary of the information presented to County
Commissioners at their recent Finance Committee mid-year budget review meeting. Mr. Akpan stated that, for
FY2019, the administration is seeing a gap in Cook County Health’s budget in the amount of $103 million. The
administration received $77 million from the State relating to Graduate Medical Education, so the gap is now
reduced to $26 million. The administration is actively working to identify further solutions to address the
remaining gap of $26 million.
The Committee discussed the subject of the backlog at the State in processing Medicaid applications. James
Kiamos, Chief Executive Officer of CountyCare, stated that the backlog represents six (6) months worth of
applications for approximately 100,000 members. The State is actively addressing this; however, he does not
expect to see an impact on it until fall or winter.
