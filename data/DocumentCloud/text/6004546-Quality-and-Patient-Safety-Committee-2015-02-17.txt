Report from System Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
Dr. Krishna Das, Chief Quality Officer, provided a brief update on regulatory and accreditation matters. She stated
that there are no new items of note; she mentioned that, as noted on the slide regarding the accreditation timetable
in her presentation, Stroger Hospital is up for its next full accreditation survey by The Joint Commission anytime
between now and November.
Additionally, Dr. Das noted that there was an unannounced survey at Stroger Hospital by representatives from
the Illinois Department of Public Health approximately one month ago. The survey was based on a patient
complaint. Following their investigation, they found the hospital in full compliance, and meeting all of the
Conditions of Participation required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. She added that the
surveyors found some process issues that should be addressed, but none of those violated the Conditions of
Participation.

Report from System Chief Quality Officer (continued)
B. Metrics (Attachment #1)
Dr. Das provided an overview of the presentation, which contained information on the timetable for
accreditations, proposed future Committee and Board presentation topics and metrics. The Committee reviewed
and discussed the information.
With regard to the information on proposed future presentations on slide 3, Mr. Driscoll suggested that there
could be a monthly focus at the Committee on the various institutions within the System, such as Cermak Health
Services and the Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH).
Ms. Merryweather noted the relationships between some of the topics, such as that between Value-Based
Purchasing (VBP) and Readmissions. She expressed concern that those related topics are staggered, with so
much time in between the presentations; by the time the presentation on Readmissions is presented in
November, because it is historical data, it seems like there is no movement ahead.
Board Chairman Hammock provided an overview of the plan for in-depth, quarterly presentations to the Board
(as listed in the left column of slide 3). The plan is to give 20-30 minutes in the Board Meeting for those topics
on a quarterly basis; he noted that the Committee need not put off until August dealing with VBP or
Readmissions in November, but he did not think that the Board will have the time to spend an extensive period
of time every month on various quality issues. At every Board Meeting, he has asked Chairman Gugenheim to
make a report on what the Committee covered that month, regarding both metrics and the topics listed in the
column on the right, which should just be summary in nature; with regard to the topics on the left, the Board is
going to get more of an education with more in-depth information.
Director Lerner suggested that there is a way of grouping this that makes a little more sense and tries to
streamline the presentation to a great extent. VBP and Readmissions are both quality initiatives, as well as cost
management initiatives, so one could look at the relationship between those two and see if there is a way of
collapsing that. Additionally, Capacity Management and Operating Room (OR) Initiatives could also be looked
at as cost management initiatives; each one of these has a relationship to quality, so one can link cost to quality
or revenue to quality. He believes that Meaningful Use is a very difficult subject to present in conjunction with
something else; it is an information technology-driven issue that has an impact to cost for the whole System this may be something that should remain as a standalone topic. With regard to the topic of Magnet and
Baldrige designations, he thinks these could be potential game-changers for the whole System, and is something
that deserves a standalone conversation of 10 minutes or so.
Chairman Gugenheim clarified Director Lerner’s recommendations: he is in agreement with February and
May’s topics; he is suggesting to collapse the August and November topics into one presentation and use the
November slot for another subject. Director Lerner responded affirmatively.
Director Lerner stated that there is a lot to be done; the overarching question that the Board presentations should
address is: what are the things that are going to help to accelerate the change process at the System? The
listings on the left do that, and there is a way of logically grouping them so the Board has a broader
understanding of, for example, OR management and the overall cost structure, and the impact that might have
on VBP as a potential high-cost provider in a system.
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, provided additional comments. He stated that, as the
organization improves its ability to collect and share the information on an ongoing basis, one other way some
organizations have chosen to share information with their Board is to supply ongoing reports in an informational
sense, but not to highlight them. That way, if a Board or Committee member says they would like to know what

Report from System Chief Quality Officer
B. Metrics (continued)
the patient satisfaction score was last quarter, even though that is not on the calendar to talk about again until
some time in the future, they have the comfort of receiving that information without having to send a direct
email or ask a focused kind of question. This is something that he and Dr. Das could talk about, regarding
whether something like this can be practically developed.
Dr. Shannon noted that there is going to be a dynamic that will suggest that there may be a need to change
something up in the schedule from time to time; for example, CCDPH may be in the queue for August, but if
something comes up topically, it may make sense to pull it forward for June.
Dr. Shannon stated that there is a difference in his mind in the presentation of quality overall in these different
areas and the complicated nature of quality, financial performance and operational performance; many would
roll that all up and say that is the quality of the System, whether one is referring to Cermak Health Services or
cancer services, but there may be opportunities in some of these to use them as more of a general education to
the Board. If any of the Board or Committee members have feedback or concerns that attention is not being
paid to a particular subject or feel that something needs to be pulled forward, he recommended that they share
those concerns and feedback. At the conclusion of the discussion on the subject, Dr. Das noted that a large
number of the annual presentations to the Committee are regulatory requirements.
Dr. Das provided an overview of the information contained in the presentation regarding metrics.
Committee reviewed and discussed the information.

The

Director Lerner stated that the only change he would suggest is to slide 10; with regard to the listing of
measures on the left, he recommended that those measures that are required by regulatory or other bodies to be
presented be highlighted with an asterisk, as opposed to those measures that the staff or Board have chosen to
monitor. That way the Board will know that there is a baseline of measures that always have to be monitored,
and there is some flexibility to change some of the other measures going forward.
Board Chairman Hammock indicated that, because the proposed metrics for the Board contain a monthly
composite of data for the measures, it would be helpful if the Committee presentation slides contain a cell at the
bottom that reflects what will be shown to the Board. Additionally, he suggested that the data be rounded to
whole numbers, which will make it easier to read.
