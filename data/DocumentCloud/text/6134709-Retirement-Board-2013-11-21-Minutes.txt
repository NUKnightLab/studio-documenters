 POLICY AND PROCEDURES GOVERNING THE OVERPAYMENT OF BENEFITS
POLICY:
The Retirement Board (“Board”) of the Municipal Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago
(“MEABF”) has the power to make rules and regulations necessary for the administration of MEABF (40
ILCS 5/8-209). In accordance with that, the Board has adopted the following policy and procedures
regarding an overpayment of benefits to a member or their beneficiaries.
Members and beneficiaries (“Member”) have a right to receive benefit payments that they are entitled to
by the Illinois Pension Code (40 ILCS 5). Except as determined by a court of law or this Board pursuant to
this policy, no Member has the right to receive or retain benefit payments that exceed the amounts to
which a Member is entitled. Subject to all applicable laws, it shall be the Board’s policy to make every
reasonable effort to recover from a Member any overpayment of benefits received through
misrepresentation, fraud, or error.
Accordingly, after discovery of an overpayment, and within a reasonable period of time after written
notification to the affected Member, MEABF will either collect a lump sum repayment from the member or
it will adjust future benefit payments to recoup the overpayment. Also, future benefit payments will be
adjusted to reflect the correct entitled benefit.
In the event of any inconsistency between applicable law and this Policy, the law shall take precedence.
PROCEDURES:
A. Overpayments to Members
Benefits paid to a Member to which the Member is not entitled are known as overpayments. MEABF shall
take all reasonable steps to recover the amount of all overpayments subject to the provisions of this
policy and applicable law.
Overpayments are divided into two groups: those which are the fault of the Member or those which are
not a fault of the Member.
B. Fault Overpayment
A ‘fault overpayment” will result when a Member receives benefits to which the Member is not entitled by
reason of the Member’s misrepresentation, fraud, or error. A lien may be filed against the Member to
recover the amount overpaid.
MEABF is required under Public Act 97-0651 to report to the State’s Attorney for investigation any
reasonable suspicion of any person who knowingly makes a false statement or falsifies a record in an
attempt to defraud MEABF. Under state law a person convicted of fraud may be subject to a fine or
imprisonment or both.
C. Non-Fault Overpayment
A “non-fault overpayment” results when it is determined that the overpayment was through no fault of the
Member, such as error by MEABF or information reported incorrectly by the Member’s employer.
D. Recovery of Overpayment
MEABF will recover overpayments either by a lump sum payment from the member or by offsetting the
amount to be recovered against future benefits, over a period of time as determined by the Board, unless
the Board, in its discretion and because of legal or practical considerations, determines that another
process is warranted.

1 Page

 E. Misrepresentation, Fraud or Member Error
In cases where there is evidence that the overpayment resulted from a fault of the Member, the Board
reserves all rights to seek all amounts overpaid. The Board shall determine whether they believe if the
Member knowingly made a false statement or provided falsified documents in an attempt to defraud
MEABF.
F. Procedures for accomplishing the recovery of overpaid benefits:
I.

Upon discovery of the overpayment, MEABF shall send a letter by certified and regular mail,
return receipt requested, to the Member advising the Member of the overpayment.
1. The letter will request payment to MEABF of the amount overpaid.
2. The letter will propose a repayment schedule as follows:
Option 1: Lump sum payment to MEABF for the full amount overpaid.
Option 2: Adjust Member’s future benefit payments to zero until the total amount of
overpayment is recovered or paid in full.
Option 3: Equal installments over:
a) Twelve months in cases of fault overpayment;
b) Twenty-four months or longer in cases of non-fault overpayment
3. The letter will provide that Option 2 will go into effect by default if no response from
the Member is received within 45 days following the date the letter was delivered.

II.

If the amount of the overpayment is $5,000 or more, MEABF staff will attempt to contact the
Member by phone to schedule a meeting to discuss the contents of the letter before the letter
is sent out for delivery.

III.

MEABF may pursue all legal remedies to collect overpayments, including making a claim on
an estate or trust, if appropriate.

IV.

MEABF will maintain a permanent record of all amounts of overpayments and the repayment
to MEABF of those overpayments.

This policy shall take effect immediately.
