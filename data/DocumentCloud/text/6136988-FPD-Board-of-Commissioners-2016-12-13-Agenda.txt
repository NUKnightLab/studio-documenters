Summary:
The Forest Preserves of Cook County (the “Preserves”) previously entered into an

Concurrences:
The Chief Financial Officer and Chief Attorney have approved this item.

The Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance Provisions.
District(s): 4 and 11
Summary:
Contract (Task Order) #13-80-02-04Db is for architectural and engineering design services
for a new nature play area and other outdoor recreation and site improvements at Dan Ryan Woods. The
services contract needs to be increased due to the release of a $1 million state grant that had been frozen
for more than a year and the Forest Preserves’ desire to make some modifications to the original design.

In December 2012, Site Design Group (SDG) was selected as a member of a pre-qualified pool of 85
architectural and engineering design firms. Its master services agreement had an initial period of three
years. During that period, SDG was assigned three Task Orders to complete master plans for
improvements at Dan Ryan Woods and Eggers Grove (#13-80-02-04D), prepare more detailed design
drawings and specifications (#13-80-02-04Da), and to design an expanded scope of work that would be
funded by a state grant (#13-80-02-04Db).
An Open Space Land Acquisition and Development (OSLAD) grant was awarded by the Illinois
Department of Natural Resources in late 2014 but was subsequently frozen in January 2015. After
waiting for more than a year for release of the grant, Forest Preserve staff elected in March 2016 to
award a smaller scope of work for $898,711.00 for a portion of the work included in the grant application
as well as some other necessary site repairs. In August 2016, the Forest Preserves was notified of the

Page 12 of 23

 FPD Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

December 13, 2016

release of the suspended $1,062,000.00 grant. Forest Preserve staff is now seeking to modify the original
plan to construct the nature play area to relocate it closer to the new Visitors Center, which was
completed earlier this year, and repackage a portion of the work that could be performed by a partner
non-profit organization.
The District now desires to increase the Task Order to Site Design Group for up to $99,832.00 to revise
the master plan, revise construction drawings and bid specifications, and potentially expand the scope of
construction management services. This increased Task Order requires Board approval as the total
combined award with other previous awards exceeds $150,000.00.

The project at Turnbull Woods will involve approximately 12 acres of tree thinning within

Summary:

the original Phase I project area, improving light levels for ground-layer herbaceous species which are
being shaded out by an overabundance of canopy cover.
Likewise, at Eggers Woods ten (10) acres of canopy will be thinned along with invasive species removal
activities. This proposed restoration would build upon recent work at the site to further improve marsh
and swale habitat for marshland birds, increase the successful establishment of thousands of native plugs
recently installed along the marsh edge and prevent the loss of herbaceous species in the uplands.
Finally, at Powderhorn Prairie tree thinning will be conducted in approximately 3.3 acres of dune habitat,
and a large population of narrow-leaved cattail controlled through herbicide application. Prescribed
burning will be utilized as a key management tool at all three sites.

Summary:

Requesting authority, pursuant to Section 9 of the Cook County Forest Preserve District Act

(70 ILCS810/9), to register a portion of the Jens Jensen Preserve as an Illinois Land and Water Reserve
("ILWR") with the Illinois Nature Preserve Commission (“INPC”).
This dedication contributes to one of the key goals set forward in the Next Century Conservation Plan to
dedicate and register 20,000 acres with the INPC by 2025. Dedication of a site as an ILWR provides a

high level of protection for land in Illinois, and is granted only to natural areas of important ecological
quality.
The proposed Jens Jensen ILWR is an approximately 220 acre portion of the preserves located in the
Village of Palatine in northwest Cook County. The site consists of remnant woods, along with
reconstructed prairie and wetlands. Formal ecological management of the site began in the late 2000's as
mitigation for work performed by Openlands and volunteers in connection with the O’Hare Airport
expansion. Currently the site exhibits mature oak woodlands with massive red and bur oaks, as well as a
large prairie reconstruction that harbors over 200 species.

The understory and ground layer vegetation

contain many conservative species, including some listed species.
The Forest Preserves of Cook County (“FPCC”) currently has 23 dedicated Nature Preserves and 2 Land
and Water Reserves. The addition of Jens Jensen ILWR would bring the FPCC's total INPC protected
lands to approximately 7,900 acres.
It is respectfully requested that authority be granted to the FPCC to submit Jens Jensen Grassland and
Woodland to the Illinois Nature Preserve Commission for review and formal dedication as an Illinois
Land and Water Reserve.
