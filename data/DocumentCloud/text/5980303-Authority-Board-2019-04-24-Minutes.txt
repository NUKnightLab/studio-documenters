April 24th ICJIA Board Meeting

The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority’s (ICJIA) Quarterly Board Meeting will be held
Wednesday, April 24th, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 pm. at the Illinois Criminal Justice Information
Authority, located at 300 West Adams, Suite 200, in Chicago. All ICJIA Board meetings are subject to
the Open Meetings Act. Members of the general public are encouraged to attend.
ICJIA’s statutorily-created oversight Board serves a unique and vital role in improving the state’s public
safety outcomes. Composed of state and local public safety officials, policy experts, and community
leaders, the Board is designed to embody and represent the state’s criminal justice system. Members are
tasked with setting agency priorities, tracking the progress of ongoing programs, and overseeing the
agency’s grant-making. To that end, ICJIA’s quarterly Board meetings bring research and practical
insights to bear on important and emerging issues affecting public safety in Illinois, with the goal of
identifying how the agency should address them through research and grant-making.
At the April Board meeting, executive staff will provide members with updates on the agency’s work.
The primary focus of the Board meeting will be two-fold. First, Board members will be briefed on the
ICJIA grant making process and agency’s financial health. As part of this discussion, staff will provide an
overview of the Governor’s proposed budget for the agency, the agency’s fiscal well-being associated
with the its grant making process, and proposed recommendations from staff moving forward.
The second part of the meeting will focus on our upcoming Justice Assistant Grant (JAG) planning
efforts. States are required to submit a three-year strategic plan for their uses of JAG funds to the U.S.
Bureau of Justice Assistance. Our next plan is due this summer. Staff will provide an overview of the
planning process and timeline as well as our current funding portfolio. Staff will be recommending that
the Board approve the creation of an ad hoc committee to assist in this planning effort.
We look forward to your participation and guidance.

Re:

Fiscal Health and Budget Update

State Fiscal Year 2020 Budget
The Governor’s proposed SFY20 ICJIA budget is largely the same as the enacted SFY19 budget.
Changes include the following:
 Increased funding to support personnel that covers bargaining unit step increases, 2 new
FSGU staff, and additional General Revenue to allow flexibility in staff assignments.
 Two new lines under fund 335 based upon new legislation:
o HB 5513/PA 100-647 creates a new scratch-off ticket for State police memorials.
The funds are to be distributed equally to the Chicago Police Memorial Foundation
Fund, the Police Memorial Committee Fund, and the Illinois State Police Memorial
Park Fund.
o HB 4594/PA 100-987 makes sweeping changes to deposit of revenues from court
fines and fees. ICJIA is to distribute the funds equally to the Department of State
Police drug task forces and Illinois Metropolitan Enforcement Groups.
 Funding for street intervention programs moved from Cure Violence at UIC to
Metropolitan Family Services. If enacted, Metropolitan Family Services will become a
new Lead Entity for ICJIA.
 Roughly a $2 million increase to Community Based Violence Prevention Programs.
 Increased funding under fund 488, which reflects an anticipated ramp up in VOCA
spending.
Compliance Audit
On January 29, 2019, the Auditor General completed its Compliance Examination of ICJIA for the
two years ended June 30, 2017. Common themes in the report included failure to conduct
adequate site visits, failure to prepare and maintain documentation, inadequate internal controls,
and non-appointment of Board members. ICJIA staff have been working diligently to identify and
implement corrective actions. In total, there were 10 material and 3 immaterial findings. You can
find the full report here: http://www.auditor.illinois.gov/recent-audits-01-29-19.asp.

Re:

Office of General Counsel update

The Office of General Counsel (OGC)’s work is essential to all aspects of ICJIA’s operations,
grant-making, and research work. OGC advises the executive director and staff on legal,
compliance, and legislative issues and oversees the administration of the over $100 million in grant
funds that pass through ICJIA. OGC has four attorneys who work on drafting and reviewing the
myriad interagency agreements, grant agreements, and contracts entered into by ICJIA and its
grantees. OGC attorneys advise, train, and draft policies on the varied and ever-evolving landscape
of state and federal rules and requirements, including grant-making rules, FOIA, Institutional
Review Board compliance, privacy issues, and criminal record appeals.
As a snapshot, OGC’s current work includes:








Beginning to review and approve the high volume of grant agreements coming to ICJIA
amidst the state fiscal year crunch.
Advising on the creation and improvement of ICJIA-administered Victims of Crime Act
grant programs.
Negotiating interagency agreements with other state agencies to meet ICJIA’s operational
needs.
Advising ICJIA staff on compliance audit corrective action plans.
Drafting boiler agreements for new grants.
Creating policies, procedures, and documents for ICJIA grantees who pass on their work to
sub-grantees.
Advising on an assortment of specific grantee-related issues.

OGC also monitors bills introduced by legislators involving the agency. Included with this memo
is the list of bills we continue to monitor and the projected impact on agency operations.

DISCRIMINATION

Creates the Racial Impact Note Act. Provides that every bill which has or could have
a disparate impact on racial and ethnic minorities, upon the request of any member,
shall have prepared for it before second reading in the house of introduction a brief
explanatory statement or note that shall include a reliable estimate of the anticipated
impact the bill would have on racial and ethnic minorities.

ICJIA does not currently have the
research and legal staff to complete
this function given how the agency is
currently funded.

SB1957

Provides the Comptroller shall transfer from the General Revenue Fund to the
Justice Reinvestment Fund 85% of the total savings calculated by the Sentencing
Policy Advisory Council from criminal justice reforms enacted into law. Provides
that funds left unclaimed due to a qualifying county failing to submit an application
or meet the specified criteria shall be reallocated to the counties that, based on the
determination of the DHS and ICJIA, have been most effective in using funds to
improve public health and safety. Provides that counties receiving funds shall submit
an annual report to the Department of Human Services and ICJIA detailing the uses
of the funds and the impact they have had on public health and safety.
Provides that in any case in which a person dies while in the custody of: (1) any law
enforcement agency, (2) a local or state correctional facility, or (3) a peace officer or
as a result of a peace officer's use of force, the law enforcement agency shall
investigate and report the death in writing to the Illinois Criminal Justice Information
Authority no later than 30 days after the date on which the person in custody or
incarcerated died.

 

ICJIA would be required to develop
and collect a data report to capture
these data. Given current funding,
ICJIA does not have the research staff
to complete this function.

Violence Against Women Act
Funded programs: 24
Total designated: $4,932,656
Congress first passed the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in 1994 and reauthorized the
Act in 2000. With a reauthorization in 2005, Congress began a new initiative of the S.T.O.P.
(Services * Training * Officers * Prosecutors) VAWA program by authorizing grants to states
for programs that would improve the response of the criminal justice system to female victims of
sexual assault and domestic violence. The program’s objectives include:




Providing services to women who are victims of sexual assault and domestic violence.
Developing, implementing, and evaluating a plan for training police, prosecutors, judges,
circuit clerks, probation officers, and service providers to promote an interdisciplinary
approach to sexual assault and domestic violence.
Implementing measures that document and assess the response of criminal justice
agencies in Illinois to sexual assault and domestic violence.

 
 

 Violence Against Women Act - Sexual Assault Services Programs
Funded programs: 1
Total designated: $503,870
The Violence Against Women Act Sexual Assault Services Program supports the provision of
hotline, advocacy, counseling, and outreach services to adults and children at 33 local victim
service agencies across Illinois.

State Programs
Adult Redeploy Illinois
Funded programs: 26
Total designated: $8,221,259
The Adult Redeploy Illinois (ARI) program was created by the Act to increase alternatives to
incarceration for non-violent offenders. Research shows that non-violent offenders are more
effectively rehabilitated in community settings, which are also less expensive than prison. ARI
provides grants to local jurisdictions to expand their capacity to safely supervise non-violent
offenders in the community by investing in evidence-based practices shown to reduce
recidivism. In exchange for grant funding, sites agree to reduce by 25 percent the number of nonviolent offenders they send to the Illinois Department of Corrections from their target
populations.
Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention
Funded programs: 17
Total designated: $6,937,499.90
Community-Based Violence Intervention and Prevention services programs support
the following activities:
1. Convene or expand an existing community coalition to engage service providers,
governmental agencies (local and/or statewide agencies), law enforcement, faith-based, and
general community members to ensure that service providers and all potential participants are
aware of violence prevention resources available in community; develop collaborative
partnerships to ensure that clients’ immediate needs are met; and provide pro-social activities
for the community.
2. Educate the public about program services through wide distribution and various types of
program materials, public presentations and awareness events.
3. Provide at least one of the four following direct services:
o Street Intervention/Interruption-Active Outreach and Engagement – These programs
provide crisis intervention and de-escalation of high stress situations to at-risk youth
and young adults.
o Counseling and Therapy – These developmentally and culturally appropriate
therapeutic services are provided by a mental health professional.

 
 

 Case Management – Case management approaches that are more effective at longterm client retention and developing trust between agency and youth/families require
actively engaging participants (i.e., active reaching out, meeting youth/families in the
home, community engagement).
o Youth Development – Engaging young people to develop their emotional, physical,
social, and intellectual selves provides opportunities for youth to practice conflict
resolution and prosocial life skills.
o

Community-Law Enforcement Partnership for Deflection and Substance Abuse Treatment
Funded programs: 6
Total designated: $420,573
The Community-Law Enforcement Partnership for Deflection and Substance Abuse Treatment
program helps law enforcement to develop and implement deflection programs that offer
immediate pathways to substance use treatment as an alternative to involvement in the criminal
justice system.
Ceasefire
Funded programs: 1
Total designated: $5,484,870
The mission of Ceasefire Illinois, a unit at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public
Health, is to work with community and government partners to reduce violence in all forms and
help design interventions required to better define what should be included in a community or
city anti-violence plan. Growing up in communities where violence is an everyday occurrence,
youth learn that violence is normal and are thus more likely to use violence or become victims of
violence. Ceasefire staff members work to engage this population. Staff members will help
change their behavior and connect them to resources that would otherwise be out of reach.
Death Penalty Abolition Act
Funded programs: 2
Total designated: $244,123
The Death Penalty Abolition Fund was created by Public Act 725 ILCS 5/119(b). The Act
required transfer of all unobligated and unexpended moneys remaining in the Capital Litigation
Trust Fund to the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority to be used for services for
families of victims of homicide or murder and for training of law enforcement personnel.
Duane Dean Behavioral Health Center Fund
Funded programs: 1
Total designated: $400,000
The Duane Dean Behavioral Health Center’s Community Diversion Program seeks to employ a
broad based comprehensive approach in Kankakee County to educate and increase access to
services to the local criminal justice systems, the local community and the opioid dependent
individuals. This program will incorporate community education and trainings, cognitive
 
 

 behavioral counseling, medication-assisted therapy (MAT), case managers, peer support
specialist, and recovery coaches.
Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Councils
Funded programs: 10
Total designated: $429,950
Family Violence Coordinating Councils, at both state and local/circuit levels, establish a forum
to improve the institutional, professional, and community response to family violence, including
intimate partner abuse, child abuse, abuse against people with disabilities, and elder abuse. The
councils engage in education and prevention as well as coordination of intervention and services
for victims and perpetrators. They work to improve the administration of justice when addressing
family violence.
Prescription Pill and Drug Disposal
Funded programs: 1
Total designated: $150,000
In order to facilitate the safe disposal of drugs, the Illinois General Assembly passed Public Act
097-0545, which established the Prescription Pill and Drug Disposal Fund, a special fund in the
state treasury. The Act states, “monies in the Fund shall be used for grants by the Illinois
Criminal Justice Information Authority to local law enforcement agencies for the purpose of
facilitating the collection, transportation, and incineration of pharmaceuticals from residential
sources that are collected and transported by law enforcement agencies. These funds will be used
to procure drug disposal boxes and arrange for their delivery to priority sites. Recipient agencies
will agree to follow this standard procedure for the receipt, storage, and disposal of the collected
drugs.
Safer Foundation Fund
Funded programs: 1
Total designated: $500,000
The Safer Foundation (SF) partnership with Mount Sinai Hospital’s Sinai Urban Health Institute
(SUHI) seeks to better understand the issues connected to gun violence in Chicago’s west side
communities. As a referral partner, SUHI seeks to work with SF to build their previous study of
non-fatal gun violence victims who are treated and discharged quickly. The goal is to refer such
persons for SF services and to identify their social needs, gaps, resources and barriers to
employment and workforce development comparing those with and those without
arrest/conviction records.

Ms. Bereziewicz stated a quorum had been achieved. Chair Robb stated the minutes were
not on the agenda and they would be approved at the next Board meeting.
Chairman’s Remarks
Ms. Robb said she would make her remarks at the end of the meeting and turned the floor
over to Director Maki.
Executive Director’s Report
Director Maki said the goal of the meeting was to shed light on ICJIA’s work on Trauma
Recovery Centers. He also discussed some basic guidelines on Board participation and
the importance of attending the quarterly meetings. He referred members to a committee
memo on strengthening Board member participation.
Authority Financial Report
Ms. Weis reported ICJIA made about $40 million in grant expenditures year to date for
State Fiscal Year 2019 (through November 30, 2018). She said 80 percent of the
expenditures were federally funded and 20 percent were state grants. A total of $20
million of these expenditures were made in November 2018, she reported.
Mr. Maki thanked the Federal & State Grants Unit for their hard work. He then
introduced ICJIA’s newest Board member, Metra Police Chief Joseph Perez.
Committee Reports
No committee reports
Trauma Recovery Center Presentation
Mr. Maki introduced Dr. Houston-Kolnik for an overview of Trauma Recovery Centers.
He said one goal of Victims of Crime Act funding was not just to strengthen services but
to expand services to victims who are hard to reach with traditional services. He said it is
difficult to serve the underserved population using traditional services and that few

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Authority Board Meeting
December 11, 2018
Page 3

 effective models exist to reach underserved populations, most of whom are young
victims, people of color, and victims of gun and community violence. He said a
commitment to developing and offering a research- and evidence-informed set of
programs to address underserved victims has been lacking.
He said the Trauma Recovery Center (TRC) in San Francisco is one of few evidenceinformed models, community-based and designed to serve those who are hard to reach
and have experienced victimization. He said he and staff visited the center in 2017 and
that the center’s Dr. Alicia Boccellari and her team offered their time and expertise to
help them understand how the model operates.
Dr. Houston-Kolnik presented on trauma and barriers to help-seeking in the areas of
awareness, accessibility, cultural beliefs, previous experiences, and the impact of
disadvantages and trauma. She defined the differences between traditional services,
where the victims are responsible for seeking services for trauma they have experienced
and services provided at a TRC. She said TRCs offer more inclusive services to victims,
the model incorporates more relationship building, and victims meet with their case
managers where they feel most comfortable.
Ms. Hora noted some traditional services have components of TRCs.
Dr. Houston-Kolnik said notice of funding opportunity development took staff
approximately eight months, but that it took a full year to understand the process from a
theoretical perspective. She said the three phases of the designed TRC program include a
coordination period, implementation period, and external evaluation.
Ms. Hora asked how many applications were received; Dr. Houston-Kolnik responded
eight were received.
Director Maki then introduced Ms. Brennan, Ms. McCafferty, Mr. Bromley, Ms.
Lochbaum, Dr. Trang, and Dr. Smith for a panel discussion on TRCs. The panelists said
the TRC process was time-consuming and laborious to get started, but having a model to
follow was helpful. Panelists said they are working to be able to sustain the program after
the three-year funding period.
Mr. Turpeau asked whether victims needed a referral for TRC services and Ms.
Lochbaum said anyone seeking services would receive help.
Dr. Olson asked the panel if they felt they were reaching the victims. Dr. Smith said
Advocate is working through social services to reach those who need help. Director Maki
asked the panel to discuss how they are engaging victims who need services. Panelists

 described some of the cases where participants experienced severe trauma and the fears
they have surrounding their safety and how their fears were addressed.
Director Maki thanked the panelists for sharing their experiences.
Public Comment
Judge Robb invited members of the public to comment.
Ms. Pamela Perrilles, executive director of CASA-10th Circuit, thanked OSF for the
work they do with families in Peoria. She said there are not a lot of attorneys available to
represent children who are victims in Peoria County.
Mari Christopherson, executive director of Illinois CASA, said one year ago, $2.1 million
was awarded to 11 Illinois CASA programs. She said there are 31 CASA programs, but
many did not apply because of many of the issues discussed in the meeting –they didn’t
have the capacity to plan and did not think they could get up to speed to implement the
program. She said more integrated services to serve victims are needed.
With public comment over, Judge Robb read a statement. She thanked Director Maki, for
his service to ICJIA and the State of Illinois. She said under his leadership, ICJIA and
staff had evolved and improved and that she was grateful to have worked with him over
the last few years.
Adjourn
Chair Robb asked for a motion to adjourn the meeting. Ms. Josh made a motion to
adjourn. The motion was seconded by Ms. Hora. The meeting was adjourned at 1:05 p.m.

 Leadership Panel: A Resilient and Trauma-Informed Illinois
Research Director Dr. Megan Alderden welcomed the panelists and introduced the topic of
trauma-informed services. She explained that trauma, often conceptualized as adverse childhood
experiences (or ACEs), can cause psychological harm to the victim and manifest in chronic
health problems, depression, alcoholism and substance use, low graduate rates, academic
underachievement, lost work time, and criminal conduct. She initiated a discussion with the
panelists on what it means to be trauma-informed and why it is important.
Director John Maki quoted Chicago Beyond Executive Director Liz Dozier, who described being
trauma-informed as moving from a framework where service providers ask, “What’s wrong with
you?” to one where they ask, “What happened to you?” He said government has a responsibility
to understand the influence it has on funded organizations and also give them time to collaborate,
plan, implement, research, and evolve. Rushing those steps heightens the risk of re-traumatizing
victims, he said. Lifespan Policy Director Jennifer Greene added that training all members of an
organization, even those who do not work directly with victims, is necessary to become fully
trauma-informed.
Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence Executive Director Vickie Smith explained that in
the field of domestic violence, providing trauma-informed services means listening to and
treating the entire family, including the abuser. This practice is borne of the understanding that
all people have been through some sort of trauma, she said. UCAN Vice President of Violence
Intervention and Prevention Services Norman Kerr compared trauma-informed practices to how
a massage therapist asks which areas of their client’s body have had surgery or broken bones, so
they can understand which areas need to be treated gently.
Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault Executive Director Polly Poskin recommended the
book Trauma and Recovery by Dr. Judith Herman, which explains that children can come from
environments that destroy their sense of trust, autonomy, and identity, which leaves them illprepared for adulthood. Ms. Poskin described how we meet these victims as young adults and
rather than comparing them to their well-adjusted peers, service providers need to meet them
where to properly address their trauma. Ms. Smith said no one achieves anything alone and that
walking alongside victims to understand what they need will help them move forward.
Dr. Alderden then asked for input on creating a statewide effort while recognizing that services
should be locally informed.
Children’s Advocacy Centers of Illinois Executive Director Kim Mangiaracino said her
organization achieves the best responses by participating in multi-disciplinary teams, which
ensure that systems that work in partnership with service providers also are trauma-informed.

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Regular Board Meeting
August 22, 2018
Page 2

 Ms. Greene noted that while the Guiding Principles of Trauma-Informed Care have been
available for many years from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,
further guidance on their implementation is needed. Understanding that people cannot be
categorized solely by “caused harm” and “received harm” is key to the adoption of these
principles, she said. She also asserted that trauma is not usually resolved in a few months and
that funding timelines need to reflect the long-term needs of clients.
Director Maki said that in a state that is so diverse and decentralized, collaboration is the only
way to move toward this goal. He added that in his experience, face-to-face contact helps
dissipate adversarial attitudes.
Ms. Poskin encouraged the Board to remember that government is not an entity separate from the
people, because that attitude belittles the public’s responsibility to enact change. Mr. Kerr
reminded the Board and panel that when citizens do not feel represented by the government, they
are likely to disengage rather than become empowered and involved in advocacy.
Dr. Alderden asked the panel for thoughts on next steps and to identify anticipated barriers.
Ms. Smith highlighted the need for research to examine how trauma affects human biology
throughout the life course and how to integrate the findings into practice.
Ms. Poskin noted that while people of color are more likely to be victims of crime, inequity, and
oppression, services often were provided by white people whose perspective can be a disservice
to victims even when they’re driven by compassion. Mr. Kerr added that cultural competency
should not be limited to race and ethnicity and should include generational understanding. In
addition to compassion, he said, training to compartmentalize and manage biases is key.
Mr. Kerr also explained that resiliency can be misinterpreted, especially in children, partially
because they can physically recover so quickly. He said those who work with youth outside of a
service setting may not have the clinically prescribed tools to identify and address trauma. He
said there will never have enough clinicians, so society needs to take responsibility for asking
intimidating questions in a safe way, he said.
Dr. Alderden summarized the panel’s discussion on how Illinois could become a traumainformed state:
1. Comprehensive training. Training on trauma for service providers as well as other
practitioners (e.g., criminal justice and education stakeholders).
a. The training should build cultural competencies.
b. The training should include ways to help people be self-aware of their
experiences, privileges, and prejudices and how this might impact their views,
understandings, and approaches.

 2. Acknowledge historical trauma. Recognize and acknowledge the impact of historical
trauma and the role government has played in creating and reinforcing it.
3. Increase access to long-term services. Fund in a manner that allows for longer-term
services. It takes time to build the relationships needed for people to disclose their
victimization experiences and address its impact.
4. Provide space for community voice. Engage residents of the neighborhoods being
served; consider what and how being trauma-informed will assist them in building
collective efficacy and strengthening their communities.
5. Use a multidisciplinary approach. Encourage adoption of multidisciplinary team
approaches. MDT approaches can increase impact of training, buy-in, and sustainability.
6. Identify trauma and consider its impact. It is important for individuals to identify,
acknowledge, and consider the impact of trauma. This starts with being willing to screen
for trauma and then building appropriate responses.
7. Build a systematic approach. Make sure all parts of the system are aware of and
consider trauma in everyday responses.
8. Fund research that informs practice. Fund research that furthers the understanding of
trauma and what victims need. Use results to aid program growth and modification.
Public Comment
Chair Robb open the floor to public comment.
Arkhawara Salih from Apna Gar related her experience of working with domestic violence and
gender-based violence outside of the United States, and asked that ICJIA assists providers in
finding resources to work with all victims, including the abuser.
Ashley Miller of BUILD seconded Ms. Salih’s comments, requesting that grants be allowed to
fund services for victims and offenders, as well as preventative services for youth who have not
been explicitly identified as victims through the traditional criminal justice system intercepts. He
added that the voices in this conversation need to reflect the people being served.
Adjourn
Director Maki invited other members of the public to comment. Seeing none, he requested a
motion to adjourn. Mr. Kibler moved to adjourn and Ms. Hora seconded. The meeting was
adjourned at 11:58 p.m.
