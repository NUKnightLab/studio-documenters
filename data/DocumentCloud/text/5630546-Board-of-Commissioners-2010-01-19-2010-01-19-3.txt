RECOMMENDATION TO ADOPT THE CAPITAL FUND STIMULUS GRANT
PROCUREMENT POLICY
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners:
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners (“Board”) adopt the attached Capital Funds
Stimulus Grant Procurement Policy.
FUNDING SUMMARY
Not Applicable

EXPLANATION
In 2003 HUD determined that CHA’s Procurement Procedures Manual and Policy, as approved
by the Board, was in compliance with the HUD Annual Contributions Contract (“ACC”), HUD
Procurement Regulations as set forth in 24 CFR 85.36, HUD Handbook 7460.8 and
modifications in accordance with the CHA/HUD MTW Agreement. Therefore, CHA was
approved to self-certify that it was in compliance with Federal procurement regulations without
having to obtain prior approval from HUD pursuant to 24 CFR 85.36(g)(3)(ii). An amendment
to CHA’s Procurement Procedures Manual and Policy is necessary to comply with HUD Notice
PIH 2009 – 12(HA) issued, which requires housing authorities to amend their procurement
standards and polices to expedite and facilitate the use of Capital Stimulus Grant Funds. Further,
the amendment is required to be labeled “Capital Funds Stimulus Grant Procurement Policy”.
The amendments to CHA’s Procurement Procedures Manual and Policy addresses the following
requirements to comply with the American Recovery and Rehabilitation Act of 2009 (“ARRA”)
and deletes certain sections of the CHA Procurement Procedures Manual and Policy that are
inconsistent with 24 CFR 85.36:
1. “Buy American”. Section 1605 of ARRA requires that all projects using Capital Fund
Stimulus Grant funds use only iron, steel and manufactured goods produced in the U.S.
unless otherwise excepted by or pursuant to the Act.
2. State and local laws shall not apply to procurement of goods and services utilizing
Capital Fund Stimulus Grant funds and housing authorities shall instead follow 24 CFR
85.36.
3. Housing authorities shall amend their procurement standards and policies, as necessary,
in order to expedite and facilitate the use of Capital Fund Stimulus Grant funds and
remove any procurement standards that are inconsistent with 24 CFR 85.36 or ARRA.
Based on the foregoing, it is recommended that the Capital Funds Stimulus Grant Procurement
Policy be adopted.
