ADMINISTRATIVE REPORT
Election Rules
Mr. Walsh reviewed a draft of the 2018 Active Employee Trustee Election Rules and noted the tentative date for the
election was Wednesday, October 17, 2018 from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. The Trustees agreed to have Trustees Roa,
Hamburger and LoVerde serve as the members of the Election Committee for the upcoming election.
It was moved by Trustee LoVerde, seconded by Trustee Capasso, to adopt the 2018 Trustee Election Rules as amended
in the meeting. See attached document.
Roll-call:

For -- Trustees Roa, Keane, LoVerde, Hamburger and Capasso.
Against -- None.

Tier 3 Normal Cost Calculations
Mr. Walsh reported that Aon Consulting had completed its calculations of the Tier 3 Normal Cost used in establishing
the employee contribution rate as required under Public Act 100-0023 for affected employees. Aon’s calculations
concluded the combined Normal Cost as a percentage of pensionable payroll for Tier 3 members, and Tier 2 members
who have elected the Tier 3 benefit and contribution structure, is 16.78%. Mr. Walsh noted that since this percentage
of pensionable salary is greater than 11.5%, the contribution rate for Tier 3 members should be 11.5% in 2019. See
attached exhibit.
Legislative Matters
This item was taken out of order. Mr. Walsh informed the Board that House Bill 4811, which includes provisions
affecting LABF, had been sent to the governor on June 22, 2018 and that the governor has 60 days to act upon the
bill otherwise it will automatically become law.
Tier 3 Receivables
Mr. Walsh updated the Board on the Tier 3 receivable matter which came about as a result of the implementation of
Public Act 100-0023. Mr. Walsh noted that, to date, just over half of the affected members had paid the retroactive
receivable. After discussing the matter, the Board decided against charging interest to the members who had not yet
paid the receivable and gave direction for Fund staff to offset at future dates the receivables for members who had
not yet paid.
Collection of Overpayments
Mr. Carroll updated the Board regarding the utilization of Markoff Law, hired on a contingency basis to assist LABF
in the collection of certain overpayments. Mr. Carroll reported on the outcomes of the first batch of cases which were
sent to Markoff.
Mr. Walsh requested that the Board give LABF staff permission to proceed in this manner with additional cases and
to grant staff the authority to collect overpayments in this manner as part of LABF’s normal collection process.

 LABORERS’ & RETIREMENT BOARD EMPLOYEES’
ANNUITY & BENEFIT FUND OF CHICAGO
July 24, 2018
The Board gave direction to proceed with this process and requested Fund staff provide periodic reports on collection
status. The Board also requested that LABF staff continue to notify the Board of any suspicion of fraud involving
overpayments.
Miscellaneous
Member Transfer Matter - Mr. Walsh discussed a letter from an LABF member who requested to transfer some of his
pension service credits from LABF to the General Assembly Retirement System pursuant to Section 11-125.1 of the
Illinois Pension Code. The Board reviewed the applicable sections of the law and discussed the matter with staff and
with Fund Counsel. Following the discussion, the Trustees directed Fund Counsel to prepare a formal write-up on the
matter and report back to the Board at a future meeting. The Board directed staff to reply to the member stating that
the LABF is further reviewing the matter.

LEGAL REPORT
Johnson Litigation
Mr. Donham reported that Fund Counsel had filed a brief on behalf of the Fund regarding Mr. Krislov’s request to the
court to receive attorney fees in the Johnson Litigation. Mr. Donham said that Mr. Krislov was asking for a portion of
the annuitant’s 3% automatic annual increase to cover his fees. Mr. Donham noted that Plaintiffs in the Johnson case
are opposed to Mr. Krislov’s request for fees in this matter.

 ELECTION RULES continued
In the event that active employee participant status cannot be verified by an Election Judge, the employee may
elect to cast a vote via a provisional ballot. The Election Committee will make a final determination regarding
the eligibility of any voter required to vote via a provisional ballot as specified in paragraph 18.
15. Voting. All voting shall take place in the designated area of the building located at 321 North Clark Street,
Chicago, Illinois 60654 on Wednesday, October 17, 2018 between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. The

16. Procedure. Participants requesting a ballot must identify themselves at the voter identification check-in station
by means of a valid driver's license, a valid state ID, Chicago municipal ID (CityKey), a valid passport or
employee ID which bears the active employee member’s photo. Any form of identification that is expired is not
considered valid and shall not be accepted.
Upon verification of voter eligibility, each ballot shall be initialed by an Election Judge before such ballot is given
to the voter and no ballot shall be counted which has not been so initialed.
Eligible voters may cast one vote in the following manner: (1) select only one candidate on the ballot by marking
the ballot as instructed, (2) insert the completed ballot into the locked ballot box.
Only votes cast on an official 2018 LABF Ballot will be counted.
17. Spoiled Ballot. If a ballot is damaged by a voter, a replacement ballot may be requested from an Election Judge.
The original ballot will be deemed spoiled and invalidated. It will not be counted.
18. Provisional Ballots. At times, questions may arise regarding who is or is not eligible to vote in an Active
Employee Trustee Election at the LABF. When voter eligibility is unclear, individuals may receive a “Provisional
Ballot.” The following are the rules and procedures established for individuals who will be casting votes via a Provisional
Ballot:
a. To cast a Provisional Ballot, a valid driver’s license, state ID, Chicago municipal ID (CityKey), passport or
employee ID which bears the active employee participant’s photo must be presented to an Election Judge.
b. Provisional Ballots are sealed in an envelope bearing the voter’s name, address and the last 4 digits of
the voter’s Social Security Number as provided by the voter.
c.

Provisional Ballot envelopes are deposited into the locked election box with all regular ballots.

d. Election Judges will make a reasonable effort to determine voter eligibility prior to the counting of votes.
e. After voting has ended, only Regular Ballots will be removed from the ballot box and counted. The ballot
box, still containing the Provisional Ballots, will be relocked.
f.

In the event that the number of votes separating the leading and second place candidates is greater than
the number of total Provisional Ballots cast, no Provisional Ballots will be opened, and the candidate
receiving the most votes will be declared the winner.

g. In the event that the number of votes separating the leading and second place candidates is less than or
equal to the number of total Provisional Ballots cast, all Provisional Ballot envelopes will be removed from
the ballot box and separated into the following three (3) categories by the Election Judges:
i. “Denied,” defined as ballots cast by individuals confirmed to be ineligible to vote.
ii. “Approved,” defined as ballots cast by individuals confirmed to be eligible to vote.
iii. “Undetermined,” defined as ballots cast by individuals for whom eligibility could not be
determined before closing of the polls.
h. The Election Committee will verify that all Provisional Ballots are classified correctly.
i.

Provisional Ballots deemed “Denied” will be set aside. They will not be opened.

j.

In the event that the number of votes separating the leading and second place candidates is greater than
the number of remaining Provisional Ballots (“Approved” and “Undetermined”) cast, no remaining
Provisional Ballots will be opened, and the candidate receiving the most votes will be declared the winner.

l.

Approved Provisional Ballots may only be opened by an Election Judge in the presence of at least one

the number of total “Undetermined” Provisional Ballots cast, no “Undetermined” Provisional Ballots will be
opened, and the candidate receiving the most votes will be declared the winner.

equal to the number of total “Undetermined” Provisional Ballots cast, counting of ballots will be suspended
