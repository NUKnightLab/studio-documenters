1. Jordan Miller provided updates on his work with social media and window works.

a. DG suggests begin with one resident
b. SSA staff will look into if this is feasible with funding
3. Plaques not funded by SSA could simply state “plaque funded by SSA #33”, and still list “WPB
Arts.com”.

this large will not occur in the future.
