RE: PrOperty Sale by Development Agreement Midtown West Project
Request for Authorization to Amend 2018-19 Budget
Appropriation #20611 Midtown West Park Improvements

Honorable City Council:

The Planning Development Department has received an offer from PDH
Development Group LLC a Michigan limited liability company, to purchase certain
City-owned real property at 831 and 931 Selden and 830 and 960 Brainard, Detroit, MI (the
?Properties?) for the purchase price of One Million Eight Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars
(the ?Purchase Price?).

The Properties will be developed by PDH as part of the City?s Midtown West Project, which is
within the boundaries of the former Wigle Play?eld Recreation Center site that is now comprised
of vacant land Site?). The City split the MW Site into: 1) four development sites that
include the Properties, 2) a l-acre site at 910 Brainard for construction of a new City park (?New
Park?) and 3) land set aside to rededicate and construct 4th Street and Tuscola Avenue to continue
through the MW Site. A separate street dedication resolution and street construction contract will
be brought before this Honorable Body to address such new streets.

PDH proposes to construct the four development sites on the Properties in two Phases with an
investment of just over $70 million. Phase 1, to be constructed on 831 and 931 Selden, will
include: 1) a for-rent, mixed-income residential development with on-site parking and retail space
and 2) a for-sale residential development with on-site parking and retail space. Phase 2, to be
constructed on 830 and 960 Brainard, will include two separate for?sale residential developments,
each with separate on-site parking. Currently, the Properties are within a SD2 zoning district
(Special Development District, Mixed Use). proposed use of the Properties is consistent
with the allowable uses for which the Properties are zoned.

As part of the Midtown West Project, PDH has participated in a voluntary community engagement
process facilitated by that included a Neighborhood Advisory Council. has
completed a Midtown West Community Bene?ts Agreement Report (the Report?) as a result
of such process and PDH has agreed to the terms of a Community Bene?ts Agreement (the 
Agreement?) with respect to certain matters contained in the CB Report. Both the CB Report and
CB Agreement are provided with the attached resolution.
