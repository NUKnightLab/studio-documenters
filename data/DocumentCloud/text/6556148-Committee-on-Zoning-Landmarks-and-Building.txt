The Applicant is seeking 0 Zoning Map Amendment in order to permit the
physical expansion of the existing one-story commercial?retail (yoga studio)
building (3,350.44 square feet Approx..), commonly identified as 1845 North
Milwaukee Avenue, which yoga studio is presently non-conforming under the
current Zoning Ordinance. Part of the expansion plan calls for the erection of a
new five-story addition (6,329.16 square feet Approx..), at the rear of the existing
commercial?retail building, which will be for the exclusive use of the existing yoga
studio. The proposed expansion plan also features multiple levels of outdoor
amenity and practice space, for the yoga studio, as well as the provision of
internal (garage) parking for at least three (3) vehicles, within the grade-level of
the existing building at the rear. *[There is currently zero off-street vehicular
parking at the site.) The subject property is located within L320 linear feet of the
entrance to the Milwaukee?Western Avenue CTA Train Station, and therefore,
the expansion plan qualifies for reduced vehicular parking, pursuant to the Transit
Oriented Development (TOD) Ordinance, though no vehicular parking is required
for this use at this site, even as expanded. The existing one-story camash facility
(2,205 square feet Approx.) will remain unchanged. The existing building, with the
proposed five-story addition, will be masonry and steel in construction and will
measure 69 feet-l0 inches in height.
