20· · · ·MS. O'MALLEY:· I'm general counsel for the
21· ·Police Department.
22· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Okay.· So, Mr. Foreman, I
23· ·actually took your advice that you said that the
24· ·lawyer from the City say that I had to go back in

 ·1· ·front of the judge to get permission to release my
·2· ·son's DNA.· I actually did that.· They know better
·3· ·and they know that that's not what the judge state.
·4· · · · · · ·So here it is clear, I have it right here
·5· ·her statement.· I'm not going to read it all
·6· ·because I only have two minutes.
·7· · · · · · ·The Court did not intend for the order to
·8· ·preclude Ms. Mitchell from pursuing DNA evidence or
·9· ·attacking, including requests the DNA swabs in an
10· ·alternate form through another method or at a later
11· ·date.
12· · · · · · ·To eliminate any possible ambiguity, the
13· ·Court clarifies that in its August 27, 2013, orders
14· ·squashes plaintiff's deposition subpoenas cannot be
15· ·used as grounds to deny any effort of Ms. Mitchell
16· ·to collect, test, or otherwise receive DNA swabs or
17· ·evidence related to her son Izael Jackson.
18· · · · · · ·So the City is giving me the run around.
19· ·I come here every month and I ask for my son's DNA.
20· ·It's mine, it belongs to me.· Here's the order from
21· ·the judge, clear.· They know better.· They lied on
22· ·that stand, they said the State Police had that
23· ·DNA.· Now it has come out that the State Police
24· ·never had that DNA.· It's been in CPD custody for

 ·1· ·nine years.
·2· · · · · · ·Then they turned around and tried to use
·3· ·what happened in court to eliminate me from getting
·4· ·his DNA.· I want to know what is so precious about
·5· ·his DNA.· Is it gold?· Because when everything
·6· ·else) was released, this should have been released.
·7· · · · · · ·And I want to know how could you find him
·8· ·justified without having all the pieces to this
·9· ·puzzle.· Because from my understanding, before
10· ·internal affairs was supposed to close this case,
11· ·everything that the CPD -- anything that they
12· ·investigate or took from my son was supposed to
13· ·have been submitted.
14· · · · · · ·How would this big old piece of puzzle
15· ·end up mysteriously left out?· How was they able to
16· ·make a decision and say that the police is
17· ·justified without even going through all the
18· ·evidence?
19· · · ·MS. SWEENEY:· I would suggest going back to the
20· ·judge and asking for a specific court order.· Be
21· ·more specific.
22· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· You want me to hand this to you?
23· · · ·MS. SWEENEY:· I'm not asking -24· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· You want me to hand it to you?

 ·1· · · ·MS. SWEENEY:· No.· You go back to the judge and
·2· ·ask for the order to be specific.
·3· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· No, it says it right here.· She
·4· ·did not tell you all.· You're using this judge to
·5· ·cover -·6· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Let me just be clear.
·7· ·We're the Police Board, so it's not we are not -·8· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Oh, well, she spoke.· She spoke
·9· ·when I was speaking with the City.· So she spoke.
10· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Right.· Because we are
11· ·trying to be helpful to get you the information.
12· ·It's been stuck.· So you asked us if we could try
13· ·to help it.
14· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· No.· I asked you before if you
15· ·could help me.· You told me that they say go in
16· ·front of the judge.· I went in front of the judge
17· ·April 22 of 2019.· I did what you said.· And this
18· ·is what the judge said.
19· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Right.
20· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· So now what is the problem?
21· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Right.· So it was helpful.
22· ·So the question that I would ask is, so since you
23· ·got that clarified from the judge, have you spoken
24· ·back to the City or --

 ·1· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Yes, yes.· They are still using
·2· ·the force.· I don't understand, if I put in a FOIA
·3· ·for this information, as the judge stated, it
·4· ·belongs to me.· It belongs to me.· I don't need a
·5· ·judge to tell you to give me anything that belongs
·6· ·to me.· It's my mine.· Anything that has anything
·7· ·to do with my son is mine.
·8· · · · · · ·What I'm getting is the run around.· And
·9· ·I didn't have to go back to them, they had the
10· ·lawyer there.· She told their lawyer also.· So they
11· ·already know what this is about.· What is the
12· ·problem?· Why can't we get this over with?· Give up
13· ·the DNA, let's get it tested.· It can be over with.
14· ·I'm puzzled.· The City know about this.· They had a
15· ·lawyer right there with me, a City lawyer was in
16· ·the same courtroom that I was in.· So why am I
17· ·constantly getting the run around?
18· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Can I ask you to wait until
19· ·after the meeting and let's speak, and I want to
20· ·see how we can assist to try to get you to someone
21· ·who can get this information.
22· · · · · · ·So just to be clear, the Police Board has
23· ·a couple of things we do.· We interview candidates
24· ·and present three candidates to the mayor when they

 ·1· ·are selecting a superintendent, and we handle
·2· ·discipline 30 days and over for police officers or
·3· ·for the police force.· That's what the Police Board
·4· ·is charged with doing, okay.
·5· · · · · · ·So if I ask you to stay, it's because we
·6· ·want to try to help get some answers for you.

I

·7· ·don't know the answers, right.· I don't know
·8· ·exactly where we should be doing to try to get -·9· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· You told me that before and I
10· ·convinced you and I went and I did it.
11· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Right.· That's correct.
12· ·That's correct.
13· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· So now here it is.
14· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· So now that you have some
15· ·information -16· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· I don't know why I'm still
17· ·waiting for it.· It's here.
18· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Ms. Mitchell, the same way
19· ·how when I got some information, I came back, I
20· ·said to you here is the information.· This
21· ·information is helpful.· This information can now
22· ·hopefully help me get you an answer faster.
23· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Okay.· But my whole thing is the
24· ·Police Board is here and you all are here and

 ·1· ·you're trying to gain trust with this City.· Am I
·2· ·correct?
·3· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· That's correct.
·4· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Okay, so in 2014, you had an
·5· ·investigate officer sit on the stand under oath.
·6· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Wait, wait.· The Police
·7· ·Board is not the group that had an investigating
·8· ·officer.
·9· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· But you can't gain trust with
10· ·the City and the CPD if they're lying.· Constantly.
11· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· I'm trying to explain to
12· ·you the Police Board, right.· So this is a forum
13· ·where you can come and you can ask for help.· So
14· ·what we're saying is that we want to try and assist
15· ·you to get the answers because we do want to build
16· ·the trust.· So I'm asking if you can wait and I can
17· ·get the information and I can ask some questions.
18· ·I don't know where to get the answers, right.

I

19· ·want to make sure you get the answers as well.
20· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· I appreciate that.· But it's
21· ·clear whatever they tell you, they are not going to

11· · · ·MS. CARREON:· My question is police report HW
12· ·388671.· I was raped in 2011 and 2013 by someone
13· ·who has always boasted that his father was the
14· ·Chief of Police.

17· · · ·MS. CARREON:· I was told -- I was raped in 2011
18· ·and 2013 by a man who has always boasted that his
19· ·father is the Chief of Police.
20· · · ·MS. SWEENEY:· Where?
21· · · ·MS. CARREON:· In Chicago.· At the time, I was
22· ·told by someone that know him that he uses cops to
23· ·get his information and gang members to silence his
24· ·victims.· At the time, I also spoke with a high

 ·1· ·level member of CPD who said that if I chose to
·2· ·press charges, he would ensure that it was handled
·3· ·properly.· Which I assume means through correct
·4· ·procedure.· However, I have now suffered harassment
·5· ·from this man for at least the last five years
·6· ·straight.
·7· · · · · · ·I made an appointment -- I tried to make
·8· ·an appointment from October onwards to go to give a
·9· ·full detailed statement; in other words, to press
10· ·charges.· I was delayed in making an appointment,
11· ·given the run around, eventually had an appointment
12· ·at the end of November.
13· · · · · · ·I took a witness with me· and we were
14· ·kept waiting until the appointment time and then
15· ·told that the detective had gone home, come back
16· ·tomorrow.· We then said, "Why can't you take the
17· ·statement, Sergeant Marconi?"· And he said, "I
18· ·don't know what it's about."· Then he said
19· ·something else, and he said, "Well, I do know what
20· ·it's about."· He said, "Well, it a hot potato,
21· ·isn't it?"· What does that mean?· First all off,
22· ·does anybody know what it means, a hot potato?
23· · · · · · ·So we had an appointment.· The witness
24· ·came with me, gave a statement for two hours, no

 ·1· ·notes were taken.· The detective said that he had
·2· ·67 other cases to look at and he can get back to
·3· ·me.
·4· · · · · · ·In the meantime, I did not know that my
·5· ·rapist had been told about this and had went to
·6· ·court to claim that, because I sent an email in
·7· ·2016, he claims that I falsified evidence in that
·8· ·email and that I am stalking him and he received a
·9· ·temporary order of protection.
10· · · · · · ·He has now gone every place I might go in
11· ·order to show up there and tell them they can't let
12· ·me in even if I'm not there.· I know this because
13· ·they told me.· I go, what is wrong with this guy?
14· · · · · · ·So we were turned away.· He's now
15· ·prosecuting as his stalker.· I have extended by a
16· ·number of times because I was able to obtain
17· ·counsel.· This order doesn't show in the record
18· ·that it was looked at by (inaudible) and by CPD.

I

19· ·don't understand why.· And yet there is a piece of
20· ·paper and I have to go to court and I have to pay a
21· ·lawyer to defend myself against a man that drugged
22· ·me and raped me and then lied to get into my home
23· ·to rape me.
24· · · · · · ·There were seven others victims.

·3· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Yes.· So if you can
·4· ·conclude.
·5· · · ·MS. CARREON:· I would like to know what it
·6· ·means, "but it's a hot potato."· I would like to
·7· ·know why he has not yet been questioned.· I asked
·8· ·to be notified when he was questioned about this
·9· ·assault.
10· · · · · · ·And I would like to know how he was able
11· ·to avoid paying $193,000 in child support.· And so
12· ·I did the research as a criminal research analyst
13· ·and (inaudible) in Washington and that is why he
14· ·was put in contempt of court and has to pay up.
15· · · · · · ·He then tried to see one of his previous
16· ·victims, because some of these women have children
17· ·with him.· Two of them have restraining orders
18· ·against him, one says she wants no contact with

20· · · · · · ·But if he is questioned and he is

 ·1· · · · · · ·I'm here to speak on behalf of Betty

I

·3· ·discussed in detail Dr. Julie Melanik's beyond
·4· ·credible forensic pathology credentials and how she
·5· ·stated in testimony and that you should insist on
·6· ·reading those transcripts, that Rialmo's version of
·7· ·events that occurred during the murder of Betty
·8· ·Jones was not supported by gun evidence.
·9· · · · · · ·I briefly discussed his conduct
10· ·unbecoming, that since the murders Rialmo has been
11· ·in two bar fights.· I want to discuss his Rule 14
12· ·testimony, when he stated during his deposition
13· ·that Betty turned to walk away per his command, and
14· ·his contradicting and perjuring testimony at trial
15· ·where he stated that she did not walk away.· In
16· ·essence, trying to blame her for her own death.
17· · · · · · ·I will state for the record that many
18· ·police officers want you to excuse Rialmo for these
19· ·murders.· They want you to send the message that
20· ·it's okay to shoot your mother or your grandmother
21· ·if she opened the door for the police.
22· · · · · · ·I implore you not to send this message to
23· ·the police or to the Chicago community.· COPA, as

·5· ·you.
·6· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Thank you.
·7· · · · · · ·Next speaker, John Perryman.
·8· · · ·MR. PERRYMAN:· Good evening.· I am here to talk
·9· ·about problems we are having in the 12th District
10· ·still.· We have troubled business.· I've reached
11· ·out to the CAPS numerous times.· They told me that
12· ·they went to investigate this business but were
13· ·told not to because there was an ongoing
14· ·investigation by the vice unit and that's kind of
15· ·where it ended.· And that's been months ago.
16· · · · · · ·Essentially they are telling me to trust
17· ·the police on this, that I'm going to be very
18· ·pleased eventually.· But the truth of the matter is
19· ·I don't believe anything is getting done.
20· · · · · · ·If they are trying to get a big home run
21· ·score on this business from vice or the organized
22· ·crime division, we don't have time.· This needs to
23· ·be shut down.· We will never have legitimate
24· ·businesses in our community when the police are not

YVer1f

 ·1· ·effectively taking care of troubled businesses.
·2· · · · · · ·So my question is for the
·3· ·Superintendent's office I guess, Chief Waller
·4· ·maybe.· What can you do to help us with this
·5· ·problem of a troubled business?
·6· · · ·CHIEF WALLER:· Well, we can't conduct those
·7· ·investigations in your time.· Those investigations
·8· ·are being handled now.· Those businesses, we just
·9· ·had a meeting yesterday.· And you saying the 12th
10· ·District now?· Or you're speaking of the 11th
11· ·District?· You're saying the 12th District or the
12· ·11th District?
13· · · ·MR. PERRYMAN:· Yeah, I think everyone know what
14· ·I'm going to say right now.· It doesn't matter.
15· · · ·CHIEF WALLER:· It matters.
16· · · ·MR. PERRYMAN:· But here is the thing.· I live
17· ·in the 11th but the business is in 12th.· But
18· ·because of that, no one in the 12th wants to talk
19· ·to me.· And because the business is in the 12th,
20· ·the 11th won't touch it.
21· · · · · · ·So this is the problem.· We go around and
22· ·around and around.· I tried to reach out to the
23· ·Commander's office, Commander Chung, and I left a
24· ·message and he had someone call me from the CAPS

McCorkle Litigation Services, Inc.
Chicago, Illinois· (312) 263-0052

25
YVer1f

 ·1· ·and guess what the CAPS person said.· You should
·2· ·talk to Commander Chung about this.· Well, guess
·3· ·what?· Commander Chung's office does not return
·4· ·phone calls.· So the 12th seems to be a little bit
·5· ·of a mess, and I kind of blame the leadership on
·6· ·this.
·7· · · ·CHIEF WALLER:· Well, let me have the address
·8· ·after this meeting and we will take a look at it
·9· ·further.
10· · · ·MR. PERRYMAN:· If we are in a middle of a three
11· ·year investigation, that's a failure.· Because by
12· ·the time that three years is done, we have gone
13· ·that much longer without businesses and the
14· ·community continues to decline.· So that's what the
15· ·option is right now.· The police need to take that
16· ·off the table.
17· · · · · · ·I know it's not on my time, but it's in
18· ·my community and we are suffering.· We have no
19· ·jobs, there is no businesses, and no legitimate
20· ·business can live next to an illegitimate business
21· ·and I think you guys know that.· And the bigger
22· ·problem is when you come with problems, they say
23· ·trust me, trust me, we're on it.· I brought this to
24· ·Commander Chung probably 14 months ago.· So how

YVer1f

 ·1· ·much longer do you think it should have to be?
·2· ·What would be reasonable, Mr. Waller?
·3· · · ·CHIEF WALLER:· Well, what I'll say to you is
·4· ·that we don't control all of that.· The City
·5· ·controls some of it.· There are times when we do
·6· ·shut businesses down, they pay fines, and they get
·7· ·reopened.· I don't know this case in particular
·8· ·specifically, but that's why I said after this
·9· ·meeting we will speak to you, find out what the
10· ·address is, what the business name is, and see what
11· ·is going on, where the investigation is.
12· · · ·MR. PERRYMAN:· Because I've been reaching out
13· ·to the Superintendent's office.· They're more
14· ·worried about where I live than where the problem
15· ·is.· And I talked to the desk sergeant of this
16· ·building and you know what he said when I said we
17· ·are having trouble in the 12th?· He said, well,
18· ·where do you live.
19· · · · · · ·This is a problem that's fundamental and
20· ·it's frustrating to the community.· It goes round
21· ·and round and round.· Commander Chung won't deal
22· ·with this.· So I want some real solutions.
23· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Have you spoken with BACP?
24· · · ·MR. PERRYMAN:· BACP?

·5· ·troubled businesses, yes, you can call the police.
·6· ·But consumer protection -·7· · · ·MR. PERRYMAN:· Shouldn't CAPS be putting me in
·8· ·touch with these guys?
·9· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Okay.· I don't know who
10· ·should be putting you in touch.· I'm telling you
11· ·the answer is Business Affairs Consumer Protection.
12· · · ·MR. PERRYMAN:· All right.· Who is supposed to
13· ·be putting me in touch with these guys?
14· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· I'm putting you in touch
