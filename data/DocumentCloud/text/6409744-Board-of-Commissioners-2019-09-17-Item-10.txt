Recommendation
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners (Board): 1) Authorize the Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) or his designee to submit Disposition Application to HUD for
disposition of Cabrini property for the first phase of Parkside 4 Phase 2; 2) Amend Board
Resolution Number 2018-CHA-89 to reduce the approved Chicago Housing Authority funding
to not to exceed $13,000,000; and 3) Authorize the CEO or his designee to execute and
deliver such other documents and perform such actions as may be necessary or appropriate
to implement the foregoing.
The requested actions in this item comply in all material respects with all applicable federal,
state and local laws and Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) board policies. Staff have
completed all necessary due diligence to support the submission of this initiative.
Background
On November 20, 2018, the CHA Board approved Resolution Number 2018-CHA-89
committing $22,500,000 ($18.3M for construction and $4.2M for remediation of the entire
site), for the development of 134 rental units and 56 market rate for-sale townhomes.
Unfortunately, the 2019 for-sale market has not been as robust as anticipated. Holsten’s
construction lender, CIBC, requires 20 pre-sales in order for construction to
1

 commence. Since starting pre-sales in October of 2018, Holsten has managed to secure only
nine contracts out of a total of 56 for-sale units. Citing concerns the for-sale market is
showing a poor performance in the area, CIBC pulled out of the for-sale townhome
development. Holsten decided to split the rental and for-sale projects and move forward
with closing and development of the rental phase at this time and reconsider what makes
the most sense for what was the for-sale site, at a near future date.
The subject of this Board action is a 102-unit mixed income rental phase consisting of 35
CHA, 31 affordable, and 36 market rate units, in the Near North area.

Funding
The total estimated project budget is $43,619,592.
The not-to-exceed total CHA funding of $13,000,000 will provide funds for project
redevelopment activities, including remediation.
CHA will also provide a loan from the proceeds of the sale of IAHTCs to the rental phase of
the project as a result of donating to the project, the value of the CHA land lease in order to
generate IAHTCs valued at $4,781,804.
Block 5
CHA shall enter into an unrestricted ground lease with the non-profit sponsor, the Cabrini
Green LAC Community Development Corporation (the “Sponsor”). After execution of the
ground lease, the Sponsor shall assign the ground lease to the Rental Owner, subject to
certain regulatory restrictions. The ground lease shall cover Block 5 of the Rental Component
(the “Block 5 Ground Lease”).

Respectfully Submitted:
