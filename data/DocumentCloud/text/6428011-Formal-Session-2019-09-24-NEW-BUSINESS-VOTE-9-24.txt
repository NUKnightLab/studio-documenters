RE: Support for SDBA Run of the Dead 2018

Dear Ms. Fisher:

On behalf of the West Vernor 8L Springweils Business Improvement District Board (BID) i am offering the
support to the Southwest Detroit Business Association (SDBA) in its application for a permit to host the
2018 Run of the Dead at Patton Park. The BID has been established for 10 years, and its
property owner members just renewed the BID in September 2017 for another 10 years. The BID takes
responsibility for 3.1 miles of the West Vernor and Springweils business corridors to do sidewalk
sweeping, maintain 88 litterbaskets, graf?ti removal, and additional DPD patrols.

The BID has worked cooperatively with the SDBA to enact improvements to the business corridors and
market our business community to a wider audience. We are pleased to support the SDBA in hosting
the 2018 Run of the Dead on November 3, 2018 as a means to bring current and new visitors to our

neighborhood.

Sincerely,



Jason Ghannam

Attachment B: Grantee?s Workplan

a. Background: The City of Detroit operates a bi-weekly (every-other?week) curbside recycling collection
system using two different contracted haulers to offer opt-in recycling collection to all eligible single-family
households within itsjurisdiction. The city is divided into two service districts, with each hauler managing
collection within its assigned district. Curbside recycling service is available to all residential properties in
Detroit with four (4) units or less, and city staff estimate that approximately 6  ,000 of the approximately 207,000
curbside recycling eligible households presently have a cart for curbside recycling. The city?s curbside recycling
program collected approximately 4, I 88.64 tons of recyclables in 2018. Households must Opt-in to participate in
the curbside recycling program, and those that do so are offered one 64-gallon recycling cart that they can set out
for every-other-week collection. The City of Detroit contracts with two local organizations, Green Living Science
(GLS) and the Michigan Environmental Council (MEC), to provide education and outreach services about
Detroit?s curbside recycling program, and the City?s of?ce of Sustainability also supports recycling education and
outreach efforts. As part of those efforts, Green Living Science and the Michigan Environmental Council conduct
worksh0ps to educate citizens on proper recycling protocol. To become eligible to receive a recycling cart at no-
cost, citizens can either attend one of the recycling workshops hosted by GLS or MEC, or they can choose to play
an interactive online game that teaches them about the city?s program. Residents who forgo qualifying for a free
cart are required to pay a one-time fee of $25 in order to receive a recycling cart.

Properties with more than four (4) residential units are not eligible for curbside recycling services, and at present
there is no formal city-sponsored or operated program to help these properties secure recycling services. These
properties can contract with the designated hauler that services their portion of the city to receive waste collection
services, and the City of Detroit also offers waste collection services using city staff and vehicles. At present it is
projected that I66 multifamily properties secure waste collection directly from the city and that 2,529 multifamily
units secure waste collection through one of the city?s contracted haulers. Data about the number of individual
residential units (households) at these multifamily properties is not presently available. These properties will be
targeted for recycling collection during Phase 1 of the city?s plan to implement a commercial and multifamily
recycling program in the second half of 20 [9 as described in the Project Description.

b. Project Description: The City of Detroit is planning to implement a signi?cant expansion of its public
recycling efforts between September I, 2019 and August 2020. City staff have prepared and submitted a
request for funding to the state of Michigan?s Recycling infrastructure Grant Program in support of this
expansion, and grant funding from The Recycling Partnership is intended to compliment any award of funding
from the state. Grant funding from The Recycling Partnership will be specifically allocated to support the
expansion of the City's existing curbside recycling program and to support the initiation of a new multifamily
recycling program.

As a part of curbside recycling portion ofthis project, Detroit will proactively seek to signi?cantly expand the
number of curbside-eligible households opting to participate. To support this expansion the city will collaborate
with its contracted service providers (haulers) to purchase and distribute up to recycling carts that are 64
gallon in volume in order to allow additional households to access curbside recycling service.

For the multifamily portion of the project, the city will implement Phase 1 of its new multifamily recycling
program with the goal of bringing recycling services to at least forty percent of the multifamily properties
currently receiving waste collection from either the city or one of the two designated haulers serving the city. As
part of this project, the city and its contracted haulers will provide multifamily preperties with outdoor receptacles
for recycling collection as well as in-unit bins that residents can use to collect and store their recyclables inside
their homes. The outdoor receptacles will be either 400-gallon side-load containers or 64 gallon carts, and the in-
unit bins will be I3 gallon or smaller. The exact number of the different sized indoorfin-unit and outdoor
receptacles to be purchased will be determined based on which multifamily properties choose to participate in the
multifamily recycling program as well as how individual multifamily households and property managers respond
to the availability of different sizes and types of in-unit bins. To the degree pOSSibie, one goal of Phase I will be
to determine which types and sizes of in-unit bins are the most desirable and effective when it comes to
facilitating resident participation and proper preparation of recyclables.

The project will also include the implementation of ajurisdiction-wide education and outreach campaign to
support the curbside and multifamily recycling programs. Education and outreach will be delivered in
collaboration with city staff and the two non-pro?t organizations that the City of Detroit contracts with for
recycling educational services, and outreach efforts will be planned and coordinated with support from The
Recycling Partnership.

c. Measurement Plan: The Grantee will implement a system for tracking the effectiveness of its curbside and
multifamily recycling efforts.

For curbside recycling, the Grantee will track the total number of households eligible to receive curbside
recycling service along with the number of households actually opting-in to utilize said service in the two
different servicejurisdictions. The Grantee will track the number of households added to curbside recycling
service each month. The Grantee will also implement a system for tracking tonnage data for the amounts
of municipal solid waste and recyclables collected from curbside recycling eligible households, and the Grantee
will also work with The Partnership to evaluate contamination rates of the materials recovered by its curbside
recycling program as resources allow. When reporting information about the households that have been added to
its curbside recycling program, the Grantee will carefully track and report the number of households that have
taken the steps necessary to qualify for no-cost distribution of a recycling cart versus those who have been
required to pay to receive a curbside recycling cart.

10

RECYCLINGPARTNERSHIPDRG

The Grantee will implement a system to track the number of multifamily properties participating in the
multifamily recycling program as well as the number of residential units at each participating property. It is
understood that recyclables from multifamily properties may be collected at the same time as recyclables from
other non-residential I commercial properties, but at the very least efforts will be made to accurately estimate the
amount of recyclables originating from multifamily residential sources. If multifamily recycling tonnage is
determined by estimation, the Grantee will share details of how the estimates are derived.

Reports will be provided to The Partnership as outlined in section I, Reporting and Additional Post-Award
Requirements, as set out in Attachment A, and every effort will be made to track the tonnage of materials
collected by the curbside recycling program separately from materials collected by the multifamily recycling
program.

d. Public Outreach Plan: The Grantee will work closely with The Partnership to develop and implement an
effective education and outreach campaign in support of Grantee?s curbside and multifamily recycling programs
utilizing the approach outlined in Paragraph of Attachment A.

As part of implementing this campaign, the Grantee and its contracted education and outreach providers will
collaborate with The Recycling Partnership to build a detailed scope of work around education and outreach, and
this scope of work will include a plan for how to allocate Partnership grant funds allotted for education and
outreach. A mutually agreed amount of grant funding may be allotted for direct ?nancial support of the
contracted service providers as long as The Partnership agrees that an adequate amount of funding has been
allocated towards direct-to-resident program promotion and outreach.

Educational efforts will focus on engaging long-term recyclers as well as new participants to keep the recycling
stream clean and ensure that residents are informed of what is acceptable and not acceptable in the curbside and
multifamily recycling program. A heavy emphasis of this campaign will be around the recruitment of new opt-in
curbside and multifamily customers and about how to properly prepare materials for recycling. This educational
program is intended to complement any previous educational pieces that have already been sent to Detroit
residents. The educational effort will target all single family curbside recycling eligible households in the
Detroit servicejurisdiction as Well as the multifamily units targeted for recycling implementation, and will utilize
most if not all of these supporting tools:

. Direct to resident informational mailers or utility bill inserts for all curbside households,

0 Public activation event to drive citizen engagement in recycling,

I Social media boosting,

- Paid advertisements,

- The implementation of anti-contamination strategies to reinforce correct recycling behavior. and

d? Other strategies determined effective by Detroit and The Recycling Partnership.

Dear Dr. Anderson:

On behalfofthe Detroit Pistons, I am writing to offer the donation ofmurals painted by Detroit-based
artists on the basketball courts located at Tolan Play?eld and Palmer Park. The muralists and I met with
community representatives for each neighborhood to ensure that these improvements are desired. After
reviewing each artists? sketch and artist statement with the community representatives, we received their
approval to move ahead. The meetings were observed by members of the Department of Neighborhoods
and Parks and Recreation. The cost ofthe improvements, approximately $l 5,000 per mural, are being
borne by Palace Sports and Entertainment LLC and the Wilson Foundation.

These improvements will take place in September 2019 to commemorate the second summer of
basketball court renovations that the Pistons have undertaken. Tolan Play?eld and Palmer Park are two of
the 60 courts that are scheduled to be renovated by the Detroit Pistons under the Parks and Recreation
Master Plan of2015, and the Pistons community benefits agreement approved by the Pistons
Neighborhood Advisory Council and Detroit City Council in 201 5.

As a gift, the ownership rights to the mural will be transferred entirely to the city. Any rights to the
artwork, by the artists, or their descendants will be transferred in their entirety to the City of Detroit. After
the life cycle ofthe mural, the City of Detroit will return the court surface to the then-current color
scheme and speci?cations.

These improvements will take place on as soon as possible. We have worked with
