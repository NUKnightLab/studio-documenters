*1 The 3rd Quarter S-FY 18 was significant for CountyCare Compliance. Evolent, CountyCare’s TPA for medical and behavioral health hired
two (2) local investigators dedicated solely to program integrity efforts. This dedicated team partnered with a data analytics firm to review
claims for anomalies. The result of this activity is apparent in the metrics above.
*2 The Overpayments Identified column indicates the total amount paid to the provider for the identified inaccurate codes. These amounts
may be offset if a provider elects to bill a corrected claim.
Example: The highest level clinic visit is billed to the health plan, reimbursement is $48, the medical record is reviewed and the
documentation validates a lower level. The “Overpayment Identified” is $48, however the provider may rebill a lower level and
expect corresponding reimbursement of $28.35. This category does not account for the net recovery of $19.65.

 Cook County Health
Compliance Program
ANNUAL REPORT – FY18
I. Introduction
Cook County Health (CCH) Corporate Compliance incorporates two (2) distinct Compliance
Programs: CCH as a provider of health care services and the CountyCare Medicaid Health Plan.
Provider services occur within both CCH hospitals (John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
and Provident Hospital of Cook County), multiple outpatient clinics, correctional medicine at the
Cook County Jail and Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, and the Cook County Department of
Public Health. It also includes physicians and others that provide direct care to patients, and
workforce members not directly involved in patient care. Although the CountyCare Medicaid
Health Plan’s Compliance Program is addressed through a separate annual report, both programs
function at the system level and are committed to the mission of Cook County Heath:
“To deliver integrated health services with dignity and respect regardless of a patient’s
ability to pay; foster partnerships with other health providers and communities to enhance
the health of the public; and advocate for policies which promote and protect the physical,
mental and social well-being of the people of Cook County.”
Corporate Compliance supports CCH’s Mission through a departmental Mission updated and
approved by the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors on September 20,
2018. The mission reads,
“The Corporate Compliance Program upholds the mission, vision, and core values of Cook
County Health by:
Developing standards to guide everyone affiliated with CCH to “Do the Right Thing”
Increasing compliance awareness through education and training
Promoting collaboration, honest behavior, mutual respect, and professional
responsibility
to support compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and system-wide policies.”
Corporate Compliance similarly updated the Compliance Vision statement:
“To ensure safeguards are in place for our patients, health plan members, health plan
providers, the residents of the county of Cook, and our workforce members, staff, and
the public at large, the Corporate Compliance Program will be a resource to everyone
affiliated with and cared for by Cook County Health.”
(For the purposes of this statement, “affiliated” is defined as all patients, health plan
members, health plan providers, the residents of the county of Cook, and workforce
members that include employees, medical staff, house staff, Board members, volunteers,
students, partners, consultants, agency personnel, and vendors.)
This Annual Report presents the activities throughout County fiscal year 2018 of the CCH
Provider Corporate Compliance Program under the executive leadership of Cathy Bodnar, Chief
Compliance and Privacy Officer, and the operational leadership of Dianne Willard, Compliance
Officer. This report also serves to demonstrate the effectiveness of the compliance program by
Page 3

looking at infrastructure, communication strategy and channels. In addition, this report provides
an assessment of the CCH Provider Compliance Program by using the seven (7) Compliance
Program Elements of a comprehensive compliance program delineated by the Office of Inspector
General (OIG).
II. Building Blocks – Program Infrastructure and Scope
The Annual Report begins with a look at the activities of the Program that incorporate efforts to
foster an infrastructure that produces a comprehensive compliance program. The existing
Departmental Organization Chart follows:

The lightly shaded positions indicate the new hires within FY18. Four (4) of the 7-positions within
Corporate Compliance were filled within the fiscal year, including the Compliance Officer
assigned to CountyCare. Although this placed a significant strain on the existing resources, the
performance by the existing team members was noteworthy. Management of the core elements
of the Program continued while an individualized development plan for each new team member
was undertaken. This was critical to the success of each individual and the Program overall.
Corporate Compliance Program Scope
Cook County Health activities that fall into the Corporate Compliance purview are:
Interpretation of laws, rules, and regulations and organizational policy as they relate
to Corporate Compliance;

Dual employment and conflict of interest reporting.

Page 5

26 of 65

 Cook County Health
Compliance Program
ANNUAL REPORT – FY18

IV. Compliance Program Structure: Performance of the Elements
Element 1
The development and distribution of written Code of Ethics, as well as written policies and
procedures that promote the hospital’s commitment to compliance (e.g., by including adherence
to compliance as an element in evaluating managers and employees) and that address specific
areas of potential fraud, such as claims development and submission processes, coding and
billing risk areas, and financial relationships with physicians and other healthcare
professionals.
A. Policies and Procedures & Work Plan Activities
Policies and Procedures
Developed, updated, and performed triennial reviews on multiple system policies
related to general compliance, governance, and HIPAA. Functioned as a reviewer for
numerous organizational policies with compliance and/or privacy elements. Continue
to participate on the CCH Policy Review Committee to ensure uniform system-wide
standards are met.
Work Plan Activities
In addition to policy and procedure activity, Corporate Compliance worked with
operational areas to assess compliance with procedures and/or regulatory
requirements.
Annual Education
Responsibility for the ongoing operations and day-to-day management of the
CCH electronic learning management system (LMS) for all mandatory annual
training for the entire CCH workforce (employees and contractors) was
transitioned to Wayne Wright, Director of Organizational Development and
Training in Human Resources.
Corporate Compliance remained subject matter expert for two (2) mandatory
annual education modules, Fraud, Waste, and Abuse and Code of Ethics. Both
modules were updated in to comply with regulatory and contractual
requirements. In addition to maintaining responsibility for other elective
modules relating to safeguarding protected health information.
Record Retention
As a government entity, all documents must be reviewed to determine if they
are considered “public records.” Public record is defined in 50 ILCS 205/3 is
defined as “(a)ny book, paper, map, photograph or other official
documentary material, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made,
produced, executed or received by any agency…or in connection with the
transaction of public business and preserved…as evidence of the
Page 6

 Cook County Health
Compliance Program
ANNUAL REPORT – FY18
organization, function, policies, decisions, procedures, or other activities
thereof, or because of the informational data contained therein.
CCH follows an approved Application for Authority to Dispose of Local
Records, known as the Record Retention Schedule. The Schedule dates back to
1985, it contains 1,237 pages with 4,395 different records and retention
periods. Over the past year, Corporate Compliance has requested and received
permission to destroy each record on the Records Retention Schedule based
upon the regulatorily defined retention period.
With the completion of the new Professional Building at 1950 West Polk,
Corporate Compliance coordinated significant efforts to educate staff on record
retention and appropriate record destruction. Corporate Compliance also
worked with Health Information Management to walk through each floor of
the Administrative Building and communicate proper identification and
retention of documents prior to the Administrative Building being vacated by
a majority of its workforce.
Departmental efforts with the aforementioned activity deferred a project to
update the current Record Retention Schedule to a leaner, more intuitive
document for Cook County Health. This project remains on the Corporate
Compliance work plan for FY19.
Dual Employment and Accounting of Disclosure Surveys
To support organizational transparency, worked with Business Intelligence to
internally develop a survey for all Cook County Health employees that
combines two (2) elements, dual employment and conflict of interest.
Completion of an annual Dual Employment survey is required whether or not
a CCH employee participates in external employment. This requirement is
promulgated by the Rules of the Board of the Cook County Commissioners,
CCH Dual Employment Policy and CCH Personnel Rules.
Historically, a subgroup of CCH employees, those that influence procurement
or function in any decision-making capacity on behalf of CCH, were required
to disclose additional information related to external relationships and
activities. The purpose of this survey is to assess whether a conflict of interest
exists. This survey is a mandatory requirement pursuant to the CCH Conflict
of Interest policy. This year, the conflict of interest questions were incorporated
with the dual employment questions resulting in one survey for all employees.
This survey collects employee disclosures for review by leadership.

Page 7

28 of 65

 Cook County Health
Compliance Program
ANNUAL REPORT – FY18
The survey requires a two-step review process. Once completed by an
employee, the survey is submitted to their operational leader. The operational
leader reviews the submission. Once reviewed and approved, the survey is
routed for a secondary review by the operational leader’s supervisor. At each
step of the review, the reviewer has the ability to reject a submission, sending
the survey back to the individual for more specificity. Summary information
will be compiled and shared with the Corporate Compliance Executive Steering
Committee.
340B Compliance
Administered through the Health Resources and Services Administrations
(HRSA) Office of Pharmacy Affairs, the 340B Drug Pricing Program has
significant program integrity requirements. Corporate Compliance continued
to function as a resource for the organization’s 340B Drug Pricing Program
managed within the Department of Pharmacy that requires drug
manufacturers to provide outpatient drugs to eligible health care organizations
such as CCH at significantly reduced prices.
Element 2
The designation of a Chief Compliance Officer and other appropriate bodies, e.g., a corporate
compliance committee, charged with the responsibility of operating and monitoring the
compliance program, and who reports directly to the CEO and the governing body.
B.

Compliance Office and Committees

2.

Expanded role in collaborating with Patient Relations to assist
in resolving compliance-related issues.
Managed two (2) e-mail addresses for Compliance
(compliance@cookcountyhhs.org) and Privacy
(privacy@cookcountyhhs.org).
Established and engaged internal and external resources to assist with
investigations and provide governmental and national perspectives on
compliance issues.
Identified trends and patterns to mitigate organizational risks and
facilitate operational improvement.
Presented trends and patterns to the Audit and Compliance Committee
of the Board.

Process for Responding to Inquiries, Issues and Complaints
The work flow process follows:
a. Investigate the allegation;
b. Determine the area(s) affected;
c. Collaborate with operational leadership and appropriate departments;
d. Review and follow organizational policy, federal, state, and county
regulations related to the incident for mitigation and remediation.
These may include further auditing of documentation, mitigating harm
and potentially informing the appropriate government entity;
e. Follow HIPAA breach notification rules that require sending a
notification and apology letter to the affected individual(s), reporting
to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), and, in the case of
breaches that affect over 500 individuals, notifying the media;
f. Collaborate with operational area to determine and facilitate a
corrective action plan including education as needed;
g. Respond to the complainant; and
h. Respond to governmental entities as required by law. (e.g. CMS, OCR,
HFS).
All contacts brought to the attention of Corporate Compliance are tracked through
a web-based tracking tool. The Compliance Program utilized one vendor for 8years to maintain consistency in tracking and monitoring. With the advancement
of technology, it was prudent to assess the current marketplace. A Request for
Proposal was posted, and six (6) vendors responded. A committee evaluated the
respondents and chose a vendor based upon their commitment to provide handson management of the project and full implementation of the Compliance Issue
Tracking Tool and leveraging a partnership with Salesforce, an existing CCH
vendor currently utilized within Human Resources, to provide the software
platform.

FY18 Contacts by Category

Page 13

34 of 65

 Cook County Health
Compliance Program
ANNUAL REPORT – FY18
The majority of the contacts, 237 or 32%, were categorized within HIPAA Privacy.
This percentage is consistent with previous years. Of the documented contacts
categorized as HIPAA Privacy, approximately 15% or 37 contacts were confirmed
privacy breaches that resulted in a total of 82 patient notifications.
The CCH Provider side of the Compliance Program provides support to the health
plan for privacy issues. CountyCare experienced one (1) privacy breach that
resulted in a total of five (5) member notifications. The one CountyCare breach in
FY18 was caused by a Business Associate.
6.

FY18 Contact Status
Of the 740 contacts were addressed throughout FY18, 96% or 709 contacts were
resolved. Of the contacts resolved, More than 99% were either managed internally
by Corporate Compliance or Corporate Compliance partnered with another area to
address the concerns raised. Less than 1% were referred to other areas external to
Corporate Compliance for management and follow-up. This metric is consistent
year-over-year. The remaining 31 contacts were remained open at the end of the
fiscal year and were carried over to FY19.

7.

FY18 Proactive vs. Reactive
Of the 740 provider contacts managed during FY18,
29% or 218 contacts were proactive. The proactive
category is defined as subjects, brought to the
attention of Corporate Compliance by individuals
seeking guidance prior to the occurrence of an
event or activity. This percentage has decreased
from 40% in FY17. The remaining 522 contacts or
71% were reactive. Reactive contacts are defined as
contacts that occurred that were reported to Corporate Compliance after the
occurrence.

Element 5
The development of a system to respond to allegations of improper/illegal activities and the
enforcement of appropriate disciplinary action against employees who have violated internal
compliance policies, applicable statutes, regulations or Federal health care program
requirements.
E. Enforcing Standards
Broadened the scope of Standards enforcement through:
1. Breach Assessments. Reviewed investigations and provided remediation guidance
to operational areas to minimize and/or eliminate breaches in the future and, utilized
Page 14

35 of 65

 Cook County Health
Compliance Program
ANNUAL REPORT – FY18
the CCH Sanction Policy and Personnel Rules, to provide leadership guidance for
disciplinary action.
2. Breach Notification. Investigated all instances of lost or stolen patient information,
including paper and electronic. For all instances in which the data loss constitutes a
breach as defined by the Breach Notification Rule, the breach notification
requirements to the patient, the Secretary of HHS, and the media are completed.
Corrective action plans are created and executed to improve the processes and counsel
the physicians and employees involved.
3. Conflict of Interest. Provided guidance and developed Conflict Management Plans
to preserve the integrity of the decision-making process.
4. Investigations Resulting in Employee Related Corrective Actions. HIPAA
and Conflict of Interest complaints were investigated and resulted in providing
leadership guidance to remediate the situations and avoid repetition of the incident.
5. Partnerships with Governmental Agencies. Corporate Compliance has engaged
both state and federal agencies (e.g. the Department of Healthcare and Family Services
(HFS) Office of the Inspector General, Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, Office for Civil
Rights, Federal Bureau of Investigations, and the Secret Service) on a variety of
matters. Additionally Compliance has worked with the Cook County Office of the
Independent Inspector General.
Element 6
The use of audits and/or other evaluation techniques to monitor compliance and assist in the
reduction of identified problem area.
F. Auditing and Monitoring
1. The Corporate Compliance Program conducted ongoing HIPAA auditing and
monitoring during the relocations out of the Administrative building as follows:
o Providing proactive record retention guidance throughout the move;
o Monitoring garbage bins and vacated offices for PHI and working with
operational leadership to educate staff when PHI was found;
o Engaging Health Information Management when original medical record
information was identified;
o Communicating to the appropriate operational area(s) when other non-HIPAA
contacts were identified related to the move (e.g. sharps and equipment found.)
2. The Corporate Compliance Program also served a resource to Internal Audit for
outpatient coding expertise.

 Cook County Health
CountyCare Compliance Program
FY 18 ANNUAL REPORT – December 2017 through November 2018
I. Introduction
CountyCare is a Managed Care Community Network (MCCN) health plan offered by Cook County
Health (CCH) pursuant to a contract with the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family
Services (HFS). Since late 2012, CCH has partnered with the State of Illinois, initially through the
State of Illinois federal Section 1115 demonstration waiver which was an early start on Medicaid
expansion, then in 2014, CountyCare transitioned into the MCCN. By working to employ the
advantages of our parent organization, CCH, CountyCare is able to uniquely promote achievement
of the Triple Aim: 1) improving the member experience, 2) improving the health of populations
overall, while 3) reducing the cost of care. The operation of the CountyCare MCCN is facilitated
through CCH and its various subcontractors.
To adhere to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Managed Care Program
Integrity requirements 1, contractual provisions in the MCCN Agreement with HFS, and the
elements of an effective compliance program as recommended in the Department of Health and
Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG) Compliance Program Guidance publications,
CountyCare developed and implemented the CountyCare Compliance Program. The CountyCare
Compliance Program is designed to demonstrate the health plan’s ongoing commitment to
promoting ethical and lawful conduct consistent with all applicable laws, regulations, and
contractual requirements, as well as CCH policies, procedures, and Code of Ethics/Standards of
Conduct.
This Annual Report presents the activities throughout county fiscal year 2018. The CountyCare
Managed Care Compliance Program is under the executive leadership of Cathy Bodnar, Chief
Compliance and Privacy Officer, and the operational leadership of Elizabeth Festa, CCH
Compliance Officer dedicated to CountyCare.
During this past fiscal year, CountyCare Health Plan, as a whole, accomplished many goals and
implemented a variety of initiatives. A few health plan achievements include:
CountyCare Became the Largest Medicaid Health Plan in Cook County: In FY2018,
CountyCare acquired the Medicaid membership of both Aetna and Family Health Network
(FHN), becoming the largest Medicaid Health Plan in Cook County.
Medicaid Redetermination Efforts: CountyCare sought to retain membership by helping
members with their Medicaid redetermination process. Triggers were developed for
providers, prompts were embedded within providers’ health information systems, and
redetermination events throughout the county were held to help members maintain their
Medicaid eligibility and CountyCare membership.
CMS Review of Illinois Medicaid Program Integrity Activity: CMS conducted a focused
review of Illinois Medicaid to determine the extent of program integrity oversight of the
managed care program at the state level and to assess the program integrity activities
performed by a random selection of the state’s managed care organizations. CountyCare

was selected, supplied numerous documents to support program integrity efforts, and
Corporate Compliance travelled to Springfield to participate in interviews with CMS and
HFS, strengthening its relationship with both entities and providing valuable insight into
the Program Integrity activities of CountyCare.
The Corporate Compliance Program dedicated to CountyCare was directly involved in each major
initiative to assure the execution adhered to and incorporated relevant regulatory directives and
contractual requirements.
II. Building Blocks – Program Infrastructure and Scope
The Annual Report begins with a look at the structure and activities of the Program that
incorporate efforts to foster an infrastructure that produces a comprehensive compliance

The lightly shaded positions indicate the new hires within FY18. Two (2) of the 3-dedicated
CountyCare Compliance Program positions were vacant for several months within the fiscal year,
including the Compliance Officer assigned to CountyCare. This placed a significant strain on the
existing resources. In the interim, Cathy Bodnar, functioned in an operational leadership capacity
with significant, noteworthy support from Cory Otto, Compliance Analyst. Management of the
core elements of the Program continued which was critical to the ongoing success of the
CountyCare Compliance Program.

Health Plan Marketing; and
Subpoena Handling.

Ad Hoc Activities/Guidance
Corporate Compliance worked with operational areas to assess compliance with
policies, procedures and/or regulatory requirements and, in certain instances, assisted
in the development of new policies and procedures.
Examples of areas assessed:
Health Plan Marketing Policy Compliance Review: Due to the ever-changing
complex regulatory environment of Medicaid managed care plan marketing,
Compliance reviewed and tracked all marketing materials before they were
submitted to HFS for approval. In FY18, Compliance conducted 37 marketing and
material reviews. 36 of 37 reviews conducted were approved by Compliance and
subsequently, HFS. Each CountyCare initiative reviewed may contain multiple
materials, however, each review is counted individually.

Medical and Prior Authorization Policies: Worked with Evolent, CountyCare’s
TPA, to compile all medical payment and prior authorization policies and to
identify areas of need.
Authorized Representatives: Provided written guidance to the member call center
regarding when they could speak with a member’s representative based on a verbal
consent.

4. Fraud, Waste and Abuse
Prevention, detection and elimination of fraud, waste, abuse, and financial
misconduct is a key driver for CountyCare Compliance. Benefit and Program
Integrity is critical not only because it a contractual requirement and a significant
focus by the State and Federal government but because it is the right thing to do.
The impetus of this key initiative is to ensure that federal, state, and county
taxpayer dollars are spent appropriately on delivering quality, necessary care and
preventing fraud, waste, and abuse in addition to protecting health plan members
and providers.
To identify potential fraud, waste, abuse, and financial misconduct, CountyCare
Compliance partners with each delegated vendor through their dedicated areas
commonly known as Special Investigation Units (SIU). The CountyCare
Compliance Officer provides direct oversight of program integrity activity.

CountyCare Compliance Program
FY 18 ANNUAL REPORT – December 2017 through November 2018
All Program Integrity activity is tracked by State Fiscal Year (S-FY) for state
reporting purposes and not by county fiscal year. The S-FY runs from July 1st
through June 30th.
FWA activity matters are raised through multiple modalities, to each delegated
vendor or directly to Corporate Compliance. All allegations are tracked and
monitored to resolution. In addition, other measures are undertaken through the
SIUs. CountyCare utilizes data mining to identify providers with aberrant billing
patterns and researches tips received from HFS, HFS-OIG, other Managed Care
Organizations (MCOs), healthcare fraud groups, CountyCare employees, the
media and other sources to identify overpayments.
Metrics for the S-FY18 follow:

* The 3rd Quarter S-FY 18 was significant for CountyCare Compliance. Evolent,
CountyCare’s TPA for medical and behavioral health, hired two (2) local
investigators dedicated solely to program integrity efforts. This dedicated team
partnered with a data analytics firm to review claims for anomalies. The result of
this activity is apparent in the metrics above.
CountyCare Compliance monitored the process to ensure that appropriate action
was taken, including reporting of suspected FWA to the State HFS-OIG.
In S-FY 2018, CountyCare referred 11 cases to the HFS-OIG for possible fraud,
waste or financial misconduct.
5. Total Volume of General Compliance Contacts
In addition to the program integrity efforts above, a total of 125 general compliance
contacts were tracked by CountyCare Compliance during the last fiscal year. This
is a 29% decrease from last year. As noted earlier in this annual report, two (2) of
the three (3) dedicated CountyCare Compliance Program positions were vacant.

With limited resources, CountyCare Compliance focused on contacts and issues
that presented, shifting the balance from proactive to reactive or unanticipated
queries or concerns. Of the 125 CountyCare contacts in FY 18, 40% or 50 contacts,
were proactive. This was a significant decrease
from the previous fiscal year, where 81% of the
contacts were proactive activities that
anticipated possible issues. The gradual return
to a proactive paradigm is anticipated with the
resolution of staffing issues.

 Cook County Health
CountyCare Compliance Program
FY 18 ANNUAL REPORT – December 2017 through November 2018
7. HIPAA (Privacy and Security)
As a covered entity, the health plan is required to safeguard privacy for plan
members. Privacy and security of member information is highly regulated, and
this category accounted for 47, or 38% of all contacts handled by compliance.
During FY2018, CountyCare had fifteen (15) HIPAA incidents. None of the
incidents required notifications to members. Twelve (12) of the fifteen (15)
incidents were misdirected communications sent to another covered entity
(another health plan, for example) or business associate (an entity doing business
on behalf of the health plan).
8. Grievances and Appeals Activities
The responsibility for Grievance and Appeals activity transitioned from Corporate
Compliance to CountyCare Operations this fiscal year, specifically to leadership
within Quality and Risk Management. CountyCare Compliance provides highlevel oversight and remains committed to ensuring that contractual and regulatory
timeframes are met, to providing guidance and assistance when necessary, and
participating in the quarterly CountyCare Grievance and Appeals Committee.
Element 5
The development of a system to respond to allegations of improper/illegal activities and the
enforcement of appropriate disciplinary action against employees who have violated internal
compliance policies, applicable statutes, regulations or Federal health care program
requirements.
F.

Enforcing Standards
Broadened the scope of Standards enforcement through:
1.
Fraud, Waste and Abuse Monitoring. As noted earlier in this report,
CountyCare Compliance collaborated closely with the Special Investigation Units
of Delegated Vendors to identify potential fraud, waste, abuse, and financial
misconduct. Towards the end of the county fiscal year, Evolent, CountyCare’s TPA
for medical and behavioral health shifted to a second data analytics firm
recognized for its expertise in DRG auditing and coding analysis.
2.

Privacy and Security (HIPAA) Breach Assessments. As staffing for
CountyCare Compliance stabilized, the area began to assume a greater
responsibility for performing breach assessments. To maintain consistency in the
approach, CountyCare Compliance partnered with CCH Provider Compliance to
review allegations. If a privacy or security breach is validated, CountyCare
Compliance provided remediation guidance to operational areas to minimize
and/or eliminate breaches in the future and, utilized the CCH Sanction Policy and
Personnel Rules, to provide leadership guidance for disciplinary action.

3.

Investigations Resulting in Employee Related Corrective Actions.
Investigated Conflict of Interest and confidentiality complaints and provided
employee guidance.

4.

Partnerships with Governmental Agencies. CountyCare Compliance
partnered with the HFS, HFS-OIG, and Illinois’ Medicaid Fraud Control Unit
(MFCU).

5.

Partnerships with non-Governmental Agencies. CountyCare Compliance
was invited to participate with a number of new organizations related to the
detection of fraud and wrongdoing in the insurance industry. These nongovernmental organizations include the HealthCare Fraud Prevention Partnership
(HFPP), National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB), and Midwest Anti-Fraud
Insurance Association (MAIA).

Element 6
The use of audits and/or other evaluation techniques to monitor compliance and assist in the
reduction of identified problem areas.
G.

Auditing and Monitoring
Fraud, Waste, Abuse and Financial Misconduct
As noted earlier in this report, CountyCare Compliance continued its partnership with
SIUs, meeting regularly to build a robust system to identify potential financial
misconduct, and formed partnerships with governmental and non-governmental
agencies.
Annual Compliance Attestation
CountyCare Compliance continued to utilize an Annual Compliance Attestation,
issued to all CountyCare’s delegated vendors in April 2018. The Compliance
Attestation required all vendors to attest to several compliance provisions in their
contracts, including distribution of a Code of Ethics, FWA policy distribution, training
and education requirements, sanction screening checks, and delegated oversight. All
of the vendors responded, and one vendor required corrective measures.

H.

Risk Assessment
The focus within CountyCare Compliance is prevention, detection and elimination of
fraud, waste, abuse, and financial misconduct, however other areas of risk relating to
member privacy and security of protected health information were identified in FY18.
These also require ongoing assessment:
Necessity for updated procedures to terminate employee access to 3rd party
electronic systems upon separation from employment and to monitor current
employee access.
Disclosure and sharing of member sensitive health information.

Page 16

 Cook County Health
CountyCare Compliance Program
FY 18 ANNUAL REPORT – December 2017 through November 2018
In addition, CountyCare Compliance will initiate an annual risk assessment with executive
leadership and key thought leaders nationally to identify outstanding risks and challenges
to meeting the standards of an effective health plan compliance program.
Element 7
The investigation and remediation of identified systemic problems and the development of
policies addressing the non-employment or retention of sanctioned individuals.
I.

Identification of Systemic Issues
Sanction Screening Checks
Addressed regulatory requirements to avoid employing, engaging, contracting or
agreeing with any individual or entity that is excluded or “sanctioned” from
participation in a federal or state health care program or who is debarred from
participation in federal procurement or non-procurement programs for the provision
of goods or services through ongoing monthly checks with an external vendor.

IV. Looking Ahead
In FY19 the Corporate Compliance Program will continue to focus on maintaining adherence to
contractual requirements and healthcare compliance best practices as the program matures. As
CountyCare relies heavily on delegated vendors, monitoring for adherence to CountyCare policies,
contractual, and regulatory standards are critical to avoid sanctions. The Program will continue
ongoing activities related to risk reduction in the areas of compliance, policy implementation, and
the development and implementation of monitoring and auditing efforts.
These priorities have been established for the CountyCare Compliance Program:
Strengthen health plan oversight in the area of fraud, waste and abuse,
o
Foster continued partnerships with HFS-OIG and the State’s MFCU to develop
best practices in Corporate Compliance for CountyCare.
o
Enhance relationships with non-government organizations and other MCOs’ SIUs
to build a network of skilled investigators and increase effective Program Integrity
efforts.
Continue to investigate all matters brought to the attention of the Program.
Uphold compliance with contractual requirements and industry best practices as
CountyCare continues as the largest Medicaid Managed Care Organization in Cook
County.
Foster partnerships with CountyCare Operations and delegated vendors to fulfill
contractual obligations in Program Integrity and state reporting.
Increase oversight and monitoring for all delegated vendors.
Serve as a resource to the workforce and delegated vendors.
Mature the CountyCare Compliance Program and continue to incorporate best practices
to cultivate a culture of compliance throughout the health plan.
Maintain CountyCare Compliance Program recognition locally and nationally.

Internal Audit Charter
(The following 3 slides are excerpts from the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) Practice Standards)

INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR THE PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE
OF INTERNAL AUDITING (STANDARDS)

Attribute Standards
The purpose, authority, and responsibility of the internal audit activity must be formally
defined in an internal audit charter, consistent with the Definition of Internal Auditing, the
Code of Ethics, and the Standards.

The internal audit charter is a formal document that defines the internal audit activity's
purpose, authority, and responsibility. The internal audit charter establishes the internal
audit activity's position within the organization, including the nature of the chief audit
executive’s functional reporting relationship with the board; authorizes access to records,
personnel, and physical properties relevant to the performance of engagements; and
defines the scope of internal audit activities

59 of 65

3

 Internal Audit Charter
1110 – Organizational Independence
The chief audit executive must report to a level within the organization that allows the internal audit activity
to fulfill its responsibilities.
Interpretation:
Organizational independence is effectively achieved when the chief audit executive reports functionally to
the board. Examples of functional reporting to the board involve the board:

Approving decisions regarding the appointment and removal of the chief audit executive;
Approving the remuneration of the chief audit executive; and
Making appropriate inquiries of management and the chief audit executive to determine whether there are inappropriate scope or
resource limitations.

 Internal Audit Charter
Considerations for Implementation

Based on this foundational work, the CAE (or a delegate) drafts an internal audit charter. The IIA offers a model internal audit activity charter
that may be used as a guide. Although they vary by organization, charters typically include the following sections:
– to explain the overall role and professionalism of the internal audit activity, citing the relevant elements of the International
Professional Practice Framework (IPPF).
– to specify the internal audit activity’s full access to the records, physical property and personnel required to perform its

engagements and to declare its accountability for safeguarding assets and confidentiality.

– to document the CAE’s reporting structure. The CAE reports functionally to the board and
administratively to a level within the organization that allows the internal audit activity to fulfill its responsibilities. This section may delve into
specific functional responsibilities, such as approving the charter and audit plan, and hiring, compensating, and terminating the CAE; as well as
administrative responsibilities, such as supporting information flow within the organization or approving human resource administration and
budgets.
– to describe the importance of internal audit independence and objectivity and how these will be maintained,
such as prohibiting internal audit from having operational responsibility or authority over areas audited.
– to lay out major areas of ongoing responsibility, such as defining the scope of assessments, writing an audit plan and
submitting it to the board for approval, performing assessments, communicating the results, providing a written audit report, and monitoring
corrective actions taken by management.
– to describe the expectations for maintaining, evaluating, and communicating the results of a quality
program that covers all aspects of the internal audit activity.
– to document the agreement between the CAE, a designated board representative, and the individual to whom the CAE reports,
with the date, name, and title of signatories.
