HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: RECOMMENDATION FOR DEFERRAL
ADDRESS: 4681 Beniteau
NAME: Duan Thomas Fleming, SR JR
Demolition Ordered: July 1, 2019

In response to the request for a deferral of the demolition order on the property noted above, the Buildings, Safety Engineering and
Environmental Department (BSEED) submits the following information:

A special inspection conducted on September 4, 2019 revealed that the building is secured and appears to be sound and repairable. The
owner has paid all taxes and is current. The proposed use of the property is owner?s use and occupancy. This is the 1"t deferral request for
this property.

Therefore, we respectfully recommended that the demolition order be deferred for a period of six months subject to the following
conditions:

 

l. A permit for rehabilitation work shall be applied for within te_n (10) business days from the date ofthe City Council
decision.
2. BSEED will schedule a Progress Inspection within (45) calendar davs from the date ofthe rehabilitation

permit to determine whether substantial progress has been made. Thereafter, the owner must submit to BSEED
detailed inspection reports, with photos showing evidence of the work completed, every forty-?ve (45) calendar
d_ay?, for the duration of the rehabilitation work, to demonstrate that substantial progress has been made during
the approved time frame for rehabilitation.

3. The building shall have all imminently hazardous conditions immediately corrected, be maintained, and securely
barricaded until rehabilitation is complete. Rehabilitation work is to be completed within six (6) months, at which
time the owner will obtain one of the following from this department:

0 Certi?cate of Acceptance related to building permits
0 Certi?cate of Approval as a result of a Housing Inspection
I Certi?cate of Compliance, required for a_ll rental properties

4. The owner shall not occupy or allow occupancy of the structure without a certi?cate (as outlined above).
5. The yards shall be maintained clear of overgrown vegetation, weeds, junk and debris at all times.
6. Prior to seeking a permit extension, the owner must contact BSEED and request to extend the deferral period.

We recommend that utility disconnect actions cease to allow the progress of the rehabilitation.

At the end of the deferral period, the owner must contact this department to arrange an inspection to evidence that conditions of the deferral
