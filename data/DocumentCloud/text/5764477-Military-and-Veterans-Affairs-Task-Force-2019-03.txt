Commitment Letter for City of Detroit Of?ce of Sustainability

I am writing on behalf of the Fred A. and Barbara M. Erb Family Foundation to express that, subject
to board approval, we are committed to providing up to $50,000 in Funding as a I :1 match should
the City of Detroit?s grant application, ?Improving Health and Safety in Detroit Homes," be selected
for :1 Partners For Places grant award.

We greatly appreciate the past sapport that helped create Detroit's Of?ce of Sustainability
(005). The 003 has made incredible progress engaging more than 6,000 residents across the city in
creating a Sustainability Action Agenda for Detroit, and it Would be very impactful to be able to
announce a project that addresses some of the Agenda's top priorities concurrently with the public
release of the Agenda this Spring.

A $300 million foundation, the Fred A. and Barbara M. Erb Family Foundation?s mission is to
nurture environmentally healthy and culturally vibrant communities in metropolitan DetroiL
consistent with sustainable business models, and support initiatives to restore the Great Lakes
Ecosystem. We are focused on improving water quality; promoting environmental health, justice and
equitable development; and supporting the arts as a means to strengthen the metropolitan Detroit

region.

OVcr the past two years. the foundation has been developing an increasing focus within its
Environmental Health 82. Justice area on lead and asthma. Lead and asthma are the two largest
environmental health problems in the city of Detroit. Detroit accounts for almost one-half
Michigan's cases of child lead poisoning and more than twice the number ofasthma related deaths
statewide. Affordability of housing is another issue. The proposed program offers an elegant solution
to these issues. and we are excited at the opportunity to deepen our partnership with the 008 by
working together in assuring its success.

1 have been impressed by the collaborative and creative spirit that has animated the planning of this
program. Only recent] emerged li'om bankrUptey, the city is still rebuilding its administrative
infrastructure and untangling an outdated web of ineffective bureaucracy. This program dc?ly
weaves together the work of multiple departments and connects them with some of our most
effective community-based organizations?improving systems while directly addressing serious
environmental, social and economic issues. What better Way to demonstrate the power of
sustainability in moving Detroit l'onvard.

Sincerely,

vacated. There was supposed to still be 10 feet for pedestrian travel in back of the curb, but this
.4 ?location?already?had?angle? parking allowed in?back of the'curb't' The petition?to grant the City a
pedestrian access easement will resolve the issue of allowing the existing parking while still
maintaining a safe pedestrian sidewalk.

At this time Cass Willis LLC wants to grant to the City of Detroit an Easement for Public Access
and Use. A Maintenance Agreement will be executed to include the subject easement area. The
request was approved by City Engineering - DPW, and Traf?c Engineering DPW, and the City
of Detroit Law Department.

All other involved City Departments, and privately owned utility companies have reported no
objections to the public access easement. Provisions retaining protection of the existing utility
installations are part of the attached resolution.-

I am recommending adoption of the attached resolution.
