PRESENTED TO

Chicago Park District
Illinois
For the Fiscal Year Beginning

January 1, 2018

Executive Director

The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) presented a Distinguished Budget
Presentation Award to Chicago Park District, Illinois for its annual budget for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018. In
order to receive this award, a governmental unit must publish a budget document that meets program criteria as a policy
document, as an operations guide, as a financial plan, and as a communications device. This award is valid for a period of
one year only. We believe our current budget continues to conform to program requirements, and we are submitting it to
GFOA to determine its eligibility for another award.
