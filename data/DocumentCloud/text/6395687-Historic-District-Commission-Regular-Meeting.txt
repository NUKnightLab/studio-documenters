STAFF REPORT: 9-11-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6426
ADDRESS: 1448 SHIPHERD
HISTORIC DISTRICT: WEST VILLAGE
APPLICANT: RIEMER PRIESTER AND ALEX DECAMP
DATE OF COMPLETE APPLICATION: 9-3-2019
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 9-3-2019

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

SCOPE: DEMOLISH EXISTING BUILDING
EXISTING CONDITIONS
Erected ca. 1900, the building located at 1448 Shipherd is a two-story, wood-frame, multiple-family
dwelling. The building is two stories in height and is covered with a faux brick, asphalt (Insulbrick) siding.
Windows, where visible and intact, are wood double-hung or leaded glass casement units. Many of the
window openings on the first story are covered with plywood, while all of window units at the second story
are highly deteriorated because the rear portion of the roof has collapsed. A wood porch with a decorative
gable and wood steps at the front elevation mark the building’s primary entrance. A second inset entrance
opens to a staircase which leads to the second story apartment. The building sits in a highly deteriorated
state due to the rear roof collapse.

 PROPOSAL
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to demolish the building.
Please see the attached narrative which outlines the project scope. The work will involve the removal of the
structure, basement, and all existing concrete walkways within the property boundaries. The resulting hole
will be backfilled with dirt and topsoil will be added. A review of recent photos of the site and Google
Earth images revealed that landscaping and fencing was removed sometime after May 2018.
STAFF OBSERVATIONS & RESEARCH
As stated above, the applicant is seeking this body’s approval to demolish the building located at 1448
Shipherd. The applicant has provided a report from a structural engineer which outlines the condition of
the building. Specifically, the project engineer states that “ …the majority is in very poor condition that it
becomes unsafe and cost prohibitive to salvage, replace, or rehabilitate. Total demolition of framing system
is recommended for this building.” The application also provides a number of photos which depict the
level of deterioration at the building.
Please see the below Sanborn Fire Insurance Map, which indicates that this building has stood in its current
location since 1910. City of Detroit Assessor’s Office records indicated that the building was erected in
1900. A review of the Historic Designation Advisory Board’s designation report for West Village
indicates that West Village was originally platted in 1876 to include what is currently known as the 1400
block of Shipherd. The designation report further notes that “…in the 1890s, modest Victorian Cottages
began to appear in greater numbers…. At the turn of the century, construction because more substantial as
larger, more and more expensive house were built.” The building at 1448 Shipherd does retain its original
form and decorative detailing, and is recognizable as representative of the district’s/neighborhood’s early
period development despite its current deteriorated condition. For these reasons, it is staff’s opinion that the
building does contribute to the district’s historic character.

Shipherd,

 ISSUES
• The project proposes to demolish the building. It is staff’s opinion that the building contributes to
the district’s historic character.
• Demolition does not meet the district’s Elements of Design
• As per the Secretary of the Interior Standards for Rehabilitation, Standard #2, “the historic
character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or
alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.”
• The applicant has provided a report from a licensed structural engineer which states that the
building is unsafe and recommends it demolition
• Sec. 25-2-22 of the Detroit City Code, entitled “ Issuance of Notice to Proceed” states that
“…inappropriate work adversely affecting the exterior appearance of a resource, which work
cannot be granted a Certificate of Appropriateness, shall be permitted by the historic district
commission through the issuance of a Notice to Proceed if…” the below condition prevails “…and
if the commission finds that the work is necessary to substantially improve or correct…” the
condition:
o (1)
The resource constitutes a hazard to the safety of the public or the occupants
RECOMMENDATION
As stated above, this wood-frame, relatively-modest building does remain as representative of the

district’s/neighborhood’s early period development, despite its current deteriorated condition. For these
reasons, it is staff’s opinion that the building does contribute to the district’s historic character. Staff
therefore recommends that the Commission deny the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness for the
demolition of the building because the work does not meet the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation, standard #2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The
removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be
avoided and #4) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity
of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features
shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.

Introduction 
 
West Village is a historic district roughly bounded by Jefferson, Kercheval, Parker and Seyburn 
Avenues in Detroit, Michigan.  It is primarily a residential neighborhood.  The district received 
its name in the mid 20th century because of its location just west of Indian Village historic 
district.   It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.  
 
The building is a 2 story residential structure constructed mainly of wood rafters, floor joists 
and exterior studs. The foundation system consists of crawl space at the rear and basement at 
front. 
 

 
 
The purpose of the structural assessment is to determine whether the main structural 
components can be salvaged or demolished.  LM Engineering has been tasked to perform the 
assessment.   The assessment was conducted primarily with a site visit on December 27, 2018.  
A structural assessment report is included as part of this report. 
 
This property is currently unoccupied and vacant.

Architectural Significance and Construction History 
 
We were not able to determine, through our research, the actual date of construction for this 
property.  The 2 story structure is a two family dwelling with a footprint of approximately 23ft x 
37ft.  Currently, the exterior walls are covered with composite shingles.  It has a low sloped 
roof.   
 

 
 
 
We were not able to find any historical photographs of this building.

Structural Condition Assessment 
 
1.  Resource Description:   
The following elements are structurally considered as major structural components of 
the residential building: 
a.  Roof rafters:   2x dimensional lumber.   
b.  2nd floor joists:  2x8 dimensional lumber. 
c.  Bearing walls:  2x4 wall studs at 16” on center. 
d.  1st floor joists:  2x8 dimensional lumber   
e.  Basement walls:  Multi wythe brick. 
f.  Crawl space:  2x8 floor joists supported by interior multi ply girder.   The girders 
were supported by concrete masonry block piers. 
2.  Evaluation of resource condition: 
Roof rafters, 2nd floor joists and portions of exterior stud walls have been exposed the 
elements for many years.   The deterioration and damage on these components vary 
from moderate to severe.   
1st floor girder beams at the crawl space appear to not be attached to the concrete 
masonry block piers.  Most of the first floor level joists are water damaged and 
deterioration varies from 25% to 60%.    
3.  Limitations of visual inspection: 
The interior of the house has been exposed to the elements for many years.  At the time 
of visual inspection, the property was only accessible at the first level.  The stairs to the 
2nd floor and stairs to the basement were water soaked and were unsafe and therefore 
prevented access to the 2nd floor and basement. 
Recommendations: 
A small percentage of floor joists and bearing wall studs may be salvaged but the 
majority is in very poor condition that it becomes unsafe and cost prohibitive to salvage, 
replace or rehabilitate.  Total demolition of framing system is recommended for this 
building.

(d)

The design treatment level of the West Village Historic District shall be conservation, as
provided for in section 25-2-2.

(e)

The defined elements of design, as provided for in section 25-2-2, shall be as follows:

Height. Buildings in West Village range in height from one story to eleven (11) stories. The
majority of the residential buildings are two and one-half (2 1/2) stories tall, meaning they have two
(2) full stories plus an attic or finished third floor within the roof. One and one-half-story residential
buildings exist and are primarily concentrated on Van Dyke between Lafayette and Kercheval, the
east side of Shipherd, and on St. Paul between Shipherd and Van Dyke. Apartment buildings range
from two (2) stories to eleven (11) stories tall although buildings of more than four (4) stories are
rare. Commercial buildings range from one to three (3) stories tall; the older commercial buildings
are two (2) stories tall.
Proportion of buildings' front facades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on age, style,
use and location in a specific subdivision. On narrow, thirty-foot to thirty five-foot parcels,
proportion of front facades is narrow compared to depth and buildings are taller than wide.
Apartment buildings are taller than wide, terraces and attached row houses are wider than tall

 when taken as a whole.
(3)

Proportion of openings within the facades. Areas of voids generally constitute between fifteen
(15) per cent and thirty (30) per cent square. Window openings in residences are always
subdivided, the most common window type being double-hung sash, whose area may be further
subdivided by muntins. Dormer and gable windows exist in a variety of shapes and sizes. The
district contains a great variety of sizes, shapes, and arrangements of openings.

(4)

Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. Voids are usually spaced evenly within the facades,
resulting in balanced compositions. Voids in buildings derived from classical precedents are
usually arranged in a symmetrical manner. Buildings influenced by the arts and crafts movement
and the Victorian era display voids arranged with more freedom.

(5)

Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. Spacing of buildings on streets is generally
determined by the setback from the side lot line, which tends to vary according to the width of the
lot. The regularity of spacing on narrow lots or parcels (thirty-foot to forty-foot range) is
interrupted by vacant lots resulting from demolition as well as the occasional combination of
several lots for larger, newer structures. On Parker from Jefferson to Agnes where lots are forty
(40) feet to fifty (50) feet wide, houses are most often centered on the lot or sometimes placed
closer to one side lot line to form a small side yard or permit space for a driveway.

(6)

Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections Most residences have porch projections and/or
entrance recessions. Porches and entrances on classically inspired buildings are either centrally
placed or, as in the case of some duplexes, placed on both sides of the facade in a symmetrical
arrangement. Victorian and arts and crafts inspired buildings display more freedom in placement.
Side and sun porches are rare in the district due to the lack of side yards; a few exist on larger
lots. Rowhouses or terraces generally exhibit freedom in placement of porches and entrances
within each complex; centrally located recessed entrances in Shipherd Court create a rhythm
amongst themselves. Commercial buildings on Kercheval display a progression of recessed
entrances, usually two (2) per building. No rhythm is established along the Jefferson Avenue
frontage.

(7)

Relationship of materials. The majority of the buildings in West Village have either common or
pressed brick or clapboard sheathing as their principal exterior material. Stucco wall surfaces
also exist as a principal material; some later replacement siding exists in the district, but much of
such siding changes the visual relationship of the siding to the building. Masonry is used on the
first story only on some houses, and wood shingles exist on some second stories. Most buildings
have wood trim; a few more substantial houses and apartment buildings have stone trim. There
are some tile roofs; some slate roofs still exist; asphalt replacement roofs are common. Porches
are built of brick or wood.

(8)

Relationship of textures The most common relationships of textures are the low-relief pattern of
mortar joints in brick contrasted to smooth wood trim and/or wood clapboard contrasted with
smoother trim. Random ashlar used at first story level is contrasted with a wood-sheathed or
shingled upper story in a few houses, as is a brick first story and a stuccoed second story. The
smoother surface of glazed brick or painted brick is sometimes contrasted with stone or wood
trim. Carved wooden detail and half-timbering provide textural interest. Slate and tile roofs
provide textural interest whereas asphalt shingles usually do not.

(9)

Relationship of colors. Orange natural brick, pressed brick, and replacement siding in natural

 earth colors are plentiful in the district; the paint colors of frame houses often relate to style. The
classically inspired buildings generally have woodwork painted in the white and cream range.
Doors and shutters feature an array of colors, usually harmonizing with the main body of the
house. Colors known to have been in use on buildings of this type in the eighteenth or nineteenth
century on similar buildings may be considered for suitability. Buildings of medieval or arts and
crafts inspiration generally have painted woodwork and window frames of dark brown, cream, or
other natural tones. Stucco is either left in its natural state or painted in a shade of cream or
yellow. Dark brown half-timbering is common. Victorian buildings display freedom in use of
color. Original color schemes for any given building may be determined by professional paint
analysis and when so determined are always appropriate for that building. Roofs are in natural
colors (tile and slate and wood colors) and asphalt shingles are predominantly within this same
color range.
(10)

Relationship of architectural details. Architectural details generally relate to style. Victorian
architectural details appear on one and one-half and two and one-half-story Victorian cottages;
spindlework, fishscale shingles and patterned shingles are indicative of the Queen Anne style.
Areas treated include porches, gables, window and door surrounds, and cornices. The buildings
influenced by the arts and crafts or medieval sometimes have details carved in wood on window
frames, door frames and eaves and sometimes have half-timbering. The foursquare buildings,
mostly on the northern end of the district, have little architectural embellishments; the detail on
the eaves, bays, dormers and porch are architectonic. Neo-Georgian or colonial have classical
details in wood on porches, shutters, window frames and dormers. In general, various styles are
rich in architectural detail.

(11)

Relationship of roof shapes. The district is characterized by a diversity of roof shapes. Hipped or
pitched roofs on most residential buildings are punctuated with gables and dormers, with the
exception of the Victorian cottages with their steeply pitched roofs and apartment buildings,
whose roofs are not visible from the street. Roofs of commercial buildings generally appear flat.
Porch roofs vary greatly according to style.

(12)

Walls of continuity. The major wall of continuity is created by the buildings, with their generally
uniform setbacks within block faces. New buildings should conform to these setbacks where they
exist. Fences along building lines extend the major wall of continuity. Hedges extending along
the front lot lines create a minor wall of continuity where they exist, and a major wall of
continuity where they exist in sufficient quantities such as on Shipherd between St. Paul and
Agnes. Gaslights on Parker between Lafayette and the Parkstone parking lot and on Agnes from
Parker to Van Dyke create minor walls of continuity, as do trees on tree lawns. Fences in the
district exist along side lot lines as well as front lot lines. On Shipherd garages on the west side
of the street create the major wall of continuity.

(13)

Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The typical treatment of
individual properties is a flat or slightly graded front lawn area in grass turf, subdivided by a walk
leading to the front entrance from the curb and frequently a side walk beginning at the sidewalk
leading to the rear. Materials for such walks are primarily concrete, although a few brick walks
exist. Some front yards have rectangular raised earthwork terraces upon which the house stands,
sometimes with a brick or stone retaining wall at the change of grade. Foundation plantings,
often of a deciduous character, are present. Hedges between properties and along front lot lines
are not uncommon. Several types of fences exist in the district, including cyclone fences, fences
with wooden posts and rails with wire mesh, wrought iron fences, and brick and concrete walls.
Some large American elm trees remain on the tree lawns in the district, although they are virtually

 extinct. Replacement trees should be characteristic of the area and period, though only a disease
resistant elm would be a practical choice. Very few straight side drives from the street to the rear
are present; alley-facing garages are the norm, although many parking bays are present with alley
entrances. The lack of front driveways leads to a unity of front yards. Street pavements are now
asphalt; cut stone curbs exist with frequency although in some areas they have been replaced with
concrete curbs. Alleys are concrete except for the alley between Shipherd and Van Dyke and the
alley between East Jefferson and Van Dyke Place, which are brick. Steel lighting poles on Van
Dyke are fluted; elsewhere in the district on north/south streets O.P. poles are the predominant
type. On east-west streets and Shipherd there are telephone poles with cranes carrying lanterns.
A boulevard with a landscaped median forty-four (44) feet by three hundred seventy (370) feet
exists on Parker Avenue between the Jefferson and Lafayette and Lafayette Avenue [sic].
(14)

Relationship of open space to structures. In those areas of the district where demolition of houses
has occurred, the character of the open space is haphazard as it relates to the buildings. On
Shipherd, the original relationship between the houses on the east side and the garages on the
west side of the street has been severely altered due to demolition of houses. On both sides of
Seyburn between the alley between Seyburn and Van Dyke Place clearance for redevelopment
has occurred. The arrangements of Shipherd Court provides a central communal courtyard space.
The boulevard on the south end of Parker provides a more spacious setting for the houses facing
it.

(15)

Scale of facades and facade elements. There is a variety in scale from block to block depending
on lot width and style. Houses south of Lafayette are of a more substantial character than those
north of Lafayette, and houses south of Agnes on Parker are the most substantial. Size and
complexity of facade elements and details either accentuate or subdue the scale of the facades.
Facade elements have been determined by what is appropriate for the style. Window sashes are
usually subdivided by muntins which affects the apparent scale of the windows within the
facades.

(16)

Directional expression of front elevations The expression of direction on residential blocks is
neutral, although individual homes may emphasize their verticality or horizontality according to
style. Rowhouses and terraces are horizontal in directional expression; apartment buildings are
vertical. Commercial buildings on Kercheval form a horizontal row.

(17)

Rhythm of building setbacks. Setbacks on the north-south streets in the district vary slightly from
area to area within the district, although they are generally consistent within each street face
and/or subdivision because of the existence of various deed restrictions. Buildings on the main
east-west streets-East Jefferson, Lafayette and Agnes-are less consistent in setback due to more
recent development. The varying designs of the buildings, frequently with slight setbacks or
projections in their facades, cause the buildings to relate to the front setback line in different
ways; this creates a slight variation in setback line.

(18)

Relationship of lot coverage. Lot coverages range from fifteen (15) per cent to eighty (80)
percent. Apartment buildings and rowhouses generally occupy a percentage at the high end of
this range. Most homes are in the twenty (20) per cent to thirty-five (35) per cent range of lot
coverage. Lot coverage is greater north of Lafayette where lots are narrower in width.

(19)

Degree of complexity within the facade The degree of complexity has been determined by what is
typical and appropriate for a given style. The classically inspired buildings usually have simple,
rectangular facades with varying amounts of ornamentation. Foursquare buildings are usually

 less complex with ornament restricted to the porch and entrance and sometimes eaves. Other
more decorative styles frequently have facades complicated by gables, bays, slight setbacks,
porches, an occasional turret, window and door hoods, and carved detail. Apartment buildings
have historical details derived from the styles in which the buildings are designed.
(20)

Orientation, vistas, overviews. Most of the buildings are oriented toward the street. Garages are
usually oriented toward an alley; almost all garages are detached and at the rear of the lot. They
are not generally visible from the street. Houses on the east side of Shipherd are oriented toward
the street and face the garages of buildings oriented towards Seyburn. All houses in Wesson's
Subdivision face the north-south streets, except those on the north side of Lafayette. In other
subdivisions the comer house often faces the east-west streets. Rowhouses and terraces are
usually oriented toward the east-west streets. Buildings on Jefferson are most often slanted
slightly towards the west.

(21)

Symmetric or asymmetric appearance Neo-colonial or classically inspired buildings are usually
symmetrical. Other styles are asymmetrical but most often result in balanced compositions.

(22)

General environmental character. The West Village District is characterized by residential and
minor commercial development dating from 1880-1930. Long, straight streets, a significant array
of housing types, and a cohesiveness achieved through uniform setbacks and heights result in an
urban, medium density neighborhood. Newer commercial and institutional uses exist primarily
on the northern and southern fringes of the district. West Village is of an urban character rare in
Detroit because of the diversity of building types in the area. (Ord. No. 547-H, ' 1(28A-1-39), 218-83)
