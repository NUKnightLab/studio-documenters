FUNDING
N/A
EXPLANATION
The proposed resolution is to approve the TSP, Lease, and Lease Rider, and bylaws to be used for
Lawndale Complex/Lawndale Community Area replacement housing units at Ogden North. The
137 units, including 60 designated for public housing, 49 as affordable housing, and 28 as market
rate units, will be operated by a private developer. Priority will be given to previous residents of
Lawndale Complex/Lawndale Community Area as determined by the Housing Offer Process. It is
understood that a developer has an interest and desire to implement its own lease forms and policy
that encourages consistent community standards for the effective management of its development.
The property specific requirements for applicants contained in the attached ACOP are based on
CHA’s Minimum TSP (Board approved September 21, 2004).
The authorization of approval of the TSP, Lease, and Lease Rider, and bylaws to be used for the
public housing replacement housing units at Ogden North is required at this time to facilitate the
development of these units. CHA, the Developer, and Resident Leadership representing the
interest of residents from Lawndale Complex/Lawndale Community Area, who recommends the
documents as acceptable, have reviewed these documents. A public comment period was held
from May 4, 2010 through June 2, 2010. A public comment hearing was held on May 18, 2010 at
Mt. Sinai Community Institute. Notice for the 30-day comment period was published in the
Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Defender, and El Dia newspapers, as well as posted on the CHA
website and on site at the following Office(s): CHA Administrative Office and Central Advisory
Council. Consideration was given to any forthcoming comments prior to finalizing the documents.
