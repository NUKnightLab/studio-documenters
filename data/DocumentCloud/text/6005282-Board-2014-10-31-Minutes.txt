Report from Chairman of the Board
Chairman Hammock stated that Dr. Shannon and staff have spent an enormous amount of time in the last two (2)
months on the System’s budget; the end of that process is in sight. The fiscal year begins December 1st; County
Commissioners still have some actions and opportunities that they are working on, but the budget is expected to be
approved before the beginning of the new fiscal year. The work has been done in exemplary fashion; CCHHS has
reduced the support level that the County provides through tax dollars, and staff have worked hard in many respects
to make it an effective budget. He added that the budget will be carefully monitored in the coming year to make
sure that targets are achieved.
Chairman Hammock indicated that the Board was fortunate to receive two (2) new Board Members, Emilie N.
Junge and Ric Estrada, and to retain Director Gugenheim, who was reappointed to the Board. Two (2) additional
members are expected to be appointed in the near future, which will round out the full Board. With that in mind,
he has not completely assigned the committee chairs and members for the coming year. He will be doing that in the
month of November. He stated that the Directors can expect a phone call from him in the next couple of weeks
asking them to serve in a particular capacity; he added that all of the Directors have been generous to indicate their
willingness to do that.
Chairman Hammock stated that, also in December, the new dashboard of metrics for the hospitals and various
departments will roll out. The Board will see the dashboard at the January Board Meeting; he noted that it will not
be perfectly refined at that point, but its presentation in January will be an important step toward reviewing that
information each month in a consistent manner, and will begin to allow the Board to track the progress during the
year. His hope is that when it is first presented, there will be an educational process to make sure the Board
understands the metrics, what they mean and what they reveal, so the Board can be better informed about the
progress that is being made on a month-to-month basis.
Chairman Hammock informed the Board of an upcoming event planned by the Cook County Health Foundation
(CCHF). CCHF is a group that is committed to raising money to help the hospital in various program activities; its
Chair is Warren Batts, former CCHHS Board Chairman. They are planning a dinner and reception event at the
Chicago Cultural Center on December 2nd. At the event, they will be honoring Commissioner Butler for his long
service to the healthcare community; they will also be honoring the family of Ruth M. Rothstein, who was a
CCHHS Board Member and a Chief Executive Officer of this Health System for many years.

VII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (Attachment #5)
A.

An Assessment of Corner Stores in Suburban Cook County, Illinois Report, presented for informational
purposes only, to be received and filed (the report is available on the CCHHS website,
www.cookcountyhhs.org, and upon request)

Dr. Shannon provided an update on several subjects; detail is included in Attachment #5.
With regard to the report on the Assessment of Corner Stores in Suburban Cook County, Director Lerner stated that,
as someone who worked in one of those underserved areas for almost seven (7) years, he would like to commend
the Cook County Department of Public Health for this outstanding study. He encouraged them to make an effort to
distribute the report to other institutions throughout the community, and perhaps engage a broader discussion about
how to improve the health of the population by looking at all social attributes, with the specific focus on access to
fresh food.
With regard to the update on the CountyCare advertising campaign, Dr. Shannon indicated that he will share the
audio files containing the radio ads with the Board.
The Board discussed the subject of tracking the redetermination of CountyCare members. Steven Glass, Executive
Director of Managed Care, stated that tracking is very difficult because it requires data that CCHHS does not
maintain; rather, that data is maintained by the State. The State has provided information in terms of deletions of
members; deletions include those members who fall off of the health plan because of their failure to complete the
redetermination process. Mr. Glass stated that redetermination is by far the biggest reason why CountyCare is
losing members. At the last review, roughly 60% of the deletions were due to the redetermination process; the State
has indicated that the average is approximately 50%.
Director Collens suggested that this subject be included in the dashboard; he stated that there could be three (3)
components - gains, losses due to eligibility and losses due to consumer choice. He asked whether the data could be
gathered in that form. Mr. Glass responded that it would not be easy; although the State maintains the data, CCHHS
has access to that data from those applications that were processed at the Hoyne office, which is where the bulk of
the CountyCare applications are processed. There are mechanisms to get that information from those applications;
however, there is not a mechanism in place to get the information from those applications processed outside of the
Hoyne office.
Director Lerner indicated that he has a whole series of strategic and technical questions regarding CountyCare;
however, he was concerned that this is not the body politic where he should present them. He suggested that further
thought be given to the idea of creating a committee of the Board relating specifically to CountyCare. Chairman
Hammock responded that he is seriously considering creating a CountyCare Committee. He stated that he and Dr.
Shannon are discussing that possibility; if that happens, it will be part of the Board’s committee structure that will
be announced in December.
While reviewing the information presented on the updated organizational structure, Dr. Shannon announced that
Douglas Elwell has been selected to fill the position of Deputy CEO of Finance and Strategy; additionally, Dr.
Shannon indicated that Mr. Elwell will be temporarily filling the role of interim Deputy CEO of Operations. With
regard to the organizational chart, Director Gugenheim requested that a list be provided of the positions that are
filled; the list should include the names of those individuals filling those positions1.
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Wiese, moved to receive and file the report on the
Assessment of Corner Stores in Suburban Cook County. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

shall be recorded and entered into the minutes of the closed meeting,” 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(12),
regarding “the establishment of reserves or settlement of claims as provided in the Local
Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, if otherwise the
disposition of a claim or potential claim might be prejudiced, or the review or discussion of
claims, loss or risk management information, records, data, advice or communications from

120/2(c)(17), regarding “the recruitment, credentialing, discipline or formal peer review of

 Response to Ebola

The Cook County Health Hospitals System as a provider of healthcare and the Cook County Department of
Health in its role as the public health department for most of suburban Cook County has been preparing for a
with suspected or confirmed Ebola for the past several months.

Leadership from Infection Control, Emergency Medicine and Public Health are monitoring the situation very 
continue to work with the Chicago and illinois Departments of Public Health, Cook County Homeland Security
Emergency Management, the CDC and our partners in the hospital community. participates in
updates, meetings and briefings with its partners in the healthcare community.

There are important jurisdictional issues that require clarification. In the event a suspect or confirmed case is
at a facility in the City of Chicago, the Chicago Department of Public Health would be consulted where
suspect or confirmed case at a suburban facility would require consultation with the Cook County De]:
Public Health. Both health departments would then consult with the Illinois Department of Public Health and
needed.

On October 20, 2014, the Chicago Department of Public Health announced that four hospitals will serve as tr
hospitals to treat Ebola patients. The protocols guiding this decision and the process of transferring patients 
yet been announced. In the interim, will continue to fully prepare its facilities and workforce.

Provider Response

as a provider of healthcare has protocols in place for screening, isolating and caring for suspect or con
patients with Ebola. The following points are intended to provide a high level overview of readiness as
of healthcare.

Screening:

asked to implement it at their respective clinic or hospital entry point.

The Electronic Medical Record (EMR) has a three question screening tool that is required in 0
advance through the registration screens.

Ongoing training of all intake/registration staff around screening is taking place at patient poi
in clinics and hospitals.

Isolating

We have identified appropriate space to allow for complete isolation of suspect or confirmed
whether they come in through a clinic, emergency room or other location.

Treatment

several weeks.

We have identified the team of medical providers who would be called upon to care for a sus
confirmed case.

Management staff at all points of patient entry/registration have been provided a screeningt

We have had pre-stocked "Ebola carts? including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and he
implements such as stethoscopes for use on single patients at key locations throughout the 5

Supplies have been relocated and ordered to ensure appropriate stock exists in the area identified for
treatment. This includes pharmaceuticals, PPE, radiology and laboratory equipment and supplies. These
supplies and equipment will be designated for use in the Ebola unit. Additional supplies have been
ordered to ensure proper volumes system-wide.

PPE Training

As of October 29th, we have provided PPE training for more than 220 medical providers and training will
continue to be provided throughout the system based on who may be called upon to care for patients.
This training will take time to complete.

We are currently training on/utilizing full coverage from head to toe with fluid resistant materials as the
University of Nebraska Medical Center is using and as the CDC has now recommended.

Simulation training is also taking place to give providers a sense of any adjustments they need to make
in conducting medical procedures while in full PPE.

Staff will be monitored 100% of the time while caring for patients (using the buddy system) as
recommended by the CDC. This direct observation affords protection against inadvertent contamination
of the healthcare worker.

Only staff who have completed full training will be allowed to enter the room of a patient under
investigation or with confirmed Ebola infection

Internal Communications

- staff have been provided regular updates through all staff emails.

- The infection control intranet site has all the information, protocols and Standard Operating Procedures in
one central location for staff reference.

- Should a suspect or confirmed patient with Ebola present, will activate its internal incident command
system to provide additional resources to the matter.

0 The following leadership teams have been thoroughly briefed by the CCH HS team: Senior Leadership,
Physician and Nursing Leadership, Managers and Directors System-wide, Board of Directors, Cook
County Commissioners.

- Thrice weekly operational leadership huddles for updates.

Public Health Response

The Cook County Department of Public Health is the state certified health department for suburban Cook
County excluding the jurisdictions of Oak Park, Evanston, Skokie and Stickney. As such, regularly monitors more
than 70 reportable communicable diseases. In the event a suspect or confirmed case presents at any suburban clinic or
hospital (not just has strict protocols in place guiding their role in disease investigation, contact tracing,
isolation and quarantine.

works closely with the Chicago and Departments of Public Health as well as Cook County Homeland
Security and the CDC.

On October the CDC and the Department of Homeland Security's Customs Border Protection announced new

screening protocols to be put in place at five airports, including O?Hare. These protocols will place arriving pa
from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea into one of four categories.

5563th FS

1. Those exhibiting signs of any illness (Ebola, typhoid, etc). This group will be transported to hospitals for further

 

screening and testing, if warranted. This category will impact if the individual is a resident of 
jurisdiction.
Those without signs or of infection who report "high-risk" exposure to someone with Ebol 

direct contact with blood or body fluid of an Ebola patient without wearing appropriate PPE). This gr up will
receive a quarantine order requiring them to remain in their home location for 21 days following the high-risk
exposure. Travel via commercial conveyance will be restricted for 21 days after the last contact. This ategory
will require direct active monitoring, including twice daily evaluation and temperature che ks, at least
one directly observed in person, by the Cook County Department of Public Health if the individual is resident of
jurisdiction.

Those without who report ?some-risk? Ebola exposure being within 3 feet of an Ebol patient
while not wearing appropriate PPE) may continue in their regularjob duties and community activitie but, in
addition to reporting their temperatures and daily for 21 days, will not be allowed to trav on
commercial conveyances and will require approval from the health department to travel outside its] risdiction.

4. Travelers who are and who do not report known Ebola exposures are considered to in the
"low?risk" group and may continue in their regularjob duties and community activities without mov ment
restrictions. This group will be given a 'care kit? and asked to report in daily for 21 days. The kit includes
instructions, of disease, tracking log and a thermometer. The 'reporting? mechanism includes twice
daily phone calls between a public health professional and the traveler. This category will require 

follow-up in the event the individual is a resident of jurisdiction.

Additionally, the state of Illinois has placed a mandatory monitoring system in place for healthcare workers returning

from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The state is working through the details but it should be expected tha
workers who are residents of jurisdiction, will be the lead agency monitoring the workers an
compliance with the quarantine.

Revised Interim U.S. Guidance for Monitoring Movement of Persons with Potential Ebola Virus Exposure

rt forthose
ensuring

(10.27.14)

CDC has provided updated guidance on monitoring and controlling movement to stop spread of Ebola which

provides definitions of four risk levels for people who may have been exposed to Ebola and for those not at 
disease. (More guidance information can be found at 

This guidance also outlines appropriate public health actions for those individuals classified as ?some risk.? Ti
health care workers who are providing direct care to Ebola patients in West Africa or others, such as observe
enter an Ebola treatment area where Ebola patients are being cared for. Additional precautions, such as dire:
monitoring, are recommended for those classified as ?some risk." in addition, the guidance recommends pub
authorities determine on an individualized case-by-case basis whether additional restrictions, such as control
movement, workplace exclusions, or restrictions on other activities, are appropriate. This daily health consult
give additional confidence to the community that a returning health care worker is and therefc
contagious.

Guidance for returning health care workers from West Africa should be distinguished from health care worke
providing care for Ebola patients in the United States. There are important differences between providing car
performing public health tasks in Africa versus in a US. hospital. A US. hospital provides a more controlled se

a field hospital in West Africa. A US. healthcare worker would be able to anticipate most procedures that would put

them at risk of exposure and wear additional personal protective equipment as recommended. In some place
the same may not be true and workers may not have the ability to prepare for potential exposures.
