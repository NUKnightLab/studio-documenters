IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update on CountyCare Health Plan (Attachment #2)
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, reviewed the information contained in the Update on the
CountyCare Health Plan. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
In response to a question regarding whether System staff can assist CountyCare members with the
redetermination process, Mr. Glass stated that staff can inform or educate the member before that member falls
out of membership; however, once the individual falls off the ranks of the Health Plan, then the marketing
rules kick in and staff’s ability to reach out is restricted.
During the review of the information on slide 10 of the presentation, Mr. Scheer referenced the significant
decrease that occurred in pharmacy expenses between September and October. Mr. Glass explained that a new
formulary was put into place on July 1st with the transition from the former pharmacy benefit manager,
Catamaran, to the new pharmacy benefit manager, U.S. Script. October was the first month where the effects
of the full implementation of that formulary were seen; the administration believes that the dramatic drop in
October is due to that reason. Mr. Scheer requested that the Committee receive information on some of the
more substantive changes in the formulary that might have caused the decrease in the next month or two. Mr.
Glass stated that they believe it is largely due to multi-source brands, as Catamaran had a much broader
formulary on multi-source brands; the administration believes that is the driving factor, but he and his staff will
further research the matter.
Director Butler, seconded by Chairman Collens, moved to accept the Update on the
CountyCare Health Plan. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System Board approved the Medical Home Network (MHN)
contract on 12/14/2012 in the amount of $2,947,760.00 for the services of project management and oversight, as
well as portal connectivity, management and maintenance. MHN has delivered advanced care management
analytics to support proactive care management for CountyCare?s high-risk population. On 12/13/2013, the 
Board approved a no cost extension of the contract through 3/31/2014. On 3/28/2014, the Board approved
an extension of the contract to 11/30/2015 and increased the contract amount by $3,183,740.00 for a total contract of
$6,131,500.00.

  
    
 
 

  
    
    
     
 

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION
MHN services are paid on a per member per month (PMPM) basis using CountyCare?s membership. The
March 2014 increase and extension was built on the budgeted membership of 56,131. With the
transition to County MCCN status on July 1, 2014, CountyCare Health Plan is now able to expand its membership to
include additional Medicaid populations including Family Health Plan (FHP) members and Seniors and Persons with
Disabilities (SPD). These new populations, along with a higher than budgeted amount of ACA Adult members during
most of is the basis for this increase. The not-to-exceed contract amount will be $14,260,100.00.

Financial and Operational Reports

Year To Date September 30, 2014

Page 53 of 68

 Financial Narrative September
Our financial packet remains a work in progress. You will find in this packet the start of our dashboard.
We have a number of items we still need to complete for inclusion here. Many of them involve cost of
care, unfortunately our systems in this area are weak and we will proceed slowly.
Key balance sheet items
1) Accounts receivable has grown 15 days this year. The three drivers include the change in the
required indigent policy which has added time before accounts can be finally adjudicated.
The hold the state had on certain outpatient procedures as they revamped reimbursement.
This was released in November and balances should be reduced going forward. Finally, the
new TPA has not been processing our claims as timely as we would expect. This should be
corrected in the near future.
2) Cash is up $109 million from the beginning of the year. This is partially due to higher than
expected FFS activity, the nature of capitation, and the continued negotiation over waiver
amounts due to CMS.
3) We have increased our payable for the waiver to $73 million. This is extremely conservative,
but we felt it necessary as we continue to work through the issues. The potential payback
ranges from $0 to this amount.
4) Our IBNR stands at $112 million. Based on our review, we believe this number is also very
conservative. We will have Milliman validate our calculations at year end.
5) We have added about $40 million to our accrued expenses to reflect historical experience
with late invoices. This will be reviewed again at month end on a very detailed basis.
Key income statement items
1) CountyCare losses are now estimated at $38 million. We spent a significant amount of time
reconciling all accounts and activity in this area. It appears we are now making a slight profit
on CountyCare operations. The losses stem from December when we still had to make an
IGT for 50% of the amount we received, $25 million, and the ongoing application assistance
activity which is reimbursed at 50% of cost, $15.9 million through September. We made
about $3 million from operations. This is an operation we closely scrutinize as we get more
familiar with operations and opportunities.
2) CCHHS in total lost $28.5 million including the CountyCare loss. This includes $28 million of
depreciation which means our unrestricted fund balance is materially the same as at year
end. This remains a critical success factor related to financings.
3) We continue to experience higher than expected overtime and agency costs. Both are areas
of management attention.
Key risk areas

Page 54 of 68

 1) We are rapidly approaching the deadline for all employees to achieve the flu vaccine. While
the majority of our staff has complied, we could experience overtime and registry costs
overruns if noncompliance is high. This is being monitored almost hour by hour.
2) Our clinics are for the most part too small for our organization. This means that we have
difficulty staffing providers when we have sickness, vacation, etc. in two or three provider
clinics. These clinics are our front door and critical to success in managed care. We will need
to address this issue strategically in 2015 and 2016.
3) The state has delayed FHP moving to mandatory this will impact our revenue numbers in
early 2015. We will need to strategically grow in 2015 to compensate for this. Further our
ACA population numbers are below expectations at the start of the year as
redeterminations have taken a larger toll than planned. We are working on strategies in this
area as well.
4) We are still negotiating with the state the 2015 IGA. The movement to managed care has
made this more challenging for both parties than in previous years.
5) Changes in the state government related to the election will require us to reestablish
relationships and the value proposition we represent.
6) Contracting with other Medicaid MCOs has been slow going, but we continue to have their
patients presenting to us. We have to improve in registration, financial counseling, and
getting authorizations.
The financial statements represent hard work from a number of people, but this month particularly
Dorothy Loving, Aaron Galeener, and Steven Glass.

(This data does not include Immediate Care Visits. It includes ER data only.)

Notes:
- ER Elopes are patients who leave without being seen by a physician.
- "Medicaid-Pending" assumes 30% of the Self-Pay accounts accepted by the eligibility vendor will be successfully converted to Medicaid accounts.
- The "Payer Type" represents the financial class in which the patient presented to CCHHS; it is not necessarily the final financial class for the patient, especially for Self-Pay patients.
