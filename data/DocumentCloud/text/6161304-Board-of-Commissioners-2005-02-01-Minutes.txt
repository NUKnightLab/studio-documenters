Transmitting a Communication, dated January 18, 2005 from
MICHAELE. LAMONT, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
transmitted herewith for your approval is that the bid for the proposal for Contract No. 03-53-864,
Environmental Abatement at the Stroger Hospital of Cook County Campus (which appeared on the
Finance Bid Reports, Section I B, page I, on January 22, 2004 and was jointly referred to the
Construction Committee, Communication No. 263517 and to the Health and Hospitals Committee.
Communication No. 263518) be cancelled and re-bid.
This action is recommended due to the following:
I. It has been over one year (October 28, 2003) since the bids were originally solicited for this
contract.
2. The lowest bidder at a price of $ 1,633, I00.00 bid did not agree to hold its price beyond the
mandatory 90-day period but still expressed a desire to be considered for the work.
3. The second low bidder at a price of $4,288,600.00 was willing to hold its price if the contract
work could be perfonned within a reasonable period of time.
4.

If an award was made to the second low bidder, the lowest bidder might challenge the award
because of the difference in price.

5. The abatement activities would no longer be perfonned concurrently with demolition
activities and thus the terms of the contract would be different this time.
The State's Attorney has reviewed this matter and concurs with this recommendation.

Commissioner Sims, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved that the request of the Director of the
Office of Capital Planning and Policy be approved. The motion carried unanimously.

REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT DIVISION
PROPOSED REAL ESTATE MATTER
Transmitting a Communication, dated January 13, 2005 from
JOHN W. DA VIS, Director, Real Estate Management Division
This office is responsible for entering into easement agreements with companies who have received
pennits from the Highway Department to install pipelines in County Highway rights-of-way. Many of
these easements were executed years ago. Currently, this office is work ing with the State's Attorney's
Office to develop a revised ordinance and form of agreement for these easements, together with an
updated fee structure. The office believes that process should be complete and presented to the Board
within this calendar year.
In the meantime, this office is continuing to administer these easements under the existing structure.
Many of the easement agreements provided for periodic review of the linear footage utilized under each
easement and an adjustment to the fee if the linear footage had increased or decreased. Pursuant to this
adjustment provision, a major audit was undertaken in 1996 and 1997, with the assistance of the
Industrial Engineering Division. Out of the 29 existing agreements, changes to the linear footage were
reported by five of the companies. Since that time, charges have been based upon these audited amounts,
as provided by the agreements.
Unfortunately, since the time of the audit, through turnover in staff and office relocations, documentation
of this audit was misplaced. Therefore, we are asking that this Honorable Body ratify the list of revised
charges.

Your Commi ttee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendation is as follows:
269195

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNfNG AND POLICY by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated January 19, 2005:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization to enter into a
professional services contract with U. S. Equities Development L.L.C. for master planning
services at the Stroger Hospital of Cook County Campus. It is respectfully requested that this
Honorable Body approve this request
The master planning services at the Stroger Hospital Campus are necessary in order to
determine how much clinical and administrative space is necessary now and in the futu re to
support all the medical acti vities at the Stroger Hospital of Cook County. Although the new
Stroger Hospital is currently handling its patient load well, future expansion space
requirements need to be considered. The ambulatory facilities on the campus, i.e. the Fantus
Clinic, are overcrowded and have outlived their useful life. Administrative space on the
campus is inadequate and it is currently split among three buildings on campus and one offsite leased space. Parking on campus is insufficient to meet demand. The master planning
process will detennine the proper number of parking spaces and their location.
The master planning services are the first phase in the final development of facilities at the
campus. The services by the U.S. Equities Development team will consist of the evaluation
and recommendation of the following: the economic re-use of some or all of the old main
hospital building, a replacement primary care facility for Fantus Clinic, options for added
medical/surgical beds on campus. possible expansion of the CORE Center, replacement of
administrative office capacity, expansion of campus parking capacity, freestanding outpatient
phannacy facilities, space for medical and radiology records, space for Bureau of Health
Services research functions, feasibility of student housing and commercial/retail development
as part of the overall campus plan, and economic reuse potential of the 1900 West Polk
Building, the Hektoen Building and the Durand Building.

690

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY I , 2005

traffic/parking and cost estimating. The team has committed to providing a preliminary
report with recommendations within four to five months of the start of this contract.

Sufficient funds remaining from the old hospital demolition contingency have been
appropriated to cover this request.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY I, 2005

Mark Kilgallon, Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources, stated that it is his understanding that
individuals who will be part of the Re-Entry Employment Project would be hired by the County as
employees and then they would be paid to go to the training program. Upon satisfactory completion of
the training program, community-based organizations, such as the Safer Foundation, as well as other
organizations, would be directly involved with the selection process.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved to amend Article Ill,
Section 3-l(a) and 3-l(b). The motion carried.
Section 3-1

Establishment of Review Panel
(a)

In order to faci litate the implementation of this Ordinance, the
Board shall establish a Review Panel consisting of ~
seven (7) members.

(b) The members of the Review Panel shall be appointed as
follows: the Clerk of the Circuit Court appoints one (I)
member; the Chief Judge appoints one (I) member; aa6 the
President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners
appoints three (3) five (5) members; and Commissioner Steele
recommends one (I) member and Commissioner Maldonado
recommends one (I) member for appointment to the President
of the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved to amend Article IV,
Section 4-l(c). The motion carried.
Section 4-1

indiYiduals
eEligible eOffenders
with
ineareerated
misdemeanor convictions earlier than a period of six (6)
months from the date of completion of the sentence upon
which the conviction was imposed or one (I) year to those
with one felony conviction subsequent to their release from
County or State incarceration or supervision.

Commissioner Gonnan asked whether the County currently hires ex-offenders.
Mr. Kilgallon replied that the original ordinance was introduced to focus on the other constitutionally
elected officials because President John H. Stroger, Jr. currently hires ex-offenders who meet the
necessary requirements for the job and taking into consideration their past criminal record.
Commissioner Gonnan asked Mr. Kilgallon whether he could provide statistics regarding this issue.
Mr. Kilgallon replied that such statistics would be difficult to obtain, but that he would look into the
matter.

693

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY I, 2005

Camela Gardner, Assistant State's Attorney, cited the " Proposed Revised Ordinance" and stated that it
provides that the Review Panel will enter into a memorandum of understanding with selected communitybased organizations, such as North Lawndale Employment Network and Safer Foundation, to provide the
services contained in the Proposed Revised Ordinance, Section 5-1.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that the new language in Article V, Section 5-1 should be more
inclusive in reference to community-based organizations, that specifically the amended sentence should
read " ... community-based organizations, such as North Lawndale Employment Network ... "
Ms. Gardner stated that the State's Attorney's Office recommends deleting all references to the specific
entities referenced, or alternatively, indicating that these organizations are not an exhaustive list of
possible organizations. This would ensure that the County has the flexibility to enter a memorandum of
understanding in the future without need for a further revision to the Ordinance.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved to add new language to
Article V, Section 5-1. The motion carried.
Section 5-1 Selection Process for Project Participants
The Review Panel will enter into memorandum of understanding as approved by
the Board with selected Community-Based Organizations such as, but not limited
to, North Lawndale Employment Network and Safer Foundation, to provide the
following services at no cost to Cook County: screening applications for
acceptance to the project; providing employment readiness training as described in
Section 5-2 of this Ordinance; selection of individuals for internship; and
providing supportive services and aftercare as set forth in Section 5-2 of this
Ordinance.

Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, moved to amend Article V, Section
5-2. The motion carried.
Section H 5-2

meftth 365-day County Internship Program, and be in receipt of documentation to
that effect which is to be submitted as the primary evidence of their employment
readiness to the Review Panel for consideration of Certificate of Completion
issuance. Other documents may also be submitted to further support the
participant's status of rehabilitation as related to education, vocational training,
employment and/or volunteer experience.
Participants with State issued
Certificates of Good Conduct, Certificates of Relief from Disabilities or State
professional/occupational licenses shall be afforded favorable consideration when
applying for participation in the Project as well as for employment.

694

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 1, 2005

Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, moved to amend Article V, Section
5-4. The motion carried.
Section H

5-4

County Internship Program

Upon successful completion of the Ex-Offender Employment Readiness TraiRiRg
pE_rogram, participants shall become eligible for a twelve ( 12) moRth 365 day
Internship Program. The Internship Program will have the goal of one hundred
( 100) entry level positions in Cook County government that are identified as
vacant in each fiscal year budget. Participants will be paid the salary consistent
with the grade level budgeted for each vacant position as well as all county health
benefits.
Participants will not be considered for positions where there is a direct relationship
between the previous criminal offense and the specific job sought, or if the
employment of the participant would involve an unreasonable risk to property or to
safety or welfare of specific individuals or the general public.
Upon successful completion of the designated County i-Intemship, participants may
then petition the Review Panel for the issuance of a Certificate of Completion.
Once issued, participants may then apply for an appropriate full time position that
is available with the County and/or participating private sector employers.
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved to delete Article VI, Section
6-l(d). The motion carried.
Section 6-1
This Section shall not affect the right of a person to collaterally
attack his conviction or to rely on it in bar of subsequent proceedings for the same
offense.
(d) A Certifieate of Completion shall Rot lin:iit or preveRt the
iRtrod1:1etioR of evideRee of a prior emwietioR for p1:1rposes of
impeaehmeRt of a \vitRess iR a j1:1dieial or other proeeediRg
where otherwise a1:1thori-ced ey the applieaete mies of
e·,.ideRee.

-fe1@ A Certificate of Completion is not to be deemed to be a
pardon. Nothing contained in this Ordinance shall be deemed
to alter or limit or affect the manner of applying for pardons
to the Governor, and no certificate issued under this
Ordinance shall be deemed or construed to be a pardon.
Commissioner Peraica asked why a participant in this program would be subject to a Class A
misdemeanor.
Ms. Gardner referred to the following: The Proposed Revised Ordinance provides that "A person who
knowingly uses or attempts to use a revoked Certificate of Completion in order to obtain or to exercise
any right or privilege that they would not be entitled to obtain or to exercise without a valid Certificate of
Completion is guilty of a C lass A misdemeanor." ... Proposed Revised Ordinance, Section 7- 1(c).

695

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY I, 2005

Ms. Gardner stated that the State's Attorney's Office recommends that this provision be revised to
provide for a C lass B or a Class C misdemeanor rather than a Class A misdemeanor, in order to conform
with Article 7, Section 6(e) of the Illinois Constitution. She further stated that Class A misdemeanors are
punishable by imprisonment terms of up to a year. The County of Cook, as a home rule entity, may not
punish by imprisonment for more than six months unless authorized by the General Assembly, which has
not occurred in this instance.

Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, moved to amend Article VII,
Section 7-l(c). The motion carried.
Section 7-1
In revoking a Certificate of Completion, the action of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners shall be by majority vote of the members.
(c)

A person who knowingly uses or attempts to use a revoked
Certificate of Completion in order to obtain or to exercise any
right or privilege that they would not be entitled to obtain or
to exercise without a valid Certificate of Completion is guilty
of a Class A Q misdemeanor.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved the approval of
Communication No. 268699, as amended. The motion carried.

WHEREAS, the majority of these individuals upon release return to communities within Cook County;
and
WHEREAS, there are currently 425 ,000 fonnerly incarcerated individuals in Illinois with the majority

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY I, 2005

Honorable Dorothy Brown, Clerk of the Circuit Court, requested that her Report to the Board of
Commissioners be entered into the Record. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the
County Clerk.)
Clerk Brown stated the following: Her report itemizes various technology initiatives commenced under
her Office. There is a possible error on page 23; this page has been replaced. Her office submitted an
application to the Chief Judge; once this application is approved, the Clerk of the C ircuit Court's Office
would be eligible for an electric filing pilot program.
Clerk Brown stated for the record that $ 1 million has been saved through consolidation of the Clerk of the
Court's mainframe with the County. This consolidation occurred in July of 2003.
Commissioner Peraica addressed his question to Clerk Brown and Craig Wimberly, Chief Infonnation
Officer, MIS Division, Clerk of the Circuit Court. He asked what staff reduction there has been as a
result of the hardware and software improvements.
Clerk Brown stated that as a result of the new cashiering system there will be no staff reduction.
However, there also will not be any request for additional staff. Additionally, she anticipates that data
entry personnel will be able to input more information and reduce the existing work backlog.
Commissioner Peraica made a comment regarding the half sheet that the litigant presents to the judge in
the courtroom. This sheet is further processed, involving several levels of personnel. Commissioner
Peraica recommended that a clerk in the courtroom enter all information at the end of the day, thereby
avoiding several levels of processing and the resulting mistakes. He noted that this is particularly
necessary in the Municipal Division.
Clerk Brown responded that this change in procedure would result in unnecessary overtime.
Additionally, this would pose an overwhelming work load for the clerks. A consulting firm, retained by
the Clerk of the Circuit Court's Office, arrived at the same conclusion. However, Clerk Brown will
continue to examine how such a system could be implemented in various courtrooms.
Comm issioner Peraica recommended that any a lterations to the Clerk's system be modeled after the
system in place in federal court. He also noted the collar county's innovation in this area. He further
recommended that such a system be e-mail and internet-based and that the system incorporate video
conferencing and video screens in order to lessen or eliminate paper flow.
Clerk Brown stated the Illinois Bar Association would be involved in whatever changes are undertaken.
Commissioner Daley asked Clerk Brown whether the court system in Miami/Dade County includes the
Traffic Court.
Clerk Brown replied that the Circuit Court Clerk is responsible for the Traffic Court.
Craig Wimberly - Chief Infonnation Officer, MIS Division, Clerk of the Circuit Court, gave an overview
of the initiatives, including: Integrated Cashiering and Security System; County Division Automation
Project; Technology Infrastructure Project; Automation of Records Management; Automation of Central
Bond Court; Integrated Criminal Justice Initiative; Application for E-Filing in the Office of the Chief
Judge; Needs Assessment for Imaging and Document Management; Intranet within the Clerk's Office;
Needs Assessment for Replacing the Juvenile Justice and Child Protection Systems; Total E. Government
Initiative and Enhancement of the Traffic System ' s Voice Information System.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY I, 2005

Commissioner Daley asked Mr. Wimberly to provide Chairman Claypool with the cost of automating the
Clerk of the Circuit Court's Office.
Mr. Wimberly stated that he would provide this infonnation to Chainnan Claypool.
Catherine Maras O' Leary, Chief Info rmation Officer, presented the following overview of the Bureau of
Information Technology and Automation: She stated that President Stroger is strongly committed to
Information Technology and Automation throughout the County. She further stated that last year the
Bureau of Infonnation Technology and Automation had so many excellent ideas that the County's Capital
Budget could not address all of them. Additionally, she noted that great cooperation exists between the
elected officials and the County. She stated that another achievement of the Bureau of Information
Technology and Automation is the infrastructure that has been built. And, although today three
departments are before the Info rmation Technology and Automation Committee, the Bureau of
Information Technology and Automation services one hundred departments within Cook County. She
stated that three-to-five years are required to service all departments. She stated that structured cable and
the wide area network have been implemented under her tenure, at the cost of six million dollars for the
County Building, eight million dollars for the Daley Center, and eight million dollars for the 69 West
Washington Building. She noted that Cook County is the only county in the nation that has a unified
wiring system connecting 26,000 people in ninety buildings and in the 128 municipalities which span not
only the city of Chicago, but many suburbs as well. This was achieved before September 11th. The
Office of Domestic Preparedness, a sub-unit of the Federal Government's Homeland Security
Department, cited Cook County as the only county to be commended after September 11th for its work.
She stated that there is substantial revenue generated by these investments in technology. She further
cited that the Sheriffs Office also has the Criminal Apprehension Booking System, (CABS) . Finally, she
stated that Cook County is the only county in the country that has digital mug shots and criminal histories,
which has allowed Cook County to work effectively with the State of Illinois.
Commissioner Peraica voiced his concern that the Bureau of Information Technology and Automation
needs to hold departments accountable for eliminating positions when technology renders these positions
unnecessary. He further stated that the Bureau of Info rmation Technology and Automation's issues
should be addressed through prioritized initiatives that are put before the State Legislature.
Commissioner Daley stated that the County needs to work with its lobbyists to address this issue. He
further stated that it is the Board of Commissioners' duty, not the Chief Information Officer's, to question
elected officials and to monitor implementation of policy. He further credited Mrs. O'Leary fo r meeting
with a number of staff from elected officials' departments. Commissioner Daley noted that this is a
promising beginning.
Chainnan C laypool reiterated the distinction that Mrs. O'Leary is not an e lected official and that policy
decisions come under the purview of the President of the Board and the Board of Commissioners. He
voiced his concern that efficiency be a key goal in any policy legislated.
The Chairman called upon the following to speak: Zelda Whittler, Undersheriff, and Lisa EnglishDowdell, Director, Information Technology Unit, Office of the Sheriff; Darlena Williams-Burnett, Chief
Deputy Recorder and Ray Wolverton, Director of Technology, Recorder of Deeds Office.

Mark Kil gallon, Director of the Bureau of Human Resources, stated that it is his understanding that
individuals who will be part of the Re-Entry Employment Project would be hired by the County as
employees and then they would be paid to go to the training program. Upon satisfactory completion of
the training program, community-based organizations such as the Safer Foundation, as well as other
organizations, should be directly involved with the selection process.

Commissioner Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved to amend Article III, Section 31(a) and 3-l(b). The motion carried.

(a)

In order to facilitate the implementation of this Ordinance, the
Board shall establish a Review Panel consisting of ~

wi th one felony conviction subsequent to their release from
County or State incarceration or supervision.

Commi ssioner Gonnan asked whether the County currently hires ex-offenders.
Mr. Kilgallon replied that the original ordinance was introduced to focus on the other constitutionally
elected officials because President John H. Stroger, Jr. currently hires ex-offenders who meet the
necessary requirements for the job and taking into consideration their past criminal record.
Commissioner Gorman asked Mr. Ki lgallon whether he could provide statistics regarding this issue.
Mr. Kilgallon replied that such statistics would be difficult to obtain, but that he would look into the
matter.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 1, 2005

Camela Gardner, Assistant State' s Attorney, cited the "Proposed Revised Ordinance" and stated that it
provides that the Review Panel will enter into a memorandum of understanding with selected communitybased organizations, such as North Lawndale Employment Network and Safer Foundation, to provide the
services contained in the Proposed Revised Ordinance, Section 5-1.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that the new language in Article Y, Section 5-1 should be more
inclusive in reference to community-based organizations, that specifically the amended sentence should
read " ... community-based organizations, such as North Lawndale Employment Network .. ."
Ms. Gardner stated that the State's Attorney ' s Office recommends deleting all references to the specific
entities referenced, or alternatively, indicating that these organizations are not an exhaustive list of
possible organizations. This would ensure that the County has the flexibility to enter a memorandum of
understanding in the future without need for a further revision to the Ordinance.

Commissioner Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved to add new language to Article

provide for a Class B or a Class C misdemeanor rather than a Class A misdemeanor, in order to conform
