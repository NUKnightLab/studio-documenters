STAFF REPORT 07-24-2019 SPECIAL MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6338
ADDRESS: 1453 IROQUOIS AVENUE
HISTORIC DISTRICT: INDIAN VILLAGE
APPLICANT: ROGER VAN TOL
STAFF SITE VISIT: 07-16-2019

PREPARED BY: A. PHILLIPS

PROPOSAL
The building located at 1914 Iroquois Avenue is a 2½-story single-family residence constructed in 1909. The
structure is clad in red brick and features limestone and carved wood detail as well as the original wood double hung
windows. The reverse-gable roof is covered in dark gray asphalt shingles and features three dormers facing the street.
The front façade of the main body of the house is symmetrical with the entry to the home at the center of the
composition. A previous renovation transformed a pergola located to the south of the house into an enclosed singlestory addition using red brick to match the main body of the house. A porch exists directly to the west (rear) of the
pergola/addition. The porch is currently accessed through French doors at the pergola/addition as well as a door off
the den at the interior of the house.

With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to demolish the existing rear porch
and stairs and erect a new enclosed addition within the same footprint of the porch per the attached drawings.
Included in the proposal are the following scope items:
• Remove existing rear porch, foundation, and stair in its entirety
• Remove existing exterior French doors and store for later reuse
• Remove existing exterior single door and store for later reuse
• Remove existing aluminum gutters on existing addition in preparation for new continuous gutter across
existing addition and proposed addition
• Pour new concrete footings for addition
• Construct new limestone clad foundation walls
• Erect new 13’-8” x 12’-7” addition (same footprint as existing porch).
o Foundation of proposed addition to be clad in red brick (Specfication: Redland Brick Mohawk 123
Matt) with limestone water table to match existing house.

 (3) new windows – (1) located on west façade and (2) located on the south facade to be double hung
wood windows with muntins to match the construction, materials, and size of the windows on the
second story of the south façade (Specification: Pella Windows Architect Series Traditional 850 with
integral lite grilles in a black finish with insulated low-e glass).
o Window sills to be of cast limestone to match existing
o New trim to match existing in profile and color will continue the existing cornice around both sides
of the addition.
o Roof be continuation of the low-sloped roof of the existing addition.
o Gutters to be K-style seamless gutter to match size and profile of existing gutter.
Backfill around the foundation and re-grade to slope away from the building
Replant in areas disturbed by construction

STAFF OBSERVATIONS
• According to building permit records, it appears the pergola was enclosed in 1965.
• The existing rear porch is heavily screened with plantings and is not highly visible from the right-of-way (see
attached photo).
• The pergola/addition/parlor is a character defining feature of the house, therefore, it is important to keep the
proportions and dimensions of the pergola intact. Extending the length of the pergola with the new addition
causes changes to the historic massing. By cladding the proposed addition in a material that contrasts with the
existing brick, the proportions of the pergola are maintained.
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1) Height. Virtually all of the houses in the district have two (2) full stories plus attic or finished third floor within the
roof; these are generally called "two-and-a-half" story houses. Additions to existing buildings shall be related to the
existing structure; new buildings shall meet the following standards:
(i) The eight (8) adjoining houses on the same face, excluding any houses built since 1930, churches, schools and
commercial structures, shall be used to determine an average height. If eight (8) houses are not available on
the same block face, then one or more houses as close as possible to being directly across the street from the
proposed structure may be used. On Jefferson Avenue, the five (5) existing houses shall be used. The height
of the two (2) adjoining houses shall be added into the total twice, with a divisor of ten (10) (seven (7) on
Jefferson Avenue) used to determine the average. Any new building must have a height of the main roof of at
least eighty (80) per cent of the resulting average; in no case shall a new building be taller than the tallest roof
height included in the computation. In determining the height of existing structures and proposed structures,
the highest point of the main roof shall be used, even where towers, cupolas, or other minor elements may be
higher.
(ii) The level of the eaves of a proposed new structure having as much or more significance for compatibility as
the room height, an average eave or cornice height shall be determined by the same process as that described
above. The proposed new structure shall have a height at the eaves, or cornice, of not less than ninety (90) per
cent of the average determined from existing structures, and in no case shall the eaves or cornice of the
proposed structure be lower than the lowest eave or cornice height used in the computation, nor higher than
the highest.
(2) Proportion of buildings' front facades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on age, style, and location in a
specific subdivision. Height being established by the standards above, proportion will be established by permitting no
proposed building or addition to create a front facade wider or narrower than those existing on the same block.
(3) Proportion of openings within the facade. Window openings are virtually always taller than wide; several windows
are sometimes grouped into a combination wider than tall. Window openings are always subdivided, the most
common window type being guillotine sash, whose area are generally further subdivided by muntins. Facades have
approximately fifteen (15) per cent to thirty-five (35) per cent of their area glazed: Sunporches with a very high
proportion of glass subdivided by mullions and muntins are common.
(4) Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. In buildings derived from classical precedents, voids are usually arranged
in a symmetrical and evenly-spaced manner within the facade. In examples of other styles, especially those of neoTudor and Victorian substyles, voids are arranged with more freedom, but usually is a balanced composition.
(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The spacing of the buildings is generally determined by the setback from
the side lot lines; these tend to be consistent, even though lot width may vary. Because of the existence of several
subdivisions and their related subdivision and deed restrictions, the placement of buildings on lots varies from area to

 area in the district. In the case of very wide properties, two (2) conditions exist. A very wide site may have a house
placed centrally upon it, with extensive side yard space; this occurs only with extremely large houses by district
standards. A more typical placement of houses of avenge size for the district is at the side of the wide site, placed
normally in relation to one of the adjoining houses. The rest of the property is a side yard on the other side of the
house, and the entrance is often oriented toward that side yard.
(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. In those examples of classical inspiration, entrances and porches, if
any, tend to be centered on the front facade. Other examples display more freedom with entrance and porch
placement, with some having the main entrance at the side. Porches, often permanently enclosed sun porches, are
often placed at the side of the building.
(7) Relationship of materials. The majority of the buildings are faced with brick, while many are partially or totally
stucco. There are some stone buildings; clapboard is rare, and almost never the sole material. Wood shingle is
occasionally used as a wall covering, usually at the second floor level, and never as the sole material. Roofing
includes slate, tile, and wooden and asphalt shingles. Stone trim is common. Wood is almost universally used for
window frames and other functional trim, and is used in many examples for all trim. Because of the existence of
several subdivisions and their related deed restrictions, the exterior textures and materials may vary from block to
block in the district.
(8) Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that of the low-relief pattern of
mortar joints in brick contrasted to the smooth surface of wood or stone trim. The use of stucco or concrete, with or
without half-timbering, as a contrast to brick surfaces is not unusual. Tile, slate, or wood shingle roofs have particular
textural values where they exist. Asphalt shingles, generally, have little textural interest, even in those types which
purport to imitate some other variety.
(9) Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors (red, yellow, brown, buff) predominate in wall surfaces. Natural stone
colors also exist. Where stucco or concrete exists, it is usually left in its natural state, or painted in a shade of cream.
Roofs are in natural colors (tile and slate colors, wood colors) and asphalt shingles are predominantly within this same
dark color range. Paint colors often relate to style. The classically inspired buildings, particularly neo-Georgian,
generally have woodwork painted white, cream or in the range of those colors, including "putty." Doors and shutters
are frequently dark green or black. Colors known to have been in use on buildings of this type in the eighteenth or
early nineteenth centuries on similar buildings may be considered for suitability. Buildings of Medieval inspiration
(notably neo-Tudor) generally have painted woodwork and window frames of dark brown or cream color. Halftimbering is almost always stained dark brown. Queen Anne or late Victorian examples may have several paint colors
on a single facade. These tend to be dark in tone and frequently of the "earth tone" family. The original colors of any
house, as determined by professional analysis, are always acceptable for that house, and may provide suggestions for
similar houses.
(10) Relationship of architectural details. These generally relate to style. Neo-Georgian buildings display classic details,
mostly in wood, and sometime in stone. Areas commonly, but not always, treated are porches, shutters, window
frames, cornices, and dormer windows. Details on Mediterranean style or vernacular buildings are often done in
stone, brick, tile, and sometimes in stucco. They include arched windows, door openings, and porches. Buildings of
medieval inspiration tend to have details in the form of carved wood or carved stone ornament on window frames,
door frames, and eaves. Queen Anne or late Victorian style buildings tend to have details in wood, stone, or molded
brick commonly embellishing cornices, window frames and door frames. In general, the various styles are rich in
architectural details.
(11) Relationship of roof shapes. Roofs with triangular gables and hip roofs predominate. A few examples of the gambreltype roof exist. Complex arrangements of the gabled and/or hip types, with subsidiary roofs, are not unusual. Dormers
are common. Flat roofs exist primarily on porches and sunrooms, and other minor elements; large hip roofs sometimes
have relatively small flat sections in the center.
(12) Walls of continuity. The major wall of continuity is created by the buildings, with their uniform setbacks within the
blocks. New buildings should contribute to this wall of continuity. Where gaslights are sufficiently numerous, and
where trees in rows have survived in sufficient numbers, minor walls of continuity are created. Fences across side lots
contribute to the major wall of continuity where placed at the front yard setback line.
(13) Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatment. The typical treatment of individual properties
is a flat front lawn area in grass turf, often subdivided by a walk leading to the front entrance, and sometimes with a
walk at the side leading to the rear. Materials for such walks are concrete, brick, or stone, or combinations of those
materials. Some front yards have rectangular raised earthwork terraces upon which the house stands. These unpaved
terraces have sloping embankments or brick and/or stone retaining walls at the change of grade. Foundation plantings,
often of a deciduous character, characteristic of the period 1895—1930, are present virtually without exception.
Hedges between properties, and ornamental front yard fences or hedges are not uncommon. The American elm is

 virtually extinct in the district, though once the dominant tree. Replacement trees should be characteristic of the area
and period, though only a disease-resistant American elm would be a practical choice. Plantings of new trees should
be directed toward the restoration of the former straight-line rows of large trees on the front yards and "tree lawns."
Straight side driveways leading from the street to rear garages exist, but alley-facing garages are common, particularly
in the southern portion of the district. Where alley-facing garages are common, the lack of driveways lends a unity to
the succession of front lawns. Driveway materials include concrete, brick and gravel. Side lots are not uncommon in
the district, and a number of these form a part of the original site plan for the residence. Such side lots are usually
landscaped, often fenced at or near the setback line, and very occasionally contain paved areas such as a tennis court.
The street right-of-way of eighty (80) feet combined with a pavement width of between twenty-four (24) and twentynine (29) feet creates wide "tree lawns" or berm areas, which adds to the generous ambience of the urban landscape of
the district. Street pavements are now asphalt; cut stone curbs still exist in portions of the district. Alleys are
frequently paved with brick, particularly where alley-facing garages are common. Fencing ranges widely in type;
fencing in public view was generally designed to compliment the style, design material, and date of the residence.
(14) Relationship of open space to structures. Open space in the district occurs in the form of vacant land, a city park,
school yards for the Waldorf and Nichols Schools, and side lots. Where an original or early arrangement of a house
and grounds included and still includes landscaped lots which form part of the landscaping plan for the residence,
such landscaped lots are significant landscape features.
(15) Scale of facades and facade elements. There is a variety in scale from block to block and style to style; most houses
have a large and substantial appearance. The size and complexity of facade elements and details either accentuate or
subdue the scale of the facades. Facade elements have been determined by what is appropriate for the style. Large
wings at the front are atypical, while small wings at the side, usually in the form of sunrooms and sunporches, are
common. Window sash are usually subdivided by muntins, which affects the apparent scale of the windows within the
facades.
(16) Directional expression of front elevations. In general, the expression of direction is neutral.
(17) Rhythm of building setbacks. Because of the existence of various subdivisions and their related subdivision and deed
restrictions, setbacks vary from area to area within the district, though they are consistent within each block or area.
The varying designs of the houses, occasionally with slight setbacks in the facades, cause the houses to relate to the
front setback line in different ways; this creates a slight variation in the setback line. Nevertheless, within each block
or area a wall of continuity is created.
(18) Relationship of lot coverage. Lot coverage ranges from fifty (50) per cent to twelve 912) per cent or less in the case
of homes with large yards. Most homes are in the twenty (20) per cent to thirty (30) per cent range of lot coverage.
(19) Degree of complexity within the facade. The degree of complexity has been determined by what is typical and
appropriate for a given style. The classically inspired buildings usually have simple, rectangular facades with varying
amounts of ornamentation. Other styles, such as "Queen Anne" and those of Medieval inspiration, frequently have
facades complicated by gables, bays, slight setbacks, porches, and occasionally, turrets.
(20) Orientation, vistas, overviews. While most of the buildings are oriented toward the street, it is not unusual for an
entrance to face the side, especially in the case of a landscaped side lot or corner house. The street facade in these
cases is well coordinated with the rest of the street facades. Garages are frequently oriented either toward an alley or a
side street; almost all garages are detached and at the rear of the lot. In those few cases where pre-1930 houses have
attached garages, they are at the rear and are entered from the side or rear. The doors of such attached garages are
generally not visible from the street.
(21) Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Neo-Georgian and other classically inspired buildings are generally
symmetrical. Other styles, including the neo-Tudor, are generally asymmetrical, but balanced compositions.
(22) General environmental character. The Indian Village District, with its long, straight streets, its hierarchy of walls of
continuity (lamps, trees, buildings) and its large, dignified homes, has an urban, substantial, low density residential
character.

RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the work, as proposed, does not negatively impact the character-defining features of the
historic building, its site, and setting. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission find the demolition of the
existing rear porch and steps and the erection of a new addition in the same footprint to be appropriate as the scope of
work meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation
• 9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the

 massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its
environment.
However, staff recommends the following conditions:
• The exterior cladding of the addition be of a material that is in contrast to the pergola/existing addition
(brick).
