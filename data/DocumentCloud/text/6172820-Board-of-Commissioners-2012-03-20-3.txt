The purpose of Request for Proposal No. 11-00853 (the was to solicit vendors to
implement Learn and Earn program, a six-week academic enrichment and career
exploration program for CHA youth, ages 13-15. The Program is aligned with comorate
strategy, including creating healthy and strong communities and helping families maximize their
potential.

Program l-listomr
The impetus for the Program arose in 2008 when several CHA Commissioners raised concerns

that youth in this age group lacked opportunities during the summer because they are too old for
Chicago Park District summer camps and too young for summer employment. The Program was
piloted in 2008 for 140 CHA youth. In 2009, the Program was expanded to accommodate 310
participants. Learn and Earn was increased to the current 700 slots in 2010 and 201 (721 youth
enrolled in 2011). From 2008 to 201], the Learn and Earn summer youth program was funded
by CHA through intergovernmental agreements with the city of Chicago Department of Family
Support Services and managed jointly by DFSS and CHA Resident Services staff.
However, with the change in administration at DF SS, CHA was asked to assume direct control
for managing the Program.

Program Model Bene?t to Participants
The Program provides an academic enrichment and career development opportunity for

approximately 700 CHA youth in order to prevent learning loss during out-of-school time.
Research of best practices demonstrates the importance of the Program. According to
Alexander, Entwisle and Olsen, achievement gaps occur for youth during the summer months
and the impact of learning loss subsequently impedes the educational progress of children of low
socioeconomic status. In 2012, CHA will utilize pre- and post-tests and participant surveys to
measure and document the effectiveness of the Program. Program metrics will include, but are
not limited to maintaining program attendance, academic achievement and lack of learning loss,
program satisfaction, and commitment to school attendance during the following academic year.

The Program will be in session for six (6) hours per day, ?ve (5) days a week, for a total of 30
hours per week. CHA will be leveraging its relationship with City Colleges of Chicago 
who will be providing space for the Program at all 7 City College of Chicago campuses. CHA
will also leverage its relationship with DFSS, who will be providing breakfast and lunch for
program participants through the Summer Food Service Program.

The Program will be held at City College campuses in order to provide youth an environment
conducive to learning that is different from a traditional high school setting. Attending and
navigating classes at a college campus provides CHA youth with exposure to higher education
and encourages thinking beyond high school. Youth will also receive a stipend of up to $600
based on attendance for their participation. This is similar to other summer programs operated
by CHA and other organizations that provide stipends After School Matters, DFSS, etc.).

During the program, youth will participate in a morning academic enrichment session based on
the approved curriculum that will focus on reading and math pro?ciency. In the a?emoon
session, youth will participate in career development activities, including industry and career
awareness, exploration and preparation. Each participant will complete a work ready pro?le,
career development plan and participate in mock interviews. The daily curriculum will be
supplemented with supportive engagement activities including guest speakers and weekly ?eld
trips designed around contextualized learning. Field trips are used to expose youth to multiple
industry sectors and occupations.

Contractor Background

The Contractors selected to operate the Program will be responsible for staffing, managing and
implementing the curriculum at each site. The four (4) selected Contractors have a unique
combination of experience with the Program. Following a competitive procurement process,
CHA is recommending:

0 Catholic Charities will operate the Program at Malcolm College and Kennedy King
College for 200 CHA youth. In 2011, DF SS also selected Catholic Charities as a new
Learn and Earn provider and they were satis?ed with their performance.

0 UCAN will operate the Program at Olive Harvey College for 180 CHA youth. UCAN
has been a Learn and Earn provider since the program?s inception in 2008. DP SS and
CHA have been satis?ed their performance.

Beginning School Study. New Directions for Youth Development, 2007 32.

 SER will operate the Program at Dawson Tech and Harold Washington College for 200
CHA youth. SER has also been a Learn and Earn provider since the program?s
inception and DFSS and CHA have been satis?ed with their performance.

0 Summer Advantage will operate the Program at Truman College and West Side Tech
for 120 CHA youth. Summer Advantage has received national recognition for a similar
summer enrichment program implemented across the country, including within several
charter schools in Chicago. In 2011, DF SS selected Summer Advantage to implement
the curriculum for all Program sites. CHA will also be utilizing Summer Advantage to
implement the curriculum and conduct pre- and post-tests at all Program sites.

PROCUREMENT HISTORY

The CHA released and advertised the RFP on December 2, 2011 to solicit consultants and/or
?rms to implement Learn and Earn summer youth program. The RFP was advertised in
the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Defender, Extra, the CHA website, and BuySpeed 
procurement system). The also directly solicited 159 ?rms, including 23 
?rms. A pre-proposal meeting was held on December 14, 2011, with vendors representing six
(6) ?rms in attendance. The CHA received ?ve (5) proposals on January 11, 2012. An
evaluation committee consisting of ?ve (5) members evaluated the proposals.

After the Evaluation Committee completed its analysis of the proposals, a competitive range was
set and approved by the Contracting Of?cer, and 4 ?rms were found to be within the competitive
range, and were scheduled for oral presentations on February 1, 2, 3 and 7, 2012. During these
meetings, negotiations were held and best and ?nal offers were submitted by each ?rm. Based
upon the evaluations of the written proposals, oral presentations and best and ?nal offers, it was
determined that Catholic Charities, SER, Summer Advantage and UCAN will provide the best
overall service and value to CHA. The average cost per participant of the program will be
approximately $2,000. Based on experience, it is necessary to maintain a ratio of 1:10
(instructors to youth) in the Program, with 62% of the per participant cost being dedicated to
wages for teachers and support staff.

Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Officer, or his designee, to enter into cost-reimbursement contracts for a l-year term, with 3, 1?
year options with: (1) Catholic Charities in an amount not-to-exceed $386,920 for the initial
term; (2) SER in an amount not to exceed $400,000 for the initial term; (3) Summer Advantage
in an amount not to exceed $283,772 for the initial term; and (4) UCAN in an amount not to
exceed $350,709 for the initial term, to implement Learn and Earn summer youth
program for CHA youth ages 13-15. These amounts are exclusive of the approximate $420,000
in stipends (up to $600 per student based on attendance) that will be paid to program participants
by CHA.
