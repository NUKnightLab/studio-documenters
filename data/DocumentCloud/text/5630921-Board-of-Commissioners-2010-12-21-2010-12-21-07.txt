GENERAL BACKGROUND
In November 2009, the Board authorized CHA to negotiate and enter into one-year contracts with CNH,
E&ES, HHCS, JAHHA, MFS and UCAN to provide comprehensive case management services through
the FamilyWorks program. The Contracts initial term was January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010
with four (4) one-year option periods. Pursuant to the Board’s approval, CHA amended the six (6)
FamilyWorks contracts to implement 2010 youth and adult employment initiatives including Put Illinois
to Work, JobStart and Youth Ready Chicago. During the base term of the contracts, Resident Services
has been satisfied with each agency’s contractual performance. However, due to the structure of the
incentive outcomes it is anticipated that most of the agencies will not earn incentive dollars this year.
Resident Services is requesting the Board’s authorization to exercise the first one-year option of the
contract.
The FamilyWorks program is designed to serve families residing in CHA’s family developments and
scattered site communities, and families that relocated temporarily to the private housing market with a
Housing Choice Voucher (HCV). FamilyWorks agencies work closely with CHA staff and property
management to facilitate efficient communication and coordination regarding resident needs. The six (6)
FamilyWorks agencies serve approximately 9,000 CHA families throughout the City of Chicago.
Residents of Horner/West Haven Park, Oakwood Shores, Roosevelt Square, Park Boulevard, Hilliard
Homes, Parkside, and North Town Village receive case management services through other service
providers and are not currently covered through these contracts.
The FamilyWorks program model addresses two important challenges facing CHA families: housing
stability and employment. FamilyWorks agencies employ youth and senior liaisons to assist in the
coordination of services and activities with CHA’s Director of Youth Opportunities and Director of
Senior Support Services. The program model utilizes identifiable outcomes with an intensive
concentration on permanent housing choices, lease compliance, employment preparation and employment
retention. Specifically, FamilyWorks agencies: 1) utilize a tiered caseload with varying levels of service
based on resident housing choice, level of need and current housing status; 2) provide families with the
employment preparation and retention services necessary to meet the minimum leasing requirements at
the families’ housing choice, including the CHA work requirement; 3) provide housing counseling to
households who have not yet made a permanent housing choice in accordance with the Relocation Rights
Contract; 4) provide clinical and wellness services (assessment, counseling and target referrals) to
individuals who may have an undiagnosed developmental disability or are in need of mental health
treatment or substance abuse treatment; 5) provide supportive services to assist residents in their housing,
employment and clinical goals (e.g. lease compliance, financial planning, transportation, child care,
workforce supports, etc); and 6) ensure families are made aware of the available services and programs in
the citywide network.
The numbers below do not reflect the total number of CHA residents enrolled in educational opportunities
in FY2010, but are based only on completed outcomes through FamilyWorks as of October 30, 2010.
FamilyWorks agencies have placed 562 CHA residents in permanent jobs and facilitated subsidized
employment for 2,109 CHA residents who participated in employment programming in Summer 2010

60 East Van Buren Street · Chicago, Illinois 60605-1207 · (312) 913-7282 · www.thecha.org

 (e.g. Put Illinois to Work, JobStart). Due to the significant number of subsidized employment initiatives
this summer, FamilyWorks agencies needed to focus their employment resources almost exclusively on
placing participants into subsidized job opportunities. Upon completion of these summer opportunities,
FamilyWorks agencies renewed their focus on permanent jobs, including transitioning residents in
summer programs to permanent jobs.
In addition to placement services, residents received education and training services that enabled them to
maintain lease compliance and meet the work requirement including, but not limited to: 1,331 residents
completed job readiness training, 1,714 residents took the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE), and
206 residents enrolled in college or post-secondary education. Additionally, agencies assisted 677
households resolve lease compliance violations, and filled the remaining 80 slots of the public housing
Family Self-Sufficiency Program, which is now at its capacity of 350 participants. FamilyWorks
agencies also assisted the aging in place senior population by completing 983 File for Life programs, and
assisted over 400 seniors with emergency food and access to medical equipment. In regard to clinical
services, 947 residents have engaged in substance abuse education workshops and counseling sessions so
far this year (group or individual). As of October 2010, more than 78% of eligible individuals have
engaged with FamilyWorks to set and accomplish individual goals.
In 2011, CHA intends to coordinate services for the Family Self-Sufficiency Program (FSS) through the
FamilyWorks contracts. FSS is a HUD-sponsored program that enables public housing and HCV
residents to build financial assets as the household increases earned-income from wages. FSS
participation generally lasts five (5) years, during which participants identify educational, professional
and personal goals. Approximately 350 public housing residents and 1550 Housing Choice Voucher
participants are currently participating in FSS. FamilyWorks agencies will work with FSS participants to
develop and monitor FSS service plans as well as coordinate financial literacy workshops and counseling
sessions, provide employment preparation, placement and retention services, and connect participants to
job training and other educational advancement opportunities.
In addition, Resident Services will no longer be assigning families through a separate contract for the
CabriniWorks program in 2011. Families at Cabrini will continue to be assigned to Heartland Human
Care Services through their FamilyWorks contract, and those who have relocated will be assigned to other
FamilyWorks providers based on their zip code. Eliminating this separate contract for the CabriniWorks
program has contributed to an overall increase in the number of families served through the FamilyWorks
contracts.
To monitor the success of the program, CHA will continue to initiate performance-based contracts with
the agencies. CHA staff will continue to monitor and perform quality assurance of the agencies
including, but not limited to, monthly performance reports of individual agencies, participant file audits,
quarterly monitoring visits with agencies and on-going resident customer satisfaction reviews. In 2010,
FamilyWorks agencies improved the organization of participant files and related documentation to
support goals completed by participants.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive Officer, or
his designee, to exercise the first one-year option of the contracts with Centers for New Horizons,
Employment & Employer Services, Inc., Heartland Human Care Services, Jane Addams Hull House
Association, Metropolitan Family Services and Uhlich Children’s Advantage Network to provide
comprehensive case management services for CHA residents for the period of January 1, 2011 through
December 31, 2011 in an aggregate amount not-to-exceed $25,100,000, adding it to the carryover balance
available at the end of the current contract term.
