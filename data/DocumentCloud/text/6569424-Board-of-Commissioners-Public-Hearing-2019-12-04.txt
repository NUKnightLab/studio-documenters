CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2020 BUDGET SUMMARY

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Contents

  

It is an honor to present the Chicago Park District’s 2020 Budget – a spending plan that reasserts
our continued commitment to serve children and families by investing in all of Chicago’s parks
and neighborhoods.
As in prior years, this $487 million budget was developed with care and rigor and rooted in the
Park District’s core values. We remain focused on putting children first, offering the best deal
in town, supporting a capital campaign that is “built to last” and providing a staff that always
makes the extra effort.
The 2020 budget includes the expansion of programming, as well as new opportunities for Chicagoans. Those
range from: the creation of new teen summer employment opportunities; increasing after-school programming;
introducing new youth sports programming; and opening world class athletic and recreation facilities on the
south and west sides (Gately Park Track & Field and Addams Park, respectively).
This coming year’s budget is an estimated $23.6 million increase over the FY2019 adopted budget. When
excluding the internal reimbursements of $4.9 million, the recommended plan is roughly a 5% increase over the
2019 budget. Through continued staff right sizing and resource allocation, the Park District will decrease the
number of full-time equivalent positions from 2019, but that will not prevent us from serving the needs of each
community. In addition, families in need will still have access to more than $3 million in financial assistance and
as always, no child will be turned away from a program for an inability to pay. This budget positions us to stay on
our path to expand in a fiscally responsible manner.
At $324 million, property taxes and personal property replacement tax make up the majority (67%) of Chicago
Park District revenues. The Park District will implement a nominal property tax increase in 2020 that will cost the
average homeowner $3.99. This increase is necessary for the financial well-being and stability of our parks. In
2020, we anticipate an increase in TIF funds received from the city that will go directly toward funding the pension
obligation, which will start a multi-year payment ramp up that will help stabilize the health of the pension fund.
Revenue growth will also come in the form of an increase in permit revenue with the Chicago Fire’s return to
Soldier Field. In 2020, program fees will not increase, remaining the same as Fall 2019 fees.
This past year was momentous for the Park District having celebrated our 85th anniversary and having reached
a new accord with our labor partners. This coming year’s budget calls for wage increases for staff, where the
lowest paid staff members will see the greatest increase, as part of the new contract. The new labor agreements
demonstrate passion for the work and mutual respect among park staff. That collegial rapport with labor partners
continues, as the conversation on the Park District pension evolves and we work toward a sustainable solution.
As a team we are driven to serve all Chicagoans.
Chicago’s parks are the glue that binds our neighborhoods. I am honored to work alongside the very best park
professionals in America, and I look forward to continuing to serve all Chicagoans.
Thank you for the privilege to serve.
Sincerely,

Michael P. Kelly
General Superintendent & CEO
Chicago Park District

City of Chicago Demographics
The City of Chicago sits at the confluence of Lake Michigan with two rivers, the Chicago and Calumet. Covering an
area of 228 square miles, Chicago has utilized its beautiful setting to become the hub of the Midwest. Home to a
population of over 2.7 million, Chicago ranks as the third most populous city in the United States and the largest
in the interior of North America. A diverse metropolis of vibrant neighborhoods and over 600 parks, Chicago
offers residents and visitors alike an array of experiences found nowhere else.

Chicago Park District
As the green backdrop of the City, the Chicago Park District plays a prominent role in the Chicago experience.
The District is one of the largest municipal park managers in the nation, owning more than 8,800 acres of green
space and offering a vast array of facilities and amenities for all ages and interests, including parks, playgrounds,
lakefront beaches, pools, cultural centers, fitness centers, golf courses, museums, and harbors to name a few.
Strong park systems are a key component in building strong cities. Investments in parks and recreation are
investments in communities as they provide spaces for children to play, neighbors to gather and community
bonds to form. Chicago's park system has expanded dramatically over the years to add thousands of new acres,
millions of dollars in capital investment and thousands of events and program offerings. From basketball courts
and artificial turf fields at neighborhood parks to transformational projects such as the 312 River Run, Gately
Track and Field, and the Ford Calumet Environmental Center at Big Marsh Park, park capital improvements have
the potential to touch the lives of all city residents and visitors, knitting the fabric of the city closer together. For
example, through Chicago Plays! playground initiative, the District rebuilt 325 playgrounds across the city so that
every child in every neighborhood is within a 10-minute walk of a park or playground. Park programs and events
create hubs of positive activity, strengthening community ties and reducing crime.

The Chicago Park District oversees the Garfield Park Conservatory
and the Lincoln Park Conservatory, tropical paradises within the
city that house thousands of rare and exotic plants. In addition,
the Chicago Park District oversees historic lagoons, plus bird and
wildlife gardens. From rich pond life teeming with frogs, herons, and
dragonflies, to shrubby areas where migratory birds stop to rest, to
lush prairies filled with native grasses and wildflowers, the Chicago
Park District offers many ways to explore nature within the city’s parks.
Popular attractions that fall under the management of the Chicago Park
District include the Clarence Buckingham Memorial Fountain, which is
located in Grant Park. Proudly referred to as “Chicago’s front yard,” Grant
Park is among the city’s loveliest and most prominent parks. Eleven worldclass museums are located on Chicago Park District property, three of them
in Grant Park: the Art Institute, the Field Museum of Natural History and
the Shedd Aquarium. More than 20 million people visit Grant Park and
Buckingham Fountain annually, making it the second most visited park
landmark in the U.S. In addition to these landmarks, the Chicago Park
District offers hundreds of stunning facilities, many of which are rented for
special events.
Strengthening our focus on the natural environment, and eco-recreation as
a rapidly growing field within community recreation, total acreage increased
from 12,917 acres in 2017 to 13,547 acres in 2018, a nearly 5% increase.
Expanding our acreage with new acquisitions and development, as well as
taking over management of existing parkland, enables the Chicago Park
District to reach all of its residents and visitors with a variety of recreation
and leisure opportunities to choose from.

opportunities.
•  Provide safe, inviting, sustainable and beautifully maintained parks and facilities.
•  Create a customer-focused and responsive park system that prioritizes the needs of children and

 Children First
Our most important role is to bring children and families into our parks and give them great reasons to stay and
play for a lifetime. One of our primary goals within this value is the development of new opportunities, while
expanding our most popular activities so that every child can experience all that we have to offer. To do this, we
routinely review enrollment statistics, solicit feedback from our guests and then use this data as a driver to assess
families' needs and interest to tailor our program offerings. We give every child a reason for, and an opportunity
to, play in the world-class parks we maintain.

In 2020, the Community Receation Sailing Department will operate as its
own unit and work towards increasing
programming opportunities for the
youth, as it establishes a sailing center at
the Monroe Harbor. In partnership with
Afterschool Matters, the department will
also develop an apprenticeship program
for teens in powerboat training.

Best Deal in Town
We prioritize quality in our programs and accountability in our fiscal management to provide excellent and
affordable recreation opportunities that invites everyone to come out and play. Families in need will still have
access to more than $3 million in financial assistance and as always, no child will be turned away from a program
for an inability to pay.

In our task to remain the “Best Deal in
Town,” we will continue to incorporate
new revenue opportunities to help us
maintain our strong financial position.
In 2020, we are honored to say that the
Chicago Fire will return to Soldier Field
to play their home games in our 61,000
seat-stadium.

Built to Last
We use our capital funding to renew our aging infrastructure in a sustainable manner and leverage partnerships
that produce new parks and facilities that are forward-thinking, environmentally sensitive and world-class. We
have inherited a world-class park system that has served generations of Chicagoans and it is our duty to ensure
the vitality endures. At the same time, we understand the need for ongoing maintenance of our prized assets and
expansion over time. These assets include fieldhouses, sculptures, landscapes, and natural areas. To achieve this
end, we strategically utilize our capital resources, and leverage partnerships, to continually do more with less. In
doing so, we will honor our inheritance and build for the next generation.

Currently under construction, Chicago’s first public indoor track and field complex, the Gately Indoor Track
& Field, is expected to open to the public in the Spring of 2020. The 139,000 square foot facility will feature
a hydraulically banked, 200-meter track; seating for 3,500 spectators; and an eight-lane full track and field
space for events such as hurdles, long jump, high jump and shot put. The building will also host sports such
as basketball, football, volleyball, and lacrosse, as well as serve as the main operations hub for Chicago’s
nonprofit After School Matters program.

Basis of Budgeting
The District’s annual budget is adopted on a non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) budgetary basis for all
governmental funds except the debt service funds, which at the time of the issuance of bonds, shall provide for the levy
of taxes, sufficient to pay the principal and interest upon said bonds as per State code, and capital project funds, which
adopts project-length budgets. The legal level of budgetary control (i.e., the level at which expenditures may not exceed
appropriations) is at the fund and account class level.
The District’s department heads may make transfers of appropriations within a department. Any transfers necessary to
adjust the budget and implement park programs may be made by the District, as long as the changes do not require transfers
between account classes (common groupings of expenditures), and do not exceed the approved appropriation. Transfers of
appropriations between funds or account classes require the approval of the Board.
All annual appropriations lapse at fiscal year-end if they remain unused and unencumbered. Encumbrance accounting is
employed in governmental funds. Encumbrances (e.g., purchase orders, contracts) outstanding at year-end are reported
as an assignment of fund balance and do not constitute expenditures or liabilities because the commitments will be carried
forward and honored during the subsequent year.
As a rule, the District presents the annual budget on a modified accrual basis of accounting, with the exception of property
taxes. Budgetary Basis refers to the basis of accounting used to estimate financing sources and uses in the budget.
Modified Accrual is the method under which revenues and other financial resource increments are recognized when they
become susceptible to accrual; that is, when they become both “measurable” and “available to finance expenditures of the
current period.” “Available” means collectible in the current period or soon enough thereafter to be used to pay the liabilities
of the current period. This is different than the accrual basis which indicates revenues are recorded when they are earned
(whether or not cash is received at the time) and expenditures are recorded when goods and services are received (whether
cash disbursements are made at the time or not).
The District’s basis of budgeting is the same as GAAP basis except for the following: 1) in the budgetary basis, encumbrances
are expenditures, whereas GAAP reflects encumbrances as an assignment of fund balance; 2) for budget, the District classifies
as revenues both long-term debt proceeds and transfer-in, whereas GAAP classifies these as other financing sources; 3)
interfund revenues and expenditures are included on the budgetary basis but are eliminated for GAAP, and 4) encumbrances
are treated as expenditures in the year the encumbrance is established.

Budget Policy
The District operates on a calendar-year basis beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. The adopted budget is
balanced, in that the budgeted expenditures do not exceed the anticipated revenue for the fiscal year. During the course of
the fiscal year, if there is a significant change to the budget, a supplemental appropriation will be submitted to the Board.
When a supplemental appropriation is submitted, the Board must give 10 days’ notice and hold a public hearing before
passage. Board action is required to make budget adjustments to transfer expenditure authority from one fund to another
and to make adjustments across account classes (i.e. from personnel services to contractual services).

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2020 BUDGET SUMMARY

24

 The Revenue Policy provides overall guidelines and structure for determining fees and managing other revenue sources
of the Chicago Park District. It is intended to be used as a guide to assist with responsible budgeting and long term fiscal
planning. Exceptions to these guidelines may be authorized, from time to time, after review by the General Superintendent
and his/her administrative staff. Annually, fees may be raised considering market conditions or in general alignment with the
Consumer Price Index. Fees are recommended by the General Superintendent and approved by the Board of Commissioners.
The Fee Schedule may be found in the Park District’s Annual Appropriation Ordinance. This policy does not apply to the
Property Tax Levy or PPRT. This policy applies to the following revenue sources:
• 

Activity/Membership Fees and Discounts
The Chicago Park District establishes these fees with the stated purpose of encouraging participation in our programs
and facilities, particularly among children and teenagers. Input is provided by local park staff to determine how a
park’s activities may be affordable by the local community. Because Chicago has such a wide and diverse economy, fee
structures may vary from community to community and local socio-economic factors may be considered.

• 

Permit Fees
The fee schedule is found within the Special Event Permit Application Package and Media Permit Application Package. It
is based on package pricing by event type and event features. Fees are relative to the quantity of event attendance and
quantity/type of event features. Space assignments are made in this order, unless otherwise directed by the General
Superintendent, as deemed to be in the best interest of the Park District: 1) Chicago Park District Programs; 2) City of
Chicago Events (i.e. Jazz Fest, Air & Water Show); 3) Multi-year Use Agreements; 4) Open to general public; first comefirst serve.

• 

Facility Rentals
Fees are posted as hourly rates. Some locations may charge more during peak time of “weekend” (Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday). Youth rates are generally 50% of adult rates. Rental fees may vary from community to community with local
socio-economic factors taken into consideration. Space assignments are made in the same manner as permits.

• 

Management Agreements
These agreements are negotiated and awarded for the complete operation of a special facility(s). This type of agreement
is instituted when departmental operation(s) of the facility is either cost-prohibitive or is not cost-effective; or when
the operation(s) require a level of expertise beyond the capabilities of Park District staff. The Park District receives a
percentage of the gross receipts and/or a minimum monthly rental rate. The length of terms and conditions of these
agreements may vary. All management agreements are subject to approval by the Board of Commissioners.

• 

Corporate Sponsorship and Advertising
The Chicago Park District (CPD) staff continually seeks corporate sponsorships for events, programs and facilities to
help increase non-tax revenue and enhance program offerings. These programs include the donation of funds, giftin-kind equipment/supplies or gift-in-kind services by the corporate partner in exchange for specific benefits. The
goal of the sponsorship program is to create long-lasting partnerships over multiple years. Corporate partners should
be selected based on sponsorship objectives that align with the mission, values and goals of the CPD. Corporate
sponsorship arrangements should adhere to the CPD established “Guidelines Relating to Sponsorship and Advertising
Agreements”. The Chicago Park District continues to identify assets suitable for sustainable advertising programs within
our properties that are valuable for revenue generation, respectful of our community spaces and adhere to the CPD
“Guidelines Relating to Sponsorship and Advertising Agreements”. Messaging and infrastructure must meet ordinance
regulations appropriate to the site and structure.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2020 BUDGET SUMMARY

FINANCIAL POLICIES

Revenue Policy

 FINANCIAL POLICIES

Debt Policy
The District manages its debt portfolio in accordance with State and Federal rules and regulations. Under applicable state
statutes, the District is governed in how it issues debt as well as limitations on the issuance of certain types of debt. Currently,
the District’s statutory general obligation bonded debt limitation is 2.3% of the latest known Equalized Assessed Valuation
(EAV). Currently, the District is $1,464 million or 74% below the $1,986 million state imposed limit.
The District is also subjected to a separate statutory debt limit of 1% of EAV for certain general obligation bonds issued
without a referendum. The District has approximately $342 million in capacity under this limit. At the end of 2019, the
District’s outstanding long-term debt will be approximately $799 million, which is $34 million lower than the previous year
and will be reduced to approximately $771 million after the debt service payments due in 2019.

Investment Policy
The District invests public funds in a manner that is consistent with all state and local statutes governing the investment of
public funds. Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that ensures the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio.
The District shall diversify its investments to avoid incurring unreasonable risks associated with specific securities and/
or financial institutions. The investment portfolio must be sufficiently liquid to enable the District to meet all reasonable
anticipated operating requirements and must be designed to obtain a market average rate of return during budgetary and
economic cycles, taking into account the District’s investment risk constraints and cash flow needs.

Fund Balance Policy
Fund balance is the difference between assets and liabilities reported in a fund at the end of the fiscal year. The District
seeks to maintain adequate levels of fund balance to mitigate current and future risks and to ensure stability. Fund balance
is also a crucial consideration in long-term financial planning. Credit rating agencies carefully monitor levels of fund balance
and unassigned fund balances in the District’s General Fund to evaluate creditworthiness. Historically, the District has been
able to maintain a healthy reserve through growth management, strategic financial planning and constant cost analysis. It is
the policy of the District to maintain certain levels of fund balance in the Long-Term Income Reserve Fund to provide both
specificity and flexibility while accomplishing two main criteria:
1.  Target Level of Reserve
The reserve floor is set at $85,000,000.
2.  Specific Circumstances for Drawing Down Reserve
Due to the biannual nature of our property tax collections, the District usually receives approximately half the tax levy
in the spring and the other half in the fall. This often creates a cash deficit as our peak spending is during the summer
months. Historically, the District would issue Tax Anticipation Warrants to bridge the gap. Internal borrowings from the
Reserve to the General Fund during the year are allowed for cash flow needs. The Reserve is to be repaid as the next
installment of property tax revenue is received.
Any other draw from the Reserve must be approved by the Board and should only be for nonrecurring expenditures or
one-time capital costs and not ongoing operational type expenditures.

Capital Asset Inventory Policy
Purchased or constructed capital assets are recorded at cost or estimated historical cost. Donated capital assets are recorded
as their fair value at the date of donation. The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the
asset or materially extend the assets’ lives are not capitalized.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2020 BUDGET SUMMARY

26

 The budget process is a culmination of input from District staff, management, the Board of Commissioners and community
members. All stakeholders have a role in shaping the District’s strategic direction. Each year, the District prepares the budget
document as a guide to communicate the District’s financial plan, policies, goals and objectives for the ensuing year. The
District has identified four core values to help guide our efforts for the future. The focus of these values is Children First, Best
Deal in Town, Built to Last and Extra Effort (discussed in detail under the section Mission & Core Values). District managers
develop specific program plans for their activities, as well as the framework of staff and support costs needed to carry out
these goals. This framework is the foundation for the District’s budget.
State code requires that the budget recommendations be submitted to the Board of Commissioners before November 1.
After providing at least seven days’ notice, the Board will hold a public hearing. The Board is to consider the budget and
make any amendments deemed necessary. The District Board of Commissioners must pass a balanced budget no later than
December 31.
Once the budget is passed, the Office of Budget and Management works with each Region and Department to manage the
adopted appropriations. Any transfers necessary to adjust the budget may be made by the Office of Budget and Management,
as long as the changes do not require transfers between account classes (common groupings of expenditures), and do not
exceed the approved appropriation. In either of those circumstances, requests for budget amendments must be brought
before the Board for approval.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2020 BUDGET SUMMARY

BUDGET PROCESS

Budget Process

 In 2011, the Government Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard, GASB 54. GASB 54 required the Park
District to combine the Long Term Income Reserve and several other funds into the General Fund for reporting purposes
in the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report beginning in fiscal year 2011. GASB 54 also required a breakdown of fund
balance into five classifications; Non-spendable, Restricted, Committed, Assigned and Unassigned. At December 31,
2018, the District's governmental funds reported combined fund balances of $285.9 million, a decrease of $9.1 million
in comparison with the prior year. The unrestricted fund balance (the total of the committed, assigned, and unassigned
components of fund balance) for the general fund was $209.8 million, or approximately 67.1% of total general fund
expenditures. Of this amount, $96.0 million relates to working cash reserves.
The 2020 budget accounts for the use of $1.5 million of prior year fund balance, which is equal to the amount in the
2019 budget.

The Long-Term Income Reserve Fund
The long-term reserve fund is a special revenue fund created in 2006 with total proceeds from the sale of the District’s
parking garages. Interest earned on these proceeds is budgeted to replace the net operating income the District had
been receiving from the garages. It is the District’s policy to maintain the fund level at no less than $85 million. At the
end of 2018, the fund balance was $96 million.

BUDGET OVERVIEW

Economic Outlook
As fiscal year 2019 comes to a close, the national economy is growing at a moderate pace. Recent data indicates
growth in the economy with real GDP increasing at an annual rate of 1.9% in the third quarter of 2019 (advance
estimate) and 2.0% percent in the second quarter. The overall economy grew at an average rate of 2.3% in 2019,
down from an average of 3.3% in 2018. The US Department of Labor reported that the seasonally-adjusted
national unemployment rate declined from 3.7% in October 2018 to 3.6% in October 2019. The overall labor
force participation rate rose in October to 63.3%, a 0.4% increase from the previous year. Over the past ten years,
the economy has grown at a solid but moderating pace, with recent, gradual deceleration.
The state and local economies have historically followed the economic gain patterns of the national economy.
In September 2019, the preliminary unemployment rate for Illinois was 3.9%, down from 4.1% a year prior, and
the unemployment rate for Chicago was 3.2%, down from 3.5% a year earlier. According to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS), from September 2018 to September 2019 nonfarm payroll employment increased by 60,800
jobs throughout Illinois. Most of the jobs were concentrated in the Chicago area, with the Chicago-NapervilleArlington Heights area accounting for 27,600 jobs in that period. The largest job losses were in Peoria, IL, with a
reduction of 1,500 jobs.
The Illinois General Assembly recently passed a $40 billion budget for Fiscal Year 2020. This new budget starts
to address the backlog of approximately $6.0 billion in unpaid bills though there is still a concern as to whether
spending and revenue estimates for the future are realistic. Financial uncertainties such as these at the state
level, leave local governments in a difficult situation as they prepare to effectively plan for the future.
With a labor force of about 4.8 million, the economy of the Chicago Metropolitan area continues to be strong
and is among the largest and most diversified in the world. Chicago is the home of many major businesses and
Fortune 500 companies. The annual gross regional product (GRP) in 2018 of the metro area was $679.70 billion,
which is a 3% increase from $657.59 billion in 2017. Tourism continues to be a driving force in the local economy,
setting records in 2018. In 2018, overall visitors rose 4.3% compared to 2017 with overnight visitors up 6%. These
statistics are a testament to Chicago's status as Conde Nast Traveler’s Best Big City in the U.S., an honor we
recently received for the third year in a row.
One of the prominent drivers in the Chicago economy is the Chicago Park District, employing over 7,200 employees
and paying over $190 million in wages and compensation. About half of these jobs are summer employment
opportunities that set the stage for personal and professional development, allowing young adults to reinvest in
their communities and positively impact the local economy. For the upcoming year, the District will continue to
reach more residents by opening new facilities such as the $56 million, 139,000 square foot Gately Indoor Track
and Field in the Pullman neighborhood as well as Addams-Medill Park in the Near West Side Community. Both
facilities will assist in increasing development in their respective communities while helping to advance more
equitable opportunities for residents across the city. As we go into our 86th year, we will continue to invest in our
world-class park system, while expanding to meet the diverse needs of our patrons.

Also in 2020, total pension expenses, including the required employer contribution and the voluntary supplemental
contribution, will increase by $6.2 million over the 2019 budget. This increase is based on actuarial projections
as the District begins a four year pension payment ramp up to help stabilize the pension fund. In 2020 the
TIF disbursement declaration from the city is anticipated to grow by $5.25 million and the District will put this
additional revenue towards the pension fund. The District’s position continues to be that pension changes are
critical to ensuring retirement security for our current employees and retirees by taking the necessary steps to
raise the funded ratio of the pension fund.

 Tax Revenues
The Park District’s largest source of revenue is the property tax which makes up 58% of total resources. While the
District has been fortunate with stable property tax collections, this budget reflects a conservative estimate in the
expected loss in collections of 3.67% of the property tax which is consistent with prior years’ actual losses. The
2020 gross property tax levy of $294.2 million reflects $2.7 million in the capture of the value of new property
and expiring/terminating TIF districts which provide additional resources to the District without increasing the
tax burden on residents. Net property tax after an expected loss in collections is $283.4 million.
The property tax is determined by dividing the levy by the equalized assessed value (EAV) of the taxable net
property in the City of Chicago. There are a variety of restrictions on the tax levy. By Illinois statute, the portion
of the levy going to the corporate fund is limited to 66 cents per $100 of EAV. The portion going to the aquarium
and museum fund is limited to a maximum of 15 cents per $100 of EAV; and 4 cents per $100 of EAV going to the
special recreation fund.
In March of 1995, property tax cap limitations were passed by the state legislature, which reflects the District’s
tax levy. The portion of the levy which supports the operations of parks and recreation facilities (the aggregate
extension) can only increase from year to year by the rate of inflation. In prior years the portion of the levy
supporting debt service is limited to the level of the 1994 debt service levy. Thus, the District can only issue
general obligation bonds where the debt service falls within that restriction. In 2009 state legislation was changed
to allow debt service to increase by the lesser of CPI (Consumer Price Index) or 5%. The 2019 budget will fall
within these restrictions.
The District represents one of seven taxing jurisdictions on City residents’ bills. According to the most recent
report released by the Cook County Clerk’s Office, 4.93% is allocated to the Chicago Park District. On a typical
resident’s bill, this amounts to approximately $200 to support parks.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2020 BUDGET SUMMARY

36

 PPRT is a tax on the net income of corporations that is collected at the state level and distributed to municipalities
and districts statewide according to a defined formula. The Chicago Park District allocates its portion of PPRT
toward the debt service fund, the aquarium and museum fund, the pension fund and the corporate fund, in that
order of funding priority.
According to the Illinois Department of Revenue’s (IDOR) Fiscal Year 2020 (July 2019-June 2020) Estimate for
Replacement Taxes, allocations to the 6,500 local taxing districts which are entitled to receive an allocation of PPRT
are estimated at $1,537 million, an increase of 15.4% from fiscal year 2019 (July 2018-June 2019) replacement tax
allocations. Because of the different fiscal years, the Park District has already recognized a portion of this increase
in the current fiscal year 2019. The State’s annual reconciliation of tax payments and returns will result in a fiscal
year 2020 transfer of approximately $32 million from corporate income tax to replacement tax. There was a
transfer from the Income Tax Refund Fund to the Personal Property Replacement Tax Fund in September 2019 of
approximately $95.8 million resulting from estimated deposits into the Income Tax Refund Fund exceeding the
amount of money paid out for Replacement Tax refunds. This helped to push the Park District’s fiscal year 2019
actual distributions higher than originally projected. IDOR points to federal tax code changes and decoupling
legislation which have the effect of increasing Illinois net income as a driver of future growth in distributions.
The Park District’s fiscal year 2020 forecast for PPRT reflects a conservative growth outlook that takes into account
IDOR’s report together with the volatility of this revenue source, the threat of economic decline on the horizon
and the District’s limited revenue streams to offset a potential falloff. In 2020, PPRT revenue is projected to
generate $41 million for the District which represents 4% growth from the 2019 budget. In addition, the District
will maintain the $5 million PPRT stabilization reserve created in 2012 to minimize the impact of economic
downturns on the budget.

Grants, Donations and Sponsorships
Partnerships are vital to the District’s operations. The Park District has continued to count on generous
private donations, corporate sponsorships, and grants from Federal, State of Illinois, City of Chicago, and local
organizations. These one-time revenue sources help alleviate the District’s expense burden for capital projects
and operating programs. In receiving outside funding, the District is able to distribute resources to the Chicago
community in greater amounts.
Outside operating grants, donations, and sponsorships fund innovative programs including Night Out in the
Parks, Special Olympics, and summer camp scholarships. Capital grants and donations fund projects including
new parks and fieldhouses, historic facility renovations, and new natural areas and playgrounds. In the past five
years, the District has been successful in obtaining an average of nearly $40 million per year in outside funding
toward District priorities, not including in-kind grants and donations. As of fall 2019, over $41.7 million in outside
funding has been awarded this year with additional grant awards expected by year-end.

Major federal government contributions in 2019 included the U.S. Department of Agriculture's funding to
support the Summer Food and After School Program ($2.6 million) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's grant
to restore the Calumet Coastal Wetlands at Indian Ridge. In 2018, the Illinois Open Space Lands Acquisition and
Development (OSLAD) program reopened and accepted new grant applications and in 2019, the District was
awarded a total of $1,162,600 to develop four pocket parks throughout the city. Also in 2019, the City of Chicago
provided over $13.7 million for various park improvements around the City including various park improvements
at Kosciuszko Park and upgrading the artificial turf football field to include a new running track and lighting at
Ogden Park. Furthermore, city aldermen collectively provided $872,000 in MENU funds for park capital projects,
which included new playgrounds, courts, and ballfield improvements.
In addition to governmental funds, generous private funding of more than $8 million was vital to sustaining the
District programs and capital priorities. In 2019, through the Pritzker Traubert Foundation and Take the Field
Foundation, the District was awarded grants to rehabilitate two artificial turf fields at Dunbar and McKinley Park.

The 2020 operating program and the 2020-2024 Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) continue to rely heavily on
outside sources to fund District priorities. Current outside funding committed for the next five years totals $164.5
million, with additional funding awards expected. Major sources of outside funds for projects in the 2020-2024
CIP include federal funding for habitat restoration work at Big Marsh, Rainbow Beach, and Steelworkers Park as
well as a bicycle and pedestrian trail for Marian Byrnes Park in the South Deering community area. The release
of the State IDNR grants will also allow many important projects to move forward in the 2020-2024 CIP including
major building restorations to community fieldhouses and centers, many of which are historic treasures. City of
Chicago funding has been obligated to rehab the fieldhouse and provide other park improvements at Kosciuszko
Park, develop a new park in the near north community, and redevelop two parks in the 11th Ward to include
new playgrounds and turf fields. Finally, private outside funding has been secured to construct new recreational

Soldier Field

The District contracts with a vendor to manage and operate Soldier Field. This contractor collects revenue from
events at Soldier Field, as well as income from non-event parking at the Soldier Field parking lots. In addition to
event revenue generated by the contractor, the gross revenue amount reflects the rent collected at the stadium
from the Chicago Bears and the annual operating subsidy from the ISFA. Revenue collected from Soldier Field
has steadily increased over the years making it the largest non-tax revenue source for the District. Soldier Field
hosted numerous exciting events in 2019, including major musical acts such as the Rolling Stones, international
soccer and Cirque du Soleil. In 2020, the stadium is excited to welcome back the Chicago Fire. The Major League
Soccer team will play home games at the stadium starting in March 2020. Along with other major events, the
return of the Fire is anticipated to grow net revenue at Soldier Field by 6% in 2020.

REVENUE

Other major revenue sources are the District’s managed assets, revenue generated by the management of
Chicago Park District revenue-generating assets by contractors including Soldier Field, harbors, concessions,
paid parking spaces, golf courses, Northerly Island concert venue, MLK Family Entertainment Center, McFetridge
Sports Center, Beverly Morgan Park Sports Complex, Maggie Daley Park and others. The contractors that operate
these assets continue to find ways to increase revenues which ultimately support local parks.

 The District is responsible for ten harbors along Chicago’s shoreline. The District contracts with a vendor that
specializes in operating harbors to maximize revenues and minimize operating costs. In 2019, major capital
improvements were undertaken including dock replacement at Burnham Harbor and new gates at both Jackson
Park harbors. These improvements will continue in 2020, with a major project to construct a breakwall at Jackson
Park harbor that will help protect the harbor from storm damage as well as sand accumulation. Chicago is the
premier boating destination in the Midwest, and these continued improvements will help sustain that status.
Gross revenue is forecasted to increase to $27 million in 2020 due to slightly increased occupancy and modest
fee increases at the District's downtown and north side harbors, while gross expenses are budgeted to increase
to $12.8 million.

Park concessions provide the public with great dining, shopping, and recreational experiences as they visit the

provided to park patrons throughout the city and 2020 will be no different. Over the years, revenue from
concessions has remained relatively steady. For 2020, the District is expecting revenue to come in similar to 2019
due to the unknowns of Chicago's summer weather and the rising lakefront water levels which have affected
some concessionaires. Total concession revenue is projected to generate $3.9 million in 2020, while the gross

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2020 BUDGET SUMMARY

42

 Prior to 2007, parking revenue was primarily income generated from the Downtown Parking Garage System that is
now part of a long-term lease agreement finalized in 2006. The District entered into a multi-year agreement with
a vendor to manage the remainder of the District’s parking system in 2009. The vendor manages the installation
and maintenance of pay & display units and collection of revenues generated by the District’s parking system.
Over the past few years, total parking revenue has been on a slight decline due to increased competition from
ride-sharing programs. As a result, the District has slightly decreased anticipated parking revenues in 2019 and
2020, while gross expenses will remain steady at $1.2 million. In 2020, parking rates will increase slightly at some
surface lots and the standard meter rate structure will be adjusted due to increasing parking taxes from the State.
However, the initial hour will remain steady at $2 per hour to park and parking on District land throughout the city
will remain reasonable compared to neighborhood paid parking options.

invested in capital improvements to all of the facilities that have put them in excellent playing condition. In 2019,
despite a late start to summer weather, the District had a very busy and successful golf season. For 2020, gross
revenue is anticipated to increase slightly to $5.7 million, and gross expenses are also anticipated to experience
a similar increase to $5.1 million. In 2020, greens fees at District courses will not increase and youth will still be
granted free golf at all courses.

Rentals and Permits

This category includes revenue from room/gym/facility rentals and permit fees for events held on District
property. The District will continue to focus on identifying ways to increase non-tax revenue streams, such as
permit revenue from large-scale events, in order to keep fees for our park programs affordable and minimize
reliance on the property tax to grow programs. The District continues to implement efficiencies to the permit
process and work with permit applicants to identify suitable sites for events beyond those most in-demand.
Revenue from rentals and permits is anticipated to climb to $19.0 million in 2020, which is a 2.6% increase
over the 2019 budget. This increase is anticipated due to a new permit fee structure that will better reflect our
numerous multifaceted space offerings.

 Other Resources

At 33% of this category, internal service earnings represent incoming reimbursements between funds. To avoid
double counting, the Financial Summary table deducts internal service earnings between funds from total
resources to more accurately reflect the total net appropriation. In FY20, the internal service earnings amount
is calculated at $4.9 million. The District utilized an outside consulting firm to determine a simplified indirect
cost rate for the District that uses modified total direct costs as the direct cost base. Based on the consultants'
findings, it was determined that $4.9 million is the recommended amount to reimburse the corporate fund from
the special recreation fund for indirect expenses. At 27% of this category, the contribution of capital assets
represents the total amount that qualifies as capital expenditures and is funded by bond proceeds. In FY20, this
amount is calculated at $4.0 million. Lastly, the use of prior year fund balance is the portion of the balance from
prior fiscal years that will be relied upon in FY20. The FY20 budget accounts for the use of $1.5 million of prior
year fund balance, which is at the same level as the 2019 budget.

Personnel Summary

Health, Dental, and Life Insurance
At $23.2 million, health, dental and life insurance benefit expenses make up 5% of the District’s budget. Each
year the District must absorb more of the escalating expense related to health benefits. In 2020, employee
contributions to the health care expense will increase by 0.5% of salary, which will help reduce the increased
healthcare expense the District faces due to overall growth trends in health expenses. This is the first of a threeyear increase in employee contributions negotiated with our labor partners to more equitably share in the costs
of growing health care expenses. The current share of Park District employer and employee contribution toward
health care expenses is approximately 90% employer and 10% employee contribution. This change seeks to
achieve a share of 85% employer and 15% employee contribution which the District believes is fair given the
national experience of 80% employer and 20% employee.
Since 2014, the District has made it a priority to seek out and implement ways to mitigate this trend and based on
the slowing rate of expense growth, these management efficiencies are paying off. In 2019, the District changed
prescription drug providers and that has helped control the prescription drug expense and as a result, anticipated
prescription drug expenses are expected to be flat in 2020.

Pension

Total pension expenses, including the required employer contribution and the voluntary supplemental contribution,
account for 7% or $33.8 million of the 2020 budget. This represents a $6.2 million increase over the 2019 budget
as the District begins a multi-year pension payment ramp up to help stabilize the pension fund.
The Park District prioritizes the health of its pension fund and has taken several steps to stabilize it. Starting with
its successful effort to pass pension reform changes in 2014 under Public Act 098-0622 which were subsequently
challenged and overturned in 2018, the District continued to identify and implement stabilizing measures under
its control. Despite the severability clause of the pension reform legislation, the District advocated for and
achieved an Agreed Order that permitted the pension fund to retain the increased and supplemental employer
contributions made from 2015-2017. In addition, despite the reversion of the pension contribution multiplier and
associated required employer contribution to pre-reform levels, the District maintained the total 2018 appropriated
amount to the pension fund by amending the 2018 Budget Appropriation to decrease the property tax levy
portion toward pension in compliance with the Court order while adding a supplemental contribution toward the
pension fund funded by PPRT. The District followed this approach again in 2019 contributing not only its legally
required contribution but nearly doubling the amount to the pension fund through its voluntary supplemental
contribution. In 2020, the District will increase its commitment to pension stabilization by allocating the legally
required employer pension contribution of $13.2 million as well as a voluntary supplemental contribution of
$20.7 million, more than 1.5 times the amount legally required. The total $33.8 million amount allocated to the
pension fund is a significant increase but substantially below the actual determined contribution. The District
continues to work diligently with its labor partners on a long-term solution to the pension and has demonstrated
at every step of the way its commitment to ensuring retirement security for current employees and retirees.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2020 BUDGET SUMMARY

 Debt Service

At 14%, debt services make up the second largest expense for the District. Debt service relates to the payments
made for principal and interest on general obligation long-term debt. Debt service expenses, after savings from
refundings, are budgeted to slightly increase by less than 1%, or $0.6 million in 2020.

Utilities

As part of a comprehensive approach to achieving utility conservation and efficiencies, the District developed an
energy risk management plan for natural gas and electricity that accounts for factors such as load profile, supply
and demand factors, market analytics, current hedges, and other factors to further achieve cost savings. To date,
the plan has proven successful in achieving results with $1.6 million per year in natural gas supply savings and
$1.4 million per year in electric commodity price component savings. The 2020 budget assumes relatively stable
expenses, with natural gas expenses declining by $0.2 million and electricity expenses increasing by $0.2 million.
The District has incurred substantial increases in water/sewer fee charges due to a multi-year water/sewer rate
increase imposed by the City of Chicago starting in 2012 that caused water/sewer charges paid by the District to
more than double. In 2017, the City of Chicago began charging water and sewer taxes in addition to water/sewer
fees. These fees and tax rates have increased annually under the existing City ordinance for the last 4 years, and
include another increase in 2020. To combat these increases, the District has embarked on a comprehensive
districtwide water conservation effort that includes a leak and infrastructure review and assessment of water
features that are both environmentally and economically inefficient. The District has been successful in slowing
the growth trend in this expense and will continue these efforts in 2020 to contain expense growth to $0.8 million
despite the tax rate increase.
Total utility-related expenses in 2020 are expected to be $32.3 million which is $0.8 million higher than in 2019.

Managed Assets

The District’s managed assets, including Soldier Field, harbors, concessions, paid parking spaces, golf courses,
Northerly Island concert venue, MLK Family Entertainment Center, McFetridge Sports Center, Beverly Morgan
Park Sports Complex, Maggie Daley Park and others, represent 12% of total expenses in 2020 which is $6.0 million
higher than 2019. A majority of this is due to anticipated increased expenses at Soldier Field due to a full season
of the Chicago Fire. This expense growth is more than offset with an anticipated growth on the revenue side at
Soldier Field. A full discussion of managed assets may be found in the revenue section of this summary.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2020 BUDGET SUMMARY

 Through a unique partnership, the Chicago Park District provides operating subsidies to Museums In the Park
(MIP). MIP is a partnership among Chicago's leading museums located on Chicago Park District property. The
MIP represent the best of the visual arts, sciences, and humanities. Together, they engage, educate, and broaden
the life experiences of millions of Chicagoans each year through diverse on-site programming, innovative
neighborhood partnerships, and interactive web-based learning. The MIP is comprised of the following
institutions: John G. Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, The Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago History Museum,
DuSable Museum of African American History, The Field Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art, Museum of
Science and Industry, National Museum of Mexican Art, Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum and Institute of Puerto
Rican Arts and Culture. The operating subsidy to MIP is allocated out of the Park District’s property tax levy and
7.534% of PPRT as mandated by state law. In 2020, $29.6 million will be budgeted for this purpose.

The District also provides funding for the Lincoln Park Zoo, which is owned by the District but managed by a
non-profit organization. In 2020, $5.6 million is earmarked to support the Lincoln Park Zoo. Collectively, the
remittance to the aquarium, museums and zoo make up 8% of the total expenses in the 2018 operating budget.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2020 BUDGET SUMMARY

56

 The District’s financial team maintains a 3-year forecast for fiscal planning. This living document reflects the results
of regular monitoring of the economy and operations on the District’s long-term finances. The District has been
credited for its prudent and conservative approach to financial management and is committed to maintaining this
position.
The District is aware that certain expenditures such as health benefits and pension contributions, have and will
continue to increase at a rapid rate and those expenses have a long-term impact on the District's annual budget.
As a result, the District employs a number of initiatives to decrease expenses and increase revenue to close the
annual budget deficit. These initiatives are detailed throughout this summary and reflect the difficult work of
meeting the demands of park patrons while living within our means. In 2020, the budget deficit was approximately
$13 million before considering the increased contribution to the pension fund. That increased contribution is an
additional $6.2 million for 2020, in order to meet actuarial projections to help stabilize the pension fund. In 2020,
the District is anticipating to receive a $5.25 million increase in the TIF disbursement declaration and the District
will put this additional revenue towards pensions.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2020 BUDGET SUMMARY

LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PLAN

Long-Term Financial Planning

 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN

Capital Improvement Plan
The Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) is the District’s comprehensive multi-year plan for land acquisition and
park development, new building construction, building and facility management, park site improvements, and
technology and major equipment. The CIP outlines the projects that are expected to take place over the next five
years. Capital projects typically have costs of over $10,000, have a life expectancy of at least 5 years, and may
result in the creation of a capital asset.
The Capital Improvement Plan is a dynamic and evolving guide for spending over a five-year period. The CIP
outlines spending priorities and expected schedules and is formed to allow for adjustment over the five-year
period. The CIP allows for flexibility, for instance, if actual project expenses are above (or below) a projected
budget in the CIP, as new outside funding is granted for specific projects or programs, or as new district priorities
develop. The CIP is published annually to reflect the growth of the Plan each year.

Capital Improvement Plan Process
Throughout the year, the Park District compiles
requests for capital improvements from numerous
sources. External requests generally come from
annual budget hearings, letters, emails, website
inquiries, legislators, advisory councils, board
meetings, community groups, city agencies, new
laws, unfunded mandates, and other similar sources.
Internal requests are typically derived from park
inspections, facility assessments, the work order
system, framework plans, policy initiatives, strategic
objectives, and needs identified by recreation, culture,
service, planning, construction, and maintenance
departments.
The requests are bundled into programs and
sub-programs that reflect a shared project type.
Establishing programs and sub-programs help us to
compare similar projects. Projects that are primarily
paving work, for example, are organized first into a
program called "site improvements" then second into
a sub-program called "paving".

Capital projects range from building new or
renovating fieldhouses and swimming pools to
installing new pathways and park benches to
planting new trees and natural areas. Above:
Fountain Girl Statue in Lincoln Park.

Once the requests are organized, an internal working group investigates, analyzes, and weighs each request. This
group includes representatives from each of the departments responsible for implementing the capital plan:
Planning and Development, Capital Construction, Facility Maintenance, Natural Resources, Green Initiatives,
Information Technology, Budget, and the Office of the Chief Operating Officer. Investigations occur throughout
the year. From request compilation to prioritization, internal review spans approximately six months.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2020 BUDGET SUMMARY

58

 After investigation and research, the working
group weighs projects against others in the
same sub-program. This analysis takes into
consideration the following typologies:
projects that are urgent, high-priority that
should be undertaken if possible; highpriority projects that should be done if
funding becomes available; worthwhile
projects to be considered if funding becomes
available; and desirable, but not essential,
low-priority projects. To understand the
continuum of need, an "urgent, highpriority" request might be replacing a broken
water main; a "desirable, but not essential"
request might be a new floral garden. Part
of this process also includes examining the
distribution of past and proposed projects
and funds across the District relative to the
geographic, legislative, and demographic
characteristics of the City.
The total estimated cost of the Capital Plan
and its individual projects must fall within
the anticipated funds available. This places
limits on the number of projects that can
be addressed in a given year. The working
group's Capital Plan recommendation to the
General Superintendent must stay within
adopted financial constraints.

Capital projects completed in 2019 include: a playground at
Meyering Park, a climbing boulder at Palmisano Park and a new
min-pitch court at Ogden Park.

59

The five-year term of the District's Plan allows
the District to maintain long-term fiscal
health, lend stability to capital investment
planning, meet longer term goals and
objectives, establish meaningful timelines
for projects, and make clear to the public the
District's future investment intentions.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2020 BUDGET SUMMARY

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN

The working group’s first step is an
investigation.
Each capital request is
investigated to determine the scope,
estimated cost, and comparative need for
the project. This investigation is combined
with research into the source, context, prior
assessments, and institutional knowledge of
the park and its facilities.

 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN

Capital Improvement Funding Sources

General Obligation Bond
Historically, the District issues approximately $30-$40 million annually in G.O. Bonds for capital improvements.
In 2019, the Board of Commissioners approved $33 million in bond funding for capital projects in 2019. For
the years 2020-2024, it is estimated that $162 million in general obligation bonds will be issued to fund capital
improvement projects.
Harbor Bond
In 2020, the District will continue to spend the harbor improvement bond proceeds issued in 2018. These funds
will be used for dock and gate replacement as well as focused capital improvements to the Jackson Park Harbor.
Special Recreation Assessment Bond
The Special Recreation Assessment levy (SRA),
is part of the District’s annual property tax. This
SRA levy assessment generates approximately $12
million to support the special recreation operations
and programming as well as complementary capital
improvements. In 2020, the District expects to
issue $10 million in SRA bonds to further support
capital, site and facility access improvements.
Parking Garage Lease Revenue
In 2006, the Board of Commissioners approved the
transfer of three downtown parking garages to the
City of Chicago. The City of Chicago then entered
into a 99-year lease of the garages, resulting in
$347.8 million in proceeds for the District.
Of
these proceeds, $122 million were reserved for
capital improvements to neighborhood parks.
The residual balance is primarily used for project
development where tax-exempt financing is not
an eligible source, such as the District’s concession
areas.

Outside funding is vital to the park capital plan. These funds
alleviate pressure on park district bond funding and provide
desired projects around the City. Above: three capital projects
completed in 2019 with outside partners at Columbus Park’s
Refectory Entrance with support from Illinois Department of
Natural Resources, Warren Park with Coca-Cola, and Dawes
Park with Chicago Cubs Charities.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2020 BUDGET SUMMARY

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN

Outside Funding
Federal, State of Illinois, City of Chicago, and private grants and donations are essential to the success of many
capital projects. Nearly half of the capital plan is funded with outside partners. Outside funding has been especially
important in the development of new parklands, construction of new fieldhouses, installation of new artificial turf
fields, and renovation of playgrounds.

 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN

2020-2024 Capital Improvement Plan
Planning for the 2020-2024 Capital Improvement Program (CIP) is underway. Expected sources for the 5-year
program include $162 million in new G.O. Bond proceeds, $10 million in SRA Bond proceeds, and an expected
$164.5 million in outside funding. The Capital Improvement Program is a living document, and additional outside
funding is expected to be identified and committed for projects within the years 2020-2024. The Chicago Park
District continues to actively seek additional outside grants, donations, and sponsorships for the 2020-2024 CIP.

Capital Project Highlights
As opportunities arise in our existing urban environment, the District strives to acquire and develop new quality
parkland around Chicago. These projects are major investments that require strong financial and community
partnerships. However, in many neighborhoods across Chicago, quality parks already exist. The District consists
of over 600 parks and close to 250 fieldhouses or community centers. Over the next few years, the District's
investment will be focused on the restoration of existing fieldhouses and cultural centers and the replacement of
park assets reaching their useful life. These projects will transform our facilities throughout the neighborhoods
and expand cultural as well as recreational uses.

Major Capital Improvements
By strategically investing limited capital resources and leveraging partnerships and alternative sources of funds,
the District has plans for several large scale capital improvements to existing facilities. The 2020-2024 plan
focuses on building upon our existing resources so that the District may continue to serve as community anchors
throughout Chicago.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2020 BUDGET SUMMARY

62

 Grant funds awarded from the State are also being put to use at Palmer and Hamilton Parks, and additional project
locations are expected to be awarded by the State in 2020. Together with District financing, improvements typically
include ADA access, building envelope including roof replacement and interior finishes. These improvements will
restore these historic park buildings and continue to support cultural and athletic programs in the surrounding
communities.

Outdoor Recreation and Natural Area Development
Open, outdoor spaces are vital for natural areas and
recreation spaces. Site improvements range from ballfield
renovations, playground replacements or renovations
to turf field construction where warranted. A recent
conversion to an artificial turf field was completed at
Ogden Park with the assistance of a grant from the
National Football League. In 2020, work to install artificial
turf fields will also be completed at Douglas Park, McKinley
Park and Chase Park. New turf fields allow continuous field
play in these highly programmed parks.
A large site improvement project is in the final planning
stages for Kosciusko Park. Improvements to this park will
include the creation of a baseball field complete with a
turf infield, new backstops and dugouts, soccer mini-pitch
court, playground with spray feature improvements and
a new dog-friendly area. While this is not a new park
within the Logan Square community, these enhancements
will greatly benefit and support new youth programs and
opportunities.

New natural areas such as the Nature Play area at
Kilbourn Park and the Palmisano Park nature area
shown in the image above, can provide habitat
improvement as well as new recreational and
educational opportunities.

In addition to athletic fields and ball diamonds, parks
offer natural areas that are unique open spaces focused
on restoring the connection between people and nature.
These mostly passive spaces are dedicated to the
cultivation and enrichment of ecological diversity and to
providing health and wellness opportunities. Natural area
habitats include prairies, wetlands, woodlands, dunes,
lagoons, and native gardens. Natural areas can be found
throughout Chicago’s parks, ranging in size from 0.25 acres
to 278 acres.
With the support of State funding, four 10-minute parks will be developed in 2020 that will include nature play
areas and open green space. With work continuing through the 2020-2024 CIP, the District will increase the
footprint of existing natural areas to allow for greater habitat diversity, better ecosystem services, and a better
opportunity to “get lost in nature.”

63

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2020 BUDGET SUMMARY

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN

Current projects nearing the construction phase are made possible with outside funding for improvements to
park facilities can be seen at Revere Park, which will be under construction in 2020. The scope includes a full
renovation and ADA access improvements to both facilities located there. In addition, a new roof and windows,
HVAC and an elevator will be installed. Seward Park will also be underway with capital improvements including
the roof replacement, masonry and window restorations, and installation of an elevator for access improvements.
Both of these projects, plus others that are in the design and construction phases, are possible with the use of
Tax Increment Financing (TIF).

 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN

New Recreational Opportunities
Recreational assets and programming for children and families in every neighborhood will remain a core program
for the District. Through expanded partnerships with our sister agencies, including the Chicago Public Schools
and Chicago Housing Authority, we aim to provide new recreational opportunities not yet available in the city
limits.
In the 2020-2024 Capital Improvement Plan, one such opportunity is a new recreational center at Addams Medill
Park. This development of a new 100,000 sq. ft. indoor recreation center will feature an indoor practice track,
artificial turf field, multi-purpose courts, club room, and other amenities.

Rendering of the new recreational center at Addams Medill (above) and indoor track at Gately Park (below).

Another major new recreational destination is the
Ford Calumet Environmental Nature Center in Big
Marsh Park. Currently underway, this facility will be a
hub for nature and eco-recreation programming for all
of Chicago. Located on the southeast side of Chicago,
exhibition space will focus on the cultural and industrial
history of the area as well as habitat, environmental,
and eco-recreation education.
Additionally, a new recreation center in Gately Park in
Chicago’s Pullman and Roseland Communities is under
construction. This new facility will assist in revitalizing
track and field in the Chicago area. The new 140,000
square foot track and field facility will be designed to host championship level meets and will have a 3,500 seating
capacity. The site will also host a new local campus for After School Matters.

 The District manages its debt portfolio in accordance with State and Federal rules and regulations. Under
applicable state statutes, the District is governed in how it issues debt as well as limitations on the issuance of
certain types of debt. Currently, the District’s statutory general obligation bonded debt limitation is 2.3% of the
latest known Equalized Assessed Valuation (EAV). Currently, the District is $1,464 million or 74% below the $1,986
million state imposed limit.
The District is also subjected to a separate statutory debt limit of 1% of EAV for certain general obligation bonds
issued without a referendum. The District has approximately $342 million in capacity under this limit. At the
end of 2019**, the District’s outstanding long-term debt will be approximately $799 million, which is $34 million
lower than the previous year and will be reduced to approximately $771 million after the debt service payments
due in 2020**.

Accomplishments
Core Value: Children First
• 

Expanded the Teen X-Stream camp by increasing the number of locations by five percent while adding more STEM
components to the program in order to expand the scope of offerings. In 2018, thirty park locations participated in
the summer Teen X-Stream camp. In 2019, McKinley, Kelvyn Park and Haas Parks added Teen X-Stream camp to their
programming, exceeding our goal of a five-percent year over year increase. Also offered is a new eight-week Teen
X-Stream camp at six park locations.

Core Value: Best Deal in Town

Rowing partner CTC worked with Dvorak, Sheridan, McGuane, Park No. 571, and Bosley in 2019.

Core Value: Built to Last
• 

Created new programming opportunities based in conjunction with recently enhanced park assets such as the mini-pitch
soccer fields underwritten by the US Soccer Federation, Chicago Fire and Ken Griffin as well as the newly resurfaced
tennis courts at Garfield Park funded by the USTA Laver Project. Incorporated new mini-pitch soccer fields into
programming by hosting a Teen Summer Soccer League at Davis Square Park and soccer programs at Archer Park, Davis
Square, Harrison and Vittum Parks. At Garfield Park the Laver-funded tennis courts provided new space for summer
tennis instruction for youth ages 6 to 12 years.

Core Value: Extra Effort
• 
•

through August 2019, fifty-two parks out of a total of sixty-two staffed locations had scheduled or held gym shows and/
or open houses.
Increased river-based recreational activities with a focus on rowing and paddling opportunities at Ping Tom Memorial
Park and the Eleanor Street Boat House (Park No. 571).

Night Out in the Parks enriched neighborhood parks and engaged audiences with nearly 2,000 cultural events citywide.
More than 140 partners with Night Out in the Parks were awarded funding to produce creative, multi-disciplinary, free
and open community events in every neighborhood across Chicago.
The District celebrated the Year of Chicago Theatre alongside the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special
Events and the League of Chicago Theatres by partnering with over 50 theater artists to feature performances in each
of the 77 community areas and all 50 wards. Highlights included Chicago Shakespeare in the Parks (Comedy of Errors),
Chicago Fringe Opera (The Rosina Project), FreeStreet Theatre (Still/Here), Steppenwolf Theater for Young Adults (We
Are Proud to Present), and Chicago Ideas (Platforms in the Parks).

The suite of Young Cultural Stewards programs (TRACE, Inferno, ArtSeed, and YCS Fellowship) collaborated on summer
programming with local photographer and community activist Tonika Johnson on the Belonging Initiative, building on
Johnson’s Folded Map Project, in which “home twins”— residents of identical North and South Side addresses (like
6720 North Ashland and 6720 South Ashland) — meet at each other’s homes to discuss quality of life issues and access
to resources. Belonging extended the conversation by encouraging youth across the North, West, and South sides of
the city to engage in dialogue and cultural mapping across Chicago. Youth worked in partnership with teaching artists
to interrogate their neighborhoods and critically reflect on boundaries and barriers as well as the places of welcoming
and sanctuary within our hyper-segregated city. Overall, YCS programs engaged 6,000 youth across 100 Chicago parks to
explore questions around belonging, acceptance, and interconnection.
Re:Center - The cultural stewardship and civic engagement training program closed out its final three cultural centers at
Humboldt, South Shore, and Berger Park.
Launched the Marian Hayes Artist Residency at Tuley Park with four inaugural artists in residence offering space,
materials, and exhibitions for a year, in exchange for community programming.

Accomplishments
Core Value: Best Deal in Town

 The Outdoor and Environmental Education department (OEE, previously organized within the Department of Natural
Resources) invites people of all ages to create connections with parks and natural areas by providing opportunities to foster
awareness, appreciation, knowledge and stewardship through programming, events, partnerships and outreach.  The
District's three Nature Center locations (North Park Village Nature Center, Northerly Island, and the forthcoming Ford Calumet
Environmental Center) provide year-round programming that can be enjoyed by the whole family. City-wide programs such
as Nature Oasis field trips, Nature Play Spaces, fishing, and gardening programs introduce our youngest participants to the
wonder of the natural world around us, while the DIstrict's paddling, camping, and climbing opportunities build a deeper
appreciation for outdoor and adventure recreation for Chicagoans of all ages.

Goals
Core Value: Best Deal in Town
• 

Ensure that learning and guided exploration of the natural environment remains accessible with free and low cost
opportunities for park patrons. The ChicaGO Explorers Program offers free outdoor gear as a resource to park staff,
teachers, scout leaders and other youth workers. With training focused primarily on camping experiences, users can
also borrow equipment to take groups of kids on a variety of outings like backpacking, snowshoeing, and hiking.

Core Value: Built to Last
• 

Open the Ford Calumet Environmental Center (FCEC) in Chicago's Calumet region in the spring, establishing a gateway
to nature-based education and eco-recreation for Chicago's southeast side and beyond. FCEC will highlight the unique
natural history and biodiversity of the area and offer one-of-a-kind opportunities for learning and exploration.

Core Value: Extra Effort
• 

Improve equitable access to nature-based education and eco-recreation through increased staff training, access to
resource libraries and programming that uncovers the nature in your neighborhood.
