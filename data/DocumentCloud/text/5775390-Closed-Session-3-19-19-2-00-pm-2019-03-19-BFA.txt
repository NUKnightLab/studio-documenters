RE: 124 Alfred Limited Dividend Housing Association Limited Liability Company 
Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT)

124 Alfred Developer LLC has formed 124 Alfred Limited Dividend Housing Association
Limited Liability Company in order to develop the Project known as 124 Alfred. The Project
will be a newly constructed ?ve-story building in the Historic District of Brush Park
comprised of ?fty-four (54) senior housing units located in an area bounded by Alfred on
the north, John on the east, Adelaide on the south and Woodward on the west.

The Project will include forty-seven (47) one-bedroom/one-bath and seven (7) two-
bedroom/two-bath apartments. Residents will have access to both below-grade and
surface parking.

The Project has been financed by a twenty-four (24)-month Construction Loan Agreement
with Aurora Financial LLC for up to $5,400,000 at ?ve percent interest with a
Permanent Loan extension Option for the amount of $295,000 at six and 15/100 percent
interest for an additional eighteen (18) years. Low Income Housing Tax Credits in
the annual amount of $918,804 have been reserved.

Rents for all units have been set at or below sixty percent of the area median
income, adjusted for family size. All fifty-four (54) units will be subject to the PILOT based
on Section 153 of the State Housing Development Authority Act of 1966, as amended.

In order to make this development economically feasible, it is necessary for it to receive
the bene?ts of tax exemption under Section 15a of the State Housing Development
Authority Act of 1966 (PA 346 as amended, MCL 125.1415A).

Adoption of the resolution by your Honorable Body will therefore satisfy the requirements
of Public Act 346 and City Ordinance 9-90, as amended, by establishing a service charge of
ten percent of the annual net shelter rent obtained from this housing project.
