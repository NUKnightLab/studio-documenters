The Executive Director reviewed with the Board the following matters.
•

The Fund received communication from the law firm Barrack, Rodos & Bacine concerning the

pro rata share of $143,000.

•

The Board retained MB Real Estate as the broker to represent the Fund for the office lease
renegotiation. Board counsel reviewed the exclusive agency agreement and informed the Board of its
substance, which was acknowledged, and the Board directed the Executive Director to sign the
agreement.

A discussion concerning the retroactive annuity adjustment for members who retired after July 1,
2012. In some situations the retroactive calculations result in a small amount due the annuitant. The
Executive Director requested that a policy be put in place that if there is a refundable amount of less
that $5 that a check will NOT be generated due to the cost and expense involved. The Board
acknowledged and approved.

•

The final actuarial valuation for 2014 and the final financial statements for 2014 were distributed to
the Board members for their review and files.

•

The Corporation Counsel forwarded communication to the Fund concerning a member, Frances
Zoller, Jr. A review of the Fund records indicates Mr. Zoeller is an inactive member, under the age of
fifty, and there are no applications filed for benefit as of date.

•

Discussion concerning the outstanding securities lending agreement with Deutsche Bank and the
indemnification on cash collateral. As a point of information to the Board members, the
indemnification provided by Deutsche Bank is limited to counterparty insolvency when cash
collateral is invested in repos. The indemnification does not apply to all losses. The Board did not
raise any further concerns on this matter.

•

Updates on the Chief Investment Officer search were discussed. The CIO search committee has nine
candidates who remain interested in the position and will work to narrow the number of candidates
and make a recommendation to the Board.
