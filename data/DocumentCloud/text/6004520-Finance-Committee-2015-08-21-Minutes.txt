III. Action Items
A. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, July 24, 2015
Director Butler, seconded by Director Estrada, moved to accept the minutes of the
Finance Committee Meeting of July 24, 2015. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
Mr. Elwell provided additional information regarding request number 11; this was a request to execute a
contract with Cerner Corporation. He stated that previously, CCHHS had contracts with both Cerner
Corporation and Siemens; Cerner acquired Siemens this year, so those two contracts were combined. In
addition, this contract includes the provision of the following: remote hosting; upgrade of the billing system;
opportunity to try Dragon software, which allows physicians to dictate directly into the medical record; new
system for calculation of nursing staffing; and the Cerner lab system. With regard to the question of why sole
source methodology applies in this situation, Mr. Elwell responded that there are really only two (2) systems
that could serve CCHHS – Epic and Cerner. CCHHS has been with Cerner for thirteen (13) years now. He
stated that the Epic system is significantly more expensive; additionally, if CCHHS switched providers, it
would experience significant disruptions to areas, including the billing system.

 III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
During the discussion of request number 4, Director Wiese inquired whether the Committee can receive
information on the number of temporary full-time equivalent employees for which the contract provides. Mr.
Elwell responded in the affirmative.
With regard to the request to increase the contract with the Suburban Primary Health Care Council by $3
million and extend for one (1) year (request number 6), Mr. Elwell indicated that this funding has been
included as part of the budget process in the past; County Commissioners have allocated $3 million per year to
go on a sole source basis to this group. This is something that will be discussed in the budget; it has been
funded at this amount for a number of years, pre-Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Access to Care Program
provides primary care to indigent patients; however, the question is whether this is the right amount of money
going forward, because there are far fewer people who do not have coverage today. This request covers
FY2015 - the period of 12/4/14 through 11/30/15. The administration is going to make a recommendation to
this Board as part of the budget for funding of a lower amount for FY2016; this Board will either approve or
not approve that recommendation. The Commissioners will have the opportunity to look at that and agree or
disagree; if they disagree and indicate that they want Access to Care to get the same amount, they will also
point out what they want cut from another area of the CCHHS budget to pay for it. He added that, as the
uninsured become covered under ACA, the need for this type of program should be less.
Director Butler, seconded by Director Estrada, moved the approval of request numbers
1 through 23, subject to completion of review by Contract Compliance, where
appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Any items listed under Section III
IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Introduction of CCHHS FY2016 Preliminary Budget (Attachment #2)
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Elwell provided an overview of the presentation on the
introduction of the proposed CCHHS FY2016 Preliminary Budget, which included information on the following
subjects: FY2015 Accomplishments; FY2016 Initiatives; FY2016 Key Budget Drivers; CCHHS Payer Mix;
FY2016 Budget Assumptions; CountyCare in FY2016; FY2016 Revenue Assumptions; Revenue Enhancement
Activities; FY2016 Revenue by Source; Cook County Health Fund Allocation; FY2016 Expense Assumptions;
Expense Control Strategies; Budgeted Revenues and Expenditures; Position Summary; and Summary of Proposed
FY2016 Preliminary Budget and Projected FY2017 and FY2018. The Committee reviewed and discussed the
information.
During the discussion of the information, Mr. Scheer remarked that the ambitions are to make improvements which
cost money, and the hope is to get the money by the kinds of things that will be accomplished; this is easy to do
over a period of time of a few years, and very difficult to do in the span of one year. He added that, based on his
experience with government, this institution will be in a difficult spot if savings that the administration thinks will
be used for one purpose are used for something else outside of the institution.

 IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Introduction of CCHHS FY2016 Preliminary Budget (continued)
Mr. Elwell provided additional information relating to one of the key budget drivers listed on slide 9, regarding
reducing the number of detainees with behavioral health issues. He stated that CCHHS is not paid for the
provision of health care services to detainees; if services can be provided to those individuals outside of a detainee
setting, there is a great likelihood that those services can be covered under Medicaid. The Cook County
Department of Corrections (DOC) is not the best place to deliver behavioral health services; however, historically,
most of the behavioral health services delivered by CCHHS are delivered at the DOC. This budget will try to start
changing some of that – there will still be a great investment at the DOC, but the administration plans to start
bringing up some additional services and additional partners who can help to reduce the population that is going to
jail primarily for behavioral health issues.
With regard to the information presented on the projections of Countycare membership, Mr. Scheer noted that, in
order for CCHHS to reduce the County’s allocation to it over time and carry out the strategic vision of improving
itself, the only avenue he can think of to grow revenue relates to membership – but membership stays stable over
that period of time. Mr. Elwell responded that the part that does not stay stable relates to the capture rate; CCHHS’
capture rate of those patients is a little above 20% - if that capture rate moves higher, that will grow revenues.

. PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY: H14-73-094

Contract number was approved by the Cook County Health and Hospitals System Board of
. Directors on 11/14/2014 in the amount of $185,000.00 for a twelve (12) month period from 11/01/2014
through10/31/2015. This contract supplies heart valve products for surgeries at Stroger.

 
 
   
      
 

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:

The Edwards porcine heart valve product line is relatively durable compared to other bloprosthetic heart valves and
does not require lifetime systemic anticoagulation (as is required with non-bioprosthesis mechanical heart valves).
The Edwards porcine heart valve is recommended by the surgeons based on patient acuity and complex anatomy.
because of its low profile that facilitates the surgical implantation. This product line also includes specialty accessory
items that allow the surgeon to repair a damaged heart valve and thereby preserve functionality and healthy portions 
of the affected heart valve. i

 
   
    
     
       
 

 

 

        
 

The total volume of cardiac cases has increased and the percentage of cardiac valve cases has increased

dramatically. Treatment of valvular disease now approaches 50%. Rheumatic heart disease is still the number one
cause of cardiac valvular disease worldwide; a large number of relatively young patients are treated here who have .
emigrated from countries where rheumatic heart disease is prevalent. Additionally, a large number of young patients 
with endocarditis are treated here. Both groups of valve patients bene?t from the implants provided by the Edwards .
contract. This evolving patient pattern (treating more young patients with valvular disease) is the primary reason for .
the increase in the dollar amount of this contract. 1

. TERMS OF REQUEST: H14-73-094

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
These stents are primarily used for angioplasties performed in the Cath Lab. The drug eluting stents are placed into
narrowed, diseased peripheral or coronary arteries and slowly release a drug to block cell proliferation. This prevents
?brosis that together with clots could othenivise block the stented artery. The stents signi?cantly reduce the risk of in-stent
stenosis especially in selected high-risk patients, reducing the need for hospital admission and revascularization and

reducing the need for repeated angioplasty and CABG surgery.

Re: Item for August 21, 2015 Finance Committee Meeting Agenda
Proposed Lease Agreement - regarding staff parking

Respectfully requesting approval of a proposed Parking Lease Agreement between the Illinois
Medical District Commission and the County of Cook, through its Cook County
Health and Hospitals System for the temporary use of IMDC property bounded by
13th Street on the north, Hastings Street on the south, a parking lot on the east and Leavitt
Street on the west in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose of additional parking for staff.

This relates to ongoing parking initiatives being undertaken in FY 2015, to eliminate
patient/visitor turn-away issues that the Stroger Hospital campus has experienced for many
years. The proposed lease time horizon should coincide with the planned timing of the
campus redevelopment plans that are underway.

 

The term of the proposed Parking Lease Agreement is a period of (2.4) months,
with the option to renew for two (2) additional two (2) year terms. The rent is
$4,500.00 for the initial term; the total ?scal impact for the twe
