County government; and
WHEREAS, President Stroger worked to keep the County’s expenditure levels and property taxes flat –

WHEREAS, President Stroger advanced significant reforms in County government, including the
transfer of oversight of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center to the auspices of the Chief Judge and

County’s operations and initiatives, through efforts that include creating ‘green’ roofs for County

emissions of dangerous diesel soot; and initiating a series of ‘medication take-back days’ that have kept
tons of potentially hazardous pharmaceutical products out of the region’s water and waste stream; and
WHEREAS, President Stroger has sought to advance economic development and expand the County’s
jobs base through initiatives that range from assisting Navistar in securing $90 million in recovery zone
facility bonds to support the company’s investment in jobs and manufacturing in Cook County to
sponsoring dozens of public events designed to help homeowners reset their mortgage rates and avoid
foreclosure; and
WHEREAS, President Stroger has worked to improve the quality of life for Cook County residents
through a variety of initiatives that include expanding recreational space for youth and adult soccer
leagues in the western suburbs, creating a homelessness call-in center designed to help people find and
remain in decent housing, and supporting humane and fair immigration reform; and

recognized nationally, including through a series of awards presented by the National Association of
Counties, the country’s leading representative body for counties across the United States; and

1. On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion
of funds in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that
date, and what was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On September 20, 2010, it became apparent that the receiving accounts required funds. The
accounts 530-530 and 530-549 were was not funded in the FY 2010 budget; therefore the
balances were was zero throughout FY 2010.
2. How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other
accounts that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Funds allocated in account 530-441 will not be totally expended because the computer system
is presently being serviced internally and no longer by the vendor who initially had the
proprietary interest in the system.
3. Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be
deferred, delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that
will result in the account that funds are transferred from.
None.
4. If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was
originally budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in
the fiscal year.
At the time the FY 2010 budget was developed, this computer equipment was in place and
budgeted for maintenance consistent with prior years. Thereafter, the agency learned that the
vendor could no longer support the system. Subsequent to the passage of the FY 2010
budget, the Board of Commissioners authorized the purchase of a new system for which a
new line item and funding was identified.

COOK COUNTY HEALTH & HOSPITALS SYSTEM
ADJUSTMENTS TO GRADE 24 POSITIONS
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 22, 2010 from
WARREN L. BATTS, Chairman, Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board
and
WILLIAM T. FOLEY, Chief Executive Officer, Cook County Health & Hospitals System
In light of the recognition of Resolution 10-R-03 approved and adopted December 1, 2009 by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners regarding the adjustment of any Grade 24 positions we are presenting
the following Grade 24 adjustments:
Oak Forest Hospital Deputy Director
Shirley Bomar-Cole
Promotion:
This equity adjustment was based on an assignment to Oak Forest Hospital in
2005. Ms. Cole was part of an interim team and promised a raise if made
permanent. The position was made permanent but she never received the
promised increase.
Oak Forest Hospital, Provident Hospital and ACHN Chief Financial Officer
John Cookinham
Error Adjustment:
An error was made in the compensation when Mr. Cookinham was re-hired.
This adjustment moved him to the level he was paid when he left the hospital
two years ago and also reflects expanded System responsibilities.
Oak Forest Hospital Associate Administrator
Thomas Dohm
Re-classification:
This reflects a promotion to Associate Administrator and was part of the
realignment at Oak Forest Hospital. The new organizational structure at Oak
Forest Hospital presents a savings.
System Chief Psychologist
Rocco Domanico

81

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 1, 2010
Promotion:

This reflects a promotion to Vice Chair of the Department of Psychiatry,
assisting the Chair in the general oversight, direction, and management for
the Department.

Oak Forest Hospital Chief Operating Officer
Sylvia Edwards
Promotion:
An equity adjustment was given based on a comparison between the position
of Chief Operating Officers at both Provident and Oak Forest Hospitals. It
was determined that the Chief Operating Officer at Oak Forest Hospital was
performing the same job as the Chief Operating Officer of Provident Hospital
but at lower pay rate.
System Director of Talent Management
Gina Goodson-Allen
Promotion:
This individual applied for the position of System Director of Talent
Management. She was promoted from Nurse Recruiter to this new position
with responsibility for all recruiting including Taleo.
Ruth M. Rothstein Core Center Pharmacist Manager
Richard Grant
Data base correction: This does not reflect a change in salary. There was a problem with the set-up
of their payroll which has been corrected.
The adjustments to the Grade 24 positions will be funded from the 110 Account. Pursuant to Resolution
09-R-526 the System Board has authority to transfer funds in and out of the 100 Services Accounts
(Personal Services), therefore the above adjustments are within the Cook County Health & Hospitals
System FY 2010 appropriation.
The Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board of Directors reviewed the above Grade 24
adjustments at their meeting of November 19, 2010.
_________________________
