Commissioner Lechowicz asked Tom Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, to supply the commissioners with
the average cost of parking for eight hours in New York City and San Francisco, in comparison to parking
in Cook County.
Commissioner Hansen asked a question on the unresolved issue of the collection of taxes by
municipalities. He called attention to page 4 of the ordinance, under the exemption provision of hospital
employees and medical employees, and asked if the hospital does not have a parking lot and a hospital
employee pays to park elsewhere, such as in a commuter lot if there would be an exemption.
Commissioner Hansen referenced Section 4 of the Ordinance and asked if a permit will be issued by the
Cook County Department of Revenue?
Barbara Bruno, Director of the Department of Revenue, responded that a registration will be issued to
every owner of a parking lot who then registers as a collector of the taxes and is entitled to a one per cent
commission for the collection of the taxes.
Commissioner Hansen asked ifthe Department of Revenue gives notice when the monies are due?
Ms. Bruno responded that notices are mailed.
In response to a question by Commissioner Hansen, Ms. Bruno commented that there are rules and
banking measures on how the books will be maintained on the smaller "mom and pop" parking lots. Ms.
Bruno indicated that 250 operators will have to remit the parking tax to the county. She indicated that
tags or some other bookkeeping measures would be acceptable. She further stated the Cook County
Department of Revenue will provide operators with rules and regulations with respect to how to maintain
their books.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the cost of collection both the County and parking lot owner?

3504

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 21, 2000
Ms. Bruno responded that the cost is approximately $125,000 and will be absorbed by the Department.
Commissioner Hansen asked if additional employees are needed? Ms. Bruno answered two additional
personnel are need: a clerical person and an auditor.
Grace Colbert, Director of Budget and Management Services, stated a reallocation of two staff from
offices under the President will be assigned to the Revenue Department.
President Stroger clarified that there is no net increase with the reassignment of new staff.
Commissioner Hansen inquired if a municipality refuses to collect the tax, how would the County
respond?
Ms. Bruno responded if a munic ipality refused to collect the tax, the department would turn the matter
over to the State's Attorney's Office for legal action. She indicated the tax revenue from suburban areas is
projected to be approximately $600,000.
Commissioner Collins indicated her concern about the collection process based on earlier public
testimony and expressed that there should be less of burden on municipalities in the collection of the tax.

Commissioner Lechowicz, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved that the Substitute Ordinance
(Communication Number 239533), the Cook County Parking Lot and Garage Operations Tax

The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Resolution:
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
TO ESTABLISH THE LEAD POISONING PREVENTION FUND
Whereas, PA 90-778 authorizes the County Board to determine that funds in excess of
the amount needed to satisfy claims against the Torrens Indemnity Fund exist in the Torrens
Indemnity Fund, and further authorizes the County Board to establish a Lead Poisoning
Prevention Fund with such excess funds; and
Whereas, PA 90-778 provides that should the County Board determine that excess fu nds
exist in the Torrens Indemnity Fund, the Board may establish a Lead Poisoning Prevention
Fund and transfer not less than 50% of the excess monies to such fund ; and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COOK COUNTY
COMM ISSIONERS THAT:
I.

Based upon the findings set forth in the PricewaterhouseCoopers actuarial report, it is
hereby determined that $6,556, 173 should be retained by the Torrens Indem ni ty Fund to
satisfy claims which may be brought over the remaining life of the Fund which expires
July I, 2037, and that the balance of the Torrens Indemnity Fund as of November 30,
1998, of $28,455,330 be deemed in excess of the needs of the Torrens Indemnity Fund.

TO ESTABLISH THE LEAD POISONING PREVENTION FUND

Whereas, PA 90-778 authori zes the County Board to determine that funds in excess of the amount
needed to satisfy claims against the Torrens Indemnity Fund exist in the Torrens Indemnity Fund, and
further authorizes the County Board to establish a Lead Poisoning Prevention Fund with such excess
fund s; and
Whereas, to determine whether excess funds exist, PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted an
actuarial study of the Torrens Indemnity Fund and issued a report dated October 19, 1999; and

3559

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 21, 2000
Whereas, the PricewaterhouseCoopers report projects future c laims against the Torrens Indemnity
Fund using several methodologies, the most conservative of which, projects future exposure at
$6,556, 173 over the remaining life of the Torrens Fund which ends on July I, 2037; and
Whereas, the PricewaterhouseCoopers report finds that, as of November 30, 1998, the Torrens
Indemnity Fund had a balance of $35,0 I 1,503, deducting for claim reserves, an amount of approximately
$28,000,000 could be determined as excess of need; and
Whereas, PA 90-778 provides that should the County Board determine that excess fund s exist in
the Torrens Indemnity Fund, the Board may establish a Lead Poisoning Prevention Fund and transfer not
less than 50% of the excess monies to such fund ; and
Whereas, PA90-778 provides that the principal of the Lead Poisoning Prevention Fund be used to
provide financial assistance to owners of residential property within the county to pay costs associated
w ith lead mitigation and lead abatement through loans, grants, or other assistance as the county deems
appropriate, and further that any interest which accrues on investment of the Fund 's principal may
additionally be used to fund other lead poisoning prevention activities, such as education, community
outreach and other activities the county deems appropriate for prevention of lead poisoning; and
Whereas, establishment of an effective countywide lead prevention program req uires the advice
and counsel of community leaders and professionals.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED BY TH E BOARD OF COOK COUNTY COMM ISS IONERS
THAT:
I. Based upon the findings set forth in the PricewaterhouseCoopers actuarial report, it is hereby
determined that $6,556, 173 should be retained by the Torrens Indemnity Fund to satisfy claims which
may be brought over the remaining life of the Fund which expires July I , 2037, and that the balance

Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinoi s.

departments and elected officials on the agenda items. The Chairman requested copies of the questions
and responses be submitted to the Secretary to the Board and placed in the record as attachments to the

The Chairman then proceeded to the first item on the agenda.

COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS, by John H. Stroger, Jr., President,
submitting a Communication, dated January 5, 2000:
Subject: Arthur Andersen's "Memorandum on Internal Control Structure" dated November
30, I 998. I am hereby requesting that this item be referred to the Audit Committee of the
Board of Commissioners for further discussion.

Referred to the Audit Committee on February 2, 2000.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding development of a specific funding plan to
reduce the deficit in the self-insurance fund, Tom Glaser stated that a comprehensive review of the selfinsurance fund had been completed and that the President would be presenting a plan to the Board.
In response to Commissioner Hansen' s question regarding the status of the "special review of Employee
Withholding Taxes" for compliance, John Chambers stated that the special review had been completed by
Price Waterhouse Coopers and that the county should be receiving a written report of their findings very
soon.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 21, 2000
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding if the Department of Corrections was still
making cash disbursement from the Inmate Welfare Fund for purchasing inmates eyeglasses, James Lee
stated that the Department is still using the fund for this purpose. Mr. Lee stated that the auditor's
original recommendation was for the Department of Corrections to ask Cermak Health Services for the
funds to purchase these items. However, he noted that these services have historicaJly been paid for
through this fund and since the services benefit and support the general population of the jail, the
Department believes it is a proper use of the fund.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding how many inmates benefit from the service,
Mr. Lee stated approximately 3,600 of 100,000 inmates annually receive eyeglasses at a cost of $20.00,
which are provided by the Illinois Prison Industries.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding if the auditor, Arthur Andersen, still had a
problem with this use of the fund, Gary Fink stated it was only a recommendation for the county to
consider using another fund for such services. Mr. Fink concluded there was currently no problem
regarding the use of the fund for these services.
In response to Commissioner Hansen' s question regarding the status of the county's general investment
policy, Tom Glaser stated that the Administration was currently reviewing the "Taxpayers' Interest
Assurance Ordinance," which addresses coJlateralization levels and presently requires 110 percent
col lateralization. Mr. Glaser stated that one possible recommendation would be to lower this from 110
percent to I 02 percent, since it is the standard co Ilateralization level that most of the insurance covering
behind the county' s bond issues require.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding a target date for the Board to receive the
collateralization and investment policy recommendations, Tom Glaser stated that the report on
col lateralization would be presented to the Board in the I st quarter of fiscal year 200 I. Mr. Glaser also
assumed that a recommendation to the Board from the Treasurer' s Office and Administration on a
Countywide Investment Policy would also be presented at this time.
Commissioner Hansen, referring to the auditor's recommendation regarding Administered Funds asked if
there had been any legal opinion requested or received from the State's Attorney's Office relating to the
various funds outside the county treasury that are being held and administered by county elected officials
and departments. Commissioner Hansen stated he was interested in reviewing such an opinion to
determine whether the receipt and expenditures of these funds were subject to statutory provisions calling
for court fees and/or fines to be remitted to the County Treasurer and held in special funds that are subject
to the standard county procedures of disbursement through budgetary authority of the Board and
accountable through requests for Board approval of purchasing bids, contracts and payment of invoices.
Tom Glaser stated he did not have information before him on this recommendation and was not aware of
any request for a legal opinion.
Commissioner Hansen stated it would be helpful for the Audit Committee members to receive annuaJly a
list of such funds, with the elected office or county department who holds and administers them and their
annual dollar volume. Commissioner Hansen asked if such information would be possible to receive,
since the Audit Committee is ultimately responsible for reviewing the audits and confirming proper use of
all county funds.
Chairman Daley stated that he would look into this question with the State's Attorney and Auditor.

Cook County Sheriff s Police Department - Internal Warrant Info rm ation Computer ( IWI C)
System, Application Control Review as of December 1998, by Laura A. Burman, County
Auditor.

Submitted to the Audit Committee on February 28, 2000.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding if access by externa l agencies to the IWI C
system had been resolved, Ernest Neely stated that access had been re-established with additional security
by means of new passwords required every 30 days and internal monitori ng by MIS of activity in the
system.
In response to Commissioner Hansen' s question regarding the consolidatio n of arrest/warrant data entry
fu nctions between the Clerk of C ircuit Court' s system and the Sheriff' s I WIC system, Ernest Neely stated
that the Sheri ff s Office is ready but the C hief Inform ati on Offi cer is still working with the C lerk of the
Circuit Court regarding their computer system . Mr. Neely stated that o nce this is resolved the Cook
County Sheriff s Police Department and the Chicago Police Department co uld go "on-line" with the
Clerk's criminal data system . He concluded that when this was done, arrest/warrant info rmatio n could be
linked to the suburban law enforcement agencies, with the LIVESCA N and C HR IS system being used as
an easy mechanism for implementing a combined criminal/court data storage system fo r all Co unty
agencies.
Chairman Daley commented on his concern regarding arrests based on erroneo us warrants that have
resulted in increased costs approved each month on the Finance Agenda. Chairman Daley asked if the
Sheriff s Office was in compli ance with the May 12, 2000 target date fo r implementi ng acti ve warrant
reconcilement procedures. Ernest Neely stated that the Sheriffs Office di d meet that compl iance date.
However, he stated the law enforcement and criminal co urt data systems are still not full y consolidated
since the C lerk of the Circuit Court' s system is still not connected to the IWIC system.
On the same issue, Cathy Maras stated that she was working with the Sheriff s O ffice and Circuit Court
Clerk' s M IS department. She stated that w hen the C lerk of the C ircuit Court's database is placed on the
county's mainframe it would take no more than 30 days to connect the Sheriff s IWI C system with the
Clerk of the Circuit Court' s crimina l data system.
Chairman Da ley stated that the Audit Comm ittee would follow-up with a letter to the C lerk of the Circuit
Court, the Sheriff and Chief Informatio n Officer requesting informatio n in writing on the status of data
entry reconciliatio n and a target date fo r im plementing a more accurate and efficient means of storing and
sharing arrest/warrant info rmatio n on a ll persons that have criminal contact with law enforcement
agencies and the criminal court systems.

not c urrently have a target date fo r resolving this matter. Mr. Rada stated in order to give an acc urate

necessary adj ustment and not until that time could the office give an accurate target date for completion.

amount of the returned checks, George Rada stated th is had been completed.

stated the Office is currentl y working on resolving this issue.

Old Business:
On a matter of old business, Commissioner Hansen had a follow-up question to a March 8, 2000 response
to Chairman Daley's February 28, 2000 letter from the Bureau of Health Services regarding the January
25, 2000 A udit Committee Meeting. Comm issioner Hansen ' s inquiry related to an aging schedule for the
Bad Debt write-off for I 995 and prior years, and on the depreciation policy used by the Bureau of Health
Services.
In response to Comm issioner Hansen's question on how the county could eliminate Bad Debt, A lvin
Holly stated that as a public hospital serving I. I million patients annually, with 900,000 of those having
no health insurance, Bad Debt would always be a factor in a public healthcare system. Mr. Holly noted
that this problem is compounded with the recent passage of State and Federal laws that have resul ted in an
increased population of 40 million uninsured men, women and children in the United States, and current
Federal proposals that would result in decreased funding for Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements to
hospitals and healthcare agencies that serve indigent patients. However, Mr. Holly confirmed that the
Cook County's Bureau of Health Services uses collection agencies in an attempt to lower the uncollected
debt due to delinquent payment for services to the uninsured and remains very aggressive in its efforts to
obtain health insurance for all its patients.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on the amount of non-depreciated value to be lost in the
Cook County Hospital main building with construction of a new County Hospital, Alvin Holly stated that
the Main Building and its improvements will be fully depreciated in 200 I and the New County Hospital
scheduled to open in 2002. Therefore, he confirmed that all depreciated value would be properly
accounted for.

Vice Chairman Goslin moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Com missioner Butler. The
motion carried a nd the meeting was adjourned.

ARTICLE II
Section 1. Effective Date: This ordinance shall take effect immediately upon adoption.
NOTE:

This item was also referred to the Committee on Finance. (See Comm. No.

235457).
*Referred to the Personnel Compliance Committee on 8/9/00.
*Deferred at the Personnel Compliance Committee Meeting of 10/ 10/00.
Chairman Moran stated that letters were received from the Burea u of Health and the Bureau of Human
Resources and should be placed in the record. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the
County Clerk.)
Commissioner Hansen asked if there was a representative from the Bureau of Health?
Chairman Moran responded that there was no one present from the Bureau of Health.
Commissioner Hansen asked for a response from Mark Kilgallon regarding Ruth Rothstein's request that
the Board consider a provision that would permit the Bureau of Health to waive the residency requirement
for categories of workers who are in short supply.
Mark Kilgallon, Chief, Bureau of Human Resources, stated that he had spoken to Ruth Rothstein and she
has asked that the waiver request be withdrawn.
Commissioner Hansen suggested to the Chairman that Ruth Rothstein should put this new information in
writing. He further said he favors the proposal sponsored by Commissioner Sutker and he asked fo r the
deferral at the last meeting in order to receive more detailed information.
Mark Kilgallon stated that he wi ll get the request in writing.
Mark Kilgallon stated that the Bureau of Human Resources oversees approximately fifteen thousand of
the County's employees, which means that an additional twelve thousand employees do not come under
the jurisdiction of the Bureau. He commented that his statements regarding Cook County hiring practices
only pertain to about sixty plus percent of the total num ber of em ployees. He furthe r stated that elected
officials have been notified of today's meeting and were asked to attend the meeting to address any
questions or concerns regard ing the proposed ordinance. He stated that he wanted to make it clear that he
is only speaking for those departments under the President and the Bureau of Health, and not a large part
of the County that is not overseen by the Bureau of Human Resources.
Mr. Kilgall on stated that the Bureau of Human Resources surveyed a num ber of jurisdictions including
collar counties, and the majority of the counties do not have a residency ordi nance. Will and McHenry
counties, however, do have ordinances.
Mr. Kilgallon further said the Bureau of Human Resources does not know what the impact the ordinance
will have on Cook County. He stated the Bureau will be able to do some analysis but because of the size
of the Cook County and its di versity, Human Resources cannot make the assumption that there wi ll be
problems because some other juri sdictions are having problems. He continued by say ing Human
Resources did a quantitative analysis on what impact the ordinance would have if everyone agreed to
move back into Cook County, and the assumption is there would not be an impact. However, if one
person does not move back into Cook County because of the residency requirement, then there still would
be a cost factor whether it means going to the second person on the eligibi lity list or whether it means
reposting and possibly doing more testing that would result in a fiscal impact to the county.

3582

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 21, 2000
He stated that the fact of having county employees supporting county businesses, supporting county
schools, paying property taxes and living in the county, and benefits that have a financial gain to Cook
County.
Commissioner Hansen asked if there are a1ticles or studies that have been done on the proposed residency
ordinance?
Mark Kilgallon responded that the Bureau of Human Resources is seeing some problems, which is one of
his concerns. He said the Bureau has not seen positive stories, and the county would have to look at other
jurisdictions that are having success with residency requirements.
Commissioner Hansen stated that a well-written article will look at both sides of the matter-the cost
benefits and the cost disadvantages.
Mark Kilgallon stated he has one article he will distribute to the committee that addresses Commissioner
Hansen 's request.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the position of the adm inistration on the residency ordinance?
Mark Kilgallon responded that the administration supports the ordinance.
Commissioner Carr stated that the residency ordinance will have an impact on the county, and it is tough
when someone makes his or her living in Cook County and pay taxes elsewhere. Personally, he stated
that the ordinance is not a bad thing.
Mark Kilgallon stated that anyone who applies for a position with the City of Chicago, must show that
they are a resident of the City of Chicago, which could limit recruitment. Mr. Kilgallon stated that the
State' s Attorney's Office needs to look at the present language on the County's ordinance. He further
stated that he believes it wou ld still allow the county to recruit from outside the county as long as they
have an established residency in Cook County by the tim e of employment. He continued by saying that
occasionally a national search would need to be done for an expert and there currently is no stipulation in
the ordinance. The City of Chicago allows several months for new employees to establish residency
within the City after they are selected by a committee for specific positions. The residency ordinance
before the committee does not indicate those specifics and would be subject to interpretation o n when it
actually goes into effect-whether by application or by employment.
Commissioner Hansen asked if there is language amending the ordinance to allow a period of time for an
employee to move into Cook County?
Mark Kilgallon stated that he can provide the committee with language, but the amendment has not been
discussed with the sponsor of the ordinance.
Commissioner Sutker stated that as sponsor of the ordinance, hi s intention was that residency wou ld be
required upon employment and not upon app lication. He stated that Section 3 in the ordinance clearly
states the provision. He also said that Cook County wants a commitment from County employees as part
of their employment. Commissioner Sutker read portions of a Chicago Tribune newspaper article in
support of the proposed ordinance into the record.

3583

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 21, 2000
Commissioner Butler stated he believes the reason for the proposed ordinance is because there are
employees who work for Cook County and live outside the county who are not paying property taxes. He
s uggested a better idea would be to have a Cook County Employment Tax. He stated he finds it difficult
to tell people where they must live in order to be employed. He closed by saying that the ordinance is bad
policy and it destroys the concept of a regional form of government.
Commissioner Hansen restated his earlier requests. He concluded by saying that if the administration
believes the ordinance should include a contingency to allow employees a period of time to move into
Cook County, the commissioners should receive the suggested language before the board meeting.
Commissioner Moreno stated he agrees with Commissioner Butler, but he thinks the ordinance is not
necessary and believes the county can scrutinize employment applications no matter where the applicant
resides, provided they are qualified.
Commissioner Sims stated that the county should look at making exceptions and amendments if the
county begins to loose valuable employees or highly qualified applicants. The commissioner said she
believes the county should "leave the door open."

Commissioner Hansen moved approval of Item 235458, seconded by Commissioner Carr.
Commissioner Hansen called for a Roll Call, the votes of yeas and nays being as follows:
