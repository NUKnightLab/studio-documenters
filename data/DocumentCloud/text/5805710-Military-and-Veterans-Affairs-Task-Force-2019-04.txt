(collectively, the ?Encroachment Permits?).

Greektown Casino has entered into an agreement with Greektown Propco LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (?Propco?), for the sale of the Casino Complex, pending necessary regulatory
and City approvals and therefore seeks approval to have new encroachment permits issued to
Propco in place of the existing Encroachment Permits effective upon closing of the contemplated
transaction.

Liber 46207, Page 1298; a Resolution adopted by City Council on October 18, 2011, a copy of
which is recorded at Liber 49612, Page 386; a Resolution adopted by City Council on July 18,
2007, a copy of which is recorded at Liber 47629, Page 872; a Resolution adopted by City Council
on November 17, 2006, a copy of which is recorded at Liber 47420, Page 1284; a Resolution
adopted by City Council on July 28, 2015, a copy of which is recorded at Liber 52402, Page 410
