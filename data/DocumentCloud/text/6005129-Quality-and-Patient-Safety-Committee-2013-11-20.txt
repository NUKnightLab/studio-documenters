Public Speakers
Chairman Collens asked the Secretary to call upon the registered speakers.
The Secretary called upon the following public speaker:
1.

Christine Zook

Nurse Representative, National Nurses Organizing Committee

Following Ms. Zook’s comments regarding the need for in-service training for registered nurses at the System,
Chairman Collens indicated that this subject is at the top of the System’s list of priorities, as it is very important.
Director Lerner suggested that perhaps the Committee can receive a presentation on the subject from the
System’s Chief Nursing Officer in the future. He added that there are examples of online education available
that are not instructor-dependent; it might be beneficial to take a look at that option. Dr. Ram Raju, Chief
Executive Officer, concurred. He stated that the System’s Chief Nursing Officer, Agnes Therady, recently
joined the System. As is customary, senior staff presents to the Board on a regular basis, through the report
from the Chief Executive Officer; he indicated that Ms. Therady can present her findings on the matter
following her review1.

Report from System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation (continued)
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief of Clinical Integration, stated that, at next month’s meeting, a presentation will be
given on Cermak Health Services2; additionally, he plans to provide a tentative schedule for all of the
presentations for the upcoming twelve months3, and will commit to providing the materials at least one week
ahead of the meeting.
Dr. Krishna Das, System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation, provided an
overview of the information presented regarding regulatory and accreditation updates, the Physician Quality
Reporting System, and publicly reported ratings. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Dr. Das informed the Committee that representatives from the College of American Pathologists are reviewing
the laboratory today at Provident Hospital.
Director Lerner inquired as to the role of the Board in site surveys. Dr. Das stated that having Board Members
present at opening and closing conferences is extremely helpful; she added that the administration inquires
whether the surveyors would like to talk to Board Members at the leadership sessions that are held with the
surveyors, as well.
During the discussion of the information regarding PQRS, Chairman Collens inquired whether Dr. Das can
report back to the Committee regarding the quality measures that will be chosen for reporting4. Dr. Das
responded affirmatively. She stated that there is a menu of approximately fifty options; the administration is
collecting ten for Meaningful Use.
During the review of the information regarding the Leapfrog Survey, the Committee discussed the subject of
issues related to reporting individual patient events to the Board. Dr. Das stated that Leapfrog expects
organizations to be explicit and inform their boards about these events; however, the Illinois Open Meetings Act
(OMA) prevents this from being provided to the System Board in a closed session setting - no exception to the
OMA currently exists that allows for the presentation of this patient-specific information to the Board in closed
session. It was noted that, if there were an exception to the OMA that allowed this to be discussed in closed
session, then the staff and Board can discuss the cases, but not reference names or other identifiers in that
discussion. Dr. Raju stated that in most of the states in this country, boards can go into closed session to discuss
in detail the individual patient events (not with patient identifiers). The State of Illinois does not allow this
Board to go into closed session to discuss those events. Leapfrog wants the Board to receive information on the
incidents, not receive only the overall statistics. He noted that one way that staff is trying to address the issue is
by including a couple of Board Members on the medical staffs’ quality committees, because information is
presented on individual patient events at their meetings.
Following the review of information on Healthgrades, Dr. Raju provided additional comments. He stated that
when the System’s Medicare data is reviewed, the System does not do well because it has a very small Medicare
population. Most of the System’s patients are uninsured; that uninsured population’s data does not go anywhere
- no insurance company or even the State’s Medicaid and Medicare programs monitor that. The other problem
relates to documentation. Every hospital that does documentation well always receives better grades;
additionally, documentation drives the coding. So if an institution has good documentation and very skillful
coders, then they will receive much better ratings, because that captures the severity of the patients who come to
the institution. This is another reason why documentation and coding are so important.

III.

Report from System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation (continued)
Director Lerner stated that, from a policy point of view, something that has been discussed at the American
Hospital Association many times is that safety net hospitals are at a disadvantage because there is no database
that truly compares the true nature of the patient population they serve.

IV.

Action Items
A. Minutes of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting, October 9, 2013
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved to accept the Minutes of the
Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting of October 9, 2013. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B. **Medical Staff Appointments/Re-appointments/Changes (Attachment #2)
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved to approve the Medical Staff
Appointments/Reappointments/Changes. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Any items listed under Sections IV, V and VI

V.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Committee Education – Readmissions (Attachment #3)
Dr. Das and Joy Wykowski, Director of Intergovernmental Affairs, provided an overview of the information
presented on readmissions. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Dr. Das added that she will be presenting information on Value-Based Purchasing sometime in the future5.

B. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees
i. Provident Hospital of Cook County
ii. John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
Dr. Pierre Wakim, President of the Executive Medical Staff (EMS) of Provident Hospital of Cook County,
presented his report. He stated that medical leadership at Provident Hospital oversees and leads quality. At
the meetings of the EMS, each chair or director of the units reports on their sentinel events and discuss any
“near miss” cases. He stated that staff is currently working on the 2014 quality indicators for Provident
Hospital for each department; after approval and discussion at the hospital level, it will be brought to the
Committee and Board for approval and discussion.

V.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
B. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees (continued)
Dr. Ozuru Ukoha, President of the EMS of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, presented his
report. He stated that staff is laying down the infrastructure to provide the type of report on quality issues
that has been requested by the Committee. He stated that, while the medical staff has been very much aware
of the quality of care and patient safety matters, they have not been able to use data in a constructive way to
actually generate reports that can be meaningful. He estimated that this may take a couple of months to
build the infrastructure.

VI.

A. **Medical Staff Appointments/Re-appointments/Changes
B. Litigation Matter(s)
The Committee did not recess the regular session and convene in closed session.

 Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program
Background
• The Affordable Care Act amended the Social Security Act establishing 
The Affordable Care Act amended the Social Security Act establishing
the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program.
•• The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program requires CMS to reduce 
The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program requires CMS to reduce
payments to the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) to 
hospitals with excess readmissions.
• The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program  was effective for 
discharges beginning October 1, 2012.

Page 37 of 47

 Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program
Background
• The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services (CMS) uses 30‐day 
readmissions measures for three conditions:
readmissions measures for three conditions: 
heart attack/acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
heart failure (HF)
pneumonia (PN)
pneumonia (PN)
• Hospitals with fewer than 25 discharges for each condition are excluded
• Hospitals with “excess” readmissions have their Medicare payments 
reduced by up to:
1% in FY 2013
1% in FY 2013
2% in FY 2014
3% in FY 2015 and beyond

 Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program 
Defining Readmission
• What counts as a readmission?
The 30‐day readmission measures all readmissions to any short‐
term acute care hospital within 30 days of discharge.
• Two exceptions:
Planned readmission
Same day readmissions for the same condition to the same
Same‐day readmissions for the same condition to the same 
hospital

________________________
National readmission rate

Penalty multiplier

Excess cost of readmissions

• Magnitude of penalty is inversely related to national readmissions rate
So as national rates drop, penalties may actually increase
• Multiplier means penalty is disproportionate to actual cost of excess 
readmissions
E.g. given a national readmit rate of nearly 20%, penalty for AMI 
~ 5x greater

which are beyond hospital control
• Disparities exist in community resources available to help reduce 
readmissions (e.g.—home health agencies, primary care and pharmacies)
• Compelling evidence that hospitals treating disadvantaged patients and 
communities more likely to incur penalties
• Adjusting for socioeconomic factors would acknowledge the reality that 
hospitals cannot always control or change structural issues
