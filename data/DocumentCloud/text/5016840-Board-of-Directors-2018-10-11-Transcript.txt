suspending each officer for two days.

First speaker, Martin Preib.
MR. PREIB:

Good evening.

My name is

Martin Preib, second vice-president of the
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

7

 Report of Proceedings - October 11, 2018

1

Fraternal Order of Police.

2

I spent a lot of time at the

3

hearings for Brandon Ternand, and I walked

4

through the crime scene, and I looked at a lot

5

of the evidence.

6

anybody could have voted that unjustified.

7

that's over with hopefully.

8
9

I really don't see how
But

I have some questions, mainly
directed to you, Mr. Roberts.

There was a

10

lawsuit filed by some gentleman named Kelvin

11

Lett alleging that the former head of the IPRA,

12

Sharon Fairley, told him that he had to change

13

his ruling on a police shooting.

14

that was filed in federal court.

15

Apparently

IPRA is also accused in another

16

lawsuit by Commander Glenn Evans of -- that

17

they trumped up charges in a criminal case in

18

which he was completely vindicated.

19

In another case, COPA conducted

20

an investigation on another officer in a

21

high-profile shooting, and it was the FOP who

22

discovered COPA hired outside investigators,

23

third-party investigators, and not included the

24

fact that they hired them or any of their
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

8

 Report of Proceedings - October 11, 2018

1

findings in anything they submitted to the

2

Superintendent, to the prosecutor or to the

3

public.

4

And I think there's a very clear

5

pattern of very suspicious conduct at COPA in

6

their investigations and their procedures.

7

And I think if these kind of

8

allegations arose against an accused police

9

officer, there would be a lot more

10

repercussions than I think anybody's seen.

11

There would be a lot more discussion about it.

12

And I think this Board should

13

initiate an investigation into what was going

14

on in IPRA under Fairley to start with.

15

I think that would be a good beginning.

16

I think that also coincides with

17

the fact that I've never really seen anything

18

from this Board that taps into the mountain of

19

evidence that officers have been

20

accused -- falsely accused in many high-profile

21

wrongful conviction cases in which the City's

22

paid tens of millions of dollars.

23

evidence has arisen now in at least two

24

high-profile federal cases.

That

And I think if
