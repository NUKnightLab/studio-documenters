RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF SECURITY OFFICERS RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND STRIKE

WHEREAS, Public monies - through tax abatements, gap funding, incentives and
other subsidies - have largely fueled the widely-celebrated resurgence of downtown
Detroit development projects that range from the renovation of long?shuttered office

Caesars Arena. In recent years, the Detroit City Council and Wayne County Commission
have approved more than $1 billion in tax incentives in and around the downtown
district and citywide; and

WHEREAS, The security officers and first responders who provide the essential
service of protecting and keeping downtown Detroit?s rebirth safe, are among the
hard-working Detroiters who have contributed their tax dollars to help to bring these
projects to fruition, and ultimately contractors to be able to operate in this market 

WHEREAS, Economically, working people are too often being left behind and are
not experiencing the prosperity of Detroit?s comeback. Working people across the city
are coming together to fight for $15 to support their families; NOW THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, The Detroit City Council supports security officers? in their efforts to
obtain a fast and fair process to organize in the workplace without interference. That
Detroit?s security officers have taken the high road in their attempts to organize and
have not been allowed to engage outside of the employer?s attempt to silence workers.

Darian Stevens, Robert Butler, Angela Jones, Connie Haggard, Muhsinah Akram, Steve
Brown, Micah Brown, Mattie Hunter, Aaron Gibson, Errol Osley, Aaron Ayler, Diamond
