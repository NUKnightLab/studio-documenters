DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT, by Gwendolyn D. Clemons,
Director, transmitting a Communication, dated January 3, 2005:
Re:

HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME Program)

respectfully request approval of a HOME Investment Partnerships Program Loan in the
amount of$1 ,750,000.00. The project's sponsor is the Alden Foundation, a 50l(c)(3) not for
profit development corporation. They will manage the project through their wholly owned
subsidiary, Barrington Horizon, Inc., the for-profit entity and general partner of the
Barrington Horizon Limited Partnership. The Richman Group, a tax credit syndicator, based
in Greenwich, Connecticut is the project' s limited pattner.
The limited partnership will be responsible for the construction of a 50 unit (42 HOME
assisted units) senior independent living development to be located at 1420 South Barrington
Road, Barrington, Illinois.
In addition to the HOME Joan request for $1 ,750,000.00, financing for the project will be
provided from a variety of sources: a Harris Bank first mortgage; an Illinois Housing
Development Authority Trust Fund loan; an Affordable Housing Program grant; and equity
capital from the syndication proceeds. In addition to those sources, the developer is deferring
part of its developer fee until the project has stabilized. Total development cost for the
project is currently estimated at $8,068,872.00. The HOME Joan of$ I ,750,000.00 represents
22% of the total development budget at a cost of $41 ,667.00 per HOME unit.
The tenns of the HOME Program Joan will be structured as a 40-year fully amortized loan at
I% interest. The County Home program will receive annual principal and interest payments
of $53,100.00 to be used for other HOME eligible activities.
I respectfully request approval of this project, and that the Chief Administrative Officer of the
County of Cook, or his designee, be authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook,
any and all documents necessary to further the project approved herein, including but not
limited to the HOME Loan Agreement and any modifications thereto. The approval of this
loan by this Honorable Body will pennit staff to issue necessary commitments to allow this
project to move forward.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Funds: $1, 750,000.00. (772-298 Account).

*Referred to the Committee on Business and Economic Development on 01/20/05.
Commissioner Hansen asked how the Alden Foundation was selected.

916

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH I, 2005

Ronald Coverson, Executive Assistant to the Director, Department of Planning and Development, replied
that the Alden Foundation has completed two projects within Cook County, one in Cicero and the other in
Oak Forest. Mr. Coverson added that the Alden Foundation is current on all payments owed to the
County and that the Department of Planning and Development strongly recommends approval.
Commissioner Hansen asked what role does the Richman Group perfonn.
Mr. Coverson replied that the Richman Group is the equity investor in the project.
Chairman Collins asked if there was anyone present from the Richman Group.
Elizabeth M. Demes, Director of Housing Development, Alden Realty Services, Inc. replied that the
Richman Group is a tax credit syndicator which has been Alden Realty Services limited partner on all of
their projects including the previous two projects that were completed with Cook County.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the function of the Richman Group.
Ms. Demes replied that project is structured with multiple layers of financing; there are tax credits
through the Illinois Housing Development Authority. Those tax credits on all of these projects are
purchased by investors who are looking for that type of tax shelter. Further, Ms. Demes stated that the
involvement of the Richman Group in their projects is to buy the tax credits and become a limited partner
and owner in the project.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the State of Illinois involvement in the project.
Ms. Demes replied that Alden Realty Services has applied to the Illinois Housing Development Authority
for low-income housing tax credit which generates the equity, as well as a trust fund loan. At this time
Alden Realty Services is waiting for the Cook County Home Loan to be approved and hope to close the
project as well as the financing by the end of March.
Vice Chainnan Goslin urged Ms. Demes to write to her Congressman and Senators, because the programs
will be reduced by fifty percent in the FY 2005 budget, and FY 2006 CDBG and HOME will be
eliminated under the proposed budget. In conclusion, he stated that Alden Realty Services should make it
a priority to let them know what the company does with the money and how important this is to provide
what your company provides to the seniors.
Ms. Demes replied that she will contact her representatives.
Commissioner Hansen asked how tenants are selected, and how individuals are made aware that the
buildings are available.
Ms. Demes replied that typically it's on a first-come first-serve basis. Applications are mailed out to
anyone who is interested, when the applicants are qualified then they have the chance to select a unit. Ms.
Demes stated that Alden Realty Services notifies individuals by advertising in the local newspapers,
through local senior organizations where Alden Realty Services has made presentations to seniors,
through the Chambers of Commerce, and also by working closely with the Housing Authority of Cook
County.
Commissioner Murphy asked how long it took to obtain full occupancy in the building in Oak Forest.

917

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDfNGS FOR MARCH 1, 2005

Ms. Demes replied that the building opened in February and the low income units were filled within two
months.

Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, moved the approval of
Communication No. 269190. The motion carried.

*Referred to the Committee on Business and Economic Development on 02/15/05.
Commissioner Maldonado asked how long Molon Motor & Coil Corporation have been in business and
where they are located.

919

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH I, 2005

Robert J. Clancy, Vice President, Molon Motor & Coi l Corporation, replied that Molon Motor & Coil
Corporation has been in business since 1954 and are located in Rolling Meadows.
Commissioner Maldonado asked for the number of employees and how many of the employees are fulltime.
Mr. Clancy replied that he has 170 full-time employees.
Comm issioner Maldonado asked the cost per hour for employee's fringe benefits.
Mr. Clancy replied that the average hourly rate throughout the company is approximately $14.50 per hour
and the company provides a fringe benefit of $3.70 per hour for each employee.
Commissioner Maldonado asked if there are any employees earning less then $11.78 per hour that are
covered by health insurance.
Mr. Clancy replied that he provides health insurance and fringe benefits to all full-time employees.
Further, he stated that there are employees that make less then the $11. 78 per hour.
Commissioner Maldonado asked Mr. Clancy if he was aware of the Living Wage Ordinance which went
into effect on January I, 2005, and that the minimum living wage has to be $ 11 .78 per hour.
Mr. Clancy replied that he just recei ved the infonnation on Monday, February 28, 2005.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that it is Mr. Clancy's commitment to adjust the salaries of those
employees earning less then $1 I. 78 per hour.
Mr. Clancy replied that Molon Motor & Coil Corporation cannot commit to that at this point.
Commissioner Maldonado replied that if Mr. Clancy doesn' t comm it to it pursuant to law he cannot seek
the tax payer's subsidy of $600,000 over a twelve year period.
Comm issioner Si lvestri stated that the State's Attorney 's Office is currently researching to determ ine if
the living wage requirement applies to applications filed prior to the passage of the ordinance.
Commissioner Murphy asked how many of the employees earn under $9.43 per hour.
Mr. Clancy replied approximately forty employees.
Commissioner Murphy asked Mr. Clancy if it would be a hardship to raise the hourly salary for the forty
employees who currently earn less then $9.43 per hour.
Mr. Clancy replied that if they were to raise the hourly rates to comply with the ordinance it would result
in a serious competitive disadvantage to the company in the market place.
Commissioner Murphy stated that she agrees with Commissioner Maldonado that it needs to be done and
maybe at a later date Mr. Clancy's company can be grandfathered in.

920

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH I, 2005

Commissioner Silvestri stated that it doesn' t affect whether or not a law can be applied after the
application has been filed, it is a legal question; and the question which governs here is whether or not an
application filed prior to the passage of an ordinance is subject to that ordinance. Further, he stated that
the Business and Economic Development Committee has jurisdiction to review the applications and to
look at what the local community has done and, if the Village of Arlington Heights supports it then it can
be passed. If in fact the State's Attorney's Office comes back and says that the living wage requirement
applies, then it will be up to the Department of Planning and Development and Molon Motor & Coil
Corporation to determine if they would like to follow through on the 6b application.
Chairman Collins replied that she disagrees with Commissioner Silvestri, because the Business &
Economic Development Committee has a responsibility to wait until the legal answer is received from the
State's Attorney's Office.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that Molon Motor & Coil Corporation doesn' t have to make that
commitment today; and that Mr. Clancy should know his legal rights before a commitment is made.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the Department of Planning and Development asked for the legal opinion.
Chairman Collins replied that no one has asked for a legal opinion.
Commissioner Hansen asked if there was a reason why the Department of Planning and Development
doesn' t know the answer to the question before the item came before the Business and Economic
Development Committee.
Jacquelyn Harder, Economic Development Project Director, replied that the Department of Planning and
Development is asking the State's Attorney's Office fo r a legal opinion.
Chairman Collins asked the Department of Planning and Development if there would be a problem with
the item being deferred.
Ms. Harder replied that she doesn't see a problem with deferring the item.
Mr. Clancy stated that Molon Motor & Coil Corporation just learned of the change in the regulations on
Monday, February 2 1, 2005, and that he hasn' t had the chance to review the contents of the new Living
