Legislative Updates
Senate Bill 333 (9:12 a.m. – 9:31 a.m.)
Mr. O’Donnell reported to the Board about SB 333, which is proposed legislation introduced by State
Senator Hite. This bill would create new regulations for Construction and Demolition Debris (C&DD)
temporary or processing facilities. He went on to explain that existing State regulations govern only

 Cuyahoga County Board of Health

July 27, 2016

C&DD landfills. There are no regulations that govern temporary or processing facilities. Each C&DD
landfill operator has a processing facility that receives C&DD material and sorts it into piles to be able
to sell the recycled material. Mr. O’Donnell went on to explain that a new facility in East Cleveland
(ARCO) purchased land from the City of East Cleveland and began a temporary processing facility.
The ARCO site is not a C&DD landfill. Rather, the site stores sorted recycled C&DD material. The
concern is that the property is in a dense urban area; there are several homes that border on the
property line of the facility; the piles of the material are higher than the roof tops of the homes and they
are getting larger all the time with very little of the material leaving the site. A picture of the site was
shown to the Board.

There was some discussion regarding nuisance and rodents, but Mr. O’Donnell stated they were unable
to document a nuisance. Mr. Novickis stated that residents have registered various unsubstantiated
complaints. Mr. O’Donnell discussed that CCBH staff are also working on regulations that will mimic
the existing C&DD landfill regulations. Ms. Wolfe, an attorney representing the C&DD industry was
present and offered to work with Mr. O’Donnell in review of the regulations so that the regulations,
which are wanted by the industry, are acceptable and do not place any undue burdens on the industry.
Mr. O’Donnell advised that he will be attending a meeting at the Ohio EPA offices in Columbus to
discuss SB 333 and proposed revisions.
