Report on Quality and Patient Safety Matters
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, provided an update on regulatory and accreditation
matters. The organization participated as a regional resource in a City-wide emergency preparedness drill
on May 15th. He added that the administration has a meeting next week with the federal judge overseeing
the Consent Decree on correctional health; he anticipates that this will be the final meeting with the judge.
Staff are in continued readiness for the visit from representatives from The Joint Commission (TJC) at
Stroger Hospital; that visit will include Stroger Hospital and the Stroger Hospital-affiliated clinics, and
will happen sometime between now and October. Staff are particularly focusing on areas involving
environment of care and staff safety issues, and infection prevention including high-level disinfection, due
to increased attention in these areas over the last handful of years by the regulatory bodies. Because the
organization is also being recertified for its primary care medical homes, he expects that the survey team
will consist of at least eight (8) surveyors, and the survey will last for a minimum of four (4) days.

Report on Quality and Patient Safety Matters (continued)
B. Metrics (Attachment #1)
Dr. Ronald Wyatt, Chief Quality Officer, provided an overview of the metrics. The Committee
reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Driscoll stated that she would like to see a couple of new indicators added to the metrics.
She suggested that a new category be added that measures how the organization performs on some of
the indicators that may affect finances down the road, such as thirty (30) day hospital readmissions.
She recommended that Dr. Wyatt work with Chairman Gugenheim to develop a revised set of metrics
for the Committee. Chairman Gugenheim noted that it is her intent to review this subject at the
earliest possible date.
Board Chairman Hammock noted that when the subject of metrics was initially discussed, what the
Board wanted was to have a person like Dr. Wyatt and hospital staff look at what metrics they need
on a day-to-day basis to most effectively provide safe, high-quality patient care. Then, after it is
determined which metrics are critical for staff needs, a synopsis or summary of those would be shared
with the Board. Additionally, the Board wants to see how the organization is measured or compared
against external hospitals.
Dr. Wyatt provided his thoughts on the subject, with regard to areas of focus for metrics.
Additionally, he provided information on the increased emphasis on the culture of safety and
referenced a section in TJC’s patient safety chapter regarding leadership; he noted that there is a tight
alignment between leadership and safety culture. He stated that it is his intent to build a strategic
dashboard; a data analytics plan that is actionable on the back end needs to be put together.
Dr. Shannon stated that, in the fall, three (3) surveys will be administered by Press Ganey across the
staff. The first survey is a repeat of the nurse satisfaction survey, which is an annual activity. The
second survey will be a culture of safety survey; the previous survey was done two (2) years ago.
The third survey will be an employee engagement survey that will go out to all staff; the last one was
done in 2011. Those surveys will provide a rich set of information of the organization’s current state
and opportunities to be considered. It is anticipated that it will take a handful of weeks to get those
surveys done; the administration is pushing to get as much participation from staff as possible. It will
take a little time to receive and digest the responses to those surveys; following that, the information
will be shared with the Board.
