Resolution sponsored by Toni Preckwinkle, President, Jerry Butler, John P. Daley, Jesus

ENCOURAGING PRIVATE FUNDRAISING EFFORTS BY
THE COOK COUNTY HEALTH FOUNDATION
WHEREAS, in February 2008, the Cook County Board of Commissioners passed an
Ordinance, establishing the Cook County Health and Hospitals System (“Health System”
or CCHHS), an agency of Cook County, Illinois ("County"); and delegated governance of
the Health System to a Board of Directors (“System Board”); and
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 6(a) of Article VII of the 1970 Constitution of the State
of Illinois, the County of Cook, Illinois, is a political subdivision and a home rule unit of
government duly organized and validly existing under the Constitution and laws of the
State of Illinois, and may, under the powers granted by said Section 6(a) of Article VII of
the Illinois Constitution, exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its
government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the Ordinance charges the System Board to “encourage the formation of a
not-for-profit corporation to raise funds to assist in carrying out the Mission of the
CCHHS”; and
WHEREAS, in furtherance of this charge, the System Board has encouraged the
formation of the Cook County Health Foundation (“Foundation”), an independent not-forprofit corporation within the meaning of the Illinois General Not For Profit Corporation
Act of 1986, as amended, and which is organized to quality for tax exempt status under

 FINANCE AGENDA
APRIL 17, 2013

Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and
WHEREAS, in accordance with its articles of incorporation, the Foundation may solicit
and receive contributions and other financial support (“Private Funding”) from individuals,
foundations and corporations (“Foundation Contributors”) to be used in a manner that
assists in carrying out the mission of the Health System; and
WHEREAS, the County secures and provides funding for ongoing Health System
activities, acquisitions and related financial needs (“Public Funding”); and
WHEREAS, it is in the public interest that Public Funding be enhanced by the
philanthropic commitment of Foundation Contributors to provide Private Funding, which
will benefit the Health System and the Cook County residents it serves; and
WHEREAS, the Foundation’s fundraising efforts will be significantly enhanced by a clear
County policy that Private Funding will supplement, rather than supplant, Public Funding;
and
WHEREAS, Private Funding may be expended by the Foundation or by the County
through the Health System to accomplish the purposes designated by the Foundation and
its Foundation Contributors without imposition of any requirements or limitations
otherwise applicable to purchases made by the County or on the County’s behalf; and
WHEREAS, the Foundation’s fundraising efforts will also be enhanced by a mechanism
to provide public acknowledgement of gifts and contributions of Foundation Contributors,
as memorialized by acknowledgments, naming opportunities, plaques, plates and the like.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that it shall be the policy of the County that
Private Funding secured and provided by the Foundation for the benefit of the Health
System will supplement, rather than supplant, Public Funding; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Private Funding may be expended by the
Foundation or by the County through the Health System to accomplish the purposes
designated by the Foundation and its Foundation Contributors without imposition of
requirements or limitations otherwise applicable to purchases made by the County or on
the County’s behalf; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County and its Health System will use their best
efforts to cooperate with and assist the Foundation in its efforts to solicit Private Funding
