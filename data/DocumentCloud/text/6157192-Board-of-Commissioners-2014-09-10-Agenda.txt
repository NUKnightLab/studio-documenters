PROPOSED GRANT AWARD
Department: Cook County Justice Advisory Council
Grantee: Cook County Justice Advisory Council
Grantor: Illinois Department of Human Services
Request: Authorization to accept grant
Purpose: The purpose of the grant is to fund an exploratory analysis of youth from Chicago committed
to IDJJ by the Cook County Juvenile Court.
Grant Amount: $24,500.00
Grant Period: 9/15/2014 - 6/30/2015
Fiscal Impact: N/A
Accounts:

N/A

Concurrences:
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any.
Summary: The JAC proposes to conduct an in-depth analysis of youth from Chicago committed to DJJ
by the Cook County Juvenile Court. The analysis will merge data sets from DJJ, the Department of
Children and Family Services, and the Chicago Police Department. Combined these data sets will give a
more complete picture of youths’ progression through the system, recidivism, history of separation from
family and initial insight into dispositional data. This initial data analysis may lead to combining other
data sets from relevant stakeholders providing a complete picture of opportunities to avoid commitments
to DJJ and better serve youths in a community based setting.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION SUPPORTING CROSS RAIL CHICAGO
WHEREAS, Cook County is the financial, business and culture capital of the Midwest, bringing in
millions of tourists and visitors every year; and
WHEREAS, Cook County is in the midst of preparing its first Long Range Transportation Plan in more
than 70 years - a multimodal blueprint that will highlight the critical importance of improved and
expanded public transportation services to maintaining Cook County’s economic vitality and
accommodating increases in population, businesses and jobs; and
WHEREAS, improved and expanded passenger train service is essential to maintain Cook County’s
economic vitality and allow for increased growth and prosperity; and
WHEREAS, a new initiative for first-class passenger rail service called CrossRail Chicago has emerged
which would, for the first time, connect Metra route lines together, knitting together the Chicagoland
region; and
WHEREAS, Metra and Amtrak services bring in millions of people to Cook County and serve hundreds
of thousands of Cook County residents, but suffer from one fundamental flaw: all trains terminate in
downtown Chicago and do not travel through downtown Chicago, making regional travel on a train less
efficient and less attractive; and
WHEREAS, most of the Metra stations are stub stations where all tracks end and therefore do not allow
for crosstown service; there are two existing tracks at Union Station along the river that travel through
the station, connecting northbound and southbound service which also could be used for crosstown
service; and
WHEREAS, a 16th Street connector track exists which could allow for Metra Electric and Rock Island
trains to connect to Union Station then travel west, northwest and north, directly connecting the
Southland with the rest of Northeast Illinois; and
WHEREAS, Cook County residents of high unemployment areas do not have easy transportation access
to areas with job surplus, such as between the area of O'Hare/northwest suburbs and the high
unemployment areas of the south side and the south suburbs; and

Page 14 of 102

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

September 10, 2014

WHEREAS, Cook County's largest transportation asset - O'Hare Airport - is not currently served well by
Metra and not served at all by Amtrak, leaving a major gap in Cook County's transportation network; and
WHEREAS, the Chicago Department of Aviation’s new consolidated rental car facility built directly
adjacent to a Rosemont Metra station known as the O'Hare Transfer Station will provide a
once-in-a-generation opportunity to connect Metra and Amtrak service directly to O'Hare, opening up job
opportunities for the entire region; and
WHEREAS, both the Illinois Department of Transportation and the Michigan Department of
Transportation are currently working on plans for faster Amtrak service into Cook County, however,
these projects need to be coordinated to ensure these investments work together to provide the best
possible service for Cook County; and
WHEREAS, much like CREATE did for freight railroads, CrossRail Chicago, if implemented, would
combine multiple commuter and intercity rail projects already in various stages of planning into a
coordinated program where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts;
WHEREAS, the Cook County Long Range Transportation Plan will seek to ensure that transportation
investments are part of a plan for prosperity, and that vision also includes agencies from outside of Cook
County, especially Amtrak and Metra, to build and provide first-class passenger train service; and
WHEREAS, there is a gap in coordination for passenger rail projects throughout the region to ensure
that Cook County is part of a Midwest-wide process of building crosstown rail service.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners supports
CrossRail Chicago and its inclusion in the region's capital plans including those of the Chicago
Metropolitan Agency for Planning, the Illinois Department of Transportation, the Regional
Transportation Authority and Metra; and

PROPOSED MISCELLANEOUS ITEM OF BUSINESS
Department:

Department of Risk Management

Other Part(ies): Insurance Liquidations Investors, L.L.C., San Francisco, CA
Request: Authorization for the County of Cook County (“County”) to enter into an agreement to assign
and transfer the County’s claims against Reliance Insurance Company in Liquidation to Insurance
Liquidations Investors, L.L.C., for the amount of $976,834.07.
Summary: Reliance Insurance Company (“Reliance”) provided general liability and workers’
compensation coverage during the construction of the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital. As a result of
Reliance’s liquidation, the County became responsible for funding existing and new general liability and
workers’ compensation claims. The County had submitted documentation to the Reliance Liquidator for
reimbursement based on the assets available from Reliance’s Estate. The County has recovered
approximately 40% of the County’s General Liability claims; the last payment to the County occurred in
2011. The Department of Risk Management, in consultation with the Office of the Chief Financial
Officer and the State’s Attorney’s Office, determined that pursuing the assignment of these claims in
return for payment was a prudent and an expeditious method for resolving the uncertainty and
speculative nature surrounding the timing and amount of any future payments. As a result of this
agreement, the County will receive $976,834.07 or approximately 55.8% of the outstanding claims
yielding a total recovery of almost 74%. If approved, this item will authorize the County Comptroller
and Director of Risk Management to assign and transfer the County’s claims against Reliance Insurance
Company in Liquidation to Insurance Liquidations Investors, LLC for the amount of $976,834.07.
This agreement to assign and transfer the County’s claims has been reviewed and approved by the Cook
County State’s Attorney’s Office.

Concurrences:
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: This contract is for a major replacement of the fire suppression systems at the locations
listed below. The existing Halon Suppression Systems at these facilities are outdated and obsolete. The
systems require upgrading as the obsolete components require replacement parts that are no longer being
manufactured. New codes and standards have been created since these systems were installed. The Halon
Suppression Systems were employed over 17 years ago to provide a means of fire suppression, primarily
in rooms with high-value electronic equipment. Since their installation, Halon Suppression Systems have
been identified as an ozone depletion chemical and are no longer available for recharging the existing
systems. Reconfiguration of spaces in the facilities also means adjustments and/or correction of systems
so that all fire alarm and supervisory alarm signals are accurately indicated on the control panels.
The system shall be completely functional. It shall include mechanical and electrical installation, all
detection and control equipment, agent and storage containers, discharge nozzles, pipe and fittings,
manual release and abort stations, audible and visual alarm devices, auxiliary devices and controls,
shutdowns, alarm interface, and advisory signs, and testing of a functional UL listed SAPPHIRE Clean
Agent Suppression System. Request for Proposals (RFP) procedures were followed in accordance with
Cook County Procurement Code. Rolf Jensen & Associates, Inc. is recommended for the Countywide

Concurrences:
The vendor has met the Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprise Ordinance.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: A Professional Services Agreement for Job Order Contracting (JOC) Consultant Services
between Cook County Government Countywide and The Gordian Group, Inc., Contract No. 11-28-043
was approved by the Board of Cook County Commissioners on 5/14/2012.
The objective of the JOC program is to provide an alternate procurement method to enable the County to
rapidly engage construction project simultaneously.
The request to increase in the amount of $2,500,000.00 is based on the available capacity of the JOC
contractors. The Gordian Group’s fee for the services provided is assessed as a percentage of the value of
construction procured by the County through the JOC program. The increase requested through this
amendment was calculated by the applying The Gordian Group’s percent fee against the total value of
construction that is available to be purchased by the County through its JOC contracts. The County is
under no obligation to expend the amount requested, and is only obligated to pay The Gordian Group’s fee
when the construction work is procured through the JOC program. This amendment will allow the County
to utilize the remaining capacity on the JOC contracts during the contract term.

PROPOSED RECONSIDERATION OF PREVIOUSLY APPROVED ITEM AND REQUEST TO
APPROVE AS AMENDED
Department: The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, the Department of Facilities Management, the
Department of Transportation and Highways and the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer.
Request: Amend the authorization amount for various contracts awarded for the Countywide Job Order
Contract (JOC) Program. JOC is a quantity based procurement process that allows facility owners to
complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and construction project with a single, competitively bid
contract. The JOC process involved first selecting a vendor pool of potential contractors through a
competitive procurement process, and identifying projects for such selected vendors. The contractors
were found to be the lowest, responsive and responsible bidder through a competitive bid process in
accordance with the Cook County Procurement Code.
On 3/20/2013, The Board of Commissioners approved contracts with the selected contractors listed
below for the Countywide Job Order Contracting (JOC) Program. The contractors selected under this
contract replaced those contractors providing services under the prior City of Chicago contract, which
was a comparable government procurement in accordance with the Cook County Procurement Code.
The contracts are a two (2) year base term with two (2) one-year renewal options from the date of
execution; 3/20/2013 to 3/19/2015.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
MLRP 11039 GAGE, LLC
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property Assessment
Classification 6b that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for an industrial facility;
and
WHEREAS, the County Board of Commissioners has received and reviewed an application from
MLRP 11039 Gage, LLC and Resolution No. 1314 R 27 from the Village of Franklin Park for an
abandoned industrial facility located at 11039 Gage Street, Franklin Park, Cook County, Illinois, Cook
County District 17, Permanent Index Number 12-20-300-043-0000; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has defined abandoned property as buildings and other structures that, after
having been vacant and unused for at least 24 months, are purchased for value by a purchaser in whom
the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, industrial real estate is normally assessed at 25% of its market value. Qualifying industrial
real estate eligible for the Class 6b can receive a significant reduction in the level of assessment from the
date that new construction or rehabilitation has been completed, or in the case of abandoned property
from the date of substantial re-occupancy. Properties receiving Class 6b will be assessed at 10% of the
market value for 10 years, 15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances justify finding
that the property is abandoned for the purpose of Class 6b ; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of over 24 months and no purchase for value by a disinterested
buyer, the County may determine that special circumstances justify finding the property is deemed

Request: Authorization to increase the CDBG Disaster Grant that was originally awarded on
12/23/2013 and accepted by the Board
Purpose: Disaster Relief from flooding in April/May, 2013
Supplemental Grant Amount: $54,900,000.00
Grant Period: 12/23/2013 - 9/30/2019
Extension Period: 12/23/2013 - 9/30/2019
Fiscal Impact: N/A
Accounts: N/A
Date of Previous Board Authorization for Grant: 3/12/2014
Previous Grant Amount: $13,900,000.00
Concurrences:
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any.
Summary: Transmitted herewith is a request for the approval to accept a U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD) grant of Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery
(CDBG-DR) funds in response to disasters occurring in 2013, authorized under the Disaster Relief
Appropriations Act, 2013. The purpose of the CDBG-DR program is to assist targeted areas that have
been affected by a natural disaster (in this case, severe storms and flooding during the period of
4/16/2013 to 5/5/2013). The program will provide necessary expenses related to disaster relief, long-term
recovery, restoration of infrastructure and housing, and economic revitalization in the most impacted
and distressed areas resulting from a major disaster declared pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster
Relief and emergency Assistance Act of 1974 (Stafford Act). Cook County was initially allocated $13.9
million, which was accepted by the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 3/12/2014. Subsequent to
the initial allocation, Cook County was awarded an additional $54.9 million, bringing the total grant
amount to $68.8 million. The Cook County Department of Planning and Development met with or
consulted studies done by the Cook County Departments of Homeland Security and Emergency
Management, Environmental Control, and Transportation and Highways, the Cook County Forest
Preserve District, the Illinois and Federal Emergency Management Agencies (IEMA and FEMA,
respectively), the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as well
as municipal and township leaders to discuss areas that were most affected by the 2013 disaster and
important projects that need to be done.
The Department of Planning and Development desires to fund projects that strategically assist with the
recovery efforts and support other investments which are occurring in the area. Cook County plans to
enter into CDBG-DR agreements with municipalities, townships, for-profit and non-profit entities to
implement CDBG-DR activities or to directly implement activities.

not limited to the CDBG-DR grant agreement and any modifications thereto. The approval of this of the
Program by this Honorable Body will permit the CDBG-DR program to continue its forward progress.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
ADDITIONS TO THE COOK COUNTY HOME CONSORTIUM
WHEREAS, the County of Cook (the County) is an entitlement community pursuant to the regulations
of the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) at 24 CFR Part 92 and the Community
Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) at 24 CFR Part 570, which entitles the County to receive an
annual allocation of CDBG and HOME grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD); and
WHEREAS, the amount of HOME funds that the County receives pursuant to entitlement status is
determined by a HUD formula that takes into consideration the populations of the municipalities withinits
jurisdiction; and
WHEREAS, the Villages of Hoffman Estates and Palatine (the Electing Municipalities) within the
County that receive Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds directly from HUD can elect
to join the County’s HOME Consortium (the Consortium), which would allow HUD to take into account
the populations of these municipalities when calculating the County’s annual HOME funds entitlement
grant, thus increasing the County’s annual allocation; and
WHEREAS, the Electing Municipalities are choosing to join the Consortium, as signified by resolution
of their municipal boards; and
WHEREAS, each Electing Municipality must conform to the Consortium Program Year, which runs
October 1 through September 30 in accordance with HUD rules; and
WHEREAS, as the Electing Municipalities move to the Consortium Program Year they may experience
a gap in their administrative funding for the few months after their old program year expires and before
the Consortium Program Year begins. (i.e., if their current program year ends on June 30 there is a three
month gap before the new program year starts on October 1); and
WHEREAS, the County wants to maximize its federal allocation of HOME Funds by including the
Electing Municipalities in the Consortium. The County’s HOME Investment Partnerships Program could
see up to a $534,000 increase over three years by adding the populations of the Electing Municipalities
into the formula for calculating the grant amount; and
WHEREAS, to facilitate the addition of the Electing Municipalities to the Consortium, the County will
provide the financing for the loss in administrative funding and program funding that is needed to align
the program years in each Electing Municipality; and

Page 66 of 102

BOARD AGENDA

September 10, 2014

WHEREAS, HUD requires that the Cook County Board of Commissioners act by resolution to add the
new entitlement communities into the HOME Consortium.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, the President and the Board of Commissioners of the
County of Cook, Illinois:
Section 1: That the County will set aside a fund of no more than $10,000 in non-federal dollars to be
used to fund the administrative costs incurred by the Electing Municipalities for periods not funded,
within a three year period, due to the alignment of the program years of the Electing Municipalities with
the Consortium Program Year in accordance with HUD requirements.
Section 2: That the County be and is hereby authorized to enter into an Addendum to the HOME
Investment Partnerships Program Consortium Agreement for Federal Fiscal Years 2015, 2016, and 2017
to add the Electing Municipalities and that the President, Bureau Chief of Economic Development or the

BOARD AGENDA

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
In August 2014 it became evident that the household supply accounts would need additional funds to
enable DFM to purchase items needed for the upkeep of the facilities. On August 15th 330 had a balance
of $51,060.00 as of today 9/2/14 the account has a balance $9,146.00.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
These accounts were chosen because of the amount of funds that had not been encumbered.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in the
account that funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
These accounts were chosen because of the unobligated amounts in the smaller accounts, account 401
was used because of the amount of fuel that has not been expended this year and account 260 because of
the amount of unencumbered funds.

PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Department: Cook County Public Administrator Office (PAO)
Request: To allow for a transfer of funds within our operating budget.
Reason: The PAO needs an independent outside attorney to handle labor issues, personnel disputes and
hearings, collective union bargaining and certain litigation which arises periodically. Special outside
counsel is required for cases in which the PAO has issues outside its probate role as administrator of
estates as to collateral litigation involving the office.
From Account(s): 390-110, $24,000.
To Account(s): 390-261, $24,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $24,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On 7/14/2014 it became apparent that account 390-261 would need additional funds to include outside
counsel for labor/personnel, collective union bargaining and collateral litigation involving the office. The
balance in the account on 7/14/2014 was $0.00, and the balance was the same 30 days prior.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.

Page 80 of 102

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

September 10, 2014

The account used for the source of funds is a position (Assistant to the Public Administrator) that became
vacant in December, 2013. Due to the position not being filled, the excess money has not been used.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
N/A
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The previous employee in the unexpected resignation caused the funds to become available.
