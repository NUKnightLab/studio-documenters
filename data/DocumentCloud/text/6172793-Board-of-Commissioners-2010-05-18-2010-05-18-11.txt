EXPLANATION
On July 17, 2007, the Board authorized CHA to enter into Energy Services (ESCO) Contracts
with Ameresco, Inc. (hereinafter “Ameresco”) and Siemens Building Technologies, Inc. (now
known as Siemens Industry, Inc., hereinafter “Siemens”) for energy assistance services and
energy related capital improvements, and authorized the CHA to negotiate capital financing to
fund the ESCO Contracts with Ameresco and Siemens up to an aggregate amount not-to-exceed
Sixty Million dollars ($60,000,000.00).
Subsequent to that authorization, the CHA applied for and received HUD grant funding under
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (“ARRA”) in the amount of $22,240,736.00 for
the Capital Fund Recovery Competition Grant Funds Program (Category 4). To date, CHA has
expended or is contracted to expend approximately $34,279,970.00, which is comprised of the
ARRA Category 4 grant funds, the Buy America Bond funds secured pursuant to the capital
financing authorization, and CHA capital funds. The CHA now seeks to additional funding in
the amount of $5,943,331.00 for expanded deployment of ESCO conservation improvements and
infrastructure for the projects referenced below at the designated CHA portfolio properties.. This
request is twofold: (1) the CHA seeks to increase the number of energy efficiency-related
improvements to locations and facilities included in Siemens’ Phase 4 work scope, which
implemented heating system and domestic hot water system replacements at twenty-three (23)
CHA developments, for an original amount not to exceed $2,403,506.00; and (2) to undertake
energy conservation work at three additional locations to be performed by Ameresco, Inc. in an
amount not-to-exceed $3,539,825.00.
The cost of additional work scope items at multiple locations that CHA seeks to have Siemens
perform under its ESCO contract include:

The CHA received competitive proposals from Siemens and Ameresco for items 1 and 2 above.
Siemens was the lowest bidder on both competitive quotes. Due to the fact that the additional
work scopes contemplated in Items 3, 4 and 5 arise at properties that Siemens already has
performed work and provided the CHA with performance guarantees, CHA has elected to
engage Siemens for these Items, to maintain the benefits of the negotiated performance
guarantees. The listed proposal amounts are negotiated prices or based on Siemens open-book
price system that has been elected to maintain the validity of Siemens’ performance guarantee
provisions of their contract. The improvements are described below:
1. Domestic water pump replacement is to replace those existing facilities and systems at
properties where it was determined that existing pumping equipment was in poor
condition substantially beyond its useful life and in need of replacement. Siemens will
install high-efficiency system replacements that have been projected to demonstrate a
simple payback in energy savings of 17 years.
2. Remote monitoring systems will link CHA directly to the operation of the newly installed
systems at the Siemens project locations via the internet. This will allow CHA to monitor
operations remotely and to permit CHA to receive system alarms and act on system
problems that are detected much more quickly. The benefit of this will be to improve
reliability, reduce response time, and provide improved resident comfort.
3. Yates radiant heating replacement is a maintenance item that CHA did not have the
funding to address during the 2005 rehabilitation. The radiant work will include the
installation of baseboard heat that will be thermostatically controlled in the unit by the
resident. The existing heated slab heating system provides erratic temperatures due to the
lack of thermostatic control and has become a maintenance problem due to leaks that
occur within the concrete slab, as the leak area must be chipped out and located so that
the piping can be repaired.
4. Trumbull pressure reducing valve (PRV) station relocation is needed to address the
awkward location of the PRVs that regulate steam to the heat exchangers in each
mechanical room. The CHA determined that the original design was likely to result in
increased maintenance due to additional pressure being placed on steam and water seals
within the PRV itself. Consequently, it is the CHA’s recommendation that the elements
of the system be reconfigured to allow the PRVs to operate more optimally according to
design intent.
5. Boiler and heating system improvements will require additional electrical power to
supply increased loads. The work scope includes transformer replacement at two
locations and electrical feeder replacement for two satellite boiler room locations. Work
includes all necessary conduit, and wiring as needed to fully integrate with existing
electrical distribution systems.

 The second element of this request is to provide upgrades and improvements to heating/cooling
systems and domestic hot water systems to the Lake Parc Place development (two 15-story
buildings totaling 300 units), the Abraham Lincoln Center and the Taylor Park/Firman Family
Center, which are CHA-owned and operated properties. We are seeking to implement these three
remaining projects via the Energy Services Agreement (ESA) process (Phase 5). CHA originally
selected Ameresco and Siemens to perform energy efficiency improvements using ESCO
compliant ESA contracting provisions at twenty-one (21) senior properties and one (1) Family
development in 2005.
The construction to implement the Phase 4 work scope commenced in June 2009, and the work
at the Senior properties was largely completed by mid-November 2009. The Family development
covered in this ESCO project, Trumbull Park, is a more complex decentralization project that
will be completed by June 2010. These three additional properties were included in CHA’s
ARRA competitive grant application. These properties were part of the group identified for
improvements financed in part through the HUD’s American Recovery and Reconstruction Act
(ARRA) Competitive Grant process, but were not originally included in the initial ESA work
scope.
On April 2, 2010, CHA received proposals from both Ameresco and Siemens, and opened in the
Asset Management Department (“Asset Management”). Ameresco’s bid was lower than
Siemens for comparable work scopes, and Ameresco is the recommended vendor. Ameresco
projects a simple payback on investment of approximately 15 years based on the contract value
of avoided gas consumption over the term of the agreement for Lake Parc Place, which is the
only residential property of the of the three to receive improvements.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA that the Board of Commissioners
authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to enter into a contract amendment with
Ameresco for the replacement of heating systems, domestic hot water heating systems and air
conditioning systems in the amount of $3,539,825 at Lake Parc Place, the Abraham Lincoln
Center and Taylor Park, to enter into a contract modification with Siemens covering the five (5)
improvements at multiple locations, in the amount of $2,403,506 for a total aggregate amount of
$5,943,331.00.
These awards remain subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE,
Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
