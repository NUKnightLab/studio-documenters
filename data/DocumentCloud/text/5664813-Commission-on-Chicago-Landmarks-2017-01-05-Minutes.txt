Proposed rehabilitation of single-family residence including construction of two new
dormers and skylights.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The proposed fiber cement dormer siding shall have a smooth finish
and a 4” lap exposure to match the typical lap exposure of historic
wood clapboard, and shall be the color of the asphalt shingles to
further minimize visibility;
2. As proposed, skylights shall be low profile curb-mounted systems and
glazed with clear glass to minimize visibility. Frame color to match
color of roof shingle.

2. 322 W. Willow

infill construction is approved as proposed.
2. As proposed, the fiber cement siding shall have a smooth finish and a
4” lap exposure to match the typical lap exposure of historic wood
clapboard; and,
3. The project as proposed would require a zoning variation and/or
adjustment, and the Commission takes no position regarding any

requirements.
3. 1236 N. Astor
43rd Ward
Astor Street District
Proposed new 14’-wide curb-cut, 12’-wide driveway, and alteration of historic fence
facing Astor Street.
Action:

The Committee adopted by a vote of 2-0-1 (with Commissioner Houlihan
voting “present”) the following findings and preliminarily disapproved the
application:
(A) found that, pursuant to Article III, Section G.1. of the Rules and
Regulations of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks (the "Rules
and Regulations"), that the significant historical or architectural
features of the district are all exteriors and exterior appearances of
structures and buildings within the Astor Street District; and,
(B) preliminarily found that the proposed new curb-cut, driveway, and
alteration of historic fence facing Astor Street does not comply with
the Commission’s Guidelines for Alterations to Historic Buildings and
New Construction pertaining to curb cuts and fences; and,
(C) preliminarily found that the proposed new curb-cut, driveway, and
alteration of historic fence along Astor Street does not meet Standards
1, 2, 3, 9, or 10 of the U.S. Secretary of the Interior Standards for
Rehabilitation; and,
(D) preliminarily found that the proposed project is contrary to Criteria 6
and 9 of the “Criteria for Determining Adverse Effect” set forth in the
Rules and Regulations, and,
(E) preliminarily found that the proposed project is not consistent with the
designation of the Astor Street landmark district and would have an
adverse effect on the significant historical and architectural features of
the property and the district; and,
(F) issued a preliminary decision disapproving the application.
A preliminary decision disapproving the application triggers an informal
conference and, if the informal conference does not resolve the issues
identified in the preliminary disapproval, a public hearing on the permit
application would be scheduled in accordance with the provisions of the
Landmarks Ordinance.
