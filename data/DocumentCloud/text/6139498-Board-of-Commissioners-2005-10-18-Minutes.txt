DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM

Transmitting a Communication, dated September 28, 2005 from
GWENDOLYN D. CLEMONS, Director, Department of Planning and Development
Re:

HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME Program)

respectfully request re-approval of a HOME Investment Partnerships Program Loan in the amount of
$2,000,000.00. Affordable Housing Continuum and PSL Holdings, LLC, received a HOME Program
award of $2,000,000.00 in December 2002, for the construction of a I 05 unit independent senior rental
housing complex to be located in Country Club Hills, Illinois. At the time of the HOME award, the
project had not received a Low Income Housing Tax Credit award (LIHTC), a key component of the
project' s financing. The project was on hold until the LIHTC award was made.
The project has now received a LI HTC award. The project has had a change in the number of units (73
units down from 105) and requires re-approval by the Cook County Board. The HOME request of
$2,000,000.00 has remained the same. The HOME request has not decreased with the decrease in units
because the cost of construction, as a percentage of the total project cost, has increased. The HOME
subsidy per unit remains below the HOME regulation limit. In addition, Affordable Housing Continuum,
the project's owner and sponsor, has created a subsidiary, Affordable Housing Continuum (AHC) CHDO, LLC, who will replace AHC as the project' s owner and sponsor.
In addition to the County's HOME funds, other financing includes a first mortgage through the Illinois
Housing Development Authority's (IHDA) Trust Fund, a Federal Home Loan Bank Affordable Housing
Program (AHP) Grant; equity through the sale of Low Income Housing Tax Credit and deferred
developer fees. The project costs are estimated to be $12,002,162.00 (the County's HOME loan request
of $2,000,000.00 would come from the HOME Program). The HOME request accounts for
approximately 17% of the estimated project costs.
The tenns of the HOME Program loan will be structured as a 40-year amortization period at 1% interest.
The County HOME program will receive annual principal and interest payments of $60,685.00 to be used
for other HOME eligible activities.
I respectfully request approval of this project, and that the Chief Administrative Officer of the County of
Cook, or his designee, authorize execution on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all documents
necessary to further the project approved herein, including but not limited to the HOME Loan agreement
and any modifications thereto. The approval of this loan by this Honorable Body will permit staff to issue
necessary commitments to allow this project to move forward.
Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Funds: $2,000,000.00. (772-298 Account).

ESTABLISH THE PARTNERS AGAINST ANIMAL CRUELTY (PAAC) TASK FORCE
AND TO PROMOTE EDUCATION WITHIN COOK COUNTY TO REDUCE AND
PREVENT ANIMAL ABUSE AND RELATED INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
(PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Joan
Patricia Murphy, County Commissioner; and Co-Sponsored by John H. Stroger, Jr.,
President, Elizabeth Ann Doody Gonnan and Deborah Sims, County Commissioners.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Resolution.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

A RESOLUTION TO ESTABLISH THE PARTNERS AGAINST ANIMAL CRUELTY
(PAAC) TASK FORCE AND TO PROMOTE EDUCATION WITHIN COOK
COUNTY TO REDUCE AND PREVENT ANIMAL ABUSE AND RELATED
INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
WHEREAS, criminal profiling experts associated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation
have identified a strong correlation between animal abuse and violence against humans and
have documented cruelty to animals as one of the traits which indicates the characteristics of
a violent personality which is demonstrated by the disproportionately high number of violent
killers in the prison system, virtually every serial killer, and recent cases of school violence;
all of which have involved persons with a history of animal abuse; and
WHEREAS, the Partners Against Animal Cruelty (P AAC) Task Force was fonned in
September 2004, to coordinate a county-wide effort to abolish cruelty, neglect and violence
involving animals in order to improve the quality and safety of their lives as well as the lives
and safety of the citizens of our communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
recogni zes the establishment of Partners Against Animal Cruelty (PAAC), a volunteer
organization governed by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, comprised of an
advisory board of five to seven members, one appointee from each of the seventeen ( 17)
commissioner districts, and a representative from each of the thirty (30) townships as well as
Jaw enforcement, animal control wardens, animal organizations, and shelters; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners:
I.

Recognizes that individuals who abuse animals are more likely to commit more serious
violent crimes against humans.

3384

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDTNGS FOR OCTOBER 18, 2005

2. Urges social workers, teachers, mental health professionals, and others to be aware of the
connection between animal cruelty and human violence and to evaluate carefully and to
monitor closely individuals who have a history of abusing animals since this may indicate
a propensity to commit violence against other humans.
3.

Urges appropriate local and county agencies to encourage and support research to
increase the understanding of the connection between cruelty to animals and violence
against humans in order to utilize instances of animal abuse to identify and intervene with
potentially violent individuals and to assist in identifying and protecting children at risk
of abuse and neglect.

4. Urges agencies which are undertaking research on violent crime and its causes to
incorporate examination of the link between violence against animals and violence
against humans.
5.

Urges local law enforcement officials, particularly prosecutors and judges, to treat cases
of animal cruelty seriously both because such cruelty is a reliable indicator of the
potential for domestic violence and other fonns of violence against humans.

6. Commends the fine work of local animal control officials and humane investigators who
help enforce laws against animal abuse and urges these professionals to work more
closely with local law enforcement personnel to identify and prevent potential violence
against humans.

*Referred to the Public Health Subcommittee on 06/21/05.
*Deferred at the meeting of 09/13/05.
Commissioner Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved the approval of Communication
No. 271733. The motion carried.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDfNGS FOR OCTOBER 18, 2005

Chairman Collins stated that since the ordinance was introduced in June a task force was formed to create
a comprehensive jail diversion program.
Chainnan Collins further stated that the State's Attorney's Office has been working with the task force
committee, and that they have some questions regarding language that needs to be clarified. In a meeting
that Chairman Collins had with the State's Attorney's Office they stated that the clarifying language will
be introduced in an amendment when it reaches the Board.
Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State's Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, stated that the State's
Attorney's Office would be glad to work with Chairman Collins on the fine details of the ordinance. Mr.
Driscoll also stated that he had seen the substitute ordinance and that the State's Attorney 's Office will
continue to work with Chairman Collins on State's Attorney's suggestions if the ordinance is voted to go
before the full Board.
Chairman Collins asked her staff to distribute the substitute ordinance to the Commissioners and asked
for a motion to adopt the substitute ordinance.

Commissioner Butler requested to be added as co-sponsor on Communication No. 271734.
Upon further discussion, Vice Chairman Claypool, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved to
adopt the Substitute Ordinance for Communication No. 271734. The motion carried.
Chainnan Collins asked Karen B. Siegel, Ph.D., Public Policy Consultant, to address the Committee with
the aid of her Power Point Presentation.
Subsequently, Ms. Siegel provided the Committee with a written handout of the above presentation,
entitled "Cook County Jail Diversion Project."
Commissioner Moreno stated that the Cook County Jail Diversion Project Program will come at no
expense to the State, Federal or County governments. The cost of jailing one inmate averages between
$100 to $ 125 per day. Multiplying that cost by 90% of the approximately 1,200 inmates results in a
savings to the taxpayers of between $36 million and $45 million annually, depending on the length of stay
of each inmate.
Chairman Collins asked the Secretary to call upon the public speaker.

A RESOLUTION TO ESTABLISH THE PARTNERS AGAINST ANIMAL

WHEREAS, criminal profiling experts associated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation have

demonstrated by the disproportionately high number of violent killers in the prison system, virtually every
serial killer, and recent cases of school violence; all of which have involved persons with a history of
animal abuse; and
WHEREAS, a strong correlation exists between animal abuse in a household and violence by the
offender against their spouse and their children and since intentional animal abuse is an early signal that
individuals, including young people, may perpetrate violent crimes against other individuals and since
many young children through their parents, friends or relatives have been exposed to dog fights,
witnessing and even participating, which desensitizes children to acts of violence, it is likely that children
exposed to dog fighting will commit acts of violence against humans and other crimes in the future as
studies have shown that the crimes attendant to dog fighting include organized gambling, narcotics
possession and/or distribution, and weapons violations; and

3388

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 18, 2005

WHEREAS, dog fighting masked as "entertainment" is a form of violence against animals and a serious
problem throughout the United States, including Cook County, crossing all racial, ethnic and
socioeconomic lines. The State has enacted laws providing for the forfeiture of money, proceeds,
vehicles and real property acquired in whole or in part as a result of dog fighting, or the facilitation of dog
fighting, which require that the proceeds from the sale of properties forfeited and sold upon conviction of
dog fighting be utilized in the investigation and enforcement of laws including dog fighting and animal
cruelty; and
WHEREAS, the Partners Against Animal Cruelty (PAAC) Task Force was formed in September 2004,
to coordinate a county-wide effort to abolish cruelty, neglect and violence involving animals in order to
improve the quality and safety of their lives as well as the lives and safety of the citizens of our
communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners recognizes
the establishment of Partners Against Animal Cruelty (PAAC), a volunteer organization governed by the

appointee from each of the seventeen ( 17) commissioner districts, and a representative from each of the

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners:

Recognizes that individuals who abuse animals are more likely to commit more senous
violent crimes against humans.

Urges social workers, teachers, mental health professionals, and others to be aware of the

THE HONORABLE ELIZABETH ANN DOODY GORMAN, COUNTY COMMISSIONER
WHEREAS, Gaelic Park in 1980 was little more than a two-story fieldhouse in a heavily wooded area of
unincorporated Cook County; and
WHEREAS, today the sprawling facility is a center of Irish fellowship and culture in the Chicago area,
hosting wedding receptions, fundraisers, international dance competitions and a variety of sporting
events; and
WHEREAS, Gaelic Park began with a dozen or so members of the Chicago Chapter of the Gaelic
Athletic Association, Harry Costello and John Crean being two of them, who were interested in providing
a park in which to play traditional Irish sports including hurling, Ireland's national sport; and
WHEREAS, many Irish immigrants wished for a central meeting place that felt like home and where
they could host weddings, communions and other social events; and
WHEREAS, as with each ethnic group who has contributed to the growth and strength of our nation, the
Irish immigrants were worried that their culture would disappear or die out and there was a desperate fear
that something that meant something to them would be gone; and
WHEREAS, a group of men, a mix of tradesmen and businessmen, pooled their talents and money and
built the center themselves for $89,000 along with many volunteer hours and donated materials; and
WHEREAS, since Gaelic Park opened in the fall of 1980, the park has grown from nine to more than 50
acres offering three banquet halls, a traditional Irish pub, stages for perfonnances and a covered outdoor
patio; and
WHEREAS, generations of Irish have played Gaelic football, hurling, rugby, soccer and carnogie at its
numerous fields; and
WHEREAS, Gaelic Park plays a vital role in preserving and celebrating Irish culture, spirit and history in
a meaningful way; and
WHEREAS, Gaelic Park in the past 25 years has hosted thousands of people, including two of Ireland's
presidents; now, therefore,

3391

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 18, 2005
