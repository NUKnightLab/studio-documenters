APPROVE APPLICATION FOR A MODIFICATION OF ISBE RULE

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RECOMMENDS:

That the Chicago Board of Education (the ?Board") approves li'Ie application for a modification of an illinois
State Board Education (ISBE) rule regarding the electronic No Child Left Behind (NCLB) School and District
ImprOVement Plans.

PUBLIC HEARING AND Section 26.259 of the Illinois School Code requires the Board to
consider the application and listen to public comments from staff, parents, and other interested parties. A
Special Board Meeting will be held on February 13, 2014 for this purpose with notice provided through

websites edu and org at least fourteen days prior. Notice was also published in a
Chicago newspaper and provided to State legislators representing Chicago and collective bargaining agents
as required by Section 2-3. 259 of the Illinois School Code.

DESCRIPTION OF APPLICATION: The request for a modi?cation regarding the electronic NCLB School
and District Improvement Plan is as follows:

Under Section 1116 of NCLB, each school identified for school improvement must submit a school
improvement plan. Under the 23 Illinois Administrative Code Section the ISBE requires that each
revised school or district improvement plan must be submitted to the State Superintendent using an
electronic format made available for this purpose. The ISBE currently requires that schools and districts
submit these plans through the ISBE electronic system.

CPS Schools currently prepare Continuous Improvement Work Plan (CIWP) every 2 years to satisfy the
requirements set forth in Section 34?24 of the Illinois School Code. The CIWP is completed through the
CPS electronic tool. In an effort to eliminate duplication of effort, CPS would like to use the CIWP which will
at least include all the components required by NCLB and the electronic system.

This modi?cation would allow the district and its schools to use the CIWP to comply with its school
improvement plan requirements.

AUTHORIZATION: Authorize the Chief Executive Of?cer to execute the application described above and
submit it to the ISBE in accordance with Section 2-3.25g of the School Code.

school improvement status pursuant to Section These plans include speci?c steps that the -

Network Chiefs of Schools, the Of?ce of Innovation and Incubation, the Academy of Urban School
Leadership (AUSL), the Of?ce of Management and Budget, Local School Councils, parent and
community representatives and school personnel, as applicable. Each school?s CIWP includes speci?c
priorities and strategies, and each school?s budget includes speci?c expenditures, identi?ed for correcting
educational and operational de?ciencies that resulted in the school being placed on probation or in school
improvement status. As applicable, a Parent Compact and Parent Involvement Plan were appended to
the CIWPs.

Once submitted to the Network Chief of Schools Offices, Of?ce of Innovation and Incubation, or AUSL,
CIWPs were reviewed to ensure that: areas in need of improvement were addressed, the stated targets
and activities were consistent with trend analyses and analysis of current conditions and that plans were

Monitoring of and support for these CIWPs will be the responsibility of the Network Chief of Schools
Of?ces, Of?ce of Innovation and Incubation, Of?ce of Strategic School Support Services, or AUSL, as

throughout the school year.
