Mary Baldwin

As part of the resident leadership at Altgeld, was not able
to participate in Working Group for the redevelopment
plans of Altgeld. Residents at Altgeld would like to retain
washers and dryers in apartments, utility room and
current bedroom dimensions.
Would like to keep her washer and dryer. Would like
information regarding the proposed Laundromat. Will the
LAC run the Laundromat, who will get the contract for the
supply of washers and dryers?
Would like Altgeld redevelopment plans to be amended to
include washers and dryers in apartments. Resident
participation and representation inadequate during
process of redevelopment plans.
Withdrew request.

Has a disability and was denied a live-in aide. Her unit is
not ADA-accessible, therefore requesting transfer.

Gail Jackson

Not satisfied with Relocation process at Altgeld. On
th
January 14 was told by Property Management that she
had to move into a make-ready unit by January 18, but
th
did not see the unit until January 17 . Her new unit was
downsized from a 4 to a 2 bedroom and was not given
choice to turn down the replacement unit. All these
issues violate the Relocation Contract.

Referred to Rayne Martin.
