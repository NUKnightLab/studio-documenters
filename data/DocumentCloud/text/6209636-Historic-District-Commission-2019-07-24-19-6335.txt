ADDRESS: 3466 BURNS
HISTORIC DISTRICT: INDIAN VILLAGE
APPLICANT: BEN CARBURY
DATE OF STAFF VISIT:

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

PROPOSAL
Erected ca. 1914, the building located at 3466 Burns is a 1 1/2–story, bungalow-plan building.
The resource features brick exterior cladding, a side-gabled roof and 6/1 wood, double-hung
windows. Wood, 8-light casement windows are also located at the rear elevation. A
deteriorated 20’x22’ concrete slab and adjacent concrete parking apron is located in the
parcel’s rear yard. A concrete ribbon driveway leads from the sidewalk to the rear yard’s
concrete slab/parking apron.

With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval for the
replacement of the existing ribbon driveway and concrete slab/apron at the rear yard with a
new ribbon driveway and concrete slab/apron of the same dimensions, footprint, and location.
The application also includes the erection of a new 20’x22’ garage at the rear yard. The new
garage will be erected according to the following description:
•

•
•
•
•
•

Side gabled roof with black asphalt roofing
Exterior walls to be clad with lapped composite/hardi siding with a faux wood grain
finish or lapped textured OSB siding boards (color Dark Greyish olive with yellowish
white trim)
Aluminum gutters and downspouts (color Dark Greyish olive)
Aluminum, single paneled overhead garage door at front elevation (color not provided)
Aluminum, single man door at side elevation (see the attached for location
alternatives)
Wood beardboard soffits
Horizontal sliding vinyl windows at side elevations (color not specified)

 STAFF OBSERVATIONS
It is noted that the parcel currently does not include a garage, although a map dating from 2002
indicates that a garage had been extant at the site in the recent past. A review of Google earth
images revealed that the garage had been demolished/removed by 2018. The new garage is
located well to the rear of the home and will be minimally visible from the public right-of-way.
It is staff’s opinion that the proposed new building is generally compatible with the existing
historic home. However, staff does question the durability/lifespan of the proposed textured
OSB siding/cladding.
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1) The level of the eaves of a proposed new structure having as much or more significance for
compatibility as the room height, an average eave or cornice height shall be determined by the
same process as that described above. The proposed new structure shall have a height at the
eaves, or cornice, of not less than ninety (90) per cent of the average determined from existing
structures, and in no case shall the eaves or cornice of the proposed structure be lower than the
lowest eave or cornice height used in the computation, nor higher than the highest.
(2) Proportion of buildings’ front facades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on age,
style, and location in a specific subdivision. Height being established by the standards above,
proportion will be established by permitting no proposed building or addition to create a front
facade wider or narrower than those existing on the same block.
(3) Proportion of openings within the facade. Window openings are virtually always taller than
wide; several windows are sometimes grouped into a combination wider than tall. Window
openings are always subdivided, the most common window type being guillotine sash, whose
area are generally further subdivided by muntins. Facades have approximately fifteen (15) per
cent to thirty-five (35) per cent of their area glazed: Sun porches with a very high proportion of
glass subdivided by mullions and muntins are common.
(4) Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. In buildings derived from classical precedents,
voids are usually arranged in a symmetrical and evenly-spaced manner within the facade. In
examples of other styles, especially those of neo-Tudor and Victorian substyles, voids are
arranged with more freedom, but usually in a balanced composition.
(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The spacing of the buildings is generally
determined by the setback from the side lot lines; these tend to be consistent, even though lot
width may vary. Because of the existence of several subdivisions and their related subdivision
and deed restrictions, the placement of buildings on lots varies from area to area in the district.
In the case of very wide properties, two (2) conditions exist. A very wide site may have a house
placed centrally upon it, with extensive side yard space; this occurs only with extremely large
houses by district standards. A more typical placement of houses of average size for the district
is at the side of the wide site, placed normally in relation to one of the adjoining houses. The
rest of the property is a side yard on the other side of the house, and the entrance is often
oriented toward that side yard.
(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. In those examples of classical inspiration,
entrances and porches, if any, tend to be centered on the front facade. Other examples display

 more freedom with entrance and porch placement, with some having the main entrance at the
side. Porches, often permanently enclosed sun porches, are often placed at the side of the
building.
(7) Relationship of materials. The majority of the buildings are faced with brick, while many
are partially or totally stucco. There are some stone buildings; clapboard is rare, and almost
never the sole material. Wood shingle is occasionally used as a wall covering, usually at the
second floor level, and never as the sole material. Roofing includes slate, tile, and wooden and
asphalt shingles. Stone trim is common. Wood is almost universally used for window frames
and other functional trim, and is used in many examples for all trim. Because of the existence
of several subdivisions and their related deed restrictions, the exterior textures and materials
may vary from block to block in the district.
(8) Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that of
the low-relief pattern of mortar joints in brick contrasted to the smooth surface of wood or
stone trim. The use of stucco or concrete, with or without half-timbering, as a contrast to brick
surfaces is not unusual. Tile, slate, or wood shingle roofs have particular textural values where
they exist. Asphalt shingles, generally, have little textural interest, even in those types which
purport to imitate some other variety.
(9) Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors (red, yellow, brown, buff) predominate in wall
surfaces. Natural stone colors also exist. Where stucco or concrete exists, it is usually left in its
natural state, or painted in a shade of cream. Roofs are in natural colors (tile and slate colors,
wood colors) and asphalt shingles are predominantly within this same dark color range. Paint
colors often relate to style. The classically inspired buildings, particularly neo-Georgian,
generally have woodwork painted white, cream or in the range of those colors, including
"putty." Doors and shutters are frequently dark green or black. Colors known to have been in
use on buildings of this type in the eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries on similar buildings
may be considered for suitability. Buildings of Medieval inspiration (notably neo-Tudor)
generally have painted woodwork and window frames of dark brown or cream color. Halftimbering is almost always stained dark brown. Queen Anne or late Victorian examples may
have several paint colors on a single facade. These tend to be dark in tone and frequently of the
"earth tone" family. The original colors of any house, as determined by professional analysis,
are always acceptable for that house, and may provide suggestions for similar houses.
(10) Relationship of architectural details. These generally relate to style. Neo-Georgian
buildings display classic details, mostly in wood, and sometime in stone. Areas commonly, but
not always, treated are porches, shutters, window frames, cornices, and dormer windows.
Details on Mediterranean style or vernacular buildings are often done in stone, brick, tile, and
sometimes in stucco. They include arched windows, door openings, and porches. Buildings of
medieval inspiration tend to have details in the form of carved wood or carved stone ornament
on window frames, door frames, and eaves. Queen Anne or late Victorian style buildings tend
to have details in wood, stone, or molded brick commonly embellishing cornices, window
frames and door frames. In general, the various styles are rich in architectural details.
(11) Relationship of roof shapes. Roofs with triangular gables and hip roofs predominate. A
few examples of the gambrel-type roof exist. Complex arrangements of the gabled and/or hip
types, with subsidiary roofs, are not unusual. Dormers are common. Flat roofs exist primarily
on porches and sunrooms, and other minor elements; large hip roofs sometimes have relatively

 small flat sections in the center.
(12) Walls of continuity. The major wall of continuity is created by the buildings, with their
uniform setbacks within the blocks. New buildings should contribute to this wall of continuity.
Where gaslights are sufficiently numerous, and where trees in rows have survived in sufficient
numbers, minor walls of continuity are created. Fences across side lots contribute to the major
wall of continuity where placed at the front yard setback line.
(13) Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatment. The typical treatment
of individual properties is a flat front lawn area in grass turf, often subdivided by a walk
leading to the front entrance, and sometimes with a walk at the side leading to the rear.
Materials for such walks are concrete, brick, or stone, or combinations of those materials. Some
front yards have rectangular raised earthwork terraces upon which the house stands. These
unpaved terraces have sloping embankments or brick and/or stone retaining walls at the change
of grade. Foundation plantings, often of a deciduous character, characteristic of the period
1895-1930, are present virtually without exception. Hedges between properties, and ornamental
front yard fences or hedges are not uncommon. The American elm is virtually extinct in the
district, though once the dominant tree. Replacement trees should be characteristic of the area
and period, though only a disease-resistant American elm would be a practical choice.
Plantings of new trees should be directed toward the restoration of the former straight-line rows
of large trees on the front yards and "tree lawns." Straight side driveways leading from the
street to rear garages exist, but alley-facing garages are common, particularly in the southern
portion of the district. Where alley-facing garages are common, the lack of driveways lends a
unity to the succession of front lawns. Driveway materials include concrete, brick and gravel.
Side lots are not uncommon in the district, and a number of these form a part of the original site
plan for the residence. Such side lots are usually landscaped, often fenced at or near the setback
line, and very occasionally contain paved areas such as a tennis court. The street right-of-way
of eighty (80) feet combined with a pavement width of between twenty-four (24) and twentynine (29) feet creates wide "tree lawns" or berm areas, which adds to the generous ambience of
the urban landscape of the district. Street pavements are now asphalt; cut stone curbs still exist
in portions of the district. Alleys are frequently paved with brick, particularly where alley
facing garages are common. Fencing ranges widely in type; fencing in public view was
generally designed to compliment the style, design material, and date of the residence.
(14) Relationship of open space to structures. Open space in the district occurs in the form of
vacant land, a city park, school yards for the Waldorf and Nichols Schools, and side lots.
Where an original or early arrangement of a house and grounds included and still includes
landscaped lots which form part of the landscaping plan for the residence, such landscaped lots
are significant landscape features.
(15) Scale of facades and facade elements. There is a variety in scale from block to block and
style to style; most houses have a large and substantial appearance. The size and complexity of
facade elements and details either accentuate or subdue the scale of the facades. Facade
elements have been determined by what is appropriate for the style. Large wings at the front are
atypical, while small wings at the side, usually in the form of sunrooms and sun porches, are
common. Window sash are usually subdivided by muntins, which affects the apparent scale of
the windows within the facades.
(16) Directional expression of front elevations. In general, the expression of direction is neutral.

 (17) Rhythm of building setbacks. Because of the existence of various subdivisions and their
related subdivision and deed restrictions, setbacks vary from area to area within the district,
though they are consistent within each block or area. The varying designs of the houses,
occasionally with slight setbacks in the facades, cause the houses to relate to the front setback
line in different ways; this creates a slight variation in the setback line. Nevertheless, within
each block or area a wall of continuity is created.
(18) Relationship of lot coverage. Lot coverage ranges from fifty (50) per cent to twelve (12)
per cent or less in the case of homes with large yards. Most homes are in the twenty (20) per
cent to thirty (30) per cent range of lot coverage.
(19) Degree of complexity within the facade. The degree of complexity has been determined by
what is typical and appropriate for a given style. The classically inspired buildings usually have
simple, rectangular facades with varying amounts of ornamentation. Other styles, such as
"Queen Anne" and those of Medieval inspiration, frequently have facades complicated by
gables, bays, slight setbacks, porches, and occasionally, turrets.
(20) Orientation, vistas, overviews. While most of the buildings are oriented toward the street,
it is not unusual for an entrance to face the side, especially in the case of a landscaped side lot
or corner house.
The street facade in these cases is well coordinated with the rest of the street facades. Garages
are frequently oriented either toward an alley or a side street; almost all garages are detached
and at the rear of the lot. In those few cases where pre-1930 houses have attached garages, they
are at the rear and are entered from the side or rear. The doors of such attached garages are
generally not visible from the street.
(21) Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Neo-Georgian and other classically inspired
buildings are generally symmetrical. Other styles, including the neo-Tudor, are generally
asymmetrical, but balanced compositions.
(22) General environmental character. The Indian Village District, with its long, straight streets,
its hierarchy of walls of continuity (lamps, trees, buildings) and its large, dignified homes, has
an urban, substantial, low density residential character.
RECOMMENDATION

It is staff’s opinion that the erection of the proposed new garage will not result in the removal of

historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize the property and that the
garage itself is generally compatible with the existing historic home. Staff therefore
recommends that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) for the work as
proposed because it meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, standards
# 2.) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of
historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be
avoided and # 9. New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not
destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated
from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to
protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 10.) New additions and
adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in
the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would

 be unimpaired. However, staff does recommend that the Commission issue the project COA
with the following conditions:
•
•
•

•

The garage shall be clad with lapped composite/Hardi siding with a smooth
finish/texture.
The color of the exterior doors and windows shall be yellowish white, to match home’s
the trim color
The applicant shall provide HDC staff the dimensions of the existing hardscape and the
proposed new/replacement hardscape (driveway approach, ribbon driveway, and rear
yard parking apron) so that they might verify that the new will replicate the old/existing.
If the application proposes to expand the existing hardscape footprint, HDC staff shall
forward this portion of the proposal to the Commission for review at a future meeting
The windows proposed for the new garage shall be wood, wood (with luminum
cladding), or aluminum
