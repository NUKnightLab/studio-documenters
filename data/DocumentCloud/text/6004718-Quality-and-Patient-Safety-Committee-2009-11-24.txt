 CORE MEASURES
A set of diagnosed based criteria adopted
by CMS and Joint Commission to improve
patient outcomes. Core Measures are
called ORYX by Joint Commission. The
rationale for these National Core Measures
is to improve
p
ppatient care outcomes for
Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) Heart
Failure (HF), Community Acquired
Pneumonia (CAP),
(CAP) and Surgical Care
Improvement Project (SCIP).
A multi-disciplinary team comprised of a
physician team leader/champion, nursing,
pp
medical staff,, and ancillaryy support
services, has been addressing this ongoing

 CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS FOR VARIANCES
 Clinical Laboratory: Turn
Turn-around
around Time of STAT Tests – The goal of 100% was not met due to staffing shortages and
inconsistent monitoring by the Managers. The action plan implemented during the Fourth Quarter involves the analysis of the
data to identify the individual technicians who are not performing and holding the Department Managers accountable. At the
November 6, 2009 meeting of the Hospital-wide Quality and Performance Improvement Committee, it was unanimously
approved that the October data outcomes must be provided at the December meeting and subsequently reported monthly.
 PT: Outpatient Wait Time – The wait time goal is less than two weeks. The variances are due to lack of staffing. The wait
time of four weeks was maintained in spite of an increase in volume as compared with Third Quarter 2008 volume (40%
higher). The wait goal during the Third Quarter 2008 was 5.58 as compared to four weeks this Third Quarter utilizing the same
number of staff.
Action Plan: The Department Director will continue to utilize partial or full coverage from contract staff

Staff will co

minimize unused appointment slots.
Response to PT Evaluation Requests within 24 hours: Analysis of variances reflect that the causes are inadequate coverage to
lack of clear communication and notification of requests not being received in a timely manner. Action Plan: Department
Director will ensure that coverage for inpatient evaluations is arranged during staff absences and clearly communicated to all
staff. Department is working with IT to ensure consistent printing out of PT requisitions in the department. Staff have also
been cross-checking the printed requisitions and the computerized task lists to ensure that all requisitions are received timely.
• OT: Treatments not completed due to the patient not being available or patient refusal are beyond staff/department control.
Staff try to make a second attempt to see the patient if they are unavailable due to a test or other appointment.
appointment No treatments
were missed due to lack of staff availability during this reporting period.
At the November 6, 2009 meeting of the Hospital-wide Quality and Performance Improvement Committee, it was unanimously
approved that the October data outcomes must be provided at the December meeting and subsequently reported monthly

Individualized Nursing
Care Plans

Action Plan for Individualized Nursing Care Plans: The Nurse Managers and Educators will concurrently provide 1:1 counseling to responsible staff
regarding deficiencies in documentation; streamline the current process by developing an integrated 24 hours plan flow sheet. The revised flowsheet
incorporates Problem, Intervention, and Evaluation documentation as well as resolution of individualized problems. This revised process will minimize
the number of care plan forms required for documentation. Full implementation of the revised process is January 1, 2010.
Action Plan For Timely Transport of Patients: The analysis of data reflected the reasons for delays are (1) patients not ready, (2) inadequate staff to
cover during lunch breaks or when staff is off ill.
Department Director revised staffing patterns to overlapping shifts to compensate for lack of staff .
For the issue of patient(s) not being ready (ED) due to treatments or procedures, the Director of ED Nursing has advised the staff not to request the
transporter until the patient is ready for transport.
The QPI Committee has requested that monthly reports regarding this measurement be provided.

 COOK COUNTY HEALTH & HOSPITALS SYSTEM
2010 Quality Plan
I.

FOUNDATION OF THE CCHHS QUALITY
The Cook County Health & Hospitals System (CCHHS) Quality Plan and related quality
improvement activities are created and developed based on the mission and vision of the
CCHHS.
MISSION
To deliver integrated health services with dignity and respect regardless of the patient’s
ability to pay; foster partnerships with other health care providers and communities to
enhance the health of the public; and advocate for policies which promote and protect
physical, mental, and social will being of the people of Cook County.
VISION
In support of its public health mission, CCHHS will be recognized, locally, regionally,
and nationally – and by patients and employees – as a progressively evolving model for
an accessible, integrated, patient-centered, and fiscally responsible health care system
focused on assuring high-quality care and improving the health of the residents of Cook
County.
The CCHHS Board and all of its employees are fully committed to providing the highest
quality of care to patients of Cook County in an environment that focuses on patient
safety and fosters a system-wide focus on ongoing quality improvement. National and
regional benchmarks, evidence-based standards, and modern, constantly updated best
health care practices will be used to support and monitor the excellence of the care
delivered in the CCHHS.

II.

PURPOSE OF THE QUALITY PLAN
• To demonstrate evidence of the commitment of the CCHHS to the delivery of quality
care.
• To outline the framework and structure for identification, implementation, and
evaluation of improvements for all clinical and support services in the CCHHS.
• To establish the reporting and review frameworks that will be used by the Medical,
Staff, Nursing, and Ancillary Services to systemically report and review the quality
and appropriateness of care in the CCHHS.
In order to assure that the CCHHS is dynamically responding to the ongoing needs of its
patients, staff, and health care delivery system, with the approval of the CCHHS
leadership, the plan, frameworks, and structure of its quality program may need to be
modified during the calendar year. The CCHHS Quality & Patient Safety Committee
will be notified of any modifications.

III.

GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE CCHHS QUALITY PLAN
To facilitate the mission of the CCHHS and to implement the CCHHS Board's goals and

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT SELECTION
Selection of opportunities for improvement may include one or more of the following
mechanisms:
• incorporate goals or important functions of the CCHHS an/or affiliate
• evaluation of findings from root cause or failure mode effect analysis
• data, from internal or external sources, which indicate performance problems in a
given process and affects a substantial proportion of patients or employees or
represents a substantial risk
• risk management
• utilization management
• operational or quality committees
• external data or feedback from various customer or supplier groups related to the
process
• data indicating performance or resource utilization problems from department quality
improvement activities
Criteria for prioritization include:
• significant potential to improve patient safety
• significant potential to improve the quality of care
• significant potential to increase patient and staff satisfaction
• significant potential to impact efficiency
• significant potential to impact expense or revenue
• processes that cross multiple departments
• advances capabilities to do future improvement projects (such as pilot programs)
• significant potential to achieve strategic goals of system or affiliate
Should there be competition for resources, elective projects will be determined
using a weighted matrix of risk and benefit.

VI.

METHODOLOGY
The methodology utilized to improve is based on the type of project, goals, timeline and
scope. The general method for quality improvement in the CCHHS is FOCUS-PDCA.
The simplest improvement approach will be applied to a problem or issue, Rapid cycle
improvement processes are encouraged when feasible and appropriate. The Quality Plan
recognizes that more complex projects with a wide range of services and staff will require
a more structured approach.

IX.

The Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board of Directors assures that the
required human and financial resources and processes are available to keep patients safe
and to provide them with the highest standard of care in alignment with CCHHS' mission
and vision. The Board reviews the summary reports on system and affiliate improvement
activities and indicators that track the CCHHS' overall performance and reviews all
periodic accreditation and regulatory audits. The Board will establish committees and
subcommittees needed to fulfill its responsibility as the overseer of quality in the
CCHHS.
ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE OF THE QUALITY PROGRAM OF THE
CCHHS
1. Board of Directors receives and reviews regular summary reports from its
Quality & Patient Safety Committee concerning quality and patient safety
activities and projects, accreditation and regulatory audit visits, and key
performance and outcome dashboards. The Board may also receive
comprehensive system and affiliate reports and presentations as needed to
enhance the Board's understanding and knowledge of especially important,
demonstrative, or educational quality projects and outcomes.
2. Quality & Patient Safety Committee (QPSC) of the Board of Directors
is the committee of the CCHHS Board of Directors delegated with the
responsibility of assuring the effectiveness of the CCHHS' quality program and
and reviewing and approving all medical staff credentials and privilege
applications in accordance with medical staff bylaws. The QPSC is comprised of
three Directors of Board of Directors and other members with experience and
expertise in the quality improvement and patient safety in health care delivery
systems and organizations. The QPSC provides high level oversight of the
effectiveness of quality and patient safety activities of the CCHHS. It approves
the Annual Quality Plan, receives summary reports from the System Quality
Council, trend reports, dashboards, and corrective action plans on core measures,
national patient safety goals, sentinel, never, near miss events, mortalities, and
patient and staff satisfaction surveys. The QPSC will also receive occasional
comprehensive presentations concerning key system and affiliate quality
improvement projects and outcomes.
3. System Quality Council (SQC) critically analyzes quality reports received
from system-wide quality taskforces, service lines, and performance improvement
projects and minutes and quality reports from the seven affiliate quality
councils/committees and the system nursing quality council. The SQC reviews
and approves the annual system and affiliate quality plans and new system-wide
quality initiatives recommended by the Annual Quality Initiatives and Planning
Council. The SQC receives and provides input on reports and corrective action
plans concerning core measures, national patient safety goals, sentinel, never, and
near miss events, patient and staff satisfaction surveys, and regulatory and
accreditation agencies. The SQC may request comprehensive presentations from

7
Page 49 of 111

 COOK COUNTY HEALTH & HOSPITALS SYSTEM
2010 Quality Plan
affiliate and system quality committees, departments, and taskforces. The SQC is
co-chaired by system CMO and the system Quality, Patient Safety, and
Accreditation Director and its membership includes the system CCO, system
COO, system CFO, system CMIO, system Inpatient Quality Director, the
Assistant Pharmacy Director for Quality, at least one affiliate quality director,
CMO, COO, CNO, President MEC, and at least one system or affiliate
Department Chair, and one affiliate or system Division Chair.
4. System Nursing Quality Council (SNQC) aligns nursing and operations for
assessment, monitoring, improvement, and sustainment of patient care processes
to achieve patient-focused performance excellence. Membership of SNQC is
comprised of representatives from CCHHS hospitals and affiliates.
5. Annual Quality Initiatives and Planning Council (AQIPC) is an ad hoc
quality taskforce that meets in the Fall of each year to receive, review, select,
and approve recommendations for new system quality initiatives received from
the ambulatory and inpatient quality sub-councils. The recommendations for new
system-wide quality initiatives would be submitted to the System Quality
Council for incorporation in the next Annual Quality Plan. Membership of
AQIPC will include the system and affiliate CMOs, CNOs, and Quality
Directors, the system CMIO, CIO, COO, CFO, CCO.
6. Affiliate Quality Council/Committee (AQC) is the coordinating, oversight,
and administrative committee for all quality and performance improvement
activities in the affiliate. In affiliate hospitals, the quality council/committee
collaborates with the Medical Staff Executive Committee in overseeing the
clinical effectiveness of care. The President of Medical Staff Executive
Committee or the affiliate CMO (in a non-hospital affiliate) or the affiliate CNO
will chair or co-chair the affiliate quality council/committee. The membership of
the AQC includes medical and nursing staff, senior affiliate leadership, clinical
and ancillary department representatives, and clinical information staff. The AQC
prepares and revises the affiliate's annual quality plan, identifies benchmarks, and
keeps the affiliate current with established quality standards. The AQC receives
scheduled quality reports concerning the affiliate's performance on core measures,
national patient safety goals, untoward and sentinel events, accreditation and
regulatory audits, system quality projects and clinical, ancillary, and financial
department quality projects. The AQC monitors trends and progress on
implementing corrective action plans. The AQC sends the minutes and reports of
its meetings to the System Quality Council and presents its annual quality plan for
approval to the System Quality Council.
7. Affiliate Medical Staff Executive Committee (MSEC), as mandated by the
Joint Commission, oversees the clinical quality of care delivered in an affiliate
hospital. The Medical Staff Executive Committee provides leadership to the
affiliate performance improvement activities to improve quality of care,

2010 Quality Plan
treatment, services, and patient safety. The MSEC participates in the
identification of activities to measure and improve the clinical effectiveness,
patient safety, quality, and efficiency of services provided in the affiliate hospital.
The MSEC approves selection of medical staff members to serve on its standing
medical care committees and receives and reviews reports from its standing
committees. The leadership of the MSEC assists in the appointment of medical
staff members to administrative quality performance improvement committees.
The MSEC and its medical staff actively participate in ongoing quality activities
and quality improvement projects of the Affiliate Quality Council/Committee. As
part of its duty to promote quality and patient safety, the MSEC, as defined in its
bylaws, assures that all providers are appropriately credentialed and privileged
and their performance is monitored on an ongoing basis.

 Cermak Policy A-06: Continuous Quality Improvement Program
POLICY:
Quality Improvement is part of every employee’s job at Cermak. The Quality Improvement (QI) Program
is the process by which Cermak employees monitor, evaluate, and improve the quality of care, eliminate
waste, and improve efficiency.
The goals of the QI program are:
1.
To ensure that high quality detainee care is delivered in a safe and appropriate manner.
2.
To ensure compliance with recognized community standards of care and accreditation standards.
3.
To provide care in a cost effective manner and to reduce waste in the system of care delivery.
4.
To provide ongoing, systematic evaluation of both processes of detainee care and clinical or
professional performance.
DEFINITIONS
Sentinel event – A clinical event that results in an unanticipated death or major permanent loss of
function, not related to the natural course of the patient’s illness or underlying condition.
Serious suicide attempt – a suicide attempt that is considered to be either life-threatening or that required
medical treatment for serious harm.
PROCEDURE
Quality Improvement Plan
The Quality Improvement Committee (see below) will annually develop and propose a Quality
Improvement Plan based on a program that identifies and prioritizes problems, opens channels of
multidisciplinary communication, identifies metrics, and develops process improvement techniques to
resolve identified concerns.
(1)
The Plan will include the program's objectives for the year, scope, and desired metrics for
evaluation of the process or problem in question. The plan will also include follow up measurements of
previously executed projects. Selection of objectives will take the following points into consideration:
a.
b.

c.

The objective will be problem-focused, as evidenced by documented studies, documented
analyses of processes, or other documented, objective methods.
Identified problems will be prioritized objectively; those with the most serious effects upon
detainee care will be dealt with first as determined by the Chief Operating Officer or Department
Head.
Quality improvement activities will follow accreditation requirements, requirements of any extant
consent agreements, and needs of the facility.

(2)
The Plan will be reviewed and approved annually by the Chief Operating Officer, Chief Medical
Officer, and the Director of Quality Improvement.

Page 58 of 111

 (3)
The Chief Operating Officer, Chief Medical Officer, and Quality Improvement Director will meet
no less than annually with the Executive Director of CCDOC to advise him/her of the results of the past
year’s quality improvement activities and the Plan for the coming year.
(4)
Additional quality improvement activities may be added to the Plan and previous activities may
be reprioritized during the planned year as the need arises. Such changes may be directed by the Chief
Operating Officer or proposed by the Quality Improvement Committee. In the latter case, they must be
approved by the Chief Operating Officer.
Quality Improvement Committee
Selection of committee members. The Chief Operating Officer will establish a Quality Improvement
Committee composed of at least the facility Medical Director, Quality Improvement Director, Department
Heads or designees, and Contract Vendor Representative, as applicable. A representative from nursing,
medical records, mental health, dental, pharmacy, radiology, laboratory, other health care disciplines, or
security will serve on the Committee or attend Committee meetings based on the agenda. A custody
representative will be invited to all meetings. This person will be appointed by the Executive Director or
Sheriff. Other clinical, administrative, and support staff will, at the discretion of the Chief Operating
Officer or Quality Improvement Director, be requested to participate in Committee activities as they
relate to identified needs, problems, or other detainee care issues.
Committee chair. The Director of Quality Improvement will be responsible for chairing monthly
meetings of the QI Committee, maintaining minutes of those meetings, and accepting and maintaining
required data collection. The Director of Quality Improvement will also be responsible for assisting
various staff members and department heads in analyzing processes of care, developing metrics, and in
developing methods of measuring outcomes. The Director of Quality Improvement will be responsible
for development of the annual CQI plan.
Committee meetings. The CQI Committee will meet monthly in a standing time slot.
must be approved by the Chief Operating Officer.

Any cancellations

Process mapping
Multidisciplinary project management teams will be formed to map, evaluate, and improve key processes
of care within the organization. These groups will be determined by the Chief Operating Officer and will
report their results to the Quality Improvement Committee.
For multi-department processes, the designated process improvement team leader will have final
responsibility for ensuring that the specified process is mapped out. Every Department head ensure that
department members, map out the processes of care in which that department participates, with
multidisciplinary collaboration with other participating departments.
For single-department processes, each Department Head will be responsible for maintaining metrics for
their key processes and reporting the results of those measurements to the Quality Improvement
Committee on a monthly basis. Metrics in each area will represent outcome results.
The Quality Improvement Director and project managers will assist Department Heads in mapping out the
process of care and metric for their area. Ongoing projects of measurement will be determined by staff,
Department Heads or administrative leadership based on

Page 59 of 111

 Guidelines for Quality Improvement Projects
In general, quality improvement teams will be multidisciplinary and will include any group of staff
members. The process to monitor and evaluate care for a QI project will consist of the following steps:
1.
Identify problem to be addressed
2.
Describe process to be assessed;
3.
Identify and convene staff members – typically multidisciplinary – to constitute a team;
4.
Establish metrics that measure the key process;
5.
Collect and organize data;
6.
Evaluate data as it reflects on the quality of care;
7
Develop and implement a plan of action to improve care;
8.
Assess the effectiveness of the corrective action;
9.
Document the process noting improvements or changes resulting from the study; problem or
process identification; metrics; plan of (corrective action); and follow-up.
10.
Communicate relevant information to necessary individuals and departments.
Implementation of actions designed to correct problems will be reported to the Quality Improvement
Committee. Following a reasonable period of implementation, the problem will be monitored to see if the
desired results have been obtained by comparing current outcomes to previous outcomes. Key processes
will have metrics which will be monitored continuously. For unique studies, if the desired results are
obtained, the cycle will end. The program area will then be routinely monitored as required by this
directive. If desired results are not obtained, the cycle will repeat itself to check problem identification,
corrective actions, and implementation of corrective actions.
Data Stream
The Quality Improvement Committee will receive a variety of data on an ongoing basis. These data will
be used for purposes of identification of potential quality issues, statistical reporting, utilization review,
and calculation of denominator-based rates. (See Cermak Policy A-04 for details of the data to be
included in these reports.)
All reports will be submitted in electronic format. Due to the volume of material that must be reviewed
each month, all reports will be due 10 business days before the regular meeting of the Quality
Improvement Committee.
Reports for the data stream will include regular monthly statistical reports, QI project reports, occasional
reports, monthly litigation review, and annual credentials review. For monthly reports, tabulation will
include interval and cumulative (year-to-date) data. Once baselines have been established, monthly
reports will also include the comparison year-to-date data from the previous year(s),
The list below includes basic metrics that will be monitored and reported to the QI Committee. The Chief
Operating Officer will determine which additional metrics will be required to be reported to the QI
Committee on a regular basis.

Quality of Care Indicators
• Medical Record Review (form attached) – CORE QIC is proposing changes in
QA chart review to comply with JCAHO patient safety goals for 2010
Interdepartmental projects:
• Pap smear Initiative Begun in 2008 initiative is to increase patient awareness of
need for cervical screening, and increase the frequency with which Screenings are
obtained for HIV+ women at CORE. Currently evaluating 2009 data to assess the
level of awareness and measure effects of improvement efforts from 2008 to 2009
• Customer Service Initiative Task force completed evaluation of staff
perceptions of customer service (CS). In process of adopting efforts to improve
CS by raising staff awareness and accountability, implementing staff training,
update and share the CORE Center’s CS policy. Permanent Committee to take
over from Task Force assessing and evaluating CS practices at CORE
• Patient Retention Initiative An ongoing initiative is in place to identify patients
who are lost to follow-up for greater than 12 months. We are creating a
mechanism and assigning a group of staff who will implement outreach efforts to
locate and assess the client’s reasons for leaving care, and coordinate with the
necessary disciplines a plan to bring the client back into care and retain them. A
federal SPNS grant was received by CORE to facilitate retention in care for
women at high risk of loss to follow-up.
• Pharmacy Cost Control Initiative An ongoing effort to reduce cost in the CORE
Center’s pharmacy by enrolling patients in medication benefit programs for which
they qualify (Medicaid, ADAP etc.). Reduces County drug acquisition costs by
>$50M annually and provides lifesaving medications to more than 5,000 HIV+
people treated at CORE.
Departmental Projects:
• Patient Satisfaction Survey Results of departmental modules (Nursing.
Registration, Pharmacy, Case management, Laboratory etc.) on annual patient
satisfaction survey are being by managers and staff. Areas for improvement
identified, improvement processes initiated as needed, and targeted patient
surveys conducted in next few months.
• Focused patient satisfaction surveys to be conducted throughout 2010, to clarify
specific consumer concerns identified in annual patient satisfaction survey and to
obtain tracking data in response to attempts to improve services.

System Measures

Indicator / Description

Management of Diabetes Mellitus

Enhances continuum of care between
inpatient and outpatient levels
Measurement of Hemoglobin A1C is
recommended every 6 months for controlled
diabetic patients (Hgb A1C 7.0 or less) and
every 3 months when Hgb A1C is above 7.0.
Department of Medicine will review all records
or an adequate sample of discharged patients
monthly to monitor compliance with above
recommendations. Feedback will be given to
individual physicians and to all physicians
during monthly department meetings. This will
also be reported regularly to QC and MQC.

Anticoagulation

Process Measure

Inpatient Anticoagulation: Prevent excessively
high INRs during hospitalization

Percent of inpatient INR results exceeding
predetermined levels (e.g., INR levels of 3.5
and 6 have been used, and there are published
benchmarks for these).
The desired outcome of reducing excessive
INRs would be to prevent serious bleeding
complications during inpatient anticoagulation.

Affiliate Measures (OFH)

Indicator /Description

DVT Prophylaxis

Process Measure
Percent of inpatients with indications for DVT
prophylaxis who received appropriate DVT
prophylaxis (goal: 100%).

Medication Reconciliation

Process Measure affects Patient Outcome
Improve inpatient and outpatient care within
the system. Increase communication amongst
affiliate care. Would encourage and enhance
patient education and prevention /reduction of
medication errors.
Important to monitor even though goal was
reconsidered by the Joint Commission.

 Introduction Stephen A. Martin, Jr., PhD, MPH, Chief Operating Ofﬁcer
The 2008 Annual Report highlights a year of continued collaboration. As a multi-faceted department,
Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) service units worked together and
with community partners to bring essential public health programs and services to the residents
of suburban Cook County. As an example, the department worked to support and enforce
the Smoke-free Illinois Act that went into effect in 2008, banning smoking in public places; and
coordinated emergency preparedness events to better prepare for a public health emergency.
Every day, our department strives to improve the quality of life for residents of suburban Cook
County. Our dedicated staff work to prevent the spread of over 70 reportable communicable
diseases, provide health promotion programs and enforce public health laws, rules and regulations.
We are the state certiﬁed public health agency for suburban Cook County with the exception of
Evanston, Skokie, Oak Park and Stickney Township. We are also one of seven operating units of the
Cook County Health & Hospitals System. The other six operating units include the Ambulatory and
Community Health Network of Cook County, Cermak Health Services of Cook County, The Ruth M.
Rothstein CORE Center, John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital, Oak Forest Hospital and Provident Hospital.

 Integrated Health Support Services
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) participated in the Farmer’s Market Nutrition Program (FMNP) in 2008. The WIC program
provides health care referrals and nutrition education and supplemental foods at no cost to
low-income pregnant, breastfeeding and postpartum women, and to infants and children
up to ﬁve years of age. The FMNP established by Congress in July 1992 provides fresh locally grown fruits and vegetables to WIC participants at the local farmer’s market.

4

In 2008, the CCDPH WIC program distributed 700 coupon booklets valued at more than
$10,000. Enrolled clients receiving a booklet were able to redeem the coupons at the Park
Forest Farmers’ Market. More than ten participating local farmers provided a wide variety
of fresh fruit and vegetables to choose from for the women and children participating in
suburban Cook County WIC.
Most fruits and vegetables are naturally low in calories and provide essential nutrients and
dietary ﬁber. They may also play a role in preventing certain chronic diseases. Health organizations such as the American Cancer Society, American Diabetes Association, and the
American Heart Association recommend ﬁve servings of fresh fruits and vegetables per day
to prevent conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, and stroke.

 Working Together for a Smoke Free Illinois
The Smoke Free Illinois Act (SFIA) was signed into law in 2007 and went into effect on
January 1, 2008. Cook County Department of Public Health was a member of a state-wide
coalition that played an integral role in passing this important public health legislation. The
legislation prohibited smoking in virtually all public places and workplaces, including ofﬁces,
theaters, museums, libraries, schools, commercial establishments, enclosed shopping centers and retail stores, restaurants, bars, private clubs and gaming facilities.
The SFIA protects public health by reducing exposure to second hand smoke, encourag-

9

ing smokers to quit and discouraging youth from starting. Once the law went into effect in
2008, multiple units within the Cook County Department of Public Health worked to support and enforce the act.
During the year, CCDPH units successfully advocated to maintain the law and worked with
high school students to send 800 thank you letters to legislators urging them to continue
supporting the act. Health educators conducted public education presentations and
Environmental Health staff investigated 628 complaints, issued 594 violation letters and
performed 32 on-site inspections. Five establishments were ﬁned for failing to comply with
the SFIA.

 Policy Development and Communications
The Policy Development and Communications Service Unit (PDCU) researches and
analyzes public health policies, advocates for the adoption of science-based public health
laws, rules and regulations and provides accurate and timely communications to suburban
Cook County. PDCU staff play an important leadership role in formulating and enacting
signiﬁcant public health legislative initiatives in the areas of communicable disease control,
environmental health, and chronic disease prevention.

10

Emergency Pharmaceutical Dispensing Site Legislation SB2690
(Sen. Maloney - Rep. Yarbrough) Since 2001, CCDPH has worked to develop a network
of emergency pharmaceutical distribution sites for the purpose of dispensing mass prophylaxis during a public health emergency. The locations, referred to as “Point of Dispensing
Sites” (PODS), are geographically distributed throughout suburban Cook County and are a
critical component of the department’s emergency response plan. In 2008, PDCU drafted
and introduced legislation (SB2690) requiring public community colleges to make their facilities available to local public health departments in the event of a public health emergency.
On October 3, 2008, the governor signed the legislation into law (Public Act 95-0997) and
community colleges are now an important part of the department’s POD network.
Page 80 of 111

 Food Pantry Recall Legislation HB5242 (Rep. Hernandez - Sen. Trotter)
In 2008, a higher number of recalls of contaminated food products made national headlines. Local health departments are required to notify food service establishments of the recalls so the contaminated food item can be removed in a timely manner. With the increase
in food recalls, CCDPH Environmental Health staff identiﬁed the need to have a registry of
food banks and food pantries so that they may receive notiﬁcation of food recalls. PDCU
staff drafted and introduced HB5242 which required food banks, food pantries, soup
kitchens and other related food relief stations to annually register with their certiﬁed local

11

public health department. On August 14, 2008, the governor signed the legislation into law.
(Public Act 95-0828)

 Working Together for Emergency Preparedness
Responding to a public health emergency takes planning, collaboration and preparation
among many agencies. Cook County Department of Public Health Service Units
including Community Preparedness and Coordination (CPCU), Communicable Disease
(CD), Environmental Health (EH), Communications, Health Promotions (HPU), and more
work together with community and agency partners from suburban Cook County
and the surrounding collar counties to plan and prepare for public health emergencies.

12

In 2008, CCDPH coordinated a Cook County Pharmaceutical Stockpile Distribution plan
exercise where more than 200 ﬁrst responders from 25 municipalities from north suburban
Cook County came together. The exercise aimed to enhance communication and coordination between Cook County government and suburban Cook County municipalities while
activating Points of Dispensing sites.
Approximately 600 community volunteers practiced picking up medications during a
public health emergency scenario. Planning exercises are vital to the safety and health of
suburban Cook County residents in preparing for a public health emergency.

Page 82 of 111

 Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Services
The Communicable Disease Control Unit works to prevent and control the spread of infectious diseases within suburban Cook County. This responsibility is achieved through collaboration with those involved in the identiﬁcation, diagnosis, treatment and legal, ethical
and social management of communicable diseases.

Infection Prevention and Outbreak Control
The Infection Prevention Program was established in 2008 in response to a growing number of outbreaks in out-of-hospital settings. The program provides guidance and oversight
for infection prevention and control activities in all relevant settings within suburban Cook
County including, long-term care facilities, dialysis centers and child care centers.
Page 83 of 111

08

annual report

 Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Services (cont’d)
The Infection Prevention Program’s outbreak response activities include the control and
prevention of potential infections that patients acquire while receiving treatment for medical
conditions, known as healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). HAIs are among the leading
causes of preventable death in the United States, accounting for an estimated 1.7 million
infections and 99,000 associated deaths each year and it’s estimated that they cause
$28 to $33 billion in extra healthcare costs each year.

14

In order to contain these outbreaks, the Infection Prevention Program provides intensive
hand hygiene education at the facilities, works with the staff to implement appropriate isolation precautions, promotes rigorous environmental cleaning practices, and encourages the
use of alcohol-free, antiseptic wipes when appropriate. When these control measures are
applied carefully, they often greatly reduce the number of healthcare-associated infections
in a facility.

 Prevention Services
The Prevention Services Unit (PSU) consists of ﬁve program areas that assist suburban
Cook County communities in building and sustaining healthy environments. PSU program
areas include:
• Chronic Disease Prevention
-- Health Promotion

16

-- Health Communications
-- Tobacco Prevention and Control
• Community Preparedness and Coordination
• Lead Poisoning Prevention
• Violence Prevention
• Epidemiology and Community Health Planning
PSU is an excellent resource to learn about the health status of a community. Trainings,
educational materials and programs are available to support residents in their individual and
group efforts to be healthy. Topics include nutrition, exercise, quitting smoking, preventing
violence and more.
Page 86 of 111

 The Prevention Services Unit focused on strategic planning in 2008. This was its second
year since reorganizing to better address violence, chronic disease and access to
health care. These were the top three health concerns in suburban Cook County, according to data and input collected from community residents and leaders representing health,
social service, government, faith-based, business and other sectors, involved in supporting
public health.
In 2008, PSU implemented plans to strengthen the agency’s infrastructure and build

17

capacity, and all prevention-services-related program areas are now under one umbrella for

OVERVIEW
Suburban Cook County Tuberculosis Cases Declined in 2008
After several years with marked increases in active tuberculosis (TB) cases, reported TB cases declined 28%
between 2007 (n=139) and 2008 (n=100). The number of cases reported in 2008 was the second lowest number
reported in the past 10 years. In 2008, the rate of TB was 3.9 per 100,000 population compared to 5.7 per
100,000 in 2007.
Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) TB Control Activities, 2008
If untreated, a person with TB may infect as many as 10-15 others each year1. In order to prevent transmission of
TB, the CCDPH TB Control and Prevention Program maintains constant vigilance in order to identify TB cases
rapidly, to ensure that cases receive appropriate therapy and to screen contacts of TB cases to determine if they
have been infected. To prevent and control TB in 2008, CCDPH staff conducted the following activities:







Utilized an electronic database to monitor suspect and confirmed TB cases and to track all contacts to facilitate screening for TB infection.
Administered 15,000 TB screening tests at the three CCDPH TB clinics located in Des Plaines, Forest Park
and Harvey. As a result, 783 persons were identified as having latent TB infection (LTBI—see below) requiring treatment.
Administered or assisted in 13 worksite and/or school-based skin testing programs.
Reached out to more than 1,000 contacts to active TB cases.
Provided direct care for 64 new, active TB cases through CCDPH clinics, including Directly Observed
Therapy (DOT—see below).
Gave 15 presentations and educational programs to diverse audiences:
 Nursing homes or long-term care facilities (7)
 Nursing staff, various organizations (3)
 CEDA South Cook County (1)
 Illinois Council on Tuberculosis (1)
 South Suburban Head Start (1)
 Head Start Health Advisory (1)
 2008 National Refugee and Immigration Conference (1)

Tuberculosis Facts
Tuberculosis is an infection caused by the organism Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which spreads from person to
person when a contagious individual sneezes, coughs, or speaks. Persons with pulmonary or laryngeal TB can
infect others. TB bacilli form tiny particles (droplet nuclei) that can become suspended in air, sometimes for long
periods, and cause infection when they are inhaled by others. Close contacts of TB cases, such as household
members or others who spend considerable time together, can become infected.
Most infected persons have latent TB infection (LTBI) with no symptoms and are not infectious to others; the
condition is found through a positive screening test (skin test or blood test). It is crucial, however, that persons
with LTBI receive treatment, because without treatment about 10% will eventually develop active TB. Persons
with LTBI and immunocompromising conditions progress to active TB more quickly, and are more likely to
have serious outcomes. For example, HIV-infected persons develop active TB 50 times faster than individuals
without HIV2. Without proper treatment, up to 90% of HIV-positive persons with TB will die within months of
TB infection2. Consequently, identifying persons with HIV and TB coinfection is critical.
Active TB can be difficult to diagnose and treatment requires months of therapy. Although TB most commonly
involves the lungs, it can infect any organ of the body. Active TB generally causes significant symptoms including night sweats, unexplained weight loss, fever, and chills. Without treatment, an estimated 60—70% of persons with active TB would die of this curable disease within a few years3.

 Annual Tuberculosis Surveillance Report, 2008

Cook County Department of Public Health

Persons diagnosed with active TB are required to limit contact with others until they are no longer infectious and to
follow an intensive antibiotic regimen lasting at least 6 months. Patients with active TB must adhere strictly to the
prescribed treatment regimen in order to avoid the development of drug-resistant strains of TB. If a person develops drug-resistant (MDR) TB or acquires MRR-TB, therapy can take 18 months or longer, and drug regimens often require the use of more toxic antibiotics to treat TB effectively.
To ensure successful completion of the treatment regimen, and to minimize the prospect of drug-resistant TB, field
staff from the CCDPH TB Control and Prevention Program watch persons with active TB take each dose of medication. This process is called directly observed therapy (DOT) and is a cornerstone of modern TB control and prevention. DOT is labor and resource intensive—and highly effective in curing TB.
Tuberculosis, a Global Challenge With Local Consequences
Through aggressive TB case identification, effective treatment, and contact tracing efforts, transmission of TB
within suburban Cook County has been largely controlled, mirroring national trends. But the control of TB
requires a sustained commitment to screening and treatment of persons with LTBI. The majority of TB cases
(66%) in 2008 were in persons born outside of the United States, many immigrating from many areas of the world
where TB is common. These individuals, like most persons infected with TB, likely had LTBI which became active after they immigrated to the United States.
The World Health Organization estimates that one-third of the world’s population, some 2 billion persons,
currently have LTBI. Among this group, more than 9 million will develop active TB disease each year, and nearly
2 million, or 4,500 people per day, will die. The speed with which individuals can traverse the globe, together with
dynamic immigration patterns to suburban Cook County, means that persons at risk of having LTBI are likely to
reside within CCDPH jurisdiction. Screening programs targeting these high risk populations can identify LTBI, a
condition which can be treated before it progresses to active TB disease.
During 2008, in addition to responding to identified cases of active TB, the CCDPH TB Prevention and Control
Program utilized surveillance data to assist healthcare providers, schools, and other key partners to ensure that
those most at risk of LTBI were screened. This critical step, as part of a strong, sustained private and public effort,
is expected to prevent the development of active TB disease and greatly reduce the risk of potential transmission
within the community.

IMPORTANT TRENDS, 2008
TB Case Rates
In 2008, 100 newly active cases of tuberculosis (TB) were identified in suburban Cook County. This represents a
28% decrease in the number of cases reported in 2007 (n=139). The rate of active TB disease in suburban Cook
County in 2008 was 3.9 per 100,000 population, compared to 7.4 per 100,000 population in the City of Chicago.
Place of Birth
Since 2000, the majority of TB cases in suburban Cook County occurred in persons born outside of the United
States, in areas where TB is more common. In 2008, 66 (66%) of all TB cases were foreign-born. Countries ranking highest on the list of persons with TB in 2008 include the Philippines (n=16), Mexico (n=11), and India
(n=10).
Race/Ethnicity
There are marked differences in race/ethnicity by birthplace. In 2008, 76% of foreign-born TB cases were either
Asian/Pacific Islanders or Hispanic or Latino. Among U.S.-born cases, 88% were either non-Hispanic white or
non-Hispanic black. Among foreign-born TB cases in 2008, 56% were from Asia or the Pacific Islands and 20%
were Hispanic or Latino; foreign-born non-Hispanic blacks and whites represented just 16% and 6%, respectively
of reported TB cases. Among U.S.-born TB cases in 2008, 59% were non-Hispanic white and 29% were nonHispanic black. Only 12% of U.S.-born cases were Hispanic. There were no U.S.-born TB cases of Asian descent
in 2008.
Age
Forty (40%) TB cases were aged 24-44 years in 2008; 30 (30%) were 45-64 years, and 22 (22%) were 65 years and
older.
TB and HIV/AIDS Coinfection
The proportion of TB cases tested for HIV increased from 25% in 2000 to 89% in 2008. Of the 89 persons tested
for HIV, 8 (9%) were HIV positive.
Multidrug-Resistant (MDR-TB) and Extensively Drug-Resistant (XDR-TB) Tuberculosis*
Since 1999, suburban Cook County has averaged 1-2 multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases each year. In 2008,
there were no MDR-TB cases reported. Through 2008, there have been no cases of extensively drug-resistant TB
(XDR-TB) reported in suburban Cook County.
Site of Disease
Sixty-seven (67%) of all TB cases reported were pulmonary cases, 28 (28%) had extrapulmonary involvement, and
5 (5%) had both pulmonary and extrapulmonary involvement. These proportions have been consistent for the past
10 years.
Number of TB Cases and Case Rates by Municipality, 2008
A total of 52 TB cases (52%) lived in the North District during 2008. The North District represents approximately
44% of the general population of suburban Cook County, indicating a slightly larger than expected number of TB
cases. Four of the top six municipalities with the largest number of TB cases were located in the North District:
Evanston (n=6), Skokie (n=6), Des Plaines (n=5), and Morton Grove (n=5).

*Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is defined as TB resistant at least to isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF). MDR TB treatment requires the
use of second-line drugs that are less effective, more toxic, and more costly than first-line regimens. Extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) is
defined as resistance to INH, RIF, at least one fluoroquinolone and at least one of the injectable drugs (i.e., amakacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).
