Project Evaluation:

• Projects evaluated in accordance with the
Statewide CMAQ Policy and criteria
• Regional Priority is the only criteria NOACA has
the ability to control
• Staff requested the Planning and Programming
Committee to recommend an approach for the
assignment of points to four projects (10, 7, 4
and 2)
• Committee recommended that points be applied
strategically by staff to maximize CMAQ funding
to the region
5-59

following projects:

•

Regional Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (10 points)
