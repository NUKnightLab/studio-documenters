PROPOSED ORDINANCE

Gender Identity Amendment to the

WHEREAS, Cook County seeks to protect its citizens in the enjoyment of civi l rights and to promote
mutual understanding and respect among all who live and work within the County; and
WHEREAS, discrimination, prejudice, intolerance and bigotry directly and profoundly threaten the ri ghts
and freedom of Cook County residents; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has passed ordinances to protect the civil rights of those who live and work
within the County, including the prohibition of discrimination based on sex; and
WHEREAS, despite these protections, there are sti ll citizens who are denied their civil rights because
their gender identity, appearance or behavior differs from that traditionally associated with their sex at
birth; and
WHEREAS, gender-based discrimination often leads to loss of employ ment, housing and refusal of
services in public accommodations.
NOW, THEREFORE, in order to protect these citizens, the Cook County Board of Commissioners
proposes that the term "gender identity," as defined, be added as an amendment to the Cook County
Human Rights Ordinance (Ordinance No. 93-0-13, approved and adopted March 16, 1993).
FURTHERMORE, it is proposed that various sections of Ordinance No. 93-0-13, the Cook County
Human Rights Ordinance, be amended as follows:

that "a County which has a Chief Executive Officer elected by the electors of the County ... [is] a Horne
Rule Unit"' and the County of Cook, Illinois (the "County"), has a Chief Executive Officer elected by the
electors of the County and is therefore a Horne Rule Uni t and may, under the powers granted by said
Section 6(a) of Article VII of said Constitution of 1970, exercise any power and perform any function
pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, and discrimination occasioned thereby threaten the
rights and proper privileges of the County's inhabitants and menace the institutions and foundation of a
free and democratic society; and

color, sex, age, re lig ion, di sability, national origi n, ancestry, sexual orientation, marital status, parental

set forth herein on a county-wide basis.
BE IT AND IT IS HEREBY ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Comm issioners, AN

RESOLUTION

Whereas, Public Act 92-0521 was signed into law on February 8, 2002, and amends 705 ILCS
I 05/27.2a, wherein the General Assembly established the minimum and maximum amount of the fees to

establish and fix the fees to be charged and collected by the Clerk of the Circuit Court; and

increasing costs associated with the operation of the judicial system , calling upon ever increasing property
tax subsidies being required to fund the operations of the judicial system; and

last resort to cover the costs of governmental services and that wherever possible and authorized by law,
services should be paid for by fees charged to the service users.
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the fees to
be charged and collected by the Clerk of the C ircuit Court of Cook County shall be increased as provided
by Public Act 92-0521 in accordance with the following:

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDI NGS FOR NOVEMBER 7, 2002

2. 252593 CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT, Dorothy Brown, transmitting a Communication, dated
June I 0, 2002:
SUBJECT: FISCAL YEAR 2001 INDEPENDENT AUDIT REPORT AND ITS RELATED
MEMORANDUM ON INTERNAL CONTROLS
Please find the Fiscal Year 2001 Independent Audit Report and its related Memorandum on
Internal Controls for the Office of the C lerk of the Circuit Court. Please accept these reports
and refer them to the Cook County Audit Committee for the appropriate review.

Referred to the Audit Committee on June 18, 2002.
Deferred on June 25, 2002 until members receive complete information.
For the record, Chairman Daley stated the Clerk of the C ircuit Court's Office had submitted a letter, dated
October 9, 2002, responding to questions on the Fiscal Year 2001 Memorandum on Internal Control.
(The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the status of legal questions from the C lerk of
the C ircuit Court to the State's Attorney on the NSF checks, John Morales stated on June I, 2002 the
Clerk had received the State's Attorney's legal opinion regarding NSF checks, and the Office intended to
write-off the balance.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on the write-off balance, Mr. Morales explained the
office had gone back I 0 years to review all NSF checks and at the end of the 200 I fiscal year accounting
period, the initial write-off balance was found to be $1.75 mi llion. He estimated the final NSF write-off
balance would be in the range of$1.75 to $1.8 million.
Commissioner Lechowicz said that s ubmitting this issue at the last meeting of the 2002 fi scal year may
conflict with the upcoming 2003 fi scal year budget process and suggested that Mr. Morales inform Clerk
Brown of this concern in order to get the item on the Board's November 7 meeting agenda.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the type of funds statutorily held by the Clerk
of the Circuit Court, Mr. Morales explained the report references funds that are depos its or items ordered
by the Court to be held until a case is disposed .
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on what happens to the earnings on such funds, Mr.
Morales stated all earnings are turned over to the Comptroller.
In response to Commissioner Goslin 's question regarding if the C lerk's Office had addressed the audit
finding relating to the statutorily held funds with Chief Judge Evans, Mr. Morales stated a meeting with
the Chief Judge had not yet been schedu led on the s ubject since the office is still trying to get a complete
accounting of these funds.
On the same subject, Commissioner Hansen asked for a target date for resolving the matter. Mr. Morales
stated he couldn't give a date but reiterated the Clerk has dedicated staff worki ng diligently on this project
to gather what will be necessary to have a producti ve meeting with the Chief Judge, and move toward the
adjudication of these cases and come to a resolution of this issue as soon as possible.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to receive and file Item No. 2,
Communication 252593. The motion carried.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 7, 2002

3. 253678 MEMORANDUM ON INTERNAL CONTROL. Transmitting a Communication, dated July
5, 2002 from Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Finance:
SUBJECT: COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS - MEMORANDUM ON INTERNAL CONTROL
STRUCTURE FOR FlSCAL YEAR ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 200 I
Submitting herewith a copy of the County's " Memorandum on Internal Control " prepared by
Arthur Andersen for the period end ing November 30, 200 I. I am hereby requesting that this
item be referred to the Audit Committee of the Board of Commissioners for further
discussion.

Referred to the Audit Committee on August 1, 2002.
Commissioner Lechowicz requested an updated status report with target dates for all outstanding findings .
Commissioner Lechowicz stressed his particular concern with the lack of compliance on the Taxpayer
Interest Assurance Ordinance.
Laura Burman stated she would review the report and send letters out to each office requesting an update
on the status of audit recommendations not completed to date. Commissioner Lechowicz requested that
responses be sent to President Stroger and the Chairman of the Finance Comm ittee, as well as to members
of the Audit Committee.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the recommendation on page 2 and the dollar
amount for an investment in training for financial repo1ting, Torn Glaser stated he wasn't sure what the
outside auditor was referring to by 'adj ustments for training' but said he did not believe additional staff or
investment in training was necessary at this time to meet the new GASB 34 requirements.
Commissioner Lechowicz stated it would be helpful for all Commissioners to understand the County's
financial reporting requirements better and as ked Mr. Glaser to briefly explain GASB 34. Torn Glaser
explained the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) recently passed a new reporting
requirement, known as GASB 34, mandating government units to identify and depreciate fixed assets. He
also noted the new rule made changes in the reporting format requiring discussion and analysis from
management.
Commissioner Lechowicz requested a brief overview of GASB from Torn Glaser, to each member of the
Board, including the financial reporting rules mandated under GASB and any budgetary issues the Board
should be aware of relating to the FMIS system's financial repo1ts and/or statements and full compliance
with new GASB 34 requirements.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on the status of the bank reconciliation and
col lateralization of deposits in the Department of Animal Control, Dr. Parmer stated this recommendation
has been completed. He said his department worked with the Bureau of Finance to have this done by
computer.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding a target date for monthly reconciliation of the
C-fund general ledger between the Comptrollers and Treasurer's Office, Tom Glaser stated the Bureau of
Finance will assume responsibility and will be reconciling on a monthly basis by the first quarter of FY
2003.
Chairman Daley noted the Treasurer's Office had submitted a response for the record on this issue. (The
referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County C lerk.)

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 7, 2002

In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on the status of a county-wide issued vehicle fuel card
policy, Tom Glaser stated the policy is in final review with the Administration and he hoped to move it
forward by December I, 2002.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on the status of the recommendation on page I0
pertaining to a FMIS system security policy for terminating employees and/or consultants, Tom Glaser
stated this had been completed.
On the same issue, Chairman Daley called on the Chief Information Officer to comment. Cathy MarasO'Leary stated for security reasons a form was developed when access to the JD Edwards FMIS system is
needed for the purpose of removing terminated employees and/or consultants who end their service to the
county. This form is to be completed by the county official or department supervisor and submitted to her
office.
Commissioner Lechowicz commented on the FMIS computer system and asked Ms. Maras-O'Leary if she
had the ability to generate an employees position report for the various county agencies showing the
number filled, on leave/disability, and vacant positions with the corresponding grades, since he felt this
information would be useful to have during the upcoming budget meetings. Ms. O'Leary stated she
already generates an open positions report and provides it weekly to the Comptroller.
Chairman Daley called on the Comptroller to comment on the issue. John Chambers stated the open
positions report is currently used as a second reference and is not distributed because there is still a lag
time with the payroll report. He expla:ined there are two systems still operating due to the fact that not all
department are 'live' on the FMIS system. He stated once the systems are consolidated this information
can be verified as accurate in a more timely manner.
Commissioner Lechowicz stated he understood there may be some mistakes due to the overlapping
systems, but noted this couldn't be an impossible task since the Comptroller for the State of Illinois gives
leadership similar reports every two months.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on the cost of the off-site data center, Ms. Maras-O'Leary
stated she had requested $4 million in the 2003 budget; but stipulated this figure did not include the cost
of interfacing with the off-site center. She said the initial estimate was $8 million and as the county
moves forward with the automation the actual figure may be closer to $12 million.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding what is considered a reasonable distance for an
off-site location, Ms. Maras-O'Leary stated 25 miles. He asked if this review was based on similar sized
counties. She informed him that her office had lengthy discussions with DuPage County and was in the
process of reviewing Fairfax County's plan.
Commissioner Hansen recommended she contact NACo for some assistance. On the same point,
Commissioner Lechowicz recommended she contact the Illinois Department of Central Management
Services, and the Beckman Institute at the University of Illinois in Champaign Urbana to work towards an
intergovernmental agreement for Cook County's back-up needs, as well as technical and financial
assistance in this area. Ms. Maras-O'Leary stated she would follow-up on these recommendations.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the Treasurer's response on page 19 and if an
opinion from the State's Attorney on the adoption of a countywide investment policy had been received,
Tom Glaser stated he forgot to ask for such an opinion but would do so immediately and get back to the
committee with the response.

Statements, re lated Management Letter and request for Bad Debt write-off for fi scal year
200 1 be forwarded to the Audit Committee of the Board of Commissioners for discussion.

Referred to the Audit Committee on August l, 2002.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on the total dollar figure of the bad debt write-off and a
breakdown by category or pay ment type, Alvin Holly stated all the accounts transferred and
recommended for bad debt w rite-off status were individual (mostly indigent), self pay accounts where all
means had been exhausted to collect payment.
In response to Commissioner Hansen question regard ing what percentage of the $627 million total
revenue did the bad debt represent, Mr. Holly stated the $186 million total write-off represented
approximately 30% of total third party patient revenue.
Commissioner Lechowicz commented that in the future it wou ld be helpful to members if the aud itor
could include a summary breakdown of revenue sources w ith the financial statements, citing as an
example a letter from Ruth Rothstein, dated July 22, 2002.

Cook County Law Library Fund - Financial Report dated July 24, 2002 for year ended
November 30, 2000.

Submitted to the Audit Committee on September 30, 2002.
Commissioner Hansen asked for comment on what is being done to reconcile the Law Library's continued
$2 million deficit. Bennie Martin stated he had been working with the President's Office and Bureau of
Administration to reconcile the problem. He noted that several attempts over the years had been made, in
partnership with the Metro Counties Association, to raise the statutory $10 maximum fee but the
legislation failed to pass. Mr. Martin said the library has tried to control its internal expenses, but has
found the cost of providing the service has risen greater than revenues.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the amount of increase necessary in the filing
fee to break even, Mr. Martin stated a $10 increase would be needed.
Commissioner Hansen asked for an observation from the State's Attorney in tenns of the Board's
authority to increase the fee and if other counties are faced with a similar problem. Pat Driscoll stated
since these fees are part of the court system and are set by Illinois statutes, legislation would have to be
submitted with an argument for the need to increase the fee by $10 and approved by the State legis lature.
In terms of other counties, Mr. Driscoll stated that not all counties have a law library. He stated he had
not researched this issue, but believed other counties of similar size such as Los Angeles County cannot
be easily compared since it has a centralized library data system.
Commissioner Hansen asked if further research and recommendations could be done on this issue.
Chairman Daley agreed that the question of increasing the fee should be discussed with legislative
leade rs, as well as the possibility of reviewing services provided by the law library at its various court
branches.
Chairman Daley asked that these issues be discussed with the President's Office and a recommendation be
made to the Board for consideration during the budgetary process.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved to receive and file Item No. 6.

Department of Revenue - Motor Vehicle Sticker Fee Account Financial Report dated July 2,
2002 for the year ended December 31, 2000.

Submitted to the Audit Committee on September 30, 2002.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page 5 regarding the timely issuance of motor vehicle
stickers, Barb Bruno stated this was the most difficult revenue source to collect and enforce. She said the
mailing goes out in May to coincide with the Secretary of State's car sales and rental reports. She noted
last year her office collected $750,000 and was reluctant to change the mailing date because of the
possible loss of revenue. However, she stated she can try and see what happens.
In response to Chainnan Daley's question regarding if the Department of Revenue has spoken to the
Sheriffs Office in terms of enforcement of vehicle stickers, Ms. Bruno stated she had, and the Sheriffs
Police issue tickets to non-compliant motorists.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to receive and file Item No. 8.

Commissioner Lechowicz commented that this department is usually a revenue generating office and in
the past he had never seen a reduction in revenues. He asked ifthere was a reason for the decrease in the
200 I receipts, noting that the fingerprinting and all other fees remained the same. He also asked what the
$24,000 new special event revenue represented?
Chairman Daley noted that the Deputy Liquor Commissioner was not present and asked Laura Burman to

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Environmental Control of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant
to notice on Monday, October 21, 2002 at the hour of 11 :00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County

upon adoption of this report, the

AN ORDINANCE DIRECTING COOK COUNTY TO ADOPT LEADERSHIP IN
ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN (LEED) GREEN BUILDING RATING
SYSTEM FOR ALL NEWLY CONSTRUCTED COUNTY FACILITIES (PROPOSED
ORDINANCE). Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by Mike Quigley, County
Commissioner; Co-Sponsored by William R. Moran and Herbert T. Schumann, County
Commissioners:
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance:
PROPOSED ORDINANCE

WHEREAS, the United States Green Building Counci l (USGBC), a non-profit, nationally
recogni zed association with membership representing all segments of the building industry,
including architects, manufacturers, government agencies, and environmentalists, has created
LEED, a green building rating system that provides specific principles and practices, some
mandatory but the majority discretionary, that may be applied during the design,
construction, and operation phases, which enable the building to be awarded points from
reaching preset standards of environmental efficiency so that it may achieve LEED
certification from the USGBC as a "green" building; and

3725

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 7, 2002

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED,
I.

That Cook County does hereby order all of its newly constructed buildings to employ
the LEED Green Building Rating System, Version 2.0, throughout their design,
construction, and operation and does further order that each new building must achieve
the LEED silver level of certification.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,
II.

That the USGBC intends to release a revised version of the LEED Green Building
Rating System every three years; and with this in consideration when beginning a new
building project, Cook County shall refer to the most current version of the LEED in
existence; and after registering with the USG BC at the design stage of the project as is
required, the County may adhere to that existing version until completion of the project,
regardless of any new LEED version that may be released at a later time.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,
III.

That with specific regard to the LEED Energy and Atmosphere category, because
achieving increasing levels of energy performance above the set energy code standards
is the surest way of realizing significant operational cost savings, all buildings must
obtain a total of at least eight points.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,
IV.

That Cook County also encourages the application of LEED principles during retrofit
and renovation projects of its current standing structures whenever it is practicable.

NOTE: This matter was also referred to the Committee on Construction. (See Comm. No.
241445).
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Schumann, moved to accept the Substitute
Ordinance (Communication No. 241446). The motion carried.

Proposed Ordinance sponsored by Mike Quigley, County Commissioner; Co-Sponsored by William
R. Moran, Herbert T. Schumann, Bobbie L. Steele, Deborah Sims, Joseph Mario Moreno, Peter N.
Silvestri, County Commissioners.
WHEREAS, buildings consume 30% of the total energy and 60% of electricity generated in the United
States; and
WHEREAS, the planning, design, construction, and operation of Cook County's buildings, facilities and
leaseholds should have a significant positive effect on the County's sustainability. Cook County shall
promote resource-efficient design of new County facilities in order to increase their efficiency, save
financial resources, and reduce the negative environmental impact of demolition, construction, and
operation of buildings; and

3726

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 7, 2002

WHEREAS, Cook County's design and building decisions impact the prudent use of the County's
energy and water supplies, the cost of remediating hazardous materials conditions, the health and
productivity of its employees, transportation choices of County employees and visitors of County
facilities, as well as the rate at which the County's landfill capacity is depleted; and
WHEREAS, the lack of adequate areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials is a significant
impediment to diverting solid waste and creates an urgent need for governmental bodies to address space
allocation for solid waste source reduction, recycling, and composting activities; and
WHEREAS, many federal, state, and municipal governmental bodies have recognized the positive role
they can play in helping to establish a market for environmentally-preferable design and construction
materials by promulgating green building ordinances and guidelines; and
WHEREAS, thoughtful planning and design decisions made by the County in the construction and
remodeling of its facilities and leaseholds can result in a significant cost savings to the County over the
life of such facilities and leaseholds; and
WHEREAS, buildings with good overall environmental quality, including effective ventilation, good
indoor air quality, proper lighting, and appropriate acoustics, can increase worker productivity by six to
16 percent' ; and
WHEREAS, the United States Green Building Counci l (USGBC) a non-profit, nationally recognized
association with membership representing all segments of the building industry, including architects,
manufacturers, government agencies, and environmentalists, has created Leadership m Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED); and
WHEREAS, LEED is a green building rating system that provides specific principles and practices,
some mandatory but the majority discretionary, that may be applied during the design, construction, and
operation phases, which enable the building to be awarded points from reaching preset standards of
environmental efficiency so that it may achieve LEED certification from the USGBC as a "green"
building; and
WHEREAS, LEED is recognized nation-wide by public and private sectors alike as a credible and viable
guide for realizing the goal of a sustainable, energy efficient building that achieves significant cost
savings over its lifespan; and
WHEREAS, the cities of Seattle and Austin have adopted ordinances that require their government
buildings to meet LEED standards for certification; and
WHEREAS, our Armed Forces recognize the need for sustainable building design, as evidenced in the
recent construction of the Bachelor Enlisted Quarters at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center in
Waukegan, Illinois, the first building in the area designated a LEED building by the USG BC; and
WHEREAS, in adopting the requirements set forth in this legi slation, the Board of Commissioners
recognizes that the substantial long-term economic, health and environmental benefits to the citizens of
Cook County realized through the use of green design strategies justifies the possibility of initial
increased capital expenditures; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 7, 2002

WHEREAS, LEED is based on accepted environmental and energy principles, is divided into five key
categories, is comprehensive in scope, supported with well-coordinated resources, and clearly describes
the intent, requirements, and suggested technologies and strategies to apply for each credit available; and
WHEREAS, LEED ensures that through all stages of a new Cook County building's lifecycle: design,
construction, and operation, the building will have a less negative impact on the environment and a more
positive impact on the health and productivity of its workers as well as the financial strength of the
County;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED ORDAINED,
That Cook County does hereby order the Department of Capital Planning and Policy to take the steps
necessary to assure that all ef--its newly constructed buildings and all buildings scheduled for capital
improvement are designed, built, and operated in accordance with the standards and requirements of te
employ the LEED Green Building Rating System, Version 2.0, throughout tl'leir desigR, coRstruetioR, and
operatioR and does further order that each new building must aehieve meet the requirements for the LEED
silver level of certification.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED ORDAINED,
That the USG BC intends to release a revised version of the LEED Green Building Rating System every
three years; and ·with this eoRsideratioR wl'leR begim1iRg a Rew buildiRg project, Cook County shall refer
to the most current version of the LEED when beginning a new building construction project or

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED ORDAINED,
Ill.
That with specific regard to the LEED Energy and Atmosphere category, because achieving

significant operational cost savings, all buildings mH5t shall set a goal to obtain a total of at least eight
points in this category.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED ORDAINED,
IV.
That Cook County also orders that LEED Existing Building rating system be used eReourages the
applicatioR of LEED priRciples during retrofit and reRovation projects of its current standing structures
whenever it is practicable and does further order that each reRoYated retrofitted building shall meet the
requirements for LEED certification for Existing Buildings.
Chairman Moreno asked a representative from the office of Capital Planning to speak on the proposed
ordinance.
Elizabeth Melas, Deputy Director of Capital Planning and Policy, said that the Office of Capital Planning
and Policy has recommended minor changes to the ordinance, and that this is the first time the department
has set out to achieve green construction. She stated that they are working toward making the new
Domestic Violence Court a green building. She said that they expect a small initial cost, which should be
offset by operational savings in energy efficiency and in other areas.
Public Testimony
Helen J. Kessler, AJA and Executive Vice President, Sieben Energy Associates, stated that the U.S. Green
Business Counsel put together the LEED rating system. She said the LEED system covers the areas of
site design, water efficiency, energy efficiency, materials, resources and indoor environmental quality.
She stated that LEED des igned buildings have greater comfort and result in greater productivity on behalf
of the workers. She further commented that it is possible to achieve a 20% to 30% energy savings using
LEED system s that are a little atypical but yield lifecycle cost savings.

3728

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 7, 2002

Chairman Moreno asked what the fiscal impact would be for the County. He also asked whether Ms.
Kessler could go into detail about the 20% to 30% energy savings.
Ms. Kessler stated that up fro nt a LEED system could be more cost-intensive for the County in design
term s, but that it would cost the County less in terms of lifecycle. She stated fu rther that the Illinois
Clean Energy Community Foundation provides funding to not fo r profits--the County would be a
candidate--to support energy efficient design that could mitigate the up front costs.
Commi ssioner Quigley noted that there is an innovative and creative green technology site that the C ity of
Chicago built on the West Side. He stated also that Mr. Lamont and the Capital Planning and Policy
department have taken the initiative in designing the Domestic Violence Courthouse in accordance with
LEED design, and should be commended fo r the resulting better health of those who will use the facility,
for the environmental benefits and for moving toward a sustainable city. He stated that the attorney has
also developed green design standards for new police stations and libraries.
Commissioner Schumann noted that it could be more expensive to retrofit buildings than to bui ld new
construction. He inquired what the break-even point typically is on LEED designed bui ldings.
Ms. Kessler responded that if enough investment is put into the design end of the process, the savings
could be immediate. There needs to be, however, a change in how the process occurs, with more work
put in at the beginning.
Commi ssioner Schumann inquired if immediate savings in energy could offset the upfront design costs.
Ms. Kessler responded, yes, this is possibl e. She stated that, for example, with reference to cooli ng
systems, we are dealing with incremental costs, which are very small. And while the capital costs of a
fuel-efficient cooling system are higher than the capital costs of a less fuel-efficient cooling system, these
costs can be offset very quickly.
Mr. William Kosik, Director of Engineering, O WP/ P, and a LEED accredited professional, stated that
there are 2 categories of the LEED requirements/rating system, one that deals with energy and atmosphere
and the other that deals with indoor environmental qualities. He stated that the requirements guide design
professionals, especially the many with no experience designing green buildings. He stated that the U.S.
Green Building Council supports designers and owners and have many case studies and also are willing
to provide interpretations for the materia ls. He furt her stated that while the rating system is above and
beyond code it is not far-fetched. He stated that one example of a green guideline is the Ashray Energy
Standard wh ich the C ity of Chicago recently adopted as part of their energy code. He commented that
there are some upfront construction costs incurred , but employee comfort is achieved and there are longterm operational savings. He stated that another example of a LEED certified building is the new
Chicago police station prototype which OWP/P is worki ng on ; early estim ates are a 5% to 7% extra cost
for green/ LEED design.
Chairman Moreno referred to a building on Sacramento Street in Chicago where the renovation was
budgeted at 20% fo r LEED design. He as ked whether it is less expensive for new LEED construction
than for LEED renovation of a new building?
Mr. Kosik stated that renovation will ty pically be more expensive. He stated also that the buildi ng to
which Commissioner Moreno referred, aggressively went after energy-savings and that 20% is on the
higher end of what you would typically see.

3729

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 7, 2002

Commissioner Moreno asked whether the recapture of costs would occur sooner on a green-designed
building than on a green-renovated building:
Mr. Kosik replied yes.
Mr. Moreno asked that all the commissioners be listed as co-sponsors of the ordinance.
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved approval of the substitute
ordinance. The motion carried.
