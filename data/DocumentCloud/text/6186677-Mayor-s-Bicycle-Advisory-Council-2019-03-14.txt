NEW ORDINANCE PROPOSED

Low Speed Electric Bikes

-and-

Low Speed Electric Mobility Devices

INTRODUCED TO CITY COUNCIL WED 3/13/19
Purpose

• Generally adopts the State code definitions for three standard classes of ebikes into the MCC
• Establishes a definition for low-speed electric mobility devices (LEMD) that
includes a variety of devices (e.g., electric scooters) observed to be in use
currently, and potentially new devices that may be introduced soon.
• Provides clarity that e-bikes and LEMDs are legal transportation options
within the Chicago Municipal Code.
• Allows the use of these transportation modes within appropriately
designated roadway spaces based primarily upon considerations of size
and speed capabilities.

 THIS ORDINANCE DOES NOT:
• Impact the operation/regulations of motorized wheelchairs or
other personal assistive devices
• Impact where or how a traditional bicycle can be ridden
• Enact a speed limit within bike lanes or for e-bikes/LEMDs
• Allow companies to rent dockless scooters to the public
