PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REQUESTING A HEARING OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION COMMITTEE
TO DISCUSS THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF VOLUNTARY REMOTE COURT
APPEARANCES
WHEREAS, audio and video appearances in courtrooms offer an enormous potential for savings,
revenue generation, environmental benefits, improved safety and remote access to justice which promotes
the administration of justice and equity in the courtroom; and
WHEREAS, remote court appearances allow attorneys and the public to appear in court for routine
matters involving Civil, Criminal, Family, Probate, Mental Health, Traffic, Juvenile, Bankruptcy and other
proceedings without leaving their homes or offices; and
WHEREAS, in 2016, In its Call to Action: Achieving Civil Justice for All, the Conference of Chief
Justices’ Civil Justice Improvement Committee set forth a convincing series of findings and
recommendations, which among them was the promotion of remote audio and video services for court
hearings and management; and
WHEREAS, the Center for Legal and Court Technology, a non-profit research organization that
improves the administration of Justice through the use of technology, progressively encourages the
utilization of remote and video court appearances throughout the United States to enhance the efficiency
of judicial administration and court proceedings for both attorney’s and the public; and
WHEREAS, in 1992, the Supreme Court of Illinois adopted rule 185 to allow for telephonic appearances
in certain civil proceedings; and in 2017, the Supreme Court of Illinois amended its rules to also allow for
remote video conferences; and
WHEREAS, in Los Angeles Superior Court a system with approximately 494 judicial officers and
comparable to the Cook County Circuit Court, over 200 of those judicial officers allow for remote court
appearances with a volume of over 83,000 appearances in 2018; moreover, approximately $4.6 million in
revenue over a three-year period attributable to remote court appearances in Los Angeles was generated;
and
WHEREAS, in Illinois, approximately 20 counties spread over 12 Judicial Circuits utilize some form of
audio and video remote appearances with approximately 4,516 remote appearance being completed in

NOTICE AND AGENDA

DuPage County 1,379 since 9/2014, the 19th Judicial Circuit - Lake County 1,456 since 6/2016 and the
22nd Judicial Circuit - McHenry County 2,280 since 4/2014; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has been and continues to be a leader in technology through strategic
Countywide initiatives and collaboration with elected offices; thus, our existing applications and resources
will allow for a seamless integration of our existing technology platforms with audio and video remote
appearances; and
WHEREAS, the use of video and audio remote court appearances has the potential to offer key benefits
to the public, such as cost savings on attorney fees for lower-income citizens, increasing pro bono
assistance, availability of court interpreters, travel costs and work absences associated with attending a
court hearing can deter self-represented litigants from effectively pursuing or defending their legal rights,
thereby further promoting access to justice in courts.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby request a hearing of the Technology and Innovation Committee be convened to review and discuss
the potential feasibility, application, and access to justice that remote court appearances may have in Cook
County courtrooms; and
