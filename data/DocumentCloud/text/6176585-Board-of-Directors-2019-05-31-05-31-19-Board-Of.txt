From: James Kiamos, Chief Executive Officer, Managed Care
Re: 12-Month Purchase of Reinsurance for CountyCare Health Plan (01/01l-12/31/2019)

On April 26, 2019, the Cook County Health Board of Directors approved a request for payment for
reinsurance for the CountyCare Health Plan. After further review and negotiations, amendments
are needed for that request as indicated below, and are being presented for the Board?s
consideration.

Since the inception of CountyCare, Cook CountyHealth (CCH) has purchased reinsurance to
offset the risk of its high-cost members. Initially, reinsurance was focused only on members who
received transplant services. Beginning in 2015, general stop-loss reinsurance was secured with a
threshold of $750,000 per member. Claims costs incurred in excess of that amount are reimbursed
to CCH. Coverage is priced on a PMPM basis by population type (eg. FHP, SPD, ACA Adults).

The CCH policy is issued under a County-wide insurance brokerage contract with Alliance
Insurance Services, managed by the County?s Of?ce of Risk Management.

CCH recommends entering a stop-loss policy coverage for twelve mon -

2019. Based on the bids submitted, and pricing and risk analysis, the -
increase the per member reinsurance deductible from $750,000 to ..
Terms will include:

. $4?,999?999 $2,000,000 per member deductible

   
 

. Costs are calculated at 100% of Medicaid for non-CCH provider .

 

 

(comparable to standard Medicaid rates) for services provided .
. Blood factor products, blood derivatives and anti-inhibitor coagulant complex excluded for
certain members

 

This memo requests the Board's approval of payment not to exceed $375747299 51 ,092,000 for the
purchase of re-insurance as described above for CountyCare members. The coverage will be
provided by Sequoia, as placed by Alliance Insurance Services, the County?s insurance broker.

 JOHN JAY SHANNON, MD
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
COOK COUNTY HEALTH
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
May 31, 2019
Employee Recognition
For the past 18 months, the Cook County Health dialysis unit has had zero vascular access infections. Despite very high
volumes with a large number of high-risk patients, the staff was able to exceed the national benchmark. Congratulations
to the CCH dialysis staff Tavia Davis, Sinumon George, Annette Glenn, Elliot Isewede, Beena Jayamon, Kyung Sook Lee,
Diane Mensah, Justin Robinson, Kimberly Rodriquez, Eva Sacharczuk, Senu Thomas and infection control nurse Onofre
Donceras on this accomplishment by providing the safest and best possible care to patients.
Earlier this month, CCH celebrated Nurses Week by recognizing outstanding nurses and ancillary staff at its annual
Clinical Excellence Award Ceremony. Their hard work and commitment to caring for patients across the health system is
a testament to the mission of CCH. Nurses are the backbone of any health care organization. Congratulations to: Jisha
Abraham, Thressia Alexander, Norma Amaya, Celia DeVeyra, Margareth Douyon-Webb, Emma Edwards, Ruby
Flordeliza, Elizabeth Giron, Kandice Hightower, Marcelo Ma Nieves, Sharon Scott-Reed and Cristina Teruel.
CCH placed first and third in the poster presentations at the inaugural National Collaborative for Education to Address
the Social Determinants of Health conference this month. Dr. Melissa Palma, a CCH physician at the Logan Square
Health Center, came in 3rd for the Applying a Model of Culturally-Adapted Motivational Interviewing to the South Asian
Healthy Lifestyle Intervention study. Christine Haley, Director of Housing for CCH, won first place for Housing is Health:
Chicago and Cook County Flexible Housing Pool.
Activities and Announcements


On May 29th, Dr. Shannon and Jarrod Johnson, COO for Central Campus, hosted a breakfast the Chicago Health
Executives Forum. Dr. Shannon presented an overview of the health system to approximately 30 C-suite CHEF
members who also had an opportunity to tour the new Professional Building.



Cook County Health (CCH) has revised its Workplace Violence
policy that addresses the management of disruptive and abusive
patients, staff and visitors. In addition to setting the expectation
that staff will treat one another, as well as patients and visitors,
with dignity and respect, the policy emphasizes de-escalation
techniques when facing a disruptive or abusive patient or visitor;
requires all staff to complete annual training; and establishes
reporting requirements and the engagement of social workers and
requires reporting to CCH police, facility security and/or local law
enforcement in the event of any threat of violence. Posted notices
will be going up throughout the system indicating that verbal
aggression will not be tolerated and that physical aggression will be
prosecuted.

 

On May 23, 2019, the Intensive Care Unit at Provident Hospital reopened as part of the longer term plan to
deliver needed services and begin accepting ambulance runs later this year. Provident Hospital sees
approximately 30,000 ‘walk-in’ emergency room patients annually despite discontinuing ambulance service in
2011. At the same time, the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was closed.
IMPACT 2020 Objective 1.2



Cook County Health has launched the second phase of its marketing campaign to build the brand and reputation
of the organization. The tagline, Making
an Impact, allows CCH to highlight
patient care, social determinants of
health, research and more. The
campaign includes outdoor, transit and
digital marketing and will run in phases
over the next several months. The
current phase focuses on CCH’s work to
address the opioid crisis.
IMPACT 2020 Objective 1.4



CCH hosted its second Research & Innovation Summit titled Housing is Health on May 22, 2019. The afternoon
included several presentations from CCH leaders, a health provider panel, a policy panel as well as remarks from
Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. The highlight was the story told by Aloyce Hill, a CCH patient who
has benefitted from our programs. The white paper developed for the event is attached.
IMPACT Objective 6.3



On May 2nd, Cook County Health participated in the Chicago Healthcare System Coalition for Preparedness &
Response (CHSCPR) Annual Full-Scale Exercise. This year's scenario encompassed impacts and considerations
associated with a multi-hospital evacuation triggered by an imminent threat. All CCH facilities participated in the
drill. The Hospital Incident Command System was activated for the duration of the drill. The simulation identified a
number of strengths in our internal capacity as well as several opportunities for additional planning and
preparation including the transportation 2011of patients from one hospital to another, the proper handling of the
transfer of critically ill patients, and planning around emergency credentialing to ensure proper staffing.
IMPACT 2020 Objective 1.1

Food As Medicine Update


Through May 16, CCH’s Fresh Truck partnership with the Greater Chicago Food Depository (GCFD) has resulted
in 183 visits to 13 CCH health centers – Arlington Heights, Austin, Cicero, the CORE Center, Cottage Grove,
Englewood, Logan Square, Near South, Oak Forest, Provident/Sengstacke, Prieto, Robbins, and Woodlawn.
Collectively, the Fresh Truck distributions have resulted in the provision of fresh fruits and vegetables to 23,844
individuals, representing 79,103 household members, totaling more than 495,000 pounds of fresh produce.
Most of the individuals benefiting from the Fresh Truck screened positive for food insecurity at a CCH health
center visit.



The CCH Fresh Market schedule is listed below.
o Oak Forest Health Center on Wednesdays, 9am-2pm
o Robbins Health Center on Thursdays, 11am-3pm
o Cottage Grove Health Center on Fridays, 9am-2pm

 Legislative Update


State


At the May 23rd Cook County Board meeting President Preckwinkle and the Cook County Board sponsored a
resolution urging the Illinois General Assembly to support HB 2495, the Reproductive Health Act.

More than 7,000 bills and resolutions have been filed this session in the House and Senate. The House and
Senate have hours remaining before the end of the spring legislative session (May 31). The deadline for passing
most state legislation by a simple majority, including a budget, is midnight on May 31. Bills that do not meet this
deadline will require a 3/5th majority to pass.



On April 29, the Senate held a joint committee hearing of the Appropriations II – Subcommittee on Capital and
the Transportation – Subcommittee on Capital. This was the sixth statewide hearing on capital that the
committees convened. Cook County CFO Ammar Rizki presented on the County’s non-transportation related
requests, including CCH’s $50M request to support the modernization of five community health centers (Cottage
Grove, Englewood, Near South, Robbins, Prieto). Iliana Mora, CCH’s COO for Ambulatory Services attended the
hearing and shared written testimony with Senators and their staff. The last time Illinois passed a
comprehensive capital program that includes transportation and non-transportation funding was in 2009.



On May 17, Governor Pritzker announced “Rebuild Illinois”, a comprehensive statewide capital plan that
includes horizontal projects (roads, bridges, etc.) as well as vertical projects (schools, health care facilities, public
buildings, etc.). The plan would be paid for through a combination of bonding and new/increased taxes and fees.
Included in the plan is $440M for health care and human services projects including:
o $175M for affordable housing
o $50M for community health centers
o $200M for hospital and health center transformation
o $15M for human services grant programs



Following passage by the Senate in April, the House this week approved SJRCA1, which proposes to amend the
state constitution to allow for a graduated-income tax rate, instead of the current flax tax rate. The question will
now be placed on the November 2020 ballot for voter approval, which requires 60% of the “yes” votes OR a
simple majority of “yes” votes among all ballots cast.
Changing the state income tax structure from a flat tax to a graduated system is a major priority of the Pritzker
administration.



HA1 to SB1321 passed the House unanimously 116-0-0 on May 30th. The bill will help address challenges with
the state’s eligibility system and resulting delays in processing Medicaid applications and redeterminations. The
bill also seeks to improve the relationship between providers and Medicaid MCOs by requiring HFS to establish a
claims dispute resolution process, establishing policies and timelines for MCOs to update provider rosters, and
ensuring stakeholder engagement in efforts to improve MCO operations and further develop value-based
payment models.
CCH reviewed and provided input towards the Medicaid omnibus bill from its perspective as a health care
provider and a Medicaid managed care plan.



SB1739 was approved in the House by a vote of 116-0-0 and awaits concurrence by the Senate. The bill includes
language that no longer allows facility closures to be eligible for the CON exemption process, and instead
requires a permit for discontinuation from the IHFSRB. The bill also sets forth requirements for notification to
the public and elected officials about the proposed closure. This legislation was initiated by legislators as a result
of concerns with the regulatory approval process related to the proposed closure of Westlake Hospital.

 

Earlier this week, the House passed SB25, the Reproductive Health Act (RHA), by a vote of 64-50-4. The RHA
affirms individuals’ rights to make autonomous decisions about using or refusing reproductive health care and
ensures that abortion is not treated differently than other forms of medical care. The bill now awaits a Senate
concurrence vote. The RHA would take effect upon being signed into law.

Federal
 After a two-week Easter/Passover recess, Congress returned to Washington with a packed health policy agenda
for the month of May. While a deal to lift the statutory budget caps under the Budget Control Act of 2011
remained elusive, House appropriators moved ahead with their FY 2020 appropriations bills. Meanwhile the
committees of jurisdiction continued bi-partisan work on measures to reign in prescription drug prices.
Budget and Appropriations
 On May 21, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) hosted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate
Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) for negotiations
on the budget caps with the White House, represented by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Acting Chief of
Staff Mick Mulvaney. After huddling behind closed doors for most of the day they were unable to achieve a final
deal, although they reported that they were close to an agreement, which would lift the caps on defense and
domestic discretionary spending as well as potentially raise the debt ceiling.
The absence of an overarching budget deal has not stopped the House Appropriations Committee from readying
eight of the twelve annual appropriations bills for FY 2020, including the Labor-HHS-Education bill, which funds
the agencies in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
o The bill includes a total of $8.3 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is
$921 million above the 2019 enacted level and $1.7 billion above the President’s budget request. (Note
that this includes $854 million in transfers from the Prevention and Public Health Fund, amounting to
over ten percent of the agencies appropriation.)
o The bill would give the CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) $25 million each to conduct
research into firearm injury and mortality prevention.
o The bill funds the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) at $5.9 billion,
which is $115 million above the 2019 enacted level and $179 million above the President’s budget
request.
o The bill includes $7.6 billion for the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which is $475
million above the 2019 enacted level and $1.5 billion above the President’s budget request. This
includes increases for HRSA’s Community Health Center program and the Ryan White HIV/AIDS
programs as part of the President’s initiative to reduce new HIV infections by 90 percent in ten years.
The Senate is expected to begin working on appropriations in June, but leadership is wary of starting the process
without an agreement on the top-line numbers. The leaders of both parties in both chambers want to make a
deal and avoid another government shutdown, just as the 2020 election season is beginning to heat up.
Medicaid
 In late April and early May, Representatives Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and Pet Olson (R-Texas) circulated a “Dear
Colleague” letter Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy to move legislation that would delay the
scheduled $12 billion in cuts to Medicaid DSH over the next two years. 302 members of the House signed the
letter, including every member of Illinois’ Cook County delegation. We will continue collaborate with efforts like
this, to keep the issue front and center in Congress.
Of note for Medicaid policy, senior level turnover continues at CMS, with Chris Traylor, the director of the
Centers for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) announcing his departure at the end of May. Traylor had only
been in the position since January.

 Affordable Care Act and Prescription Drug Pricing
 On May 16, the House passed H.R. 986, the Strengthening Health Care and Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act.
The bill included bi-partisan measures which were reported out by the Judiciary Committee, designed to get
generic drugs to market faster and inhibit anticompetitive practices on the part of the drug companies. It also
included provisions by Democrats designed to shore up the Affordable Care Act, including:
o H.R. 1385, which would provide funding for states to establish their own individual and small group
marketplaces instead of using the Federal Marketplace.
o H.R. 1386, which would provide $100 million for Federal health navigators that provide assistance to
consumers in purchasing health insurance plans on the Federal Marketplace.
o H.R. 1010, which would prohibit the sale of short-term limited duration health insurance plans, which
are often limited in scope since they are not required to meet the minimum coverage requirements
prescribed in the ACA.
o H.R. 987, which would require HHS to conduct outreach and educational activities to promote health
insurance on the Federal Marketplace.
The House adopted several amendments during floor consideration, including two that would prohibit HHS
from:
o Prohibiting “silver loading,” a mechanism for insurers to load their full premium increases to certain
mid-level (i.e., silver) plans to draw down larger Federal premium subsidies to offset the
Administration’s elimination of other cost-sharing subsidies.
o Ending auto enrollment when a marketplace consumer takes no action during open enrollment.
All House Democrats present voted for the bill along with five Republicans. The rest of the Republican members
voted no, arguing that the ACA provisions were poison pills that prevented them from supporting legislation
which included bi-partisan generic drug provisions they helped to craft. The measure will not be taken up by the
Senate because of the ACA provisions. The upper chamber is continuing to work toward bi-partisan drug pricing
legislation of its own.
House leaders have indicated that in the late summer or fall a larger drug pricing bill, including authorizing
Medicare to negotiate prices directly with the drug manufacturers, could move forward. This could be the
vehicle for advancing a number of “must pass” health care provisions, including a delay of the scheduled
Medicaid DSH cuts.


Earlier this month the Administration announced an expanded “conscience rule” to protect health care
workers who oppose abortion, sterilization, assisted suicide and other medical procedures on religious or
moral grounds. Health care institutions that fail to adhere to the new rule risk the loss of federal funds.
Last week, Cook County joined the state of Illinois, the city of Chicago and other states and jurisdictions
across the country in a federal lawsuit challenging the expanded right of conscience rule.

Budget and Appropriations
 On May 21, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) hosted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate
Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) for negotiations
on the budget caps with the White House, represented by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Acting Chief of
Staff Mick Mulvaney. After huddling behind closed doors for most of the day they were unable to achieve a final

deal and avoid another government shutdown, just as the 2020 election season is beginning to heat up.
Medicaid
 In late April and early May, Representatives Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and Pet Olson (R-Texas) circulated a “Dear
Colleague” letter Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy to move legislation that would delay the
scheduled $12 billion in cuts to Medicaid DSH over the next two years. 302 members of the House signed the
letter, including every member of Illinois’ Cook County delegation. We will continue collaborate with efforts like
this, to keep the issue front and center in Congress.
Of note for Medicaid policy, senior level turnover continues at CMS, with Chris Traylor, the director of the
Centers for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) announcing his departure at the end of May. Traylor had only
been in the position since January.
Affordable Care Act and Prescription Drug Pricing
 On May 16, the House passed H.R. 986, the Strengthening Health Care and Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act.
The bill included bi-partisan measures which were reported out by the Judiciary Committee, designed to get
generic drugs to market faster and inhibit anticompetitive practices on the part of the drug companies. It also
included provisions by Democrats designed to shore up the Affordable Care Act, including:
 H.R. 1385, which would provide funding for states to establish their own individual and small group
marketplaces instead of using the Federal Marketplace.
 H.R. 1386, which would provide $100 million for Federal health navigators that provide assistance to
consumers in purchasing health insurance plans on the Federal Marketplace.
 H.R. 1010, which would prohibit the sale of short-term limited duration health insurance plans, which are
often limited in scope since they are not required to meet the minimum coverage requirements prescribed
in the ACA.
 H.R. 987, which would require HHS to conduct outreach and educational activities to promote health
insurance on the Federal Marketplace.
The House adopted several amendments during floor consideration, including two that would prohibit HHS from:
 Prohibiting “silver loading,” a mechanism for insurers to load their full premium increases to certain mid-level
(i.e., silver) plans to draw down larger Federal premium subsidies to offset the Administration’s elimination of
other cost-sharing subsidies.
 Ending auto enrollment when a marketplace consumer takes no action during open enrollment.
All House Democrats present voted for the bill along with five Republicans. The rest of the Republican members
voted no, arguing that the ACA provisions were poison pills that prevented them from supporting legislation which

 included bi-partisan generic drug provisions they helped to craft. The measure will not be taken up by the Senate
because of the ACA provisions. The upper chamber is continuing to work toward bi-partisan drug pricing legislation
of its own.
House leaders have indicated that in the late summer or fall a larger drug pricing bill, including authorizing Medicare
to negotiate prices directly with the drug manufacturers, could move forward. This could be the vehicle for
advancing a number of “must pass” health care provisions, including a delay of the scheduled Medicaid DSH cuts.
Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for CCHHS at both the State and Federal level.
