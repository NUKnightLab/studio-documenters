CHA

RESOLUTION TO AMEND THE RATIFICATION OF THE 2009
HUD CFRC ENERGY EFFICIENCY GRANT AWARD

To the Honorable Board of Commissioners:

RECOMMENDATION

It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve the attached Resolution to amend the Board?s
previous Resolution in November of 2009 (Resolution No. 2009-CHA-159), which ratified the acceptance ofa HUD
grant award for 23 CHA energy efficiency projects and authorized a corresponding increase in the FY2009
Comprehensive Budget. The recommended action would amend the 2009 ratification of the HUD grant award
by reducing the award amount from $22,240,736 to $21,741,330, and would authorize the Acting Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) or his designee to execute the revised Capital Fund Program Amendment to the Annual
Contributions Contract ?1014 to memorialize the adjusted award.

BACKGROUND

In November 2009, the CHA Board of Commissioners ratified the acceptance of a Capital Fund Recovery
Competition (CFRC) grant award from the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. This award was
for energy efficiency projects and related capital improvements at 23 CHA properties. The ratified award amount
totaled $22,240,736.

On September 23, 2009, the CHA received official notice from HUD of multiple grant awards under HUD's Energy
Efficient, Green Communities initiative, which had to be executed by CHA and returned to HUD. The 23
CHA efficiency projects at various CHA properties included one property that was inadvertently referenced in
grant application by an inaccurate name and AMP designation. Each of the 23 properties were slated by
CHA for energy efficiency capital improvements, but became eligible for funding under the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 as priority ?shovel-ready? projects.

During the CFRC grant closeout process for the 23 energy efficiency projects the erroneous listing of the one
property that was not accurately referenced in the grant application was discovered. Despite 
attempts to administratively correct the error in the grant application, the stringent requirements of ARRA
compliance did not permit the correction, and HUD has required the adjustment of the grant award to recapture
funds for the project that was incorrectly referenced.

The CFRC grant language does not allow for ARRA funding to be used at CHA properties other than the properties
specified in the grant agreement. While the CHA did complete energy efficiency improvements at the intended
23 properties, only 22 of these properties were correctly included in the CFRC grant agreement. Therefore, the
ratification of the grant award amount must be amended to reflect a reduction in this grant funding.

CORPORATE GOAL
The proposed ratification supports Plan Forward Goal Ensure that housing portfolio is safe,
decent and sustainable.

 

FUNDING: 2015 Capital funds

CONCLUSION
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable CHA
Board policies and all applicable federal laws.
