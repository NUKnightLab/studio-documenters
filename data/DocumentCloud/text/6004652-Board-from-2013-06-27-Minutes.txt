Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Ms. Besenhofer provided additional information regarding request number six. She stated that this request is
to extend and increase the contract for janitorial services at the clinics while the administration continues to
review and determine a complete strategy and solution for the System.
Vice Chairman Ramirez inquired regarding the responders to the second Request for Proposals (RFP) that
was issued; he stated that the transmittal states that the vendors did not possess significant health care
experience – this does not mean that they were unqualified, it just means that somebody deemed that the
vendors did not have significant health care experience. Vice Chairman Ramirez stated that this contract
originated from an emergency situation that arose. He noted that the System extended the contract in
February of 2013; he inquired as to the reason why the System is continuing with this vendor, if there are
other folks out there that can perform these services. Ms. Besenhofer responded that the RFP has not yet
been awarded; the administration is in the process of going back and reviewing what has been submitted to
see if there is, in fact, a viable option within that. Part of the issue has to do with the change in leadership at
the System, in terms of bringing them up to speed, and determining what to do from a strategic perspective
moving forward. Vice Chairman Ramirez inquired as to how this vendor came to be the service of choice
for the System initially. Ms. Besenhofer responded that Jani-King had not done business before with the
System in that capacity. She added that they have significant experience. Vice Chairman Ramirez informed
the Chairman that he intended to vote no on this request.
Also with regard to request number 6, Chairman Carvalho inquired as to the reason that the System found
itself in an emergency situation that necessitated this current contract. Ms. Besenhofer stated that the issue
had to do with prevailing wages.
With regard to request number 8, the following individuals presented additional information: Tom Dohm,
Interim Chief Operating Officer at Provident Hospital of Cook County; and Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief of
Clinical Integration. An extension was granted for this grant that begins in July of this year through June of
2015. A feasibility study was completed, the RFP was issued and was granted; now staff is moving on to the
capital and structural build-out of the MRI suite. Mr. Dohm stated that this is part of the outpatient
expansion – the vast majority of MRIs will be performed on an outpatient basis. Chairman Carvalho recalled
that this was not a grant sought by the System; rather, the University of Chicago secured this grant to the
System. Mr. Dohm stated that the System’s Strategic Plan has always included expansion of outpatient
services at Provident Hospital. All of that would require a significant upgrade to its imaging center;
currently, the vast majority of its modalities are done in analog instead of digital - this particular project, in
addition to the MRI, will enable the administration to redesign the space for multiple uses.
Dr. Shannon added that this is a completely useful and appropriate technology for Provident Hospital to
have, especially with the population that it will need to care for under CountyCare. This gives an
opportunity for patients to get the right kind of care that they need without requiring them to travel each time
to the central campus. He stated that this is also affording an opportunity at the same time to upgrade other
more standard modalities for imaging at Provident Hospital.
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Director Michael, moved the approval of requests
number 1 through 14 under the Contracts and Procurement Items. THE MOTION
CARRIED.
Vice Chairman Ramirez voted NO, and Directors Muñoz and Velasquez abstained and
voted PRESENT on request number 6.
Chairman Carvalho abstained and voted PRESENT on request number 14.

Action Items (continued)
B. Approval of clinical training affiliations (Attachment #4)
Dr. John O’Brien, Director of Professional Education, presented the request for the Board’s consideration.
The Board discussed the role of the Work Group on Affiliations in reviewing proposed clinical training
affiliations. Chairman Carvalho noted that, in the past, the reason why a work group was created for this
purpose is because this has been an item of the Board’s attention over the years; there is a desire to ensure
that the residencies and education and affiliation agreements were designed to be in the best interests of the
System. Dr. O’Brien agreed; he indicated that the involvement of the Work Group is beneficial and has
been very helpful to the administration. Chairman Carvalho stated that the Committee and Work Group
assignments are currently being determined, due to the appointments of four new Directors; the Work Group
on Affiliations will be re-populated and will remain in place.
Vice Chairman Ramirez, seconded by Director Butler, moved the approval of the clinical
training affiliations. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
C. Any items listed under Sections III, IV, V and VIII

VI.

Report from Chairman of the Board
Chairman Carvalho indicated that there are a number of issues that will need to be addressed in future
conversations, discussions and deliberations by the Board. He stated that he would like to simply “tee it up” as to
what the issues are, and ask the administration to develop the solutions for the Board.
All of the issues relate to CountyCare, CareLink, moving towards managed care, the Medicaid market, the
Affordable Care Act (ACA), the implementation of expanded Medicaid, and the like. The issues relate to the fact
that State law has been changed. When a hospital provides care to a person who is under 200% of the federal
poverty level, they now have to provide it for free. Other hospitals do not provide unlimited care to persons who
present in an non-emergent situation, so they have a self-help way of managing that situation. It is really only the
emergent care that they have to provide for free; they have been doing that anyway, so when the law changed it
really did not impact other hospitals. Because the System provides care to persons in non-emergent situations
without regard to ability to pay, State law says that the System has to provide it for free for persons under 200%
of the federal poverty level; therefore, the System needs something in its structure to recognize that change in
State law. Chairman Carvalho stated that he leaves that to the administration to suggest to the Board at a future
time how to deal with that.
Next, the System needs a way to deal with the fact that people are going to become sponsored who are currently
uninsured. This is happening now with respect to CountyCare, and will be happening more so when the ACA
comes into play. The System needs a strategy for how to deal with the persons who are eligible for these items,
but choose not to become enrolled in them. Does the System continue to provide care in an unlimited way? If an
individual is under 200% of the federal poverty level and they are eligible for Medicaid or another ACA option,
but they do not enroll - State law says that if the System provides the care to that person then it must provide it for
free. Chairman Carvalho stated that the System needs a strategy for this.
For those persons who are eligible under the ACA for subsidized care but not Medicaid, if they are currently
uninsured and have been getting their care at the System and have not been paying co-pays or premiums, the
ACA is going to be a bit of a surprise - while care is going to be subsidized, it is not going to be free. So for those
persons who may be eligible for ACA but choose to not exercise their rights to enroll, how is the System going to
deal with that?

VI.

Report from Chairman of the Board (continued)
There are going to be people who choose not to enroll and then will miss their opportunity once the enrollment
period closes. Enrollment for this will not be like Medicaid enrollment; Medicaid allows for enrollment to take
place at any time and for retroactive eligibility. With the ACA options, there is going to be an enrollment period
and then there is going to be closure and no retroactive eligibility. The first enrollment period is October through
March. If it is past the enrollment period and the person has not enrolled but is eligible for enrollment, if that
person gets sick in May, they are going to be uninsured; the System needs a strategy for that.
Persons who are enrolled in the ACA options or in Medicaid may be assigned to a managed care organization the System may or may not be part of that network; if those persons seek care out-of-network at the System, what
mechanisms, if any, are going to be in place to deal with that? Even if the System is in-network, there may be copays associated with that – is the System going to collect them? If the System does not collect them, will that
pose a problem with the managed care organization? For those patients who come to the System to have their
prescriptions filled, who have already received care somewhere else but come to the System’s emergency room
because, for example, they do not have access to prescription benefits under whatever plan they are in – is the
System going to continue to allow for prescriptions to be written for those who come here solely for that purpose?
The State has now authorized the creation of exclusive provider organizations (EPOs). If a person is enrolled
with an EPO, they are only supposed to get their care at places that are members of the EPO; if the System is not
a member of that EPO and the person comes to the System for care that is not emergent, is the System going to
provide that non-emergent care? With regard to those persons enrolled in Medicare Advantage, there may be
requirements that those persons see certain providers; if the System is not one of the providers and the patient
comes here anyway for non-emergent care, what is the System going to do?
With regard to the System’s own co-pays - CareLink has provided for co-pays, but collection of co-pays has
always been an issue. There are issues regarding cash floating around the System and regarding the integrity of
the cash control process. Additionally, there are concerns regarding the fact that, according to County Ordinance,
the System cannot currently accept debit or credit cards without having to collect a surcharge. Chairman
Carvalho stated that the administration may want to go to the County Board to address this issue.
Chairman Carvalho asked Dr. Raju and his team to think over the coming days, weeks and months about how to
advise the Board regarding what policies the Board should set and what procedures the Board should adopt for the
System to deal with these issues and challenges.
Director O’Donnell noted that, particularly with respect to CareLink and collection of co-pays, part of the
challenge appears to relate to the System’s ability to accept the co-pay; she urged the Board to further review the
subject of accepting debit and credit cards – if a legislative change is determined to be needed for this purpose,
then the administration should pursue that.
On another subject, Chairman Carvalho stated that there will be several new Directors that will be joining the
Board. He and the administration staff will be working with them on a new Member Orientation. He noted that
there will also be a need to reconstitute the Board Committees and Work Group(s). He asked the Secretary to
contact the Directors following this meeting to receive an expression of interest regarding the Committees or
Work Group(s) they may be interested or willing to serve on or Chair.

VII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (Attachment #5)
Dr. Raju provided an update on the following subjects: CountyCare Update; National HIV Testing Day; Human
Resources Update; and Recognition.

VII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (continued)
Dr. Raju stated that he had just returned from Washington, DC; he provided an overview of the purpose for his
trip as it relates to CountyCare, regarding its current status and discussion of the issues faced by the System. He
stated that CountyCare enrollment started in February; through June, close to 70,000 applications have been
collected. His pitch to the Congressional delegation was that on December 31, 2013, the System should be able to
utilize its own network/infrastructure, and not dismantle it. After the CountyCare Demonstration Project ends on
December 31st of this year, the administration wants CountyCare to exist in some form, either as a Managed Care
Community Network (MCCN) or a Managed Care Organization (MCO); the administration is in the process of
working on that, and staff will be working closely with the State government on a transition plan that includes
some of those issues - how CountyCare will work and what will be its role, etc.
Dr. Raju stated that, as this organization is transformed to a different level, the administration wants to have both
the State and Federal governments appreciate that and extend to the System the ability to continue to do that. He
added that he does not want a simple extension of the Waiver, because if the Waiver is extended the System will
still only be paid $.48 per $1.00, as there is only Federal match. He stated that staff is in the process of putting
together a transformation document – this will be submitted to the State, and will start the discussion.
Dr. Raju stated that another reason for his trip was to talk to representatives from the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS). When CountyCare began, a per-member per-month payment was agreed upon in the
amount of $628.00, of which the System would receive $314.00; since that happened, the System’s needs and
work has increased. For example, the State has moved all of the hemophiliacs into CountyCare, and the State has
sent out a letter saying that all of the AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP) should be adopted by CountyCare
– ADAP comes with $25 million worth of pharmacy services that the System will need to pay. Dr. Raju stated
that he has to go back to CMS and say that the amount of money agreed upon is not enough, because the
complexity of the patient and the patient population has changed.
Dr. Raju stated that, under the ACA, there was an assumption made that everybody will get insurance. Based on
that assumption, once everyone is eligible for insurance, Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments, which
are provided to support the cost of the uninsured, will be reduced. CMS proposes to redistribute both Medicare
and Medicaid DSH; additionally, there are some problems with the way that they calculate the uninsured
population. The way the DSH is being recalculated, post ACA, is that 25% of the DSH will remain as it is; the
other 75% of the DSH will be based on the uninsured population. There are two problems with that. The first
problem is that the proxy for uninsured days being used by Medicare at the present time is Medicare SSI days and
Medicaid days. The System does not have enough Medicaid or Medicare patients; it has a large uninsured
population. The second problem is that CMS is placing the national uninsured rate of 14% as the proxy. The
System is running at a 60% uninsured rate. This will have a terrible impact on the DSH dollars going forward,
because the System will still continue to have uninsured persons coming into the System, even after the
implementation of ACA. He is pushing for them to go back and say perhaps they need to wait two more years
before they start redistributing the DSH payment, in order for more people to be enrolled into the System.
A. Report from Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #6)
John Cookinham, System Chief Financial Officer, presented his report regarding Financial Reporting. The
Board reviewed and discussed the information.
During the Board’s review of the information, the following subjects were discussed: County subsidy;
differences between financial statements based on cash and accrual methods; funding sources; and the cost to
run the System.

VII. Report from Chief Executive Officer
A. Report from Chief Financial Officer (continued)
Dr. Raju indicated that a recent press article was published that led to some confusion regarding the amount of
subsidy received by the System from the County. He stated that the System’s subsidy was $253 million; the
article indicated that the System received $364 million from the County.
Director Muñoz stated that, with the new Directors that are joining the Board, two things should take place.
First, the Board should hold a special session; Directors can talk about these types of issues and further educate
the new Directors. He stated that it is important to understand the sources of the System’s funding, and
understand the prior arrangements that the County has entered into historically. Secondly, he stated that the
Board needs to know exactly what it costs to run this operation; he noted that the Board does not really have
that information in a way that he can understand it. The Board should have a one page document that tells the
true cost of the treatment and services that the System provides on a daily basis.

REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
June 28, 2013 
 
 
COUNTYCARE UPDATE 
 
st
CountyCare continues to grow.  As of June 21  we have initiated 69,408 applications.  In addition, we 
have initiated 3,596 Cermak applications. 
 
We have submitted 40,331 applications to the state.  Of those submitted we have an 85% approval rate.  
We are initiating approximately 500 applications per day.  In the last week, we submitted 536 
applications per day to the state.  The state has also recently increased their processing from a little over 
200 to 275 applications per day.  Approximately 19,000 applications are backlogged waiting to be 
processed.    
 
Earlier this month, the state increased the number of their staff processing CountyCare applications by 
adding 44 more caseworkers.  There are now a total of 103 state caseworkers housed at our Hoyne 
building processing CountyCare applications.  
 
 
NATIONAL HIV TESTING DAY 
 
STEP UP, GET TESTED is a call to action under National HIV Testing Day.  Today, June 27th, the Ruth M. 
Rothstein CORE Center is hosting its annual National HIV Testing Day (NHTD) testing event under 
outdoor tents in the Fantus Clinic courtyard.  Free rapid HIV testing will be offered.  Information about 
how to enroll in CountyCare will be available.  Information will also be provided on Spread the Word, a 
new Illinois lottery game which raises funds for HIV prevention, awareness and support services.  This 
event is being hosted by the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE 
Center and the CORE Foundation and the Chicagoland National HIV Testing Day Collaborative, Illinois

 HUMAN RESOURCES UPDATE 
 
CCHHS’s Employment Plan was filed with Plaintiff’s Counsel on June 13, 2013.  HR’s Senior Labor 
Counsel, Kevin Frey and our Employment Plan Officer, Carrie Pramuk‐Volk joined CCHHS last week.  We 
are on target to process and hire 120 Post Graduates with a July 1st start date. 
 
The transition from Cook County Human Resources to CCHHS Human Resources continues.  A team 
comprised of three existing HR employees and two new hires are being trained so CCHHS can assume 
responsibility for managing our own postings in Taleo.  We have hired a consultant to assist with the 
labor transition.  We are approving our own grants of authority; and while we have always approved our 
own Tuition Reimbursement Requests, we are now forwarding them directly to the Cook County 
Comptroller. 
 
 
RECOGNITION 
 
I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Director Heather O’Donnell and Director Ed Michael for their 
tireless efforts on behalf of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System.  Director O’Donnell’s 
commitment to the System since its inception and her leadership as Finance Committee Chairman have 
been of great value.  Director Michael, as Chairman of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee, lent 
valuable expertise to our committee and Board discussions.  Their insight and support of the System 
have guided us as we continue to transform.  I thank them for their dedication to the Cook County 
Health and Hospitals System.
