19· ·matters will be posted on the Board's website

13· · · · · · · · ·What I was planning to do tonight

·1· ·to continue.
·2· · · ·MR. LIPARI:· As I was saying, the
·3· ·difference between our data and the Invisible
·4· ·Institute's data is they got a much -- they
·5· ·have a much larger -- goes very much further in
·6· ·time.· And their data set has not been cleaned
·7· ·or vetted, not that it can't be useful, but any
·8· ·time you talk about large data sets, you have
·9· ·to have other data sets to compare them against
10· ·to make sure that the data's valid, that there
11· ·aren't duplicates, there isn't missing
12· ·information.· So we were able to do because we
13· ·have access to all the other data sets -- many
14· ·other data sets of the Police Department, we
15· ·were able to compare that data set to others,
16· ·to clean the data to make it more accurate and
17· ·more reliable.· So it doesn't cover as much of
18· ·a time period, but it is a more reliable for
19· ·the period that it does cover.
20· · · · · · · · ·A couple other things we have on
21· ·there, just to be aware of, records of
22· ·all -- not records, but data on all of the
23· ·investigatory stop reports, so you can look at
24· ·ISRs, again in your district, in your ward, in

·1· ·your neighborhood, in your beat.· You can even
·2· ·break it down to look at things like how many,
·3· ·say, juveniles were arrested as a result of an
·4· ·ISR in a school.· So you can really drill down
·5· ·into a pretty detailed level of this
·6· ·information.
·7· · · · · · · · ·The purpose of this is to further
·8· ·educate, to bring transparency to this
·9· ·information and to inform and empower not only
10· ·City agencies because they have access -- they
11· ·can use this data to better manage their own
12· ·agencies, in which the police department is in
13· ·the process of doing, but also to educate,
14· ·inform and empower the public.
15· · · · · · · · ·So I encourage all of you, check

·4· ·been confiscated?
·5· · · ·SUPERINTENDENT JOHNSON:· Certainly.· So at
·6· ·this point same time last year we recovered
·7· ·over 20 percent more weapons than we did the
·8· ·same time last year.· We are currently on pace
·9· ·to recover over 10,000 illegal weapons from the
10· ·streets of Chicago.· This is not a testament to
11· ·how good CPD is, but moreover it's just a brief
12· ·reminder how many illegal weapons we have out

10· ·I want to know once the investigation is

12· ·charged criminally, who pursues that matter?
13· ·Is it up to me?· Who gets it to the State's
14· ·Attorney?· Is it up to you?· We will start
15· ·where we need to start, but my main focus,

·3· · · · · · · · ·Robert J. More also accepts all
·4· ·of the instances in which the book known as the

14· ·which is obvious to me, has to defend against
15· ·the anti-Semite smear, has to defend against
16· ·some type of psychological derangement smear,
17· ·has to be able to pull the teeth on all these

·1· ·Felmon and Devine created a false police report
·2· ·against me.· What's sad is they were -- 2013,
·3· ·there was a CR report here, and through the
·4· ·investigator when they were both suspended,
·5· ·they asked them the question on Rule 14,
·6· ·Chicago Police Board of ethics, if you file a
·7· ·false police report, do you understand, they
·8· ·said yes.· And what did they do?· They created
·9· ·a false arrest report on me.· I filed as an
10· ·attorney pro se.· I won with a federal judge.
11· ·In fact, I was falsely arrested.· Then a year
12· ·later in 2015, six police officers came to my
13· ·residence looking for me to arrest me.· The
14· ·codes show that.· And then through my discovery
15· ·in 2018, through the 22nd District, they all
16· ·covered for him, which is in my case, 16 CV
17· ·2287.· Docket entry 85 and 96 explains exactly
18· ·how the whole Department did this.· So my point
19· ·is, you have Isaac Lambert, another officer in
20· ·the 22nd, he was disciplined for doing the
21· ·right thing on a false police report, and he
22· ·was demoted from the detective division.· The
23· ·point is, in order to get public trust -- I was
24· ·framed.· There's no doubt about it.· I was

·1· ·framed and I continue -- but in order to get
·2· ·public trust, you have to discipline not only
·3· ·the police officers, but the Department.· It's
·4· ·systemic.· My case proves it.· Why didn't I go
·5· ·to COPA, Eddie Johnson, Superintendent?
·6· ·Because I went to IPRA and they went -- they
·7· ·threatened to go into my house, right, without
·8· ·a warrant.· So I lost faith.· I already have
·9· ·this in front of me.· There is no
10· ·investigation.
11· · · · · · · · ·So let me close here and say I'm
12· ·a middle-aged white guy.· I feel sorry for the
13· ·people of color that have been going through
14· ·this for years.
15· · · · · · · · ·If you want true accountability
16· ·for the public, you have to walk the talk.
17· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Thank you.· Next
18· ·speaker, John Catanzara.
19· · · ·MR. JOHN CATANZARA:· Good evening,
20· ·Superintendent.· With the announcement of the
21· ·upcoming promotional exam for sergeant, I would
22· ·urge you to consider a waiver for all the
23· ·policemen who got on this job and there was no
24· ·college requirement at the time they got hired

·1· ·to take a promotional exam.· To change the
·2· ·rules while they're already on the job is not
·3· ·fair.· To have them uproot their life, have to
·4· ·go to school, out-of-pocket expenses for
·5· ·schooling, it's not right.· And saves the City
·6· ·money in the long run, because they don't have
·7· ·to go and get college tuition reimbursement in
·8· ·order to qualify for promotional tests.· For
·9· ·many of them it's going to be their last bite
10· ·at the promotional apple.· To grant them a
11· ·waiver if they were hired prior to that
12· ·requirement I think would be a fair thing to
13· ·do.
14· · · · · · · · ·To the Police Board.· You're on
15· ·the verge of rendering a decision in the Rialmo
16· ·case.· I'm going to tell you a story real quick
17· ·hopefully.· About 20 years ago, I was working
18· ·midnights in the 8th District.· I found myself
19· ·straddling the roof of two buildings, standing
20· ·on a railing and a rooftop, confronting an
21· ·offender with a knife with a five-inch blade
22· ·ranting like a lunatic after menacing six
23· ·teenagers at about 2:00 o'clock in the morning.
24· ·When he finally discovered that I found out

·1· ·where he was, he came towards me with a knife
·2· ·in his hand above his head, up to probably the
·3· ·front of this podium, he got that close to me
·4· ·with a knife.· The whole time my gun was
·5· ·pointed at his head.· My Mag light was in my
·6· ·other hand, and I didn't shoot because I wasn't
·7· ·afraid.· Now, does that make me stupid?· To a
·8· ·lot of officers it did.· You know why?· Because
·9· ·three weeks later that same offender
10· ·slaughtered three innocent human beings and
11· ·stabbed them not less than 80 times in a single
12· ·victim.
13· · · · · · · · ·Now why am I telling you this?
14· ·Because policemen face circumstances like this
15· ·all the time.· And to sit here and render a
16· ·decision for a split-second decision that
17· ·someone made is pretty dangerous.· And to say
18· ·that Rialmo did not have reasonable fear of his
19· ·well-being and his partner's well-being when
20· ·that incident went down that Mr. LeGrier is
21· ·responsible for enacting is reckless.· He
22· ·should be given his job back and this nightmare
23· ·should be over.
