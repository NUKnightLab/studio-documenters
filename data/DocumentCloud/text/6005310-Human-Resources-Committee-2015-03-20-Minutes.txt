Report from Chief of Human Resources (continued)
During the discussion of slide 2, regarding FY2015 vacancies filled through 2/23/15 by hiring source, the
Committee discussed the difference between total vacancies and Requests to Hire (RTH) in Human Resources.
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, stated that, as the organization transforms, the administration does
not always know exactly what skill sets will be needed in certain areas. Currently there are approximately 700
RTHs over about 1,000 vacancies, so approximately 300 are in flux; those 300 positions are ones that are kept at
the ready if a decision is made to expand in an area or develop a new skill set. The actual target for this fiscal year
is to get the total vacancies down to 600; that reflects a reasonable middle-of-the-market average for the number
of vacancies any organization of this size would have. Board Chairman Hammock noted that it would be helpful
if the number reflecting total vacancies was broken down into categories indicating “immediate” vacancies, that
ties closer to the number of RTHs in Human Resources, versus what might be called “reserve” vacancies.
With regard to the information provided regarding improving/reducing average time to fill positions on slide 10,
Chairman Wiese inquired regarding the feedback received from the hiring managers on challenges experienced
with the hiring process. Ms. Lopez responded that they are citing time constraints and lack of resources to get
interviews scheduled and coordinated. A contract was recently approved with Supplemental Health; the
administration has reached out to them to onboard some clerical assistants, so they can help with scheduling and
taking care of that for hiring managers. She added that Dr. Shannon hosted a monthly leadership meeting
recently; at the meeting, it was impressed upon the attendees that it is critical that they move on those applications
so individuals can be onboarded. Dr. Shannon stated that there was a serious communication of urgency about
this at the leadership forum; he noted that he had a specific separate meeting with nursing leaders the following
day. There is no doubt that this is related to clerical activity and time constraints. At the same time, the divisions
that are highly motivated around this activity will schedule interviews for the evenings and Saturdays; the
candidates think this is a great idea because they do not have to take a day off of work if they are employed, and it
can be easier for child care arrangements. He stated that there will have to be a higher degree of accountability for
the managers for this phase of the process.
With regard to the information provided on the Leadership Development Program, Director Junge inquired
whether the Program includes a component on working with labor relations, understanding the collective
bargaining agreements and communicating regularly with labor leadership. Ms. Lopez responded that this is not
included with the current Program, but it is planned for the one being developed for the next cohort. Chairman
Wiese requested that a metric be built for this area of reporting for next month, as the ongoing Program is
showing some impact, and some expansion of the Program is anticipated with the labor component; she added that
the Committee could discuss some potential components for inclusion, like the important labor component that
Director Junge mentioned.
Director Junge referenced comments provided during public testimony regarding a nursing candidate who was
rejected from employment for the reason of a lack of leadership ability; she asked whether Ms. Lopez could
provide information that explains why leadership ability would be a factor in denying people for bargaining unit
positions. Ms. Lopez responded that, without knowing more information on the matter, she did not have an
immediate response, but would look into the matter further.
With regard to a question from Chairman Wiese regarding the long-term goal for diversity, Ms. Lopez stated that
staff are working to finalize the job description for the Equal Employment Opportunity Officer for the System.
The goal is to fill this position and have the individual perform an assessment, as well as work with the recruiting
team on goals for hiring.
