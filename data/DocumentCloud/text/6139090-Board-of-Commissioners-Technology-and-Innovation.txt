BUREAU OF TECHNOLOGY, by Antonio Hylton, Chief Information Officer,
transmitting a Communication, dated October 28, 2008:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with
CDW GOVERNMENT, INC., (CDW-G), Vernon Hills, Illinois, for the Active
Directory assessment of the County's network structure currently supported by
Microsoft Premier Software Services.
Reason: The Bureau of Technology's Active Directory network has grown
significantly since it was first designed and is in need of a
reassessment to allow stable growth for the future. An assessment
will check for vulnerabilities and point out a weakness that
can threaten our environment. Exposing vulnerabilities and
correcting them before they cause a problem will reduce the overall
support costs to maintain our network and provide a secure structure
which will allow the County to grow. Microsoft Premier support
services are only performed by Microsoft Corporation or its affiliates.
CDW-G is an authorized affiliate of Microsoft Services. CDW-G has
been appointed by Microsoft Services to perform the assessment.
