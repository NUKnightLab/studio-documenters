CLAIM FOR DAMAGES

Transmitting a Comm unication, dated February 6, 200 I from
EUGENE "GENE" MOORE, Recorder of Deeds
The Recorder of Deeds has received a c laim for damages pursuant to Section I 0 I of the Registered Title
(Torrens) Act (765 ILCS 35/10 1).
The c laimants, Zdzislaw Prosniak, Krystyna Prosniak and Zofia Wojciechowski allege as foll ows:
The claimants recei ved a Certificate of Title number 1506973 free and clear of any United States Tax
Liens.

946

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 8, 2001
The Recorder of Deeds office failed to register a Federal Tax Lien against the property in the amount of
$166, 184. 11. The Recorder relied on the affidavit of one Dawn Watkiss, seller of the property, that there
were no United States Tax Liens against her. Subsequently, the United States of America filed a tax
foreclosure action against the property now owned by the claimants.
The United States Department of Treasury was seeking damages in the amount of $125,000.00, but
agreed to settle for $1 10,000.00. Out of that amount the Recorder will pay $85,000.00 and two (2) other
defendants/lenders will pay an additional sum of $25,000.00. Since the $85,000.00 is less than the
Recorder' s possible liability, the Recorder of Deeds recommends that the Board of County
Commissioners approve the claim for $85,000.00.

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Lechowicz, moved that the request of the Recorder of
Deeds be approved. The motion carried unanimously.

Tuesday, January 23, 2001 at the hour of2:00 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118
North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report, the recommendation
is as follows:
24068 1

1998 T URNOVER AUDIT. Transmitting a Communication, dated January 2, 200 I from
Michael J. Shine, Chief Deputy Treasurer, Office of the County Treasurer:
Re: 1998 Turnover Audit
The Cook County T reasurer's Office is subm itting to the Board of Commissioners the 1998
Turnover Audit conducted by the auditors of Arthur Andersen.

NOTE: This item was also referred to the Audit Committee. (See Comm. No. 240680).
*Referred to the Finance Committee January 4, 2001
In response to Commissioner Hansen' s request for comments on the Memorandum on Internal Control
provided by Arthur Andersen, Gary Fink noted the recommendations addressed audit concerns as of
November 30, 1998. He stated the current County Treasurer has put a corrective action plan in place to
address each recommendation.

973

 JO URNA L OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 8, 200 1
In response to Commissioner Hansen' s question regarding processing NSF checks, Mr. Fink stated the
recommendations addressed the lack of an organized, coordinated and timely procedure for posting,
reconciling and correcting subsidiary records to the general ledger. He said the Treasurer has
implemented new general ledger and cashiering systems, and is working on the installation of
supporting/integrated systems and s ubledgers to promote the automation of the general ledger (Phase II),
which would coordi nate corrective measures with other offices involved in the process.
In response to several questions asked by Commi ssioner Hansen, Mr. Fink commented that the
recommendations relating to the calculation of interest, timeliness of cash deposits, and reconciliation of
the general ledger are now being completed by the Treasurer' s Office. He further stated he was not aware
if the recommendation to establish a taxpayer/customer information database and a taxing body
information database had been implemented.
Kim Feeney, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer's Office, stated that the County's Management of
Information Systems (M IS) Department issues reports by property index number (PIN) on the distribution
and recouping of tax money. Ms. Feeney noted MI S provides the Treasurer's Office with two new
reports: a 30H Report for every agency that has a refund, and an Agency ColJection Report. She
continued by stating the 30H Report indicates distribution as far as collections or recouping of funds and
where the taxing agency is in the process.
Donna Echevarria, Distributions Supervisor, stated that the Treasurer's Office provides all taxi ng
bodies/distri cts with the 30H Report and the Agency Collection Report. The Agency Collection Report
indicates the extension amount, not the levy amount. The taxing agency submits their levy to the County
C lerk, who has the authority to decrease the levy.
Chairman Daley asked the State's Attorney's Office to provide in writing, clarification regarding the
County C lerk's authori ty to reduce a taxing agency 's levy, and to what extent he is authorized to do so.
Chairman Daley also requested the communication include the retention of prior years' levies maintained
by the County C lerk. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Ms. Echevarria concluded by say ing that reports are generated for each agency regardless if they are fo r
col lections that are di stributed or refunds that have to be offset against future distributions. She further
stated that the taxing agency receives reports that show their respective begi nning and ending balances.
She also indicated other reports are available upon written request.
In response to Commissioner Hansen ' s question regarding assessing the cash flow projection process and
historical cash flow requ irements to establish investment parameters, Mr. Fink stated the recommendation
was based upon historical investment in short-term vehicles that would allow the County to diversify
investments and possibly improve returns. He said the Treasurer has already adopted an investment
pol icy fo r the office.
Mr. Fink furthe r commented that the recommendation of setting priorities addresses the need for an
operating system and establishing responsibilities fo r and control over managing records and changes in
the system. He noted that accommodating users or the need for a stand-alone system for the Treasurer
should be addressed.
In response to Commi ssioner Hansen's question regarding integrated processing systems, Cathy Maras
O'Leary, Chief Information Officer, stated systems have been established however, not all refunds and
certificates of error are online. She stated that her office is in the process of working with the Treasurer
on these records and corresponding systems.

974

 JOURNA L OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 8, 2001
Commissioner Quigley and Commissioner Lechowicz requested that a written report on the current status
of each recommendation be prepared by Mrs. O'Leary. Commissioner Collins requested the report
include the status of improvements made for a more time ly distribution to taxpayers and taxing districts.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on whether the State' s Attorney's Office was aware of
the recommendation that the Treasurer's Office prepare an inventory of outstanding issues that requi re
legal interpretation, Elizabeth Re idy stated the office has been worki ng with Martha Mills, General
Counsel for the Treasurer's Office, on outstanding issues that require legal interpretation or advice.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's request fo r comments on the Memorandum on Internal Control
s ummary, Mr. Fink stated that the s ummary addresses the concerns Arthur Andersen had of the former
Treas urer's accounting systems and operating procedures. Mr. Fink commented that the current
Treas urer has demonstrated a strong commitment to resolve the problems and has made improvements in
the accounting system and operating procedures in the office. He noted the Treasurer has also
implemented a corrective plan to address future concerns.
Ms. Feeney responded to Commi ssioner Hansen's question regarding the news reports relating to $88
million the State wants the County to tender to the State Treasurer, by stating that this fi gure represented
D fund monies, and a portion of this, $8. 1 million, was in the form of refund checks that were written by
the previous administration, but never issued. It was determined that these checks were written in
anticipation of refu nds that were never properly certified, and did not occur. Therefore, the checks were
not issued, and remained in the possession of the Treasurer.
Elizabeth Reidy stated that a response to the State Treasurer's letter is fort hcoming from the State 's
Attorney' s Office. She indicated there has been some confusion in the State Treasurer's demand for $88
million. She noted the $26.5 million referenced in Arthur Andersen's Statement of Assets and Liabi lities
Audit Report is unrelated to the $88 million. The County Treasurer has asked the State's Attorney's
Office to assist in responding to the State Treasurer's demand. The State' s Attorney' s Office has met
with representatives from the Offices of the State Treas urer and Attorney General and are preparing to
respond to the demand for $88 million .
President Stroger addressed his concerns regarding how the County Board should resolve the problems in
the Treasurer's Office, by either amending the state statutes or by enacting a home rule ordinance. The
President also said he had spoken with State Treasurer Topinka and stressed his desire to have the County
and State work together to resolve these issues.
Commissioner Lechowicz req uested info rmation on the automation project referred to by the Treasurer's
representati ve as Phase II . Comm issioner Lechowicz commented that he did not believe the funding for
the project had been addressed by the Cook County Board and stated that recommendations need to be
presented to the Board.
In response to Commissioner Butler' s question regarding whether money generated through fees and
fines in the Office of the C lerk of the Circuit Court flow through the Treasurer's Office, Ms. Feeney
responded no. Ms. Feeney stated the Clerk of the Circuit Court holds the money wi th the exception of
forfeited bail bond money, which is deposited in the Treas urer' s Office. Ms. Reidy noted that the Clerk
of the Circuit Court is ordered by the Court to hold money in escrow.
Commissioner Collins expressed her concern regarding interaction and communication between various
departments and agencies within County government. The large number of separate funds, spread out
among a ll the agencies and Consti tutional offices, could have a detrimental effect on accountability.

975

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 8, 200 1
Chairman Da ley responded that staff from Arthur Andersen and the County Auditor' s office provide
sufficient accountab ility throughout all branches of County government. He provided recent examples of
occasions where the Audit Comm ittee identified a problem, and worked with the auditors and
management to find a solution. T his system ensures accountability.
Commissioner Schumann commented that any req uest fo r funding approval by the Board on Phase II
would likely involve purchasing new technology to tie the other e lected officials and departments
together. He stated it is important that the members of the Board understand the technology, the intended
users and the needs of each based on their respective duties and/or responsibilities.
Commissioner Schumann requested a technology report from Mrs. O ' Leary regarding Phase II. He asked
that the report include the property tax and collection system/process as it relates to the proposed
automation project.
Chairman Daley asked that the report from the Chief Information Officer indicate whether Phase II is the
final step in the automation process, or are other phases expected. He further requested Tom Glaser,
C hief Financial Officer, to address the so urce of funding for Phase II.
Commissioner Lechowicz, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 240681. T he motion carried.
Commissioner Hansen moved to adjourn. Seconded by Vice Chairman Carr, the motion carried

COUNTY TREASURER, Maria Pappas, transmi tting a Communication, dated Aug ust 2,
1999:
In a letter dated July 2, 1999, I informed you that a RFP was being issued to replace our
cashiering system since the system is not Y2K compliant. T he letter explained the urgency in
selecting a vendor in time for consideratio n at the August 4, 1999 Board meeting. This
urgency results from the extremely ti ght timeframe to plan, install and test the new cashiering
system by a December 1, 1999 implementati on dead line.

1008

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 8, 2001
RFP's were sent to vendors based on the recommendations of Ernst & Young LLP. Proposals
were received and evaluated for three vendors, USL Financials, CPS Systems, Inc. and
System Innovators Incorporated. The proposals were evaluated for: ( I) the capabilities of
the software application in meeting the cashiering requirements of the Treasurer's Office; (2)
the cost; (3) the implementation schedu le; and (4) the fit with the long-term information
technology strategies of the Treasurer's Office including an enterprise resource planning
system that will improve financial control.
As a result of the above process, I am requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to
enter into a contract with USL FINANCIALS for the lease purchase of a cashiering system.
The cost of the system for a five year capital lease is $2, 183, I I 9.85 including software,
hardware and training as detailed in the proposal submitted. The first year capital lease cost
of $436,623.97 will be paid from the 717/060-579 appropriation account, and the annual
maintenance cost of $I 71 ,350.00 will be paid from the 060-440 account. The proposal
includes MBE/WBE participation at 38% of the non-proprietary hardware cost.
I appreciate your support of this necessary request, in order to continue our efforts to
modernize th is office and increase its efficiency.

* Referred to the Finance Committee August 4, 1999.
With respect to Item 230130, the Cashiering component was approved as amended at
the August 10, 1999 Finance Committee meeting.

1998 TURNOVER AUDIT. Transmitting a Communicatio n dated, January 2, 200 I fro m
Michael J . Shine, C hief Deputy Treasurer, Office of the County Treasurer:
Re: 1998 Turnover Audit
The Cook County Treasurer's Office is submitting to the Board of Commissioners the 1998
Turnover Audit conducted by the aud itors of Arthur Andersen.

NOTE: This item was also referred to the Committee on Finance. (See Comm. No.
240681).
Referred to the Committee on Audit J anuary 4, 2001.
Following the call of the meeting, the C hairman recessed the meeting for discussion and questi ons on the
subject, under Communication 240681 , by the full board in the Committee o n Finance.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's req uest for comments on the Memorandum on Internal Contro l
provided by Arthur Andersen, Gary Fin k noted the recommendations addressed aud it concerns as of
November 30, 1998. He stated the current County T reas urer has put a corrective action plan in place to
address each recom mendation.
In respo nse to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding processing NSF checks, Mr. Fink stated the
recommendations addressed the lack of an organi zed, coordinated and timel y procedure for posting,
reconci ling and correcting subsid iary records to the general ledger. He said the Treasurer has
implemented new general ledger and cashiering systems, and is working on the installation of
supporting/integrated systems and subledgers to promote the automation of the general ledger (Phase 11),
which would coordinate corrective measures with other offices involved in the process.
In response to several questi ons asked by Commiss ioner Hansen, Mr. Fink commented that the
recommendations relating to the calculation of interest, timeliness of cash deposits, and reconciliation of
the general ledger are now being completed by the Treasurer' s Office. He further stated he was not aware
if the recommendation to establish a taxpayer/customer information database and a taxi ng body
info rmation database had been im plemented.
Kim Feeney. Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer' s Office, stated that the County's Management of
Information Systems (MIS) Department issues reports by property index number (PIN) on the distribution
and recouping of tax money. Ms. Feeney noted MIS provides the Treasurer's Office with two new
reports: a 30H Report for every agency that has a refund, and an Agency Collection Report. She
continued by stating the 30H Report indicates distribution as far as collections or recoupi ng of funds and
where the taxing agency is in the process.

10 18

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 8, 2001
Donna Echevarria, Distributions Supervisor, stated that the Treasurer's Office provides all taxing
bodies/districts with the 30H Report and the Agency Collection Report. The Age ncy Collecti on Report
indicates the extension amount, not the levy amount. The taxing agency submits their levy to the County
Clerk, who has the authority to decrease the levy.
Chairman Daley asked the State's Attorney's Office to provide in writing, clarification regarding the
County Clerk's authority to reduce a taxing agency ' s levy, and to what extent he is authorized to do so.
Chairman Daley also requested the communication include the retention of prior years' levies maintained
by the County Clerk. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Ms. Echevarria concluded by say ing that reports are generated for each agency regardless if they are for
collections that are distributed or refunds that have to be offset against future distributions. She further
stated that the taxing agency receives reports that show their respective beginning and ending balances.
She also indicated other reports are available upon written request.
In response to Commissioner Hansen' s question regarding assessing the cash flow projection process and
historical cash fl ow requirements to establish investment parameters, M r. Fink stated the recommendation
was based upon historical investment in short-term vehicles that would allow the County to diversify
investments and possibly improve returns. He said the Treasurer has already adopted an investment
policy for the office.
Mr. Fink further commented that the recommendation of setting priorities addresses the need for an
operating system and establi shing responsibilities for and control over managing records and changes in
the system. He noted that accommodating users or the need for a stand-alone system for the Treasurer
should be addressed.
Jn response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding integrated processing systems, Cathy Maras
O ' Leary, Chief Information Officer, stated systems have been established however, not all refunds and
certificates of error are online. She stated that her office is in the process of working with the Treasurer
on these records and corresponding systems.
Commissioner Quigley and Commissioner Lechowicz requested that a written report on the current status
of each recommendation be prepared by Mrs. O' Leary. Commissioner Collins requested the report
include the status of improvements made for a more timely distribution to taxpayers and taxing districts.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on whether the State's Attorney's Office was aware of
the recommendation that the Treasurer's Office prepare an inventory of outstanding issues that require
legal interpretation, Elizabeth Reidy stated the office has been working with Martha Mi lls, General
Counsel for the Treasurer' s Office, on outstanding issues that require legal interpretation or advice.
In response to Commi ssioner Hansen's request for com ments on the Memorandum on Internal Control
summary, Mr. Fink stated that the summary addresses the concerns Arthur Andersen had of the former
Treasurer's accounting systems and operating procedures. Mr. Fink commented that the current
Treasurer has demonstrated a strong comm itment to resolve the problems and has made improvements in
the accounting system and operating procedures in the office. He noted the Treasurer has also
implemented a corrective plan to address future concerns.
Ms. Feeney responded to Commi ssioner Hansen's question regarding the news reports relating to $88
million the State wants the County to tender to the State Treasurer, by stating that this figure represented
D fund monies, and a portion of this, $8.1 million, was in the form of refund checks that were written by
the previous administration, but never issued. It was determined that these checks were written in
anticipation of refunds that were never properly certified, and did not occur. Therefore, the checks were
not issued, and remained in the possession of the Treasurer.

1019

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 8, 200 1
Elizabeth Re idy stated that a response to the State Treasurer's letter is fort hcoming from the State's
Attorney' s Office. She ind icated there has been some confusion in the State Treasurer's demand for $88
million. She noted the $26.5 mill ion referenced in Arth ur Andersen's Statement of Assets and Liabilities
Audit Report is unrelated to the $88 million. T he County Treasurer has asked the State's Attorney's
Office to assist in respondi ng to the State Treasurer' s demand . The State's Attorney ' s Office has met
with representatives from the Offices of the State Treasurer and Attorney General and are preparing to
respond to the demand for $88 million.
President Stroger addressed his concerns regarding how the County Board sho uld resolve the problems in
the Treasurer's Office, by either amending the state statutes or by enacting a home rul e ordinance. The
President also said he had spoken with State Treasurer Topinka and stressed his desire to have the County
and State work together to reso lve these iss ues.
Commissioner Lechowicz requested information on the automation project referred to by the Treasurer's
representat ive as Phase II. Commissioner Lechowicz commented that he did not believe the fund ing for
the project had been addressed by the Cook County Board and stated that recommendations need to be
presented to the Board.
In response to Commissioner Butler's question regarding whether money generated throug h fees and
fines in the Office of the C lerk of the Circuit Court flow through the Treasurer' s Office, Ms. Feeney
responded no. Ms. Feeney stated the Clerk of the Circuit Court holds the money with the exception of
forfe ited bail bond money, which is deposited in the Treasurer's Office. Ms. Reidy noted that the C lerk
of the C irc uit Court is ordered by the Court to hold money in escrow.
Commissioner Coll ins expressed her concern regarding interacti on and communication between vario us
departments and agencies withi n County government. The large number of se parate funds, spread out
among all the agencies and Constitutional offices, could have a detrimental effect on accountability.
Chairman Daley responded that staff from Arthur Andersen and the County Auditor' s office provide
sufficient accountability throug hout all branches of County government. He provided recent examples of
occasions where the Audit Committee identified a problem, and worked wi th the auditors and
management to find a solution. This system ensures accountabi li ty.
Commissioner Schumann commented that any req uest for funding approval by the Board on Phase II
would likely involve purchasing new technology to tie the other elected officials and departments
together. He stated it is important that the members of the Board understand the technology, the intended
users and the needs of each based on their respecti ve duties and/or responsibilities.
Commissioner Schumann requested a technology report from Mrs. O ' Leary regarding Phase II. He asked
that the report include the property tax and collection system/process as it relates to the proposed
automat io n project.
C hairman Daley asked that the repo11 from the Chief Informat ion Officer indicate whether Phase II is the
final step in the automation process, or are other phases expected. He further requested Tom G laser,
C hief Financial Officer, to address the so urce of funding for Phase II.
Following discussion and questi ons on the issue, under Communicatio n 240681 in the Committee on
Finance, the Chairman reconvened the meeting of the Audit Committee.

Commissioner Lechowicz, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 240680. The motion carried.

requesting authorizati on for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with BRIGHT
HORIZONS FAMILY SOLUTIONS, INC. ("Brig ht Ho ri zons"), C hicago, Illi nois, for
operation of the child care center in the Cook County Admini stration Building.
Pursuant to the Intergovernmental Agreement with the City of Chicago, the Joint Overs ig ht
Committee (JOC) developed an RFP for the operation of child care services and a training
program for future child care workers at the center. The RFP was issued and five timely
proposals were recei ved. The JOC tho ro ug hly evaluated these pro posals and unanimously
determi ned Bright Hori zons to be the most respons ive bidder. The JOC concluded that
Brig ht Horizons is the best qualified to operate the type of hig h caliber employer-based child
care center as envisioned by the County and the City.
In addition to the above. in order to proceed with the project we specifically request
authorization for the expenditures set forth below. T he City, in accordance with the
Intergovernmental Agreement will be responsible for one-ha lf of these and other costs
identified with the child care center.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $7 1,925.00. (490-289 Account).

Chairman Steele asked Jennifer Vidis, Executive Director, Commission on Women 's Iss ues, to give an
overview of the C hild Care Center proj ect.
Ms. Vidis stated the Board approved a joint proposal between Cook County and the City of Chicago for a
child development center in the New County Administration Building in Apri l 1999. She said the County
would provide the space, pay operating costs, and seek a private operator to provide child care and
development services. The proposal provides that I 0% of the slots are set aside for Head Start eligible
famil ies. Ms. Vidis stated there was an intergovernmental agreement approved by the County Board in
October, 1999 setting fo rth the terms of the partnership between the C ity of Chicago and the County, and
the creation of a Joint Oversite Committee. T he Joint Oversite Committee was responsible for the
facil ity design, construction, selection of an operator and management of the project.
William Huffman, Director of Faci li ties Management, gave a brief synopsis of the construction of the
project. He stated construction is 40% complete and said the day care center would occupy the first
second floors of the building. He noted the value of the contract is $ 1, 700,000 that was previo usly
approved by the Board and projected the substantial completion of the project by April 12, 200 I. He
added that two months after that date, the o utdoor play areas, certification and Iicensing should be
completed. He reminded the Committee that the C ity of Chicago is pay ing 50% of all capital and
o perating costs associated with the project.
Kim Everts, principa l des ig ner, Ross, Barney and Jankowski stated the first floor street level w ill inc lude
an infa nt, todd ler and a mixed aged classroom, a large motor room for children, and an outdoor play area
for the younger children that will be located on Dearborn Street. She indicated a play area for older
child ren, located behind the Miro Sculpture is currently under construction. The second floor will hold
two, three and five-year old classrooms and a small resource library. She indicated there w ill be a
warming kitchen for daily food preparation on the lower level. Ms. Everts added for safety the first floor
outdoor play area will have a seven foot fence.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 8, 200 1
Anna Ashcraft, Special Assistant to the President, Legal Counsel, presented an overview of the RFP
Content and Operator Selection Proposal. She stated an RFP was issued in March, 2000 and the Joi nt
Oversite Committee experienced an extensive evaluation process because various components continued
to evolve. The Joint Oversite Committee attempted to reduce tuition and make modifications to the
training component. Ms. Ashcraft said quality, parent involvement, curriculum, experience of the
operator, teacher training, enrollment, marketing policies and accreditation were paramount in the
operator selection process. She noted the RFP req uested an employer-sponsored day care wi th organized
planning abi lity.
Design ideas and support were considered. She noted that teacher turnover is a
problem in the industry and indicated the ability to retain and support teachers were critical in the
selection process.
Comm issioner Maldonado inquired about operator costs.
Ms. Ashcraft responded that tuitions are as low as possible. She indicated the County/C ity will not pay
operating costs but the operator will charge tuition that will pay these costs.
Commissioner Maldonado asked if there wi ll be a special rate for fam ilies that enroll more than one
child?
Ms. Vid is answered that special rates are not reflected in the proposed rate structure.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired ifthe chil d care center will charge fees customary fo r day care centers
or are the fees discounted?
Ms. Vidis indicated that the rates are competitive, but are not the lowest in the downtown area. The rates
are below the free open market. She noted these are excellent rates given the qua lity of care that the
provider wi ll be able to bring to the center.
Commissioner Maldonado asked about the maximum capacity of the center?
Ms. Ashcraft responded that the maximum capacity of the center is 112 children.
Commissioner Maldonado asked if there is a different fee structure depending on the age of the child?
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question, Ms. Ashcraft stated the rates are structured to
accommodate the different length of employees' work days. For a regular 5-day work week, 8-9 hours a
day , the rates would be as fo llows: $ 185.00 for infan ts, $175.00 for toddlers, $ 160.00 for two year olds
and $ 140.00 for three to five year olds.
Ms. Ashcraft indicated that 80% of tuition cost is labor.
Commissioner Hansen asked who were the other respondents to the RFP?
Ms. Ashcraft stated that National Lewis University, the YMCA, Centers for New Horizons and Harold
Washington College also submitted proposals. She indicated the basis for selecting Bright Horizons was
due to the quality of the program and that the other proposals were not employer-based and did not have a
high rate of accreditation.
Comm issioner Hansen asked what is the estimated enrollment for this center?

1023

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 8, 200 I
Ms. Vidis responded that the center expects full enrollment and asked Dave Thomas, Director of Client
Services, Bright Horizons Family Solutions, to give a brief summary of the center to the Committee.
Mr. Thomas stated that Bright Horizons Family Solutions works exclusively with employer companies
where there is a hig h volume of child care. The company was created 14 years ago by a husband and wife
team and is based at Watertown, Massachusetts. He indicated that the corporation has regional offices
and operates 330 employer-based programs in the United States, the United Kingdom and the Pacific
Rim. Mr. Thomas said Bright Horizons operates about 30 programs for companies such as Motorola,
Northwestern Memorial Hospital, ComDisco, Household Finance and Bank One in the C hicagoland area.
Mr. Thomas stated the focus of Bright Horizons Family Solutions is quality at the classroom level. He
indicated that the company is accredited by the National Association of the Education for Young Chi ldren
and will benefit City and County employees.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question, Mr. Thomas stated the Bright Horizons Corporate
Officers are Roger Brown - President and Chief Executive Officer and Linda Mason - Chairman of the
O rganization.
Commissioner Hansen requested and received a copy of Bright Horizon's Annual Report.
Commissioner Hansen requested a list of RFP respondents and commented that the tuition costs seem
very high. He expressed concern that he did not want the tuition to price out the very people, County and
City employees, it was designed to benefit.
Vice Chairman Goslin said he supports the program and commented on the comparison of fees at the
State of Illinois child care facility.
Mr. Thomas responded that he will provide a full disclosure of the company to the Education Committee.
He stated Bright Horizons objective is a 7% return before taxes.
Commissioner Schumann inquired about partial week rates that considers City and Coun ty holidays?
Mr. Thomas responded that partial work weeks will be offered and that holidays will be specified when
the parents complete the contract.
Chairman Steele indicated the City of Chicago is helping the County lower costs by bringing in the Head
Sta11 Program. She said that some programs are subsidized particularly by the State of Illinois and noted
the highest tuition rate is for infant care. The Chairman stated her main concern is not to price-out county
employees and suggested there may be certain alternati ves available that would reduce tuition.
Chairman Steele introduced Ruby Smith from the City of Chicago, Department of Human Resources,
who worked on the Joint Oversight Committee.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the operating cost of $893,000 will be covered by revenues generated by
the child care center?
Ms. Ashcraft answered in the affirmative.
Vice Chairman Goslin requested more information on the price structure and requested the County
compare both the quality of day-care and tuition rates with the State of Illinois.
Vice Chairman Goslin asked if the County is the lead agency in this project?

1024

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 8, 2001
Ms. Ashcraft responded that the County is the lead agency.
