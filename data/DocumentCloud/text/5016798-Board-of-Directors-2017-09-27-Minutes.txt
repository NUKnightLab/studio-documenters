Transformational Brownfield Plan Introduction
Senate Bills 111-115, signed by Governor Snyder on June 6, 2017, allow for the approval of
Transformational Brownfield Plans (“TBPs”), which are defined as plans that will have a
“transformational impact on local economic development and community revitalization based on
the extent of brownfield redevelopment and growth in population, commercial activity, and
employment that will result from the Plan.”
Per Michigan Public Act 381 of 1996, as amended (“Act 381”), TBPs must be a mixed-use
development and, with respect to TBPs in Detroit, with certain exceptions, must have a minimum
level of capital investment of $500M or more. This investment can be one project or a series of
developments on eligible property that are a “related program of investment.” In addition to the
capture of property tax increment revenues, TBPs allow for the capture of construction period tax
revenues, state income tax revenues, and withholding tax revenues (together with property tax
increment revenues, “TIF”) as well as certain sales and use tax exemptions. Eligible activities
under TBPs are expanded to include the “construction, restoration, alteration, renovation or
improvement of buildings.”
A proposed TBP for the Hudson’s Block, Monroe Blocks, One Campus Martius Expansion, and
Book Building and Book Tower Redevelopment Projects (the “Plan”) is being submitted for review
and consideration and will be described by project.

HUDSON SITE
Project Introduction
Rosko Development Company LLC, an affiliate of Bedrock Management Services LLC, or its
affiliate will be the developer of the project (the “Developer”) for this component of the Plan which
entails the planned redevelopment of the Hudson’s Site to create a world-class mixed-use
development with extensive public and civic space. This development is anticipated to include
the tallest tower in the City that will rise an estimated 800 feet next to a mid-rise podium, which
will be separated by landscaped public space.
The planned structure on the Hudson’s Site will be approximately 1.3 million gross square feet
(“GSF”) and is anticipated to consist of approximately 103,000 GSF of retail and food and
beverage space, including a street level market; 118,000 GSF of event and conference space;
305,000 GSF of office space; approximately 330 residential units occupying 425,000 GSF;
89,000 GSF of programmed civic and public space; 74,000 GSF of terrace and landscaped
space; and a 23,000 GSF public skydeck atop the tower. The planned redevelopment of the
Hudson’s Site also includes modernized below-grade parking with at least 700 parking spaces.
It is currently estimated that this project will create or support 1,900 permanent jobs and the
spillover effects from visitors and tourists are expected to create another 900 jobs.
Total investment is estimated at $909 million. The Developer is requesting approximately
$188.7M in TIF reimbursement for this component of the Plan.

Acquisition of Property by the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority
Mr. Tuomey presented to the Board details pertaining to the acquisition of 2126 Pierce Street in
Detroit, MI. The DBRA staff is seeking authority to partner with EMC and utilize the $25,000.00
refundable earnest money deposit as a credit to the $39,000.00 contribution, while paying an
additional $14,900.00 for acquisition of 2126 Pierce Street.
Board Members who serve on the EMC board asked legal counsel if they needed to abstain from
voting and was advised that there is no direct conflict of interest therefore they may vote as usual.

 Project Introduction
On August 23, 2017, the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (DBRA) Board authorized
DBRA staff to enter into a purchase agreement, pursue standard due diligence activities, and
secure a third party funding source, such as the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
funding for the acquisition of 2126 Pierce Street.
Through further discussions with the Department of Housing and Revitalization (HRD), the use of
CDBG funds in connection with a Sale Lease Back provision of the binding agreement (the
“Purchase Agreement”) is prohibited. As a result, DBRA staff reached out to the Easter Market
Corporation (EMC) to develop a partnership whereby the DBRA will assign the Purchase
Agreement to EMC, EMC will contribute $150,000.00 towards the acquisition of the property, and
DBRA will contribute $39,900.00, and conduct standard due diligence work, including a Phase I
environmental assessment and an ALTA Survey, totaling $3,950.00.
In exchange for the Purchase Agreement, a $39,900.00 contribution, and costs incurred during
Due Diligence, the DBRA is provided several provisions, including: (1) a perpetual First Right of
Refusal to purchase the property, (2) approval and denial of any contemplated leases that EMC
may enter into, and (3) a proportionate share of lease proceeds equal to 23% of total proceeds.
The DBRA staff is seeking authority to partner with EMC and utilize the $25,000.00 refundable
earnest money deposit as a credit to the $39,900 contribution, while paying an additional
$14,900.00 for the acquisition of 2126 Pierce Street.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the partnership with EMC and utilization of the earnest
money deposit, as presented The Board took the following action:
