 CUY SR 43 – 1.98 AURORA ROAD
Staff Comments:
• Recommendations
• The project area is Level 2 of the NOACA Freight Network,
meaning relatively high truck counts. Design should
consider their turning movements mainly at the shopping.
• Include high-visibility crosswalks and pedestrian
countdown heads with the new signal at Portz Parkway.
Include pedestrian crossing of Aurora Road.

 NEXT STEPS
