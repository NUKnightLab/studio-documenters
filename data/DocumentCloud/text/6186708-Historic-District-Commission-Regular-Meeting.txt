STAFF REPORT 07-10-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6317
ADDRESS: 14821 FAUST
HISTORIC DISTRICT: ROSEDALE PARK
APPLICANT: MIKE DAVIS/OWNER

PREPARED BY: G. LANDSBERG

DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 07-03-2019
PROPOSAL
14821 Faust is a 1½-story, front-gabled brick dwelling. A raised brick and concrete porch spans the front of the
house. The applicant proposes to build a wooden deck at the rear of the house to replace a pre-existing deck.

Rear view, 14821 Faust (Applicant photo, May 2019).

The proposed work scope is:
 Construction of a rear deck built of pressure treated southern yellow pine, including matching railings

STAFF OBSERVATIONS
The applicant has provided photos documenting the design and condition of the previous rear deck, which he states
was removed in 2018. No COA was issued at that time. In this current proposal, the applicant seeks the
Commission’s approval of a “scaled-down” version of the previous deck, in the same location but “smaller
dimensions all around.” The primary plan difference for the new deck is the introduction of an angled corner.

 ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1) Height. The height of the single-family residential structures in the Rosedale Park Historic District range
from one (1) story to two-and-one-half (2½) stories tall, the half-stories contained within the roof. The standards,
as defined in original deed restrictions, shall be met by new single-family residences. Additions to existing
buildings shall be related to the existing structure. Garages are generally one-story tall. The three (3) apartment
buildings on West Outer Drive near Grand River Avenue are two-stories tall on a high basement. The red brick
church on Fenkell at Stahelin has a slightly vaulted sanctuary section that is nearly three (3) stories in height and
two (2) single-story wings.
(2) Proportion of buildings' front facades. The typical front facades of residential buildings in the Rosedale Park
Historic District are often wider than tall or as wide as tall to their eaves. Tall half-stories with dormers provide
additional height.
(3) Proportion of openings within the facade. Proportion of openings varies greatly according to the style of the
building. Typical openings are taller than wide, but individual windows are often grouped together to fill a
single opening which is wider than tall. Windows are often subdivided; buildings designed in English Revival
styles frequently display leaded glass in casement windows and transoms. In buildings derived from classical
precedents, double-hung sash windows are further subdivided by muntins. A variety of arched openings and bay
windows exist throughout the district. Modernistic-style residential buildings have large openings with a variety
of proportional relationships. Dormers projecting from the front roof slopes of many houses in the district add to
the window area. Openings range from twenty (20) percent to seventy-five (75) percent of the front facades,
most falling into the twenty-five (25) percent to thirty-five (35) percent range.
(4) Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. In buildings derived from classical precedents, voids are usually
arranged in a symmetrical and evenly-spaced manner within the facades. In buildings of other styles, particularly
those of English Revival sub-styles, voids are arranged with more freedom, but usually result in balanced
compositions. Voids often dominate the design of the front facades of modernistic style houses.
(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The spacing of the buildings is generally determined by the lot
sizes and the setbacks from side lot lines. There is a general regularity in the widths of subdivision lots from one
block to another, and a shared rhythm and cadence along the streetscapes. Generally, all residences or parts
thereof, including cornices, balconies, pergolas or porches, are not nearer than three (3) feet to the side lot line,
or as defined by specific subdivision or deed restrictions.
(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Entrance and porch types usually relate to the style of the
building. Generally, entrances and porches on buildings of English Revival precedents exhibit freedom of
placement and orientation, while buildings of classical inspiration typically have porches and entrances centered
on the front facade. A common entry arrangement on vernacular English Revival houses is that of a slightly
projecting, steeply gabled vestibule or gabled wall punctured with an arched opening. On smaller scaled
buildings of later building styles, such as the Garrison Colonials, minimalist traditionals, and ranches, entrances
and porches are positioned on one side of the front facade. Some houses have entrances that recede while others
have porches, steps, and/or entrances that project. Most porches occupy a single bay while others, particularly on
Arts and Crafts and Bungalow style houses, span the length of the front facade. Side and rear secondary
entrances and porches and enclosed sunrooms are common. A rhythm of entrances and porches is not discerned
due to the variety of house designs in the district.
(7) Relationship of materials. Masonry is the most significant material in the majority of houses in the Rosedale
Park Historic District, in the form of pressed or wire cut brick, often combined with wood, stone, and/or stucco.
Wood is almost universally used for window frames, half-timbering, and other functional trim. Windows are

 commonly either of the metal casement or wooden sash variety. Aluminum siding and aluminum canted
windows on later buildings are sometimes original; vinyl siding and vinyl windows, where they exist are
replacements. Glass block exists as an original material in some window openings of buildings in "modern"
styles. Roofs on the majority of the houses in the Rosedale Park Historic District are asphalt shingled, while
several original slate roofs still exist. Garages, where they are contemporary with the residential dwelling, often
correspond to it in materials.
(8) Relationship of textures. The major textural relationship is that of brick laid in mortar, often juxtaposed with
wood or smooth or rough-faced stucco and/or stone elements and trim. Textured brick and brick laid in patterns
creates considerable interest, as does half-timbering, leaded and subdivided windows, and wood shingled or
horizontally-sided elements. Some Arts and Crafts style buildings have stone as their major first floor material,
providing a rustic, organic appearance, and stucco or wood at second story level. Slate roofs have particular
textural values where they exist; asphalt shingles generally do not.
(9) Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors—such as red, yellow, brown, or buff, dominate in wall surfaces.
Natural stone colors also predominate: where stucco or concrete exists, it usually remains in its natural state, or
is painted in a shade of cream. Roofs are in natural slate colors, and asphalt shingles are predominantly within
this same dark color range. Paint colors often relate to style. The buildings derived from classical precedents,
such as the Neo-Dutch Colonials and Garrison Colonials, generally have woodwork painted in the white or
cream range. English Revival style buildings generally have painted wood trim and window frames of dark
brown, gray, buff, or shades of cream, depending on the main body color. Half timbering is most frequently
stained or painted dark brown. Stained and leaded glass, where it exists as decoration visible on the front facade,
contributes to the artistic interest of the building. The original colors of any building, as determined by
professional analysis, are always acceptable for a house, and may provide guidance for similar houses. Colors
used on garages should relate to the colors of the main dwelling.
(10) Relationship of architectural details. The architectural elements and details of each structure generally
relate to its style. Contributing residential buildings, constructed between 1917 and 1955, were designed in
styles identified as English Tudor Revival, Arts and Crafts, Bungalow, Colonial Revival, Dutch Colonial
Revival, Foursquare, Prairie, French Renaissance, Ranch, Garrison Colonial, Minimal Traditional, and
International, or hybrids of these styles. Characteristic elements and details displayed on vernacular English
Revival-influenced dwellings include arched windows and door openings, steeply pitched gables, towers,
clustered chimneys, and sometimes half-timbering. Classically-derived styles display modest detail and
architectural elements, mostly in wood in the form of columned porches, shutters, cornices, and keystones. A
great variety of dormer types (shed, gabled, hipped, round-arched, and wall dormers), complimentary to the style
of pre-circa 1935 buildings, are very common throughout the district. Porte cocheres and archways adjoining the
main body of the house add architectural interest where they exist. Modern styles are generally characterized by
smooth, relatively unadorned wall surfaces, horizontal bands of windows, and simplicity. The bank building at
the corner of Grand River Avenue and Fenkell at 18203 Ashton was designed in a pared down Neo-classical
style typical of its period. The red brick church on Fenkell at Stahelin features a triple set of double doors,
stylized cross, and substantial stone piers demarcating its principal entrance. In general, the district is rich in
early to mid-twentieth century architectural styles.
(11) Relationship of roof shapes. A variety of roof shapes exists, relating to the style of the dwellings. Common
on English Revival buildings are steeply sloped pitched or hipped roofs with complex arrangements of
secondary roof shapes, including steeply sloped gables, clipped gables, and shed roofs. These roofs are
commonly interrupted by gabled, shed, and multi-sided dormers, and substantial chimneys which are sometimes
clustered. Bungalows feature low-slung, side facing gable roofs with shed dormers. Classically-inspired
buildings display pitched or hipped roofs with less slope, with or without dormers. Roofs of houses built later in
the period of development of the district, such as those of modern inspiration, tend to have significantly lower
slopes. Flat roofs are not typical except on porches, sunrooms, and other small extensions of a primary building

 with a pitched roof, with the exception of the International style building facing Stoepel Park No. 1 at 14901
Minock. Flat roofs as the main roof of a primary building are generally not appropriate in the district.
(12) Walls of continuity. The common setbacks of houses on straight residential streets create strong visual walls
of continuity. This is augmented by the landscaped features in the public right-of-ways, such as the traffic
islands and tree lawns planted with mature trees.
(13) Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. Monumental features mark the
entrance to Rosedale Park near Grand River Avenue at Ashton Boulevard and Fenkell with an elaborate set of
brick and stone piers; at Glastonbury with brick piers and masonry globes, bearing a plaque identifying the area's
developers; and at Piedmont, the more modest of the three with its very squat brick piers bearing masonry
globes. The flat terrain of the area is divided with principal streets oriented north-south and alternating eighty
(80) feet and one hundred (100) feet in width, and five east-west streets fifty (50) feet wide. The district is
separated from the Grand River Avenue commercial lots by an alley. The typical treatment of individual
residential properties is that of a dwelling erected on a flat or slightly graded front lawn. The front lawn area is
generally covered with grass turf, subdivided by a straight or curving concrete or brick walk leading to the front
entrance and a single width side driveway leading to a garage. There is variety in the landscape treatment of
individual properties. Lack of front yard fencing in all but the western part of the district is a result of
subdivision restrictions that prevent fences near to the front line of the property than the rear of the building. The
placement of trees on the tree lawn between the concrete public sidewalk and masonry curb varies from block to
block or street to street. Lots in Rosedale Park Subdivision No. 4, on Auburn, Minock, and Plainview, have no
curbs, and feature wide tree lawns. Replacement trees on the public right-of-way should be characteristic of the
area and period. Original street lighting standards throughout the district have tall fluted poles with crane's necks
and replacement lanterns. Many have been replaced by tall, modern steel poles. A specific light standard was
designed for Outer Drive, and many still exist.
(14) Relationship of open space to structures. The curbed landscaped traffic islands in the center of the northsouth streets require that the road curves around them. Minock, Auburn, and Plainview on the western end of the
district do not have the landscaped islands in the public right-of-way, although West Outer Drive has some wide
medians. Public sidewalks line each side of the street, and are set back from the road by a tree-lawn that widens
when not opposite a landscaped traffic island. All houses have ample rear yards as well as front yards. Wider lots
in Rosedale Park permitted side drives with garages at the rear of the lots. Where dwellings are located on corner
lots, garages face the side street. Garages, when original, often correspond in materials to the main body of the
dwelling, but are of modest, one-story, simple box design with single or double-doors. Some later houses in the
west part of the district were originally built with garages that were integrated into the main body of the
dwelling. About half of the original garages in the district have been removed and/or replaced. Fences of metal,
wood, or stone separate individual properties from the alley behind the Grand River Avenue commercial
frontage. While there are a few hedges between properties in front, hedges and backyard fences are common
along the east-west streets, and backyard fences are common throughout the district. Stoepel Park No. 1, outside
the district's southern and western edge, preserves open space, as does Flintstone Park, outside of the district at
its southeastern edge.
(15) Scale of facades and facade elements. The Rosedale Park Historic District comprises a single-family
residential neighborhood of moderately scaled dwellings. Houses erected in the 1940s and 1950s are generally
smaller in scale than those built in the earlier phase of development. Three (3) multi-unit apartment buildings, on
the west side of West Outer Drive near Grand River Avenue, are also moderately scaled. Elements and details
within are appropriately scaled, having been determined by the style, size and complexity of the individual
buildings. Window sash are usually subdivided by muntins and casement windows are leaded, affecting the
apparent scale of the windows within the facades.
(16) Directional expression of front elevations. The houses in the Rosedale Park Historic District are horizontal
or neutral in directional expression. Large architectural elements within facades are frequently vertical in

 directional expression, such as multi-storied projecting gables sections, clustered chimneys, or columns. The
three (3) apartment buildings on West Outer Drive are horizontal in directional expression.
(17) Rhythm of building setbacks. Front yard setbacks are generally consistent on each residential street in the
Rosedale Park Historic District, as prescribed by the deed restrictions, although porches, entrance arrangements,
window projections, and irregular massing result in the appearance of variety.
(18) Relationship of lot coverages. The lot coverage for the single-family dwellings ranges generally from
twenty-five (25) percent to thirty-five (35) percent, including the garage, whether freestanding or attached.
(19) Degree of complexity within the facades. The degree of complexity has been determined by what is typical
and appropriate for a given style. Overall, there is a higher degree of complexity in the English Revival style
buildings, where their facades are frequently complicated by gables, bays, irregularly placed openings and
entrances, and irregular massing, than those of other styles. The facades of classically inspired buildings and
modernistic buildings are more straightforward in their arrangement of elements and details.
(20) Orientation, vistas, overviews. The orientation of buildings is generally toward the north-south streets, with
the exception of the house at 14901 Minock, which faces Stoepel Park No. 1. The primary vistas are created by
the landscaped traffic islands. Because of the standard setbacks and lack of front yard fencing, the streetscape
appears as an unbroken greenbelt.
(21) Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Front facades of buildings range from completely symmetrical to
asymmetrical but balanced compositions. English Revival style buildings are irregular in layout and
asymmetrical in appearance. The classically-inspired buildings are generally symmetrical. The modernistic
buildings are not symmetrical but result in highly ordered compositions.
(22) General environmental character. The Rosedale Park Historic District is a solid, fully developed large
residential area of just under one thousand six hundred (1,600) moderately-scaled single family dwellings, builtup in the period between World War I and World War II and complemented with typical examples of compatible
houses from the 1950s. Its landscaped features within the public right-of-ways results in a park-like setting.
Located approximately twelve miles from the city's center, the Grand River Avenue commercial strip is to its
north; otherwise, the area features several other substantial residential subdivisions, including North Rosedale
Park and Grandmont.

RECOMMENDATION
The proposed deck does not destroy historic materials that characterize the property, is differentiated from the old,
and is compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features of the home and property. Wood is a
common texture within the district for accessory structures and trim. Staff therefore recommends that the
Commission approve the proposed rear deck, as the proposed changes appear to be appropriate per Secretary of the
Interior Standards 9 and 10:




9. New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic
materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and
shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the historic property and its environment.
10. New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner
that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its
environment would be unimpaired.

 STAIRWAY ILLUMINATION: ALL EXTERIOR STAIRWAYS SHALL BE
ILLUMINATED AT THE TOP LANDING TO THE STAIRWAY.
ILLUMINATION SHALL BE CONTROLLED FROM INSIDE THE
DWELLING OR AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATED.
