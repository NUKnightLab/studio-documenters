Timeline

During the review of slide 14 of the presentation, regarding the nursing-sensitive clinical quality indicator relating
to physical restraints, Chair Richardson-Lowry inquired whether the organization’s higher rate of the use of
restraints has anything to do with CCH’s population, culture, or some other attribute. Dr. Peters responded that
this needs to be studied further; she will look into the question and provide a response to the Committee.
During the review of Threats under the SWOT Analysis, the Committee discussed the subject of possible
opportunities to engage and partner with local universities. Chair Richardson-Lowry suggested that the
administration reach out to leadership at the Chicago Public Schools to collaborate on potential opportunities that
would generate more interest by younger students to pursue a career in nursing.
During the discussion of slide 25 of the presentation, Chair Richardson-Lowry requested that “language barriers”
be included as a bullet under the category of Weaknesses in the SWOT Analysis.
During the review of slide 27 of the presentation, Chair Richardson-Lowry inquired whether the nursing metrics
will be reported quarterly. Dr. Peters responded affirmatively. Director Driscoll stated that she believes that
nursing needs a quality structure, but also believes that it needs to be integrated into the overall hospital quality
structure; perhaps dual reporting to the hospital quality structure and to nursing quality would be appropriate.
