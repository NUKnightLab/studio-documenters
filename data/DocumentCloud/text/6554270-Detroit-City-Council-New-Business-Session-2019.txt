Dear Dr. Anderson:

On behalf of myself, Barry Lehr, I am writing to offer the donation of the sculpture entitled ?Ascension?
which 1 created in 1971, to the City of Detroit to be installed in Detroit?s Palmer Park. The costs of the
installation are being borne by the City of Detroit.

These improvements will take place on a date to be determined by the City of Detroit. 1 have worked with
community representatives from People for Palmer Park to ensure these improvements are desired.

The City of Detroit will have responsibility to maintain the sculpture. I recommend that any maintenance
of this artwork be executed by Giorgio Gikas, Venus Bronze Works, 13401 Mt Elliott St, Detroit, MI
48212, where previous restoration and repair work has been completed.

?Ascension? is a tall, slender, steel construction created by artist Barry Lehr in 1971 in Michigan. The
sculpture is composed of three curved, hollow steel slabs of the same basic shape, stacked vertically on an
internal structural mast. The slabs are rotated and permanently set at different angles. The
sculpture'was originally painted 1969?1970 Chevrolet Daytona Yellow lacquer. ?Ascension? is
approximately 12 ft tall 5 ft wide and weighs about 700 pounds.

As a gift, the ownership rights to the sculpture will be transferred entirely to the city. Any rights to the
sculpture, by the artists, or their descendants will be transferred in their entirety to the City of Detroit.

We respectfully request your authorization to accept and install the sculpture ?Ascension?, with a waiver
of reconsideration.



Sincerely,

Barry

RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING NOVEMBER 20, AS THE TRANSGENDER DAY OF
REMEMBRANCE

WHEREAS, The mission of the Detroit City Council is to promote the economic, cultural and
physical welfare of Detroit?s citizens through Charter?mandated legislative functions; and

WHEREAS, Trans gender Day of Remembrance (TDOR) is an annual observance that honors
the memory of the transgender people whose lives were lost in acts of anti-transgender violence
that year; and

WHEREAS, Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDOR) was started in 1999 by transgender
advocate Gwendolyn Ann Smith, as a vigil to honor the memory of Rita Hester, a transgender
woman who was killed in 1998. The vigil commemorated all the transgender people lost to
violence since Rita Hester?s death, and began an important tradition that has become the annual
Trans gender Day of Remembrance; and

WHEREAS, Across the United States, anti-transgender stigma and systemic discrimination
heighten the vulnerability of transgender people from an early age. For transgender women of
color, who comprise the vast majority of victims, these challenges are further exacerbated by and
intertwined with racism and sexism; and

WHEREAS, Almost half of all transgender people in the United States will attempt suicide at
one point in their lifetime, a rate that is eight times higher than the rest of the United States
population; and

WHEREAS, The United States has one of the highest rates of murder of transgender people, and
this ugly reality occurs in our city. According to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) reported on
June 7, 2019, in the online article titled ?Horrible Anti? LGBT Killings in Detroit Demand
Action ?2

On May 25, 2019 Paris Cameron, 20, a Black transgender woman, was among three people
killed in a horri?c shooting in a home in Detroit.

I On December 7, 2018 Keanna Mattel, 35, a Black transgender woman, was fatally shot in
Detroit. In 2015, Ms. Mattel, who also went by the name Kelly Stough, spoke against the
anti-trans violence, explaining that ?police are unaware with our struggle so they have no
sympathy for us.? Ms. Mattel?s friends remember her as ?a sweetheart and beautiful
character.?

WHEREAS, There is signi?cant incidence of misgendering or misnaming transgender victims
of crime in police reports, indicating that the number of victims of violence and murder is likely
far higher than what is of?cially reported, and local law enforcement is not required to, and
frequently fails to report hate crimes, including murder, speci?c to the community; and

WHEREAS, Congress and the executive branch must act to protect and preserve the lives of all
minorities through inclusive legislation. It is noteworthy to point out the foresight and success of
the Wayne County Prosecutor?s Of?ce for implementing a policy that will respect the humanity
of transgender people; and

WHEREAS, Wayne County Prosecutor Worthy in association with Fair Michigan a
Michigan nonpro?t corporation seeking to end discrimination against persons based on sex,
sexual orientation, gender and gender identity announced the issuance of the Transgender
Interaction Policy on November 3, 2016; and

WHEREAS, The "Transgender Interaction Policy. the ?rst in the state, mandates employees in
the Wayne County Prosecutor?s Of?ce to acknowledge transgender, intersex and gender-
nonconforming individuals in a manner appropriate to the individual?s gender identity, which
may be different from the sex the individual was assigned at birth or listed on of?cial
identi?cation documents; and

WHEREAS, That the Detroit City Council acknowledges the health of any community is
predicated on protecting the most vulnerable, and in doing so, supports this year's Transgender
Day of Remembrance, on November 20th and

WHEREAS, Transgender Day of Remembrance is an important reminder for all to focus on
preventing anti-transgender violence in our community. THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, That the Detroit City Council:

1. Recognizes and supports the goals and principles of Transgender Day of Remembrance;
and

2. Applauds the Wayne County Prosecutor?s Of?ce Transgender Interaction Policy

3. Supports an increase in the amount and accuracy of Federal collection and reporting data
for violence against transgender people; and

4. Calls on the Federal and state governments to study, reSpond to and prevent violence
against transgender people. NOW THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, That the City Council hereby designates November 20th in this year, 2019, and
every year, henceforth as the Transgender Day of Remembrance in the City of Detroit. BE IT
FINALLY

RESOLVED, That copies of this resolution be forwarded to the of?ces of the City Clerk, the
Mayor, the Detroit delegation in the Michigan legislature and the United States Congressional
delegations from Michigan.
