entitle Officer Larkins to the disability benefit sought. Officer Larkins has not met his burden of proof of
evidence that he is disabled and therefore, Larkins’ application for an ordinary disability benefit is denied.

Vice President Hamburger requested Board counsel, David Kugler, recommend to the Board rules regarding
audio and video recordings during a Board Meeting.
The Executive Director reviewed with the Board the following matters.
The Candlelight Vigil is September 5, 2018 at 5:00 pm, and the Fund has been invited. Interested
attendees should notify Director Tuczak, and attendees’ names shall be provided to the organizers of
this event.
Director Tuczak discussed a recommendation by the Board attorneys to direct communication to the
City’s Budget Director, Ms. Samantha Fields, regarding the shortfall in employer contributions
received for the years 2016 and 2017, versus the funding required in the Illinois Statutes. A draft of a
letter outlining the amounts per the Illinois Statutes, versus the amounts collected was distributed.
Trustee Brown noted that the City’s levies are set to equal the amounts in the Statutes. The levies go
directly to the Fund and do not pass through the City. In addition, it was noted that any shortfall will
be paid to the Fund when the actuarially determined funding begins in payment year 2022.

meeting of Friday, October 5, 2018 from 9:30am to 1:00 pm. All Board members present agreed to
the time change for the Sufficiency meeting.
The next issue concerned a request of the Captains’ Association to solicit retired Captains for direct
payment of dues from November annuity payments. Currently, the Fund does allow retired members of
the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) to deduct annual dues from the retiree’s November annuity. If
allowed by the Board, the Fund’s staff would send a mailing to retired Captains soliciting approval for
the deduction. The mailing would be paid by the Captains’ Association, however, addresses of the
retirees would not be provided to the Captains’ Association. It was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded
by Trustee Beyna that the Board approve the request from the Captains’ Association to send the desired
mailing, and approval for such mailing and authorized deductions also be given to the Sergeants’ and
Lieutenants’ associations if requested in the future.

The next matter discussed was presented by the Fund’s Chief Investment Officer, Ms. Devitt, who
requested an educational reimbursement pertaining to a neuroscience master program. Such program
is in the communities of social neuroscience, which relates to behavioral investing and behavioral
science; the way decisions are made and how investors react to crisis. The employee handbook
allows for a maximum $7,500 educational reimbursement per year for graduate programs. The 2018
budget does not include a provision for reimbursement as the request was not made during the budget
process at the end of 2017. Ms. Devitt indicated that she would like to reduce her previously
approved 2018 budget requests by approximately $4,000 pertaining to intern salary and $3,500
pertaining to reimbursements for conferences and seminars, with such funding instead allocated to
educational reimbursement for the neuroscience master program presented.
It was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Beyna that the Board approve the request from
the Fund’s Chief Investment Officer (CIO) for education reimbursement in accordance with the
established employee handbook, with a report on the class submitted by the CIO. In addition, for the
operating 2018 Budget of the Fund, the funding from this $7,500 expenditure will be deducted from
conferences and seminars and employee salaries (intern).

currently evaluating the possibility of some financing for the benefit of the pension funds. A
recommendation has not yet been made, however, an actuarial impact study may be necessary. Trustee
Brown requested that if an impact study is necessary, that the Executive Director be authorized to approve
the impact study, with funding for such study to be paid by the City.
It was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Beyna that the Board authorize the Executive
Director to begin the study once requested by the City.

The next item from Director Tuczak concerned a request from the Fund’s independent auditing firm,
Mitchell & Titus LLP (M&T). M&T will be responding to a RFP issued by the City with respect to
monitoring compliance on the City of Chicago Police Department's consent decree. While M&T will be
responding to the RFP, the decision process by the City is not concluded. The RFP would involve M&T
performing various procedures on matters of the Chicago Police Department. M&T wanted to confirm
with the Board that there are no concerns of independence issues from the Board with respect to the
audit of the Fund, should M&T be hired to perform the procedures outlined in the RFP. After discussion
it was determined that a representative from M&T should appear before the Board, either in person or
telephonically, at the September meeting or subsequent to conclusion by the City of the RFP, should
M&T be hired, to address Board concerns.
Director Tuczak next communicated to the Board that Trustee Beyna has spent significant time trying to
collect what is due the Fund, under the law, with regard to the proceeds from evidence and recovered
property of the Chicago Police Department. After discussion, it was agreed that Trustee Brown would
assist with the situation, pending receipt of the previous communication sent to the City and Chicago
Police Department regarding this matter.
The last item discussed was notification that the CFA Society of Chicago is conducting free ethics
training seminars targeted towards trustees and funds. The seminars are two hours in duration and are
scheduled for Mid-September. If enrollment for September is low, alternative dates in November may be
provided.
All business concluded for this date, August 30, 2018, due to the lack of a quorum, the meeting was
dissolved.
