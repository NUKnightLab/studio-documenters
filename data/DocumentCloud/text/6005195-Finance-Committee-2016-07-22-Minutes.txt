UNANIMOUSLY.

B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Charles Jones, Director of Strategic Sourcing and Supply Chain Management, provided an overview of the requests

contract whose term is unexpired is presented, that it include the unexpired date in the Terms of Request section.

 III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Chairman Estrada requested that the total number of responders to the Request for Proposals (RFP) be provided for
request numbers 5 and 7.
With regard to request number 9, Director Richardson-Lowry noted that there is a broad audience in terms of those
who would be using the services referenced in the request, but she did not see a predominantly Hispanic or AfricanAmerican-based communication service listed. She asked whether there is a separate contract for those parties, with,
for example, WVON and Spanish-language radio, to ensure that the entire population is touched. Mr. Jones responded
that he will reach out to the Cook County Department of Public Health to get the answer to that question.
With regard to request number 20, Mr. Jones stated that the transmittal should reflect that the contract provides for two
(2) one-year renewal options. He noted that this contract was the result of an RFP process. The Board previously
granted conditional approval of a contract with another vendor under the RFP for this service, contingent to receiving
the letter from Contract Compliance reflecting responsiveness to the County’s Minority and Women-Owned Business
Enterprise (M/WBE) Ordinance, but the vendor was found to be not responsive to the Ordinance. Therefore, the
administration went to the next responder to the RFP, which was Cardinal Health 200, LLC, which is now presented
for the Committee’s consideration. Chairman Estrada commented that this is a good example that shows that the
systems put in place to ensure compliance with the purchasing policies and M/WBE Ordinance do work the way they
should.
With regard to request number 24, Director Junge inquired regarding the number of institutions who are currently
using this type of technology for patient self-registration. Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer for Finance
and Strategy, responded that he will provide that information.
With regard to request number 27, Mr. Jones stated that this is a sole source contract, because of the special training
and expertise those individuals provide.
With regard to request number 29, Mr. Jones stated that this is a sole source contract, because it allows for data
gathering and custom reports to be produced for comparative analysis.
With regard to request number 30, Mr. Jones stated that this is a sole source contract for the purchase of a specialty
drug for a patient with a rare form of leukemia. In response to a question regarding request numbers 28 and 30
regarding how these purchases for medicines are reviewed from a clinical usage and treatment standpoint, Dr. John Jay
Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, stated that, with instances like this, there is not a formal peer review process per se,
but content experts are used in the process. With regard to request number 28, typically the clinical team caring for the
patient will make a recommendation directly to the Executive Medical Director, Dr. Claudia Fegan; this happens
infrequently, usually on a case-by-case review.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Butler, moved the approval of request numbers
1 through 30, subject to completion of review by Contract Compliance, where
appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Chairman Estrada abstained and voted PRESENT on request numbers 10 and 27.

C. Any items listed under Section III and IV

 IV. Recommendations, Discussion / Information Items
A. Report from Supply Chain Management
• Report of emergency purchases (Attachment #2)
Mr. Jones presented a report of one (1) emergency purchase for the Committee’s information.

V.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #3)
• Report
• Metrics
• Financial Statements through June 2016
Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed the report, which included metrics and Financial Statements
through June 2016. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
With regard to the information presented on the Income Statement, Board Chairman Hammock noted that, under
the category of Claims Expense, the actual amount shows $415,772,000, but the budgeted column does not reflect
an amount. Mr. Akpan indicated that the budgeted figure for Claims Expense is included in the “Other” category;
it was requested that this be corrected to accurately align in the proper category for Claims Expense.
With regard to the information presented on Purchased Services, Director Richardson-Lowry requested that Mr.
Akpan provide through the Chair a schedule associated with the “Others” category, as well as a schedule associated
with the types of consulting services and how that breaks out.
Mr. Elwell provided an update on budget assumptions, in order to set some of the scenario for what the Committee
will see on August 15th. He stated that this was a challenging budget year, and next year will probably be ten times
the challenge.
Mr. Elwell stated that, when the collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) were approved this year, what was
negotiated and approved was a 10.75% increase spread over the CBAs’ total number of years. In 2016, only part
of the year included increases, because the CBAs did not start at the beginning of 2016; however, 2017 will have a
full year of those salary increases - 2.2% and 2.0% increases to be spread over the year, totaling 4.2%. He noted
that this does not include step increases.
Mr. Elwell stated that the budget will also include things the administration has committed to do. It has committed
to do a better job at quality improvement and patient experience, so additional staff positions will be needed to
accomplish that. The organization also has to do better at denial management and getting patients registered, and
that will require additional positions.
Mr. Elwell stated that the administration knows that beginning next year, on October 1st, the states will have to pay
5% of the Affordable Care Act cost; that means that reimbursement will go from 100% to 95% from the federal
government. It is estimated that this may amount to between $24-30 million of additional cost to CCHHS or less
reimbursement to CCHHS, depending on how it is negotiated with the State.
Board Chairman Hammock stated that, with regard to the Strategic Plan, three-year financial projections have been
promised. Mr. Elwell responded that it is the administration’s full intention to do that. The projections will also
include those expenses that the County has historically taken care of for CCHHS that the administration thinks
will become a CCHHS expense in 2018 and 2019. Board Chairman Hammock requested that the projections
include one (1) schedule that shows what expense CCHHS is picking up for the first time so the Board can talk
about that and have a good understanding of it.
