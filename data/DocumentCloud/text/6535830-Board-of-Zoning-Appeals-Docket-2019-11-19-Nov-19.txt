Church of Our Father Baptist c/o Pastor Burnard Byles appeals
the decision of the Buildings Safety Engineering and
Environmental Department (BSEED SLU2019-00094) which
(Approved with Conditions) permission TO ADD BSEED a
Specially Designated Distributor’s (SDD) license (Carry-Out Sale
of Liquor for off-premise consumption) to an existing SDM
establishment (Carry-out Sale of Beer & Wine for off-premise
consumption) in an existing 5,415 square foot building in an B4
(General Business District). This case is appealed because appeals
to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any person, firm,
partnership or corporation, or by any City department,
commission, board or other City agency which is aggrieved 1) by
a decision of an enforcing officer, or 2) by any decision made by
the Buildings and Safety Engineering Department involving
Conditional Uses; Michigan courts have held that in order to meet
the “aggrieved person” standard, the appellant must prove that he
or she (or it, if the appellant is an organization) has suffered
special damages related to the beneficial use and enjoyment of
his/her own property that are not common to other property
owners similarly situated. The party filing the appeal must be more
than a mere resident of the City; he or she must be able to show
harm or damages that are unique to him or her, and to his/her
property, specifically. (Sections 50-4-102 Appeals, Michigan Case
Law on “Aggrieved Person” Standard and 50-3-381 General
