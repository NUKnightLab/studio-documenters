REQUESTING STATE’S ATTORNEY KIM FOXX TO APPEAR BEFORE THE BOARD OF
COMMISSIONERS TO DISCUSS THE STATE’S ATTORNEYS OFFICE’S DECISION TO
DISMISS ALL CHARGES IN THE JUSSIE SMOLLETT CASE
WHEREAS, Jussie Smollett alleged that he was a victim of a racist and homophobic hate crime in the
City of Chicago, County of Cook; and
WHEREAS, the alleged hate crime attack immediately received global media attention and the
immeasurable impact of this case has reflected poorly on the City of Chicago and Cook County

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

April 25, 2019

WHEREAS, the investigation by the Chicago Police Department revealed that the alleged hate crime
never occurred and was, in fact, staged by Jussie Smollett; and
WHEREAS, Jussie Smollett was indicted by a Cook County Grand Jury on 16 felony counts after
allegedly lying to police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic hate crime; and
WHEREAS, the decision by State’s Attorney Kim Foxx and her office to adjudicate the Smollett case in
an unprecedented manner caught the Mayor of Chicago and the Chicago Police Superintendent
completely off-guard and has left much doubt and many questions yet to be answered; and
WHEREAS, the overwhelming reaction from the legal community has been of shock and surprise by the
decision and it has left a negative perception that the State’s Attorney’s Office was neither fair and
equitable nor transparent in the adjudication of the Smollett case; and
WHEREAS, Cook County constituents deserve nothing less than honest and transparent answers to this
very troubling case; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby request that State’s Attorney Foxx appear before the next scheduled Finance Committee of the
Board of Cook County Commissioners to discuss the decision to dismiss all charges against Mr. Jussie
Smollett; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx be prepared to discuss
in-depth and take questions on the decision made by her office on the Jussie Smollett case. ..end

Summary: This contract will allow all County departments participate in the photocopier leasing program.
All equipment will be capable of network printing, faxing, and scanning. Cost per copy includes the use of
the equipment, maintenance services and all supplies (excluding paper).

It has been determined that leasing of multifunction photocopier equipment allows the County to achieve
significant savings when contrasted with purchasing and maintaining the same equipment. Additionally,
photocopier leasing contracts allow the County to keep up with technology by replacing the equipment
with each new contract. Finally, multifunction photocopier equipment allows departments to eliminate
stand-alone printers and fax machines which reduce capital, maintenance, and supply costs.
Competitively bidding procedures were followed in accordance with the Cook County Procurement Code.
Bids were solicited for leasing of multi-functioning digital copiers. Toshiba Business Solution was lowest,
responsive and responsible bidder.
The proposed contract will replace County Contract No. 1384-12815 (Konica Minolta), which expires on
May 1, 2019.

Summary: This sub-recipient contract with Loyola University will allow the Adult Probation Department
to comply with the grant award from the Bureau of Justice Assistance to develop and implement a
recidivism reduction program for high-risk probationers, and will include research and implementation
support from Loyola University Chicago. Loyola's participation will include developing an in-depth
implementation fidelity review plan, a process evaluation plan, and an outcome evaluation plan.

The successful implementation of this federal grant award requires a research partner that possesses
unique skills and knowledge related to the administration of community corrections in Cook County. To
perform the required grant activities, the research partner must have a strong knowledge and
understanding of the criminal justice system in Cook County, specifically the courts and probation. Loyola
University Chicago is the only university in the Chicago area with the necessary combination of criminal
justice system experience, an available pool of student research assistants, and a focus on action research
with dedicated capacity. Faculty and students in Loyola's Criminal Justice Department have a strong track
record of research in Cook County through recent initiatives, including the MacArthur Safety and Justice
Challenge, the Adult Redeploy Illinois Program, and positions on several statewide policy and oversight
bodies. Loyola University will be providing research support through the Center for Criminal Justice
Research, Policy, and Practice, which is a unique institution in Cook County.
This is a sole source procurement pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.
