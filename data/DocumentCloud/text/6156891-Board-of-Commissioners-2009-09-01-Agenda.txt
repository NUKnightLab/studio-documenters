ITEM #1
RECEIVED AND FILED
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 24, 2009 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
In accordance with the authority granted to me by Section 2-6008 of the Counties Code and for the
reasons stated herein, please transmit this veto message on the agenda for the next meeting of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners, September 1, 2009.
Please be advised that in accordance with the authority granted to me by Section 2-6008 of the Counties
Code, I am exercising my veto authority as President of the Board of Commissioners and hereby veto
Communication No. 300566 from the July 21, 2009 Finance Committee Meeting and approved at the July
21, 2009 Board Meeting through the passage of the Finance Committee Meeting Report in Agenda Item
No. 35 as amended. I hereby veto the amendments passed on July 21, 2009 to the Cook County Home
Rule Retailers Occupation Tax (Chapter 74 Taxation, Article IV, Sections 74-150 through 74-153).
As previously addressed to the Cook County Board of Commissioners, when I took office in December
2006, Cook County was facing a deficit of over $500 million in a budget of approximately $3 billion.
Ratification of union contracts with yearly pay increases and other enhancements with no identified
source of revenue to pay for them contributed heavily to that budget deficit—actions taken before I took
office. To solve the Fiscal Year 2007 budget crisis, I called on everyone in Cook County Government to
cut 17% from offices across the board. My office led the way with a 19% reduction from what was
budgeted in FY 2006.
Before taxpayers were asked for one penny more in taxes, my Administration made substantial cuts in
county government spending. This was also the 12th year that Cook County did not raise the property tax
levy on its homeowners. After much debate, the majority of the Board of Commissioners voted to raise
the Cook County portion of the sales tax by one penny for the Fiscal Year 2008 budget. The one penny
increase was the responsible course of action to take and obviously a majority of the Board of
Commissioners agreed in that stance.
On July 21, 2009, a majority of the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to repeal the one penny
sales tax increase by fifty percent without fully vetting the ramifications of such a reduction. Moreover,
the Board of Commissioners required that the Cook County Budget for Fiscal Year 2010 be based on the
actual revenue received in Fiscal Year 2009, and that there would be no further increase in taxes.
First of all, the Fiscal Year 2010 Budget cannot be based on the actual revenue received in Fiscal Year
2009 as required by the Board of Commissioners in Section 74-153 of the Retailer’s Occupation Tax
Ordinance. The Board of Commissioners are fully aware that the County will not have a record of the
actual Fiscal Year 2009 revenues until the end of the first quarter of the 2010 Fiscal Year. Moreover, it
would be fiscally imprudent to withhold the preparation of the 2010 Budget until notice of the actual 2009
revenues. The 2010 Budget as per previous budgetary appropriations is formulated through the
estimation of projected revenue and due to timing concerns, should not and cannot be based upon the
actual 2009 revenues; this requirement of Section 74-153 is erroneous on its face and impossible to
implement.
In addition to the erroneous requirement of the Board of Commissioners for the 2010 Budget to be based
upon 2009 actual revenue, the Board of Commissioners has failed to consider the extent of operational
burdens upon the County resulting from reductions in State funding for County related grants and core
programs, the structural deficit, operational costs of funding self-insurance, payment of the 2007 pension
obligation, the needs of the Health and Public Safety and Criminal Justice Systems as well as the funding
required for statutory and court related mandates before implementing a reduction in the sales tax and
reducing the Retailer’s Occupation Tax to 1.25% effective January 1, 2010.

ITEM #1 cont’d
Before taking this action, the County must perform its due diligence and ascertain the ramifications of a
reduction in the sales tax as well as the effect it will have on County government as well as the necessary
and important services it provides.
While I am vetoing the reductions and amendments to the Retailer’s Occupation Tax, I have directed the
Cook County Budget Director to begin the preparation for the Cook County 2010 Budget presentation
with consideration of reductions in the sales tax. Beginning the 2010 budget process at this early stage
will allow my Office as well as the Cook County Board of Commissioners to fully evaluate and consider
what a reduction in the sales tax will mean to Cook County and its taxpayers in advance of requiring a
reduction.
I have directed the Budget Director to request all Departments as well as the separately Elected Officials
to prepare three (3) potential budget requests for 2010 in order to understand the needs of the County and
the effects of a potential reduction in the sales tax.
In summary, the Fiscal Year 2010 Budget requests from County Departments and the offices of the
separately Elected Officials should:
1. Create, in the Budget Request Application, a budget equal to or less than the Fiscal Year 2009
Operating Budget (in the event the sales tax remains at 1.75%).
2. Create, in a separate spreadsheet, a budget that is 12% less than the Fiscal Year 2009 Operating
Budget (in the event that the sales tax is reduced to 1.25%) that identifies reductions for: object
accounts, positions being reduced, and identify whether they are filled or vacant, and services
being reduced or eliminated.
3. Create, in a separate spreadsheet, a budget that is 19% less than the Fiscal Year 2009 Operating
Budget (in the event that the sales tax is reduced to 1.25% and the funding for the 2007 Pension
Obligation must be paid out of General Funds) that identifies reductions for: object accounts,
positions being reduced, and identify whether they are filled or vacant, and services being
reduced or eliminated.
In addition to the above, the various Departments and offices of the separately Elected Officials shall
identify the use of countywide contracts and identify the amount used by said Department; furthermore, it
is required that any use of the 490, 499 and 899 accounts for expenditures that are submitted or controlled
by the various Departments be identified.
The above listed information has been requested and is due back to the Office of Budget and Management
Services on or before August 20, 2009.
Requiring this specific information will allow this Office and the Board of Commissioners to fully
understand the cuts that would have to be implemented in order to implement a reduction in the sales tax.
This requested information will be shared with the Cook County Board of Commissioners through the
Finance Chairman for Finance Committee consideration. Reviewing the proposed budgets including
potential reductions will aid in determining the appropriateness of the budget requests and that the County
offices and offices of the separately Elected Officials are focusing on its core mission, streamlining
County services and funding vital services.
I stand firm in my commitment to support County services and to provide adequate funding in order to
protect and provide for our County residents. I remain committed to consider reductions in the sales tax;
however said reductions must only be made at the appropriate intervals with a complete understanding of
what the effects of a reduction in revenue will have on County services and government.
While I hereby veto the actions of the Board of Commissioners on July 21, 2009 and veto the
amendments to the Cook County Home Rule Retailers Occupation Tax, I have simultaneously taken the
necessary steps to determine what the ramifications of a reduction in the sales tax will be and whether a
reduction would and should be supported by the Board of Commissioners, the separately Elected Officials
and the residents of Cook County.

For these reasons I urge you to reconsider your support of the amendments to the Cook County Home

ORDERING THE COOK COUNTY BUREAU OF HUMAN RESOURCES
TO IMPLEMENT RECOGNITION OF DOCTORS COUNCIL SEIU
AT STROGER HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY AND RELATED FACILITIES
WHEREAS, on March 31st the Service Employees International Union Local 20 (“Doctors Council
SEIU”) filed a Majority Interest Petition (“MIP”) with the Illinois Labor Relations Board ("ILRB") for
the physicians, dentists, podiatrists, and psychologists employed by the County of Cook at the John H.
Stroger, Jr. Hospital and related facilities (hereinafter “employees”); and
WHEREAS, the MIP was accompanied by the signatures of a majority of employees in the petitioned-for
units; and
WHEREAS, physicians and dentists at Provident Hospital of Cook County, the Ambulatory Community
Health Network, Cermak Health Services of Cook County and Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County are
currently represented by Doctors Council SEIU, which is a part of a national union of doctors, and have
an enforceable collective bargaining agreement; and
WHEREAS, Section 1210 of the Illinois Administrative Code, governing the ILRB pursuant to the
Illinois Labor Relations Act (5 ILCS 315/1, et seq. [the “Act”]), delineates the exclusive means by which
a public employer may recognize a labor organization as the bargaining representative for a specific
group of employees; and
WHEREAS, a labor organization seeking to be recognized as the representative for a proposed
bargaining unit which is currently unrepresented by another labor organization may: 1) request that the
employer voluntarily recognize it; or 2) file a representation petition with the ILRB under Section
1210.20(a) of the Act. In response, the employer may 1) agree to the voluntary recognition procedures
provided in the Act (Section 1210.160); 2) consent to a representation election; or 3) decline to respond to
the request; and
WHEREAS, on June 19, 2009, the Executive Director of the ILRB entered an Order and Direction of
Representation in a case entitled County of Cook and Cook County Health and Hospitals System and
Chicago Joint Board, Local 200, RWDSU-UFCW, No. L-RC-09-012, involving administrative assistants
at Provident Hospital of Cook County. In this order, the Executive Director determined that Cook County
is the sole employer of the Cook County Health & Hospitals System (“the CCHHS”) employees with the
authority to recognize a bargaining unit such as Doctors Council SEIU; and
WHEREAS, although both the County and the Cook County Health & Hospitals System have filed an
appeal seeking to overturn the Executive Director’s order, if the ILRB upholds the Executive Director’s
order, any future matters involving CCHHS employees would likewise be considered as if the County
were the sole employer; and
WHEREAS, contrary to the decision of the ILRB, the Cook County State's Attorney's Office ("CCSAO")
has concluded that the County and the CCHHS should be considered joint employers, who share or codetermine matters governing essential terms and conditions of employment, including recognizing
Doctors Council SEIU; and
WHEREAS, neither the ILRB nor the CCSAO have determined that CCHHS is the sole employer of
CCHHS employees with the sole authority to refuse recognition of Doctors Council SEIU.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that pursuant to the procedure by which a public employer
may recognize a labor organization under the Act, and pursuant to its authority as a sole employer as
determined by the ILRB, and pursuant to its authority as a joint employer as determined by the CCSAO,
the Cook County Board of Commissioners, in the interests of fairness and equal opportunity, hereby
recognizes Doctors Council SEIU for employees in the petitioned-for unit; and

WHEREAS, on August 19, 2009, the First Judicial District of the Illinois Appellate Court issued a
unanimous opinion upholding the dismissal of a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Blair Holt
Assault Weapons Ban, Cook County's Ordinance to Ban Assault Weapons, first passed by Cook County
in 1994 and amended in 2006; and
WHEREAS, the plaintiffs in the case, Wilson v. Cook County, sought to declare the ordinance
unconstitutional in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's holding in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008); and
WHEREAS, in upholding the dismissal of the suit, the Illinois Appellate Court agreed with the trial
court's findings that (1) the Ordinance is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad; (2) plaintiffs did not

violate the Illinois Constitution or the 2nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution; and (4) the County
properly exercised its police powers in enacting the Ordinance; and

WHEREAS, any rollback of the sales tax may create a budget deficit, which must be accounted for in
order to continue providing the services mandated by the Illinois State Constitution, despite ever
increasing costs to provide said services; and
WHEREAS, because personnel costs account for over 70 percent of the overall budget, any substantial
budget cut will necessitate a reduction in workforce; and
WHEREAS, consequently, in the past, several personnel related options have been presented to close
budget deficits, such as furlough days, layoffs, elimination of important services, etc., all of which affect
the quality and type of service delivery we provide; and
WHEREAS, it should not be the desire of this Board to seek to add to the list of the unemployed,
especially in light of current economic conditions; and
WHEREAS, this Honorable Body must not only seek to create efficiencies and savings, but must be
willing to propose and adopt creative solutions to solving our financial problems, without solely seeking
to terminate our dedicated employees, which not only hinders our ability to deliver core services, but also
undermines morale; and
WHEREAS, despite the above mentioned circumstances, it is incumbent upon all the employees of Cook
County, to be willing to be a part of the solution to resolving our financial situation; and
WHEREAS, Section 3 of the Illinois One Day Rest in Seven Act (ODRSA) (820 ILCS 140/) states that
“Every employer shall permit its employees who are to work for 7 1/2 continuous hours or longer at least
20 minutes for a meal period beginning no later than 5 hours after the start of the work period.” The
ODRSA only specifies payment be made for break periods to hotel room attendants as stated in Section
3.1 of the same Act, “(c)Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, every hotel room attendant shall
receive a minimum of 2 15-minute paid rest breaks and one 30-minute meal period in each workday on
which the hotel room attendant works at least 7 hours.”; and
WHEREAS, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not require breaks or meal periods be given to
workers, however it does require to compensate such breaks, should the employer decide to grant them
and at the same time request that the employee work during said breaks; and
WHEREAS, Section 4a of the Illinois Minimum Wage Law (820 ILCS 105/) states that “(1) Except as
otherwise provided in this Section, no employer shall employ any of his employees for a work week of
more than 40 hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the
hours above specified at a rate not less than 1 1/2 times the regular rate at which he is employed.”; and
WHEREAS, the FLSA regulations on overtime compensation coincide with Illinois law; and
WHEREAS, considering the models of compensation based on both Federal and State law and common
practices in the private sector, the following scenarios should be considered for changing Cook County’s
compensation policies:
a. Hourly paid employees would no longer be compensated for meal and break periods, but for
actual time worked per day/week. Hourly paid workers, who currently get 1 30-minute paid meal
and 2 15-minute paid breaks, would be paid for 7 hours actually worked, instead of the current
standard 8 hours that includes such rest periods;
b. Hourly paid employees would no longer be compensated for meal periods, but for actual time
worked per day/week and 2 15-minute paid breaks. Hourly paid workers, who currently get 1 30minute paid meal, and 2 15-minute paid breaks, would be paid for 7.5 hours worked, instead of
the current standard 8 hours that includes such rest periods;

paid breaks; or current shifts of 8 hours per day that includes a 30-minute paid meal break;
d. Salaried and hourly paid workers would no longer be compensated more than 7.5 hrs per day for
holidays, personal days, sick days or vacation days;
e. Overtime would be compensated only after 40 hours per week of actual time worked; and
WHEREAS, by adopting any of the above mentioned changes to Cook County’s compensation policies,
effectively reducing compensation for non-working time, Cook County Government will continue
providing the services mandated by law while reducing its current payroll obligations; and
WHEREAS, the County must bargain for any changes in the terms and conditions of employment with
union employees represented by a collective bargaining agent, and notice of the intent of this Resolution
must be sent to said bargaining agents representing said employees.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby urge that upon adoption of this Resolution, the President of the Board of the County of Cook send
notification to all County employee bargaining agents of the possible implementation of each of the
aforementioned changes that may be required for the FY2010 budget; and

were combined for letting as one construction contract as Group 1 – 2009, utilizing only the West
Bartlett Road project Section: 00-B1003-05-RP. Additional funding is required due to expansion of
the improvement scope to include landscaped medians along West Bartlett Road and
Munger/Naperville Road; channelization along West Bartlett Road at Naperville Road to provide dual
left-turn lanes and right-turn lanes; patching, widening and resurfacing 1500 feet along West Bartlett
Road from the Elgin, Joliet & Eastern Railway/Canadian National Railroad crossing to a point west
of Spitzer Road; construction of roadway embankment along new Munger Road; guardrail removal
and replacement; tree removal and replacement; and reimbursable utility relocation.

HON. ABISHI C. CUNNINGHAM, JR., Public Defender
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $200,000.00 from and to
the accounts listed below, for covering expenditures in the following accounts.
Reason:

Court Reporting - The court reporting account is almost depleted and with three months
remaining in the fiscal year, it is estimated we need another $143,000 in this account. The
shortage is due to increased court reporting fees and an increase in the number of cases going
to trial.

Travel - The travel budget is projected to be overspent by fiscal year-end. We feel an increase
of $23,000 is sufficient to take us to the end of the year.
Training - Additional funding is requested to accommodate attendance to the ABA and the
NLADA conferences. In addition, more funds are needed so our attorneys can meet the CLE

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and
what was the balance 30 days prior to that date?

Please note that the new administration has setup a monthly reporting system to review each line
item to see where we are trending. This is done by taking the annual budget for all non-personnel items,
dividing by 12 to obtain a monthly budget number. The ytd budget is determined by multiplying the
monthly budget by the number of months that have passed to obtain a ytd budget. These numbers are
then compared to the monthly and ytd actual expense and variances are reviewed.
268

Court Reporting - It was apparent in the July/August timeframe that we would need to
infuse this account with funds. The balance remaining on August 1 was approximately
$76,000 however; our office had sent invoices totaling another $50,000 to the
comptroller’s office that had not been processed. In addition, there was another $30,000
of invoices that were waiting to be processed by this office. The balance in this account
July 1 was 141,712.

190

Travel - The Chief Financial Officer and other staff in the Public Defender’s office
reviewed this account in July and August. It was determined that we should increase the
funds to accommodate the year-end rush we typically experience with this account as
well as to make sure we have enough funds to pay for out-of-town speaker travel
resulting from the upcoming Public Defender training program (held locally). The
balance remaining on August 1 was approximately $125,000. On a year-to-date basis,
this account was unfavorable by $4,400 (benching ytd expense against ytd budget). The
balance July 1 was $177,000.

186

Training - The funding for this account was requested by the Public Defender and other
staff in July so that persons from this office could attend additional conferences. The
available balance August 1 was $39,000 but is committed to other programs. The
balance on July 1 was $40,064.

2.

Moving Expenses and Remodeling - It was apparent the beginning of August that we
would need to infuse this account with funds. The balance remaining on August 1 was
$711. The balance July 1 was $711.

How were the accounts used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other
accounts that were also considered (but not used) as the source of transferred funds.
630

Rental office equipment - when the Chief Financial Officer saw that the available June
balance was $102,000 she began to investigate if/when the office might be hit with
additional charges. The investigation revealed that the previous administration had
planned for a countywide contract when they shouldn’t have as it is planned elsewhere.

818

Designated Funds - when the Chief Financial Officer reviewed this account and asked
what this account was used for, she learned that this account is used for matching funds
when grants are involved. There are no grants for 2009 so this money did not need to be
planned here by the previous administration.

225

Postage - when the Chief Financial Officer reviewed this account and saw that no
spending had taken place as of July, she investigated to find out what why. She
discovered that at the end of 2008, the postage reserve with Pitney Bowes was increased
and this was enough to carry the office through July 2009. So it was determined we
could move some money from this account without jeopardizing our postage needs for
2009.

260

Professional Services - when the Chief Financial Officer reviewed this account and
questioned why so little had been spent she was told that one of the professional services
contracts was not renewed (Bob Gulch) for 2009.

350

Office Supplies - On a year-to-date basis, we seem to be spending less than was
anticipated.

There is another account that was looked at (441 Operating, maintenance and repairs of
processing equipment) but we were not sure whether or not our office will be allocated expense
for this line item.
Although the expert witness account shows a healthy balance this is a timing issue. Typically, the
office has a heavy influx of expert witness invoices at year-end.
3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
This was mostly answered in question 2. The previous administration had erred in planning the
630 and 818 accounts. When the plan was originally done for the postage account, the reserve
probably had not been increased at that point. The $16,000 taken out of the office supply account
is making up the balance of what we think we will need for court reporting.

"CONNECTING" COOK COUNTY BROADBAND EXPANSION PROJECT
WHEREAS, Cook County will be applying for an estimated $68.5 million total in three applications for
the Federal Stimulus funding from the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), a part of
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. BTOP’s aims are potentially
transformative: building new broadband infrastructure to connect community anchor institutions and
underserved residents, expanding the capacity of neighborhood public computer centers, and fostering
sustainable adoption of broadband through innovative programs; and

ITEM #64 cont’d
WHEREAS, Cook County Government, Public Safety, Public Health Care Operations, Employee and
Resident Services are increasingly dependent on our communication infrastructure. With the continuing
and escalating threats enabled by the daily dependency on technology there is an increasing need to
“harden” and secure our infrastructure. To accomplish this and provide these critical services to our
residents, Cook County will be required to provide grant matching funds of 20% for the Infrastructure
Grant portion of the request or approximately $7.7 million; and provide grant matching funds of 20% for
the Public Computer Center (PCC) Grant portion of the request or approximately $2.0 million; and
provide grant matching funds of 20% for the Sustainable Broadband Adoption (SBA) Grant portion of the
request or approximately $4.0 million for a Total Matching Grant requirement of $13.7 Million; and
WHEREAS, Cook County will be a collaborative partner with the City of Chicago in its separate and
distinct BTOP application which will also require an additional Cook County proportionate match of
approximately $4.4 Million; and
WHEREAS, Cook County’s comprehensive approach to solving these continually expanding needs will
benefit the 5.3 million residents of Cook County via the following three main components:
1. The hubs will provide advanced broadband services to County facilities which include 22
existing Sheriff’s Office Radio Towers, six Court Houses, six Highway Department facilities,
three hospitals, five One Stop Centers of the President’s Office of Employment Training
(POET), a Sheriff’s Training facility, and the County’s main warehouse. These locations will
serve as anchor institutions in the community and provide vital County services;
2. Five pilot Cook County workforce development centers will be connected for the purpose of
supporting thousands of low-income adults and children with fiber-optic service and
advanced broadband wireless capability to enable Internet access to users within a potential
range of 15-20 miles from specific access points. The centers will enhance their workforce
development curriculum to include computer literacy training programs, children outreach
and adult reading literacy programs; and
3. Through the construction and implementation of a County-owned fiber optic network which
will connect existing Sheriff’s Office Radio Towers and all County owned buildings, Cook
County will extend its fiber optic network and optimize the use of its existing tower
infrastructure, terrestrial capacity, and provide accessible wireless high-speed broadband
services. The initiative will provide advanced “last-mile” technologies to service the
community and low-income residential cost-saving solutions.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners supports
the Bureau of Technology and the City of Chicago’s applications for federal stimulus grants offered
through the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) of the American Recovery and
Revitalization Act (ARRA) of 2009.

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent that Account 235-449 would require additional funds on May 12, 2009, due to a
decision to expand the Electronic Monitoring of Impact Incarceration Post-Release participants.
The balance on this date was $198.00 and thirty days prior was $856.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 211-449 was identified as the source of transferred funds because of a unanticipated
surplus in this account. No other accounts were considered.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 211-449.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
This account has a surplus due to the fact that when the Budget was prepared in the Fall of 2008,
we did not have a firm amount for the new Motorola Maintenance Contract. We anticipated the
amount of the contract to be $2,100,000.00 per year, but the actual cost was $1,651,000.00. This
has resulted in a surplus for this account.
