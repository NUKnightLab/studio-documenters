The Chairperson convened the Public Hearing portion of the meeting by inviting residents and
the public at large to address the Board.
Immediately following the Public Hearing Session, Terry Peterson, Chief Executive Officer,
presented his monthly report. Per Mr. Peterson, due to the myriad of complaints received from
tenants regarding maintenance issues, on April 8th, in cooperation with the City of Chicago, a
group of eight person-teams began "walkdowns" of all the high-rises to identify problems that
have not been addressed. According to Mr. Peterson, substandard apartments are immediately
brought into compliance or the occupants are given the option of relocating to a "make-ready"
unit. To date, "walkdowns" at Stateway, ABLA, Horner and Cabrini have been completed. Mr.
Peterson concluded his report by assuring the Commissioners and residents that he would
continue to do everything possible to improve the quality of life for the residents of the Chicago
Housing Authority.
