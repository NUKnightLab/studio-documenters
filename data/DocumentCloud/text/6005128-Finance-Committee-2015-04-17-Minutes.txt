George Blakemore

Concerned Citizen

Chairman Collens noted that there has been quite a bit in the news recently about contract issues at the College of
DuPage and Chicago Public Schools; therefore, he thought this is a good time to remind everyone about the
System’s contracting processes. Under this very intensive process, all contracts are required to be reviewed and
signed-off on by Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, and Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive
Officer of Finance and Strategy. Chairman Collens stated that he personally reviews all of the contracts that are
presented for this Committee’s consideration; the contracts are then reviewed by this Committee and are approved
by the full Board. He has confidence that there is a very strong internal process in place.

III. Action Items (continued)
C. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #2)
Mr.Elwell provided an overview of the requests presented for the Committee’s consideration. The Committee
reviewed and discussed the requests.
Review of all of the requests by Contract Compliance has not yet been completed; it was respectfully requested
that the Committee conditionally approve these requests, pending the completion of review by Contract
Compliance.
With regard to request number 5, Mr. Elwell presented additional information. He stated that these services
are being brought in-house; however, the administration is not quite ready for that to happen, so this contract is
being extended for two months. The vendor will have applications that they will have taken by the time their
contract ends on June 30th; based on the contract, the System will pay the vendor a 7% contingency fee after
that period, so those applications will get processed and approved. On June 30th, the fixed fee stops, but their
contingency will continue until the System has collected on all those accounts. Mr. Elwell stated that the
administration has been very conservative in estimating what that contingency fee will total; he estimates that
it will total approximately $3 million of the $5 million increase amount, and will probably play out over a six
month period.
Director Estrada, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of request numbers
1 through 14, subject to completion of review by Contract Compliance where
appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
D. Any items listed under Section III

IV. Report from the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy (Attachment #3)
A. Quarterly report to CCHHS Board
i. Financial Statements (Attachment #4)
ii. Metrics (Attachment #5)
Mr. Elwell provided an overview of the Report, Financial Statements and Metrics. The Committee reviewed
and discussed the information.
During the review of the Report, Board Chairman Hammock inquired regarding the additional revenue
amounts from the State, as referenced by Mr. Elwell and mentioned on slide 2 of the presentation; he asked
whether those amounts apply to FY2015 revenue items, or whether they date back to FY2014. Mr. Elwell
responded that some relate to FY2015, but some also relate to FY2014; he noted that these were not accrued,
because the administration was in disagreement with the State and therefore did not have the State’s
acknowledgement of the numbers. Board Chairman Hammock noted that, as things progress during the year, it
would be helpful if the administration could keep present in the Board’s minds those revenues recognized this
fiscal year but attributable to another fiscal year.
During the discussion of slide 14 of the Finance Dashboard, Mr. Elwell indicated that the slide should be
labeled as CountyCare: MLR (Medical Loss Ratio).

IV. Report from the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy

A. Quarterly report to CCHHS Board (continued)
During the discussion of slide 16 of the Finance Dashboard, Mr. Elwell noted that, on the subject of accounts
receivable, the administration is currently working on an issue regarding a number of accounts that are over
two years old that have been carried over instead of being written-off; it was a past practice to not want to
write many accounts off, but these need to be cleaned up, as the System is not going to get paid for them. The
System has already reserved for them, so these accounts are not included in its net receivables.
With regard to slide 20 of the Finance Dashboard, Chairman Collens noted that it would be more useful and
informative to split out the physical plant data from the equipment data; this would give the Board a better
sense of the status. Director Velasquez inquired whether an inventory of equipment has been done. Mr.
Elwell responded that this has not been done in a long time; the administration is taking a look at that, and is
taking a look at how equipment is tagged.

iii. Focus Area Presentation – Information Technology (Attachment #6)
Donna Hart, Chief Information Officer, provided an overview of the presentation on Information Technology.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of slide 3 of the presentation, Chairman Collens inquired whether the Health
Information Systems (HIS) Department supports CountyCare. Ms. Hart responded that HIS supports some
portions of CountyCare, relating to Business Intelligence. Mr. Elwell provided additional information. He
stated that, besides HIS support with Business Intelligence, the other functions relating to CountyCare,
including claims processing, reporting to the State, and grievances and appeals, are supported by an outside
vendor serving as the Third Party Administrator.
Ms. Hart stated that another presentation is expected to be provided relating to security and disaster recovery in
the near future. With regard to the subject of disaster recovery, she provided additional information on mirror
sites that exist on both on-site and remote locations.
B. Report of emergency purchases (Attachment #7)
Details were provided on two emergency purchases that were recently made.

C. Strategic Issue Review
i. CountyCare Update (Attachment #8)
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided an overview of the information contained in the
CountyCare Update. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the information provided on slide 8, questions were raised regarding denials of new
requests for Harvoni, a drug used to treat/cure Hepatitis C. Mr. Glass stated that he can distribute the prior
authorization protocol for the Committee’s information. He noted that, if denied, the main option available to
members is to appeal the decision; he added that the appeal could go all the way up to the State for a hearing.

C. Strategic Issue Review
i. CountyCare Update (continued)
With regard to the information on slide 9, Board Chairman Hammock noted that, from the pharmacy chart, the
Integrated Care Program (ICP) group has a very expensive pharmacy bill; he asked what the Committee should
be expecting in terms of pharmacy expense. Mr. Glass responded that the State, in building its rates of what it
pays the System, has the projections of what profit and costs would look like; he stated that a line relating to
those projections will be added to next month’s presentation for both the ICP and Family Health Plan (FHP)
populations.
Director Butler, seconded by Director Estrada, moved to receive and file the six (6)
reports under Section IV. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
