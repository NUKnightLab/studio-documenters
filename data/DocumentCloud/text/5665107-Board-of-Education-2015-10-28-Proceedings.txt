accordance with Section of the School Code. The academic performance standards
set out in this policy utilize the key indicators of performance and the rating designations set out in the
Board's School Quality Rating Policy applicable to all Chicago Public Schools, including
charters per the terms of their agreement.

This policy also ensures that (1) there is transparency regarding the expectations and standards for
charter school academic performance; and (2) the portfolio of charter schools available to Chicago
families and students contains high quality schools.

POLICY TEXT:

I. SCOPE OF POLICY: The charter school performance standards outlined in this policy shall
inform the decisions throughout the District?s annual charter school evaluation cycle as well as the
Board's determinations regarding a charter school?s expansion or replication, non-renewal and/or

if the charter school or campus on the Academic Warning List achieves an SQRP rating of Level 2+ or
higher, the school or campus shall be removed from the Academic Warning List, regardless of its two-
year SQRP point value average or the number of consecutive years it achieved a Level 2 rating.

levels approved, or increasing by more than 10% of the total of the authorized student enrollment at any
charter school or campus.

if the charter is permitted under section 27A-5(b) of the Illinois School Code to operate more than one
campus, or increasing the number of single-site charters granted to the same operator

STANDARDS FOR CHARTER SCHOOL EXPANSION: If a charter school seeks to expand, the
CEO will make recommendations to the Board for approval of school expansion based on the following
standards:

(A) Charter school operators who operate a single-site charter school will have their applications for
expansion recommended to the Board for approval if the school has a current two-year SQRP point value
average of 3.2.

applicatiOns for expansion recommended to the Board for approval if all of the operator?s schools or

contract, the CEO will make recommendations to the Board on school renewal based on the following
standards:
