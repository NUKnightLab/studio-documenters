After the initial roll call, three of the five Board members needed for a quorum were
present. Chairman Wolff suggested moving to agenda items that did not require a
quorum.
Chairman’s Remarks
Chair Wolff welcomed the group and mentioned that a board’s contributions fall into
three categories: fiduciary, strategic, and generative/creative. She said while the other
responsibilities are often clear, it can be difficult to make time for the generative/creative
function, and it is the Strategic Opportunity’s Committee job to step back and think about
what big-picture intentions for the justice system in Illinois might look like. This meeting
will provide an opportunity for this work.
Executive Director’s Report
Director Maki thanked Chair Wolff for her insight and said his intention for the meeting
was to describe projects that are moving from planning to implementation. He asked for
the members’ feedback on the Authority’s progress and future.
Justice Assistance Grant Updates
Director Maki reported that the Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program had been moved
into a Grant Accountability and Transparency Act-compliant structure. Conflicts between
the state and federal calendars, staffing bandwidth, designing strategic funding groups,
and including research staff were cited as hurdles overcome during implementation.
Goals of delivering statewide benefit through JAG programs have been reached by
incorporating research and information sharing, Director Maki said, particularly with the
inception of the Department of Information and Technology. Competing with the private
sector in recruiting talent has proven difficult, though ICJIA has a history of innovation
in crime-mapping technology, he said.
Chair Wolff encouraged the group to define “statewide benefit,” and give their thoughts
on whether progress had been made toward the goal. Director Maki answered that it did
not have a static definition, but rather was an orientation that the Authority uses to

 interpret research on what the state needs at different points in time. Ms. Campanelli said
the benefit that ICJIA can provide is violence prevention by meeting client needs, such as
reentry programs. Ms. Vollen-Katz added that statewide benefit does not necessarily
mean every citizen profits from every program, but that funding decisions should be
made with intentionality toward learning how to solve a problem so that the knowledge
can be shared.
When Director Maki added that geographic diversity was also a piece of achieving
statewide benefit, Ms. Vollen-Katz said she appreciated the Authority hosting training
and events outside of Cook County.
Mr. Delfino stated that he is seeing progress in including all jurisdictions, but many
southern counties still have unmet basic needs. He said his office has plans to organize a
meeting with new prosecutors who may not know what resources are available to them
and Chair Wolff suggested including ICJIA in the event. Judge Robb suggested Authority
representation at bi-annual state’s attorneys' and public defenders' associations meetings
to discuss how to apply for grants.
Ms. Hora asked about conducting a needs assessment for JAG funding similar to what
was conducted for Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) funds. Director Maki said JAG was
initially set up to address law enforcement equipment needs rather than programs and it
can be difficult to allocate funds to innovative programming or research.
Chair Wolff revisited Ms. Campanelli’s statement on violence prevention as the goal of
the justice system. Mr. Chadd responded that the goal should be achieving accurate
convictions, and Ms. Campanelli agreed. Ms. Vollen-Katz summarized both goals by
suggesting that the common objective is reduced justice system contact. Ms. Desai
reminded the group of the JAG priorities that had been agreed upon in 2016. Judge Robb
suggested that those goals should be discussed regularly in committee meetings.
Director Maki said that percentages of JAG funding will not be set aside for particular
program areas. Though available amounts are indicated in public Notices of Funding
Opportunities, they can be adjusted based on the volume and quality of responses,
especially during this first year.
Ms. Hora suggested the committee could receive a presentation of how the $4.2 million
in JAG funding is divided. Director Maki welcomed future discussions about whether
specific amounts or proportions should be set aside for innovative approaches. He added
that all policies will be taken to the Authority Board for approval.
Director Maki said the committee had moved JAG into a competitive funding structure,
informed by the Research & Analysis Unit’s work. ICJIA also has adopted a no-match

 policy, following guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice. Director Maki also
relayed the recommendation that the Authority follow the GATA structure in offering
three-year grant cycles.
Victims of Crime Act and Violence Against Women Act Updates
Director Maki laid out the anticipated Victims of Crime Act and Violence Against
Women Act funding calendar. He said the first notice of funding opportunity under the
new competitive structure was for comprehensive legal assistance and the next will be for
unmet needs for victims of child abuse, community violence, financial exploitation, and
impaired driving. Ms. Brennan said legal assistance funding has been offered by ICJIA in
the past, but not to this degree ($6 million). She said VOCA guidelines now allow for a
greater range of services to be covered. Director Maki added that the Authority will be
following federal recommendations in centralizing victim services, rather than funding
single legal experts at various locations.
Policy Updates
Director Maki reported that the Criminal Justice & Sentencing Reform Commission
report was released in January and the next Board meeting will include a panel of
Commission members. Chair Wolff asked what the mechanism would be for monitoring
progress on implementing the Commission’s recommendations. Director Maki answered
that it would likely be the combined responsibility of ICJIA, the Sentencing Policy
Advisory Council, and local criminal justice coordinating councils, and that he would be
seeking the input of the Board to assign state-level accountability.
Director Maki reported ICJIA also recently became responsible for coordinating the Sex
Offenses and Sex Offender Registration Task Force. He said the task force is charged
with developing a report on sex offender registration, recidivism, and risk-assessment,
and how Illinois aligns with national best practices in the treatment of people who
commit sexual crimes.
Future Meeting Dates
The 2017 SOC meeting schedule was proposed. The next meeting will be held at the end
of March. The committee then will convene every two months.
Public Comment
There was no public comment.
