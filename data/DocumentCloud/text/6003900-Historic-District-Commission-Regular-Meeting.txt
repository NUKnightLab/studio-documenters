PROJECT Structural Assessment. 2 Story arraige House
LOCATION: 2827 John St.
Detroit. MI
DATE: October 18. 2017
ATTENTION: Michael Vanoverbeke


Ingram Engineering Services. Inc. (IE8) representative David O'Connell was present at 2827
John St. on Wednesday. October 18. 2017 to perform a visual structural inspection and
assessment of the stability of the east and north brick extu'ior walls. Renewed components
include the walls themselves and the retraining ?oor framing that serves to partially brace than.
The inspection covered readily visible structure only. no material was removed to expose
concealed elements. Neither destructive nor nondestructive testing were performed. No survey
was performed as part of this assessment. all dimensional information is approximate based on
visual estimates only. Although mostly destroyed. mechanical. electrical. plumbing equipment.
waterproo?ng. roo?ng. other architectural and structural elements were not renewed.

The property is a two-story brick carriage house measuring approximately 54 (east-west) 30
(north-south). The front of the building faces east onto John Street. Although the date of
original construction is unknown it is believed the structure is over 100 years old The property
experienced signi?cant fire damage. IES was informed that the ?re occurred approximately 17
years ?ago. The roof is completely gone exposrng the interim of the structure to the elements.
The 2 ?oor ?aming is likewise mostly destroyed with only some joists remaining.

The roof framing is nonemstent. therefore it is not possible to determine its original
con?guration

The 2? ?oor joists are 2xll wood members spanning across 3 bays. Each bay is approximately
an 18 span east-west. The east and west ends of the Joists are pocketed into the east and west
exterior brick walls. These walls are typically 12" thick constructed of 3 wythes of red brick.
There are two interior lines of support for the 2x12 Joists. The cast interior line of support is a
'drop girder consisting of 5-2x14 wood members bolted together spanning 30 it. The drop
girder is supported on brick pilasters measuring approximately 21"x21" built into the north and
south exterior walls. The west interior line of support is a 12" thick. 3 wytbe. brick wall at the
north end and a steel beam spanning ?om the end of this interior brick wall to the south exterior
wall. There are numerous makeshi? props located below the drop girda. the steel beam and the
Joists themselves

RECORBIENDATIONS

 

Based on the observations noted above and supporting engineering calculations. it is 
conclusion that the gable con?gurations on the exterior walls are potentially unstable and
hazardous. They are at risk of collapse under an extreme wind event (gusts in excess of 60 mph).
rain or other environmental loading. IES calculations indicate that the free-standing gable
formations need to be braced near the top and 2? ?oor. down to the ground.

Generally. the walls away from the gables have enough strength to remain stable under code
level wind loading. so it is only necessary to brace the gables. Sawn lumber ?aming in the form
of diagonal props. as shown in the attached structural sketches are capable of providing enough
bracing to prevent the walls from falling into the street under code level wind forces.

Please note that the south and west walls which border private property are similarly susceptible
to an extreme wind event. Likewise. the north and east walls. even with the proposed shoring are
still susceptible to an inward collapse. The owner of the property and of the adjacent properties
must prevent access to the areas near these walls.

Alternatively. IES can provide a similar bracing scheme to prevent an inward collapse and or
collapse of the south and west walls.

STRUCTURAL REPORT

BUILDING CONDITION

Although the date of construction of the buildings at 2827 John is unknown, it is believed the carriage house
was built in the late 1800?s/early 1900?s. The one?story building appears to have been built after the carriage
house. The property experienced ?re damage 17 years ago.

The carriage house roof collapsed as well as part of the second-floor framing (Photo 1). The existing brick wall is
currently unbraced and will need stabilization during construction and in the final design. The gables at the
north and east were previously rebuilt (Photo 2). All remaining gables will need to be removed for safety, the
existing wall will need to be stabilized and the gables will be rebuilt after construction (Refer to The
existing brick of the carriage house is in good condition. A large opening was created between the carriage
house and one-story building. It appears this opening was created when the one~story building was constructed.
Part of the opening was infilled with CMU, not original to building (Photo 3).

The one story building does not appear original with the carriage house. Part of the walls are CMU and do not
match the period of the brick of the carriage house (Photo 4). Similar to the carriage house, part of the roof has
collapsed. The existing brick is in very poor condition. The existing steel Iintels above the windows and doors
have rusted and caused the brick to crack around the steel (Photo 5). In addition, there are several large step
cracking around the corners and several other locations around the building (Photo 6).

The final design intention has several of the existing columns and load bearing interior walls being demolished.

This will require reframing if the existing structure is kept. In addition, the contractor will face challenges trying
to construct the new concrete building around the existing.



See Ingram Engineering Services. Inc. Report dated October 18, 2017 for additional structural assessment of the
existing carriage house.

2827 JOHN STREET: NEIGHBORHOOD ENGAGEMENT 

 

May 1, 2018

To Whom It May Concern,

Below is a summary of our formal interactions with the Bnish Park CDC as well as informal
meetings with concerned neighborhood residents regarding 2827 John 105 Alfred St 
112 Edmund PI

November 2017 - Formal presentation to the Bnish Park CDC regarding increased
height on 112 Edmund Pl as well as the first formal presentation for 2827 John 
and 105 Alfred. At the time the project was well received by the CDC and was
slated for approval. It was after this presentation that a few residents and board
members (who were not present at this meeting) expressed concerns about 105
Alfred St (parking deck).

March 13 2018 - In response to residents concerns regarding 105 Alfred St we had
another formal presentation to the Brush Park CDC. Our team presented an
updated design (from the November presentation) and received aggressive push
back from a handful of residents. mostly regarding the proposed commercial space
at the ground floor of 105 Alfred St and the perceived increase in automobile
queuing on Alfred as a result of the parking CDC declined to support 105
Alfred St until residents concerns were addressed.

0 April 4 2018 - Our second informal meeting with Brush Park residents. We lowered
the parking structure by one floor and developed a townhouse program on Alfred St
that was very well received. Everyone in attendance was very pleased with our
efforts to address their concerns and it was agreed upon that full support would be
given by all in attendance.

0 April 17 2018 - It was brought to our attention that the residents of The Canton were
not aware of our project and were very concemed with the height and programming
112 Edmund PI. We agreed to have a GoToMeeting with two members of their
board to elaborate on the impact of the building. Attempts were made to explain
that their views would be minimally impacted and that the program of our building
was appropriate for the location (as well as conforming with all applicable zoning
and code regulations). A spirited discussion was had on these merits and it was
agreed upon by all parties that we would have another presentation that would
include more residents of the building on May 2 2018.

To the best of our knowledge, the above represents an accurate representation of the
interactions between Terranovus Development and residents of the Brush Park community.
