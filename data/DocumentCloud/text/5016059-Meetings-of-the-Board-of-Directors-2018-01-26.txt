i. Metrics
ii. Meeting Minutes, which include the following action items and report:
• Contracts and Procurement Items (detail was provided as an attachment to the Board Agenda)
Director Estrada provided an overview of the Meeting Minutes. Charles Jones, Chief Procurement Officer, provided a
brief overview of the contractual requests that were considered at the Finance Committee Meeting. It was noted that there
is one (1) request that is pending review by Contract Compliance.
The Board discussed the subject of Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprise (M/WBE) participation in CCHHS
contracts. Chairman Hammock noted that the administration has been in frequent dialogue with many of the
Commissioners regarding the extent of M/WBE participation in CCHHS’ procurement. While CCHHS has always been
compliant with the County rules, some Commissioners feel like it needs to go beyond compliance, and should try to grow
the minority activity. He requested that the Finance Chair, Mr. Jones and Mr. Akpan develop a metric on this subject that
is reported to the Board periodically. Director Suleiman Gonzalez recommended that the data be benchmarked with the
past fiscal year, if possible. Dr. Shannon commented that one challenge for this is that the database for this is maintained
by the County’s Department of Contract Compliance; the administration is having conversations with them about the
possibility of CCHHS staff having read-only access and the ability to extract from that.
Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, provided an update on the metrics/financials. He stated that staff are still working
to complete the financial reports for the end of the fiscal year. He expects that a draft version should be available in time
for the Finance Committee Meeting in February.
Director Suleiman Gonzalez, seconded by Director Junge, moved the approval of the Minutes of
the Meeting of the Finance Committee of January 19, 2018. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.
