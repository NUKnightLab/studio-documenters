A RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE HOUSE BILL 4100, THE RENTAL HOUSING
SUPPORT PROGRAM (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Transmitting a Communication
sponsored by Larry Suffredin, Cook County Commissioner; Co-Sponsored by Roberto
Maldonado, Cook County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE HOUSE BILL 4100, THE RENTAL HOUSING
SUPPORT PROGRAM
WHEREAS, Cook County is committed to respect the human rights of all people,
including the right to adequate housing for all; and
WHEREAS, an affordable housing crisis exists in Cook County as evidenced by the
fact that there are 191,260 households in Cook County earning less than 30% of area
median ($22,500 for a family of four) who are rent burdened, meaning they pay more
than 35% of their income for rent; and
WHEREAS, 7,280 households are on Cook County Housing Authority waiting lists for
public housing and housing choice vouchers; and
WHEREAS, HUD’s fair market rent for a 2-bedroom apartment in Cook County is
$951.00; and a household in Cook County earning 30% of area median income can
only afford to pay $515.00 a month for rent; and
WHEREAS, House Bill 4100, the Rental Housing Support Program, which is currently
pending in the Illinois General Assembly, would alleviate the affordable housing crisis
in Cook County by creating a rental subsidy program for households earning less than
30% of area median income funded by a new $10.00 state surcharge for the
recordation of any real estate related document and such surcharge would be
evidenced upon collection by a state seal from the Illinois Department of Revenue;
and

WHEREAS, the program created by HB 4100 is modeled after a very successful
program in Chicago, the Chicago Low-Income Housing Trust Fund and the Trust Fund
has been in existence for over ten years and currently subsidizes over 2,000 units of
housing in Chicago; and
WHEREAS, the passage of HB 4100 would result in an estimated $14 million to be
allocated to Chicago and Cook County housing agencies to provide rental subsidies;
and
WHEREAS, the passage of HB 4100 would result in at least 1,600 new units of
affordable housing in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, HB 4100, would create a new $10.00 state surcharge on real estate
recordings to fund the Rental Housing Support Program, with Cook County to receive
$1.00 for every affected filing generating an estimated $1.2 million to go directly to the
County's general revenue fund to cover the County's costs for collecting the fee
created by the bill; and
WHEREAS, all of the funds generated in Cook County through the collection of the
surcharge will go to serve low income households in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, Mayor Richard M. Daley and the City of Chicago are in support of HB
4100 and urge the passage of the measure.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that the Board does hereby declare its support for House Bill 4100
and urges the members of the Illinois General Assembly to pass House Bill 4100, and
in sequence, to urge the Governor to sign the measure into law.
