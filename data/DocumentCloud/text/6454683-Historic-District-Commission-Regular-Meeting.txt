STAFF REPORT: 10-9-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6489
ADDRESS: 90 SEWARD
HISTORIC DISTRICT: NEW CENTER
APPLICANT: BRAIN HURTIENNE
DATE OF COMPLETE APPLICATION: 9/10/2019
DATE OF STAFF SITE VISIT: 10/1/2019

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

SCOPE: INSTALL NEW BALCONIES
EXISTING CONDITIONS
The building at 90 Seward is a 4-story, masonry building known as the Saxer Apartment Annex. The
building was erected ca. 1924 and features limestone cladding at the primary elevation, and red brick at the
side and rear elevations. Red brick is also located at the building’s light wells. Windows are non-historic
aluminum units. The building’s front elevations features decorative detailing such as curved arch
pediments at the parapet, pilasters, and rustication at the first and second stories. The parapet also features
historic-age/original clay tiles.

PROPOSAL
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval for the following work
items:

 East and West Elevations (Light wells)
 At each unit, remove one existing window and saw cut brick to lengthen opening in order to
accommodate the installation of a new fiberglass single door (color not specified) with glass
transom. Each door will lead to a new balcony. The new balcony decks will measure 6’-0”x 12’4” and will be constructed of wood with wood decking. Each deck will also feature aluminum
picket railing which will measure 3’-6” high. The new decks will not be painted.
STAFF OBSERVATIONS AND RESEARCH
 The new balconies will not be visible from the public right of-way as they are located within the
light wells
 The windows which will be removed and replaced with doorways are not historic age
ISSUES
 None
RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the work as proposed will not result in the removal of historic materials or the
alteration of features and spaces that characterize the property. The work is also compatible with the
building’s historic character. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness for the work as proposed because it meets the Secretary of the Interior Standards for
Rehabilitation, standards #2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The
removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be
avoided and #9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic
materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be
compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the
property and its environment. However staff recommends that the Commission issue this COA with the
condition that the balconies are either painted or stained a color which matches the buildings trim and that
the color of the new fiberglass doors be reviewed and approved by HDC staff prior to the work’s initiation.

  90 & 100 Seward Renovation
August 26, 2019
Ms. Jennifer Ross, Historic Specialist
City of Detroit, Planning & Development Department
2 Woodward Avenue, Suite 808
Detroit, MI 48226
Re:

90 & 100 Seward Renovation
Virginia Park Historic District

Ms. Ross,
We respectfully submit this enclosed description of both 90 and 100 Seward Renovation projects to the City of
Detroit Historic District Commission for review. This project is applying for the Federal Historic Preservation Tax
Incentive with Kristine Kidorf as the lead consultant preparing the tax credit applications to submit to the State
Historic Preservation Office.
Project Description
Both buildings, 90 and 100 Seward, were purchased about 1 year ago to renovate and update much of the building
to accommodate new residents. The buildings were completely vacant and in need of repair.
The existing buildings are 3-story with basement walk-ups. Both building plans have courtyards or lightwells with
an undulating plan offering light to the apartment spaces. The buildings are brick masonry load bearing structures
with wood framed floors, corridor walls, and roofs.
The buildings fill up their sites with only the courtyards / lightwells and some rear space between the alley and the
building as available space. All site space is paved or covered with solid surface material.
The buildings underwent a gut rehabilitation and reconfiguration in the early 2000’s. The windows were replaced
at that time and will remain yet be repaired or broken sash replaced. The unit configuration did change and is now
proposed to change slightly within the same overall building unit configuration.
Exterior Conditions
• The windows are in good condition and will remain as is, with repair.
• Front and rear doors will remain and be repaired.
• The front limestone façade is in good condition and will be tuckpointed.
• The front decorative roof of 90 Seward is in good condition and will remain as is.
• The brick masonry in the courtyards / lightwells and rear is in good condition and will not be cleaned.
Brick masonry will be replaced where required of existing broken or spalled brick. New brick will match
the existing common brick. All masonry will be pointed with mortar to match the existing adjacent in
color and texture.
• The parapet top cap of existing clay tile will remain as is.
• The roof will remain and be patched.
• New balconies will be installed in the courtyards / lightwells. One window of each unit will be changed to
a door for access to the balcony, per unit. The new door is proposed to be fiberglass with a window per
the attached brochure. Please review the enclosed drawings as well.

 (d)

The design treatment level of the New Center Area Historic District shall be
rehabilitation, as provided for in section 25-2-2.

(e)
follows:

The defined elements of design, as provided for in section 25-2-2, shall be as

(1)

Height All houses that were originally single or two-family have two (2) full stories plus
an attic or finished third floor within the roof; these are generally called "two-and-a halfstory" houses. The few terraces in the district are two (2) or two and one-half (2%)
stories tall. Apartment buildings range in height from three (3) to ten (10) stories; the
majority are four (4) stories tall. Additions to existing buildings shall be related to the
existing structure; new building in New Center Commons (Delaware, Pallister and
Bethune) and on Virginia Park shall meet the following standards:
i.

The six (6) adjoining structures on the same face, excluding churches and commercial structures, shall be used to determine an average height. If six (6)
structures are not available on the same block face, then one or more structures as
close as possible to being directly across from the proposed structure may be used.
The height of the two (2) adjoining houses shall be added into the total twice, with
a divisor of eight (8) used to determine the average. Any new building must have
a height of the main roof of at least eighty (80) per cent of the resulting average;
in no case shall a new building be taller than the tallest roof height included in the
computation. In determining the height of existing structures and proposed
structures, the highest point of the main roof shall be used, even where towers, or
other minor elements may be higher.

ii.

The level of the eaves of a proposed new structure having as much or more
significance for compatibility as the roof height, an average eave or cornice height
shall be determined by the same process as that described above. The proposed
new structure shall have a height at the eaves, or cornice, of not less than ninety
(90) per cent of the average determined from existing structures, and in no case
shall eaves or cornice of the proposed structure be lower than the lowest eave or
cornice height used in the computation, nor higher than the highest.

(2)

Proportion of buildings front facades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on
use, style, and size of buildings. While single family dwellings may appear taller than
wide or wider than tall, the overall appearance is neutral. Terraces or rowhouse buildings are wider than tall; apartment buildings appear taller than wide although some are
wider than tall due to projecting and receding wall surfaces that emphasize the vertical.

(3)

Proportion of openings within the facades. Areas of voids generally constitute between
fifteen (15) per cent and thirty-five (35) per cent of the front facade, excluding the roof.
Most window openings are taller than wide, but are frequently grouped into combinations
wider than tall. Where there are transom windows above doors they are wider than tall;
a few round windows exist on upper stories or attics. A great variety of sizes, shapes,
and groupings of openings exist in the district.

(4)

Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. Queen Anne and arts-and-crafts style buildings
display freedom in the arrangement of openings within the facades, but usually result in

 (5)

a balanced composition. In buildings derived from classical precedents, voids are
usually arranged in a symmetrical and evenly spaced manner within the facade.
Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The spacing of buildings has generally been
determined by the setback from the side lot lines. The spacing of buildings tends to be
consistent, except where vacant lots occur. On Virginia Park where lots are approximately fifty (50) feet wide, some buildings are placed closer to one side lot line, creating
room for a side driveway. On smaller lots in the district, the buildings occupy most of
the width of their lots, while complying with the side lot setback restrictions.

(6)

Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections Steps and porches exist on all of the single
and multiple unit two-and-one-half-story dwellings in the district; the progression of
porches lends to the consistency of the streetscape. Entrances and porches are either
placed centrally on the facade, as is usually the case with classically inspired buildings,
or are placed to one side of the front facade, and the porch sometimes wraps around to
the side. Rear porches are common on single-family residences; few side porches exist
due to narrow lot sizes. On Virginia Park there is an occasional porte cochere.

(7)

Relationship of materials. The district exhibits a wide variety of building materials
characteristic of single and multiple unit residential buildings dating from the last decade
of the nineteenth century and first quarter of the twentieth century. The majority of
buildings are faced with brick; a brick veneer first story and a stucco, clapboard, or wood
shingle second story is not unusual. All-stone, all-stucco, and all-wood buildings exist
but are few in number. Later replacement siding is uncommon in the district; when it
does exist, much of side changes the original visual relationship of the siding to the
building. Stone sills and wood trim are common. Roofing includes slate, tile, and
asphalt shingles. It is common for apartment buildings to have limestone or concrete
high basements or first stories and stone ornamental detail and trim.

(8)

Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that
of the low-relief pattern of mortar joints in brick contrasted to the smooth surface of wood
trim and masonry sills. The brick is sometimes textured. Also common is the contrast
in textures created by the juxtaposition of different materials used for the first and second
stories; frequently a brick first story is contrasted with a stucco or wood sheathed second
story. Half-timbering adds textural interest to the stucco where it exists on neo-Tudor
houses. In apartment buildings, stone, either rough cut or smooth and/or cut to appear
like rustification at the basement and/or first story level contrasts with the main material,
brick. Slate and tile roofs contribute to the textural interest, whereas asphalt shingles
generally do not.

(9)

Relationship of colors. Paint colors generally relate to style. Natural brick colors (red,
brown, yellow, orange, buff) predominate in wall surfaces. Natural stone colors also
exist. Stucco and concrete are usually left in their natural state or are painted in a shade
of mm; half-timbering is frequently stained or painted brown or brownish-red.
Classically inspired buildings, particularly neo-Georgian and colonial revival, frequently
have wood trim painted white, cream, or in a range of these colors. Where shutters exist,
they are either dark green, black, or another appropriate dark color. Colors known to
have been in use on buildings of this type in the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries on
similar buildings may be considered for suitability. Buildings of medieval and/or arts-

 and-crafts inspiration generally have painted wood trim of dark brown; black and red is
also present. Queen Anne and late Victorian style houses may have several colors
painted on the same facade. Storm windows are sometimes a different color from the
window frames and sash; window sash are most often the same color as the window
frames, with a few exceptions. Colors used on trim of apartment buildings are frequently
brown, gray, black or green. The original color scheme of any building, as determined
by professional analysis, is always acceptable for the building, and may provide
suggestions for similar buildings. Roofs are in natural colors; slate is predominantly
gray, gray green and black; tile is green or red. Asphalt shingles display a variety of
colors, most derived from colors of natural materials (tile, slate and wood colors).
(10)

Relationship of architectural details. Architectural details generally relate to style.
Porches, window frames, cornices, dormers and gables are frequently treated. NeoGeorgian and colonial revival buildings display classic details in wood; buildings influenced by the arts-and-crafts movement have wood details such as half-timbering,
heavy vergeboards, and other wood elements. The vernacular "four-square" buildings
usually show restraint in detail. In general, the houses on Virginia Park are more ornate
than those in the rest of the district. Some of the apartment buildings display carved
stone ornament set in panels, string courses, spandrels and cornices.

(11)

Relationship of roof shapes. A multiplicity of roof types exist, and frequently within the
same building. Predominant forms are hip and gabled, frequently punctured with
dormers. A few buildings have engaged towers or bays with conical roofs. Other buildings have less complex roofs, appropriate to their architectural style.

(12)

Walls of continuity. The major wall of continuity is created by the building facades when
their setbacks are uniform within each block face. Where lighting poles and trees exist
in sufficient numbers they contribute to a minor wall of continuity along the tree lawns.

(13)

Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The typical treatment of individual properties is a flat or slightly graded front lawn area in grass turf
subdivided by a concrete or brick walk leading to the front entrance; a side walk
sometimes leads to the rear. On sufficiently graded lots, steps lead up the earthwork
terraces to the front steps. Some straight side driveways, primarily in concrete but a few
in brick, leading from the street to the rear garages exist on Virginia Park, Bethune, and
Lothrop. Where front lawns are uninterrupted by driveways, a unity to the succession
of front lawns is achieved. Foundation plantings of an evergreen and deciduous
character are present on individual lawns. Hedges between properties along the side lot
lines are common; properties on corner lots frequently have hedges along the north south
street. Trees are evenly spaced on the tree lawn; on Pallister where the tree lawn has
been widened, trees are planted close to the public side walk and upright lighting
standards are evenly spaced near the brick paving of the street. Public sidewalks
throughout the district are concrete; brownstone and some bluestone curbs remain on
Delaware between Woodward and Second, Virginia Park and Seward. Virginia Park is
paved in brick; traffic off Woodward enters and exits through a horseshoe with wrought
iron gates and brick piers with stone cresting and foundations. A grassy turf, hedges, and
young trees are planted inside the court created by the horseshoe. Newer gates at the
entrances of other blocks are of the same materials. Side and rear yard wooden fences,

 either painted brown or left in a natural state, exist throughout New Center Commons.
Side yard fences generally do not extend beyond the face line of the front porch, except
where they fence in side lots or comer properties. Fencing in public view through the
district, the fluted designed to compliment the style, design, material, and date of the
residence. Pallister between Second and Third Streets is a pedestrian street; it is paved
in brick with concrete around its perimeter. Street furniture and upright iron light
standards are placed at regular intervals. Ornamental poles (O.P.-type, Detroit Public
Lighting) are located on Delaware between Woodward and Second, Virginia Park and
Seward. On Second Boulevard and Third Avenue, where they run throughout the
district, are fluted steel lighting standards with crane-neck pendants (Union
Manufacturing Company No. 4700). Alleys are paved in either asphalt or concrete, the
exception being the alley north of Delaware east of Second, which is brick. Parking
areas off the alleys next to the alley-facing garages in New Center Commons are also
either asphalt or concrete. Alleys are entered and exited on Bethune Court; they do not
have outlets on Third Avenue. Bethune Court, Bethune Street, and the alleys have tall,
modern light standards. Ornamental light posts on Pallister Commons are Union Metal
Manufacturing No. SP874-Yl.
(14)

Relationship of open space to structures. Vacant land in the New Center Historic District is located immediately west of Bethune Court, where it provides a small buffer from
the street at the corners of Bethune Court and Pallister. Open space on Pallister is
provided by the brick-paved pedestrian mall and widened tree lawns. There is also
ample vacant land adjacent to the Virginia Park gates at the corners of Woodward and
Virginia Park. Where buildings have been demolished, vacant land exists, usually in the
form of parking lots. This condition prevails primarily in the block of Virginia Park
between the Lodge Service Drive and Third Avenue, and on Lothrop. Backyards as well
as front yards exist on all single- and double family residential properties; backyards to
houses on Bethune, Pallister and Delaware tend to be relatively small due to the placement of one and one-half (1%) or two and one-half (2%) car garages and adjoining paved
parking area off the alley.

(15)

Scale of facades and facade elements. There is a variety in scale from street to street and
style to style; most houses have a small to moderate appearance and apartment buildings
have a moderate appearance. The size and complexity of facade elements and details
either accentuate or subdue the scale of the facades. Houses on Virginia Park are large
in scale compared with the rest of the district. The elements within the facades of Queen
Anne and some colonial revival buildings emphasize their size by dividing the facades
into large segments, such as towers, projecting gables, and bays. Neo-Georgian facades
have restrained, small-scale detail within. Buildings influenced by the Arts and Crafts
movement contain heavy elements, such as vergeboards and large brackets. Apartment
buildings usually contain small scaled elements within moderate to large scale facades.
Buildings generally are within normal limits of scale for moderate single and multiplefamily residences of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.

(16)

Directional expression of front elevations. Although some houses appear wider than
tall and some appear taller than wide, the overall directional expression is neutral.
Apartment buildings are expressed vertically, terraces (rowhouses) are horizontal. The

 Church of Christ, Scientist, is expressed horizontally.
(17)

Rhythm of building setbacks. Setbacks vary from area to area within the district, though
they are usually consistent within each block or street face in compliance with deed restrictions. The varying designs of the houses, occasionally with slight setbacks in the
facades, cause the houses to relate to the front setback line.

(18)

Relationship of lot coverage. Lot coverage of single-family dwelling ranges from approximately twenty (20) per cent to forty five (45) per cent, most being in the twenty five
(25) per cent to thirty-five (35) per cent range of lot coverage. Lot coverage of multiunit apartment buildings range from fifty (50) per cent to ninety (90) per cent of their lots,
most being in the upper end of this range.

(19)

Degree of complexity within the facade. The degree of complexity has been determined
by what is appropriate for a given style. The late Victorian buildings exhibit complex
massing and multiplicity of forms, colors and textures. Other styles in the district are
less complex. The classically inspired buildings usually have simple, rectangular
facades with varying amounts of ornamentation.

(20)

Orientations; vistas, overviews. Single-family houses and apartment buildings are generally oriented towards the east west streets. The majority of terrace buildings are oriented toward Third Avenue. The majority of the garages are oriented towards the alleys;
where driveways exist, garages are frequently oriented towards both the street and the
alley. All garages are detached and at the rear of the lot. A dramatic view of the General
Motors Building and Fisher Building can be seen just south of the district.

(21)

Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Neo-Georgian and other classically inspired buildings are generally symmetrical. Other styles including Queen Anne and arts-and-crafts
inspired, are generally asymmetrical but result in balanced compositions. Front facades
of apartment buildings are symmetrical in appearance.

(22)

General environmental character. The character of the New Center Historic District is
that of late nineteenth century and early twentieth century residences on straight east-west
streets. A cohesiveness is attained by entrance gates, uniform setbacks, spacing on lots,
buried utilities, and, on Pallister, spacious tree lawns, street furniture, and brick paving.
Overall, the district has an urban, low to moderate density, revitalized residential
character with small-scale commercial usage on its southern periphery and on Second
from Virginia Park to Delaware. (Ord. No. 530-H, § 1 (28A-141), 11-17-82)
