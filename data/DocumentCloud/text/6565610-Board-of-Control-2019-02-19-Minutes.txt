Additional Item
BC2019-139
Department of Law submitting an alternate procurement process, which will result in an award
recommendation to an electronic discovery vendor and related legal services in the amount not-to-exceed
$140,000.00 for temporary attorney services for the period 2/25/2019 - 2/24/2020.
Funding Source: General Fund
Nora Hurley and Jonathan McGory, Department of Law, presented. Trevor McAleer asked for clarification
on the not-to-exceed amount being requested and asked what amount will be requested when the
contract is submitted, if the lowest bid comes in below $140,000.00; Mr. McAleer made reference to
contracts discussed several months ago for outside legal counsel services and whether the proposed
contract would now be necessary and commented that maybe the County would not be faced with the
urgency to select a vendor in order to meet the imposed deadline, had those contracts moved forward
at that time.
Nan Baker asked if a request to extend the deadline to produce the records was considered. Michael
Dever suggested various options to expedite the approval of the contract to meet the subpoena deadline.
Lenora Lockett indicated this item could not be approved as a time sensitive/mission critical request, as
suggested by Mr. Dever, as it exceeds the $25,000.00 threshold; however, the selected vendor may be
given conditional authority to proceed if the vendor meets County requirements before the award is
made. Nan Baker asked if the Department of Law believed the deadline of March 1 could be met when
this vendor selection and approval process was being considered or would they seek a deadline extension;
asked if waiting an additional week for contract approval will still provide assurances that the services will
be complete and in compliance with the terms of the subpoena. Joseph Nanni asked if an IT solution is in
place to complete this process; asked if the County Prosecutor’s Office agrees with the approach to this
matter.
Trevor McAleer asked what the intended start date of the contract will be. Lenora Lockett said that the
contract outlining the amount, time period, scope of service will still need to come forward for the record
and formal Board approval, even if authority to issue a notice to proceed is granted, which would give
the vendor additional time to complete services. Trevor McAleer agreed with Ms. Lockett’s comments
and recommended that the contract date be set to begin at the end of this week and then bring the
contract forward for formal approval on February 25, 2019. Maggie Keenan motioned to amend the

 agenda to consider the item; Michael Dever seconded. Maggie Keenan motioned to approve the item;
Michael Dever seconded. Item BC2019-139 was unanimously approved.
