3. Benefit Matters
a.

Furlough Legislation Calculation Considerations
Regina Tuczak, Executive Director, reported that when the Fund staff began to implement newly enacted
P.A. 101-0011, they found discrepancies between the salary information certified by the employer and the
salary data maintained by the Fund. Under P.A. 101-0011, now codified as Section 9-179.4 of the Illinois
Pension Code, employees who were on furlough or received salary reductions in the period December 1,
2017, through November 30, 2018, were allowed to purchase additional service or earnings credit for that
period. She stated that the Fund had met with the employer and learned that the differences resulted from a
new payroll system that had been implemented prior to December 1, 2017. The pay rates of the steps
under the new system were not always identical to the pay rates of the steps under the old system. When
there was not an identical match for an employee’s step rate, the employee was placed into the next
highest rate. The salary reductions beginning on December 1, 2017, were calculated from the new pay
rate. The discrepancies mostly impacted non-union salaried employees. The trustees discussed that the
actual salaries paid to the employees were accurate and that the discrepancies found in implementing P.A.
101-0011 were relatively small.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee McFadden that the Board approve a
procedure permitting the use of the salary reduction certified by the employer, when the higher step rate
used as the basis for the reduction can be verified through documentation of the payroll system change,
rather than the salary data maintained from the Fund’s pension administration system, for the calculations
required under Section 9-179.4 of the Illinois Pension Code.

MOTION ADOPTED BY VOICE VOTE

b. Member #136780 Calculations
The Executive Director stated that Member #136780 had requested to purchase additional salary and
service credit pursuant to Section 9-179.4 of the Illinois Pension Code under the circumstances previously
discussed by the Board. By applying the presented methodology, the member would receive a monthly
annuity benefit in the amount of $6,365.87 effective as of August 1, 2019.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee McFadden after due consideration of the
application presented for Member #136780 and having confirmed that the Fund staff followed the Fund’s
procedures in reviewing and processing the application, including but not limited to the calculation for the
purchase of service or earnings credit during a period of furlough or salary reduction as permitted by
Section 9-179.4 of the Illinois Pension Code that the Board approve the Member’s application for monthly
annuity benefits in the amount of $6,365.87 effective as of August 1, 2019.

4. Legislative Matters
a.

Review and Consideration of August 21, 2019, Legislative Committee Recommendation Regarding Draft
Legislation

3

 Trustee McFadden, Chair of the Legislative Committee, stated that the Committee had met on August 21,
2019, and considered proposed legislation which would provide for actuarial based funding for both the
County Fund and the Forest Preserve Fund. The legislation included a three-year ramp and would provide
a 100% funding level amortized over 30 years. The Legislative Committee recommended that the Board
approve the legislation and have it introduced before the General Assembly. Trustee McFadden stated that
the Committee had directed the Executive Director to prepare draft correspondence for County
representatives and labor stakeholders that would be sent with copies of the proposed legislation,
requesting support for such legislation. Trustee McFadden added that the Fund’s Legislative
Representative had been authorized to submit the proposed legislation to the Legislative Reference Bureau
(“LRB”) so that the legislation would be ready for introduction before the General Assembly.
Mr. John McCabe, of John McCabe & Associates, the Legislative Representative, stated that the
legislation had been submitted to the LRB and had been returned to him. He stated that Senator Martwick
was a possible sponsor in the Senate, but that a sponsor in the House had not yet been determined. He
added that Senator Martwick wanted the Fund to continue discussions with the County about the funding
legislation.
The trustees then considered a motion to adopt the Legislative Committee’s recommendation that the
legislation be introduced. Trustee Wilson stated that while he was willing to proceed with the Legislative
Committee’s recommendation, he noted that, per the guidance of our legislative representatives, to
increase the likelihood of success we should continue try to collaborate with the County.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Kouruklis that the Board adopt the
recommendation made by the Legislative Committee at the meeting on August 21, 2019, that the Board
approve the presented amendment to Section 9-169 of the Illinois Pension Code, 40 ILCS 5/9-169, that
includes, but is not limited to, actuarially based contributions from Cook County, the employer, which is
anticipated to achieve 100% funding by the levy year 2051 and that the Fund’s Legislative Representative
be authorized to take all action reasonably necessary to cause such proposed amendment to be introduced
before the Illinois General Assembly. It was further moved that the Executive Director be authorized to
advise the employer and other stakeholders, on behalf of the Board, of the legislation that will be
introduced by transmitting the proposed amendment with the presented correspondence.

 b. Discussion and Possible Action Regarding Other Legislative Matters
The Executive Director asked for direction regarding a response should the County inquire about the
legislation after it was delivered as the Board had directed. The trustees discussed that they were open to
continued dialogue with the County, but that the funding legislation needed to be advanced and was of
utmost importance. They also discussed that if trustees would be needed to attend a meeting with County
representatives that Trustee McFadden and Trustee Ochalla would participate and Trustee Fitzgerald
would serve as an alternate.
5. Health Benefit Matters
a.

Review and Consideration of August 6, 2019, Health Benefits Committee Recommendation Regarding
Health Plan Rates for 2020
Jane Hawes, Director of Health Benefits, stated that the Health Benefits Committee had met on August 6,
2019, and considered the proposed health plan rates prepared by Segal, which were to be effective from
January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. The Committee had recommended that the Board approve
the rates. Dan Levin, from Segal Consulting, presented the rates that were to be provided under the CCPF
Health Plan.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee McFadden that the Board adopt the
recommendation made by the Health Benefits Committee at their meeting on August 6, 2019, that the
annuitant and survivor rates for the CCPF Health Plan as proposed and prepared by Segal be approved
effective from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020.
Vote Result:

MOTION ADOPTED BY VOICE VOTE

b. Medicare Premium Reduction for Those Ineligible for Free Medicare Part A
Mr. Levin presented the rates for those members who were required to purchase Medicare Part A and
Medicare Part B. He noted that it was beneficial to the CCPF Health Plan to provide a premium reduction
to those members who would now be required to participate in Medicare, but are not eligible for premium
free Medicare Part A.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee Goode that the Board adopt the reduced rates
as proposed and prepared by Segal, for retirees participating in the CCPF Health Plan who also are
required to purchase Medicare Part A and Part B to be approved effective from January 1, 2020 through
December 31, 2020.

effective January 1, 2020.
Vote Result:

MOTION ADOPTED BY VOICE VOTE

d. Open Enrollment Incentives and Wellness Budget Considerations
The Director of Health Benefits stated that there was approximately $74,000 remaining to be spent on
wellness items reimbursable from UHC. She proposed that certain incentives, possibly similar to a
sweepstakes coupon, be included with the open enrollment packets so that the members would have an
incentive to read the materials provided. The trustees discussed whether the proposals had been
considered by the Health Benefits Committee and received confirmation that they had not been presented
to the Committee. Mary Pat Burns, fiduciary counsel, advised that federal law may prohibit the use of a
sweepstakes incentive in the selection of health care providers and that the matter should be considered by
the Health Benefits Committee.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Fitzgerald that the proposed open
enrollment incentives and wellness budget considerations be deferred to the Health Benefits Committee.
Vote Result:
e.

MOTION ADOPTED BY VOICE VOTE

Acute Rehab Services and Plan Provision Change
The trustees considered the continuation of coverage for a member who required more time in acute
rehabilitation than the CCPF Health Plan currently provided. Because of the emergency circumstances, the
extended coverage had been approved by the Fund with the concurrence of the Chair of the Health
Benefits Committee. Mr. Levin stated that most plans would not have the limitation in the coverage that
the CCPF Plan had been interpreted to provide. The trustees discussed that the coverage should have
mirrored the County employee plan and was most likely an error in the implementation of coverage when
the Plan transitioned to UHC.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee McFadden that the Board ratify the action
taken by the Fund, under emergency circumstances and with the consent of the Chair of the Health
Benefits Committee, to approve an exception to the CCPF Retiree Health Plan for medical services
required by the Member for a total of 140 days. It was further moved that the Fund obtain further
information regarding coverage of this type and to defer further consideration of the matter to the Health
Benefits Committee.

2019, and that the Fund had received a proposal from the current provider to extend the policy for an

6

 additional year on the same terms. She stated that the Fund’s broker had confirmed that the proposed
policy and its limits were appropriate for the Fund.

renewal of the Network Security and Privacy (Cyber) Liability Insurance as offered by Beazley Insurance
Co. to be effective from October 8, 2019, to October 8, 2020, upon the terms presented at an annual

b. Technology Service Contract/SOW Continuations
i.
CDW-G
The Executive Director reported that she met with representatives of AIS, who provide services
related to the Fund’s IT systems through its agreements with CDW-G, and has learned that while
the current infrastructure is unnecessarily complex, it should not be dismantled at the present
time. It is necessary for the Fund to continue its engagement with CDW-G to maintain the current
systems. She stated that the Fund is currently within the approved budget for IT services, but may
exceed the budgeted amount by the year’s end. She reported that a posting had been made to find
a Director of IT and that the Fund is actively seeking to fill the position. The Fund is currently
below budget with respect to salaries of the IT department.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee McFadden that the Board approve
the retention of CDW-G to provide the network support services as presented at a cost not to
exceed $61,580 and it was further moved that the Executive Director be authorized to negotiate,
execute and deliver on behalf of the Fund the Statements of Work necessary to effectuate the
foregoing.

Executive Director Report
The Executive Director reported that on August 6, 2019, Burns Burke & Pinelli, Ltd. had filed a Petition
for Leave to Appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court in Levin v. The Retirement Board. Ms. Levin, through
her attorney, has filed a response. Copies of the briefs are available on BoardEffect or can be provided to
the trustees upon request.
It was reported that the expenses anticipated for the intended member communications survey in 2019
would exceed the budgeted amount of $4,000 and that an additional $3,000 would be needed. The survey

7

 would provide an assessment from members about communications with the Fund and would identify
opportunities for improvement.
The Executive Director reported that the outreach to Out-of-State Annuitants to confirm their addresses
and validate continuation of benefits was continuing. A second mailing will be sent advising annuitants
that they will have until no later than October 15, 2019 to respond. Fund staff expects to present requests
to terminate or suspend the annuities of those member who do not respond to the Board at their meeting on
November 7, 2019.
The Member identified by Office Number 129466 has been convicted of a felony and her sentencing is
scheduled for November 17, 2019. She is already receiving an annuity and the Board will need to
consider whether her annuity benefits should be terminated pursuant to Section 9-235 of the Illinois
Pension Code. The Fund’s external counsel has advised that the Board should schedule a hearing to make
this determination at their meeting on November 7, 2019. The Fund will send the required notice to the
Member.
The Fund has been advised by external counsel that the proposed rental agreements for the open
enrollment venues include ‘hold harmless’ clauses that could expose the Fund’s assets to unnecessary risks
and should be limited to the available insurance. The Fund has contacted the venues to determine if the
clauses can be limited, but a final determination about the agreements has not been obtained. The Trustees
presented a few alternatives for consideration of other venues.
The Executive Director reminded that trustees that they each are required to have eight hours of ethics
training each year. She noted some upcoming opportunities for the trustees to fulfill this obligation and
that Fund staff would be available to register any trustee for attendance at these events.
The trustees were advised that the Health Benefits Committee would meet on September 19, 2019, at 9:30
am; that the Legislative Committee would meet on September 19, 2019 at12:30 pm; and that the
Investment Committee would meet on September 26, 2019, at 9:30 am.
The Executive Director stated that the Director of Risk Management for Cook County had invited Fund
representatives to participate in a presentation to staff members of the Board of Commissioners and
members of the President’s cabinet on September 6, 2019. The Fund was asked to make a short
presentation about pension and health care benefits.
The Fund has been notified that the Senate Special Committee on State and Pension Fund Investments will
convene its hearings on Wednesday, October 23, 2019 and Thursday, October 24, 2019. The Senate
Committee requested that, at a minimum, the Executive Director, the Director of Investments, the
President of the Retirement Board and the CEO of the Fund’s consulting firm be present to testify. Other
trustees are also encouraged to attend. She will ask that the Fund be scheduled to appear on Wednesday,
October 23, 2019, to avoid any conflict with the Investment Committee meeting scheduled on October 24,
2019.
The Executive Director reported that a different vendor would be used to print and mail the open
enrollment materials. The selected vendor, Fuse, had been was successfully retained by the Fund to print
the most recent Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (“CAFR”). The costs for Fuse to print and mail
the open enrollment materials will be about $1,000 more than the prior vendor. She added that Fuse will
provide a more efficient process and will better limit the transfer of annuitant data. It was anticipated that
the Fund will be reimbursed for this expense through the UHC Wellness budget.
At the conclusion of the Executor Director’s report, it was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by
Trustee Goode that the Board approve the additional anticipated expenditure of $3,000 over the budgeted
amount to execute a communications survey in 2019, which will be included in the final Pension Notes
newsletter for 2019 for either the active member group or the retiree group.
