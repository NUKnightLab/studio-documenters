Re: Analytic Solutions Network, LLC Data Services Agreement

Cook County Health hereby advises the CCH Board of its intent to enter into a data services
agreement with Analytic Solutions Network, LLC for trauma data sharing in support of our prior
hospital participation agreement with the American College of Surgeons. This contract with ASN is
necessary in order for the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County to obtain certi?cation as a veri?ed
Level 1 Trauma Center. Although this is a zero dollar contract for CCH, we are bringing this contract to
your attention due to requirement of a mutual indemni?cation clause that would make each party
responsible for the impact of its own privacy and intellectual property violations
