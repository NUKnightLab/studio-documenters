COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
POLICY FOR RESPONDING TO ICE DETAINERS
WHEREAS, Cook County is a “Fair and Equal County for Immigrants,” as defined in 07-R-240; and
WHEREAS, there is ongoing confusion regarding the proper boundaries of the relationship between
local law enforcement and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”); and
WHEREAS, this is especially true in the context of ICE detainers, which are issued pursuant to 8 USC §
1226 or 8 USC § 1357(d), and used by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to advise local law
enforcement agencies that DHS seeks custody of an individual presently in the custody of that agency;
and
WHEREAS, 8 CFR § 287.7 expressly provides that ICE detainers are merely “requests” that local law
enforcement advise DHS when the individual is due to be released, and that the agency continue holding
the individual beyond the scheduled time of release for up to 48 hours, excluding weekends and federal
holidays, in order for ICE to arrange to assume custody; and
WHEREAS, due to troubling inconsistencies in ICE policies, many local law enforcement agencies
erroneously believe ICE detainers are mandatory and that local law enforcement agencies are legally
required to comply; and
WHEREAS, ICE detainers are generally issued before a finding of probable cause that an individual is
deportable, and have even been imposed on U.S. Citizens by mistake; and
WHEREAS, ICE detainers are routinely imposed on individuals without any criminal convictions or
whose cases are dismissed, but the federal government only reimburses part of the costs associated with
ICE detainers, if there is a written agreement with the State or local subdivision of a State; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111

WHEREAS, ICE will not indemnify local agencies for costs or liability incurred as a result of wrongful
detainers; and
WHEREAS, it costs Cook County approximately $43,000 per day to hold individuals “believed to be
undocumented” pursuant to ICE detainers, and Cook County can no longer afford to expend taxpayer
funds to incarcerate individuals who are otherwise entitled to their freedom; and
WHEREAS, the enforcement of immigration laws is a responsibility of the federal government; and
WHEREAS, ICE detainers encourage racial profiling and harassment; and

WHEREAS, having the Sheriff of Cook County participate in the enforcement of ICE detainers places a
great strain on our communities by eroding the public trust that the Sheriff depends on to secure the
accurate reporting of criminal activity and to prevent and solve crimes; and
WHEREAS, by means of this ordinance, Cook County joins states, cities, and counties across the nation
that are informed about the discretionary nature of ICE detainers and refuse to enforce them, except in
situations where federal reimbursement may be available.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter
46 Law Enforcement, Section 46-37 of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
Sec. 46-37.

Policy for responding to ICE detainers.

(a)
The Sheriff of Cook County shall decline ICE detainer requests unless there is a written
agreement with the federal government by which all costs incurred by Cook County in complying with
the ICE detainer shall be reimbursed.
(b)
Unless ICE agents have a criminal warrant, or County officials have a legitimate law
enforcement purpose that is not related to the enforcement of immigration laws, ICE agents shall not be
given access to individuals or allowed to use County facilities for investigative interviews or other
purposes, and County personnel shall not expend their time responding to ICE inquiries or
communicating with ICE regarding individuals’ incarceration status or release dates while on duty.
(c)
There being no legal authority upon which the federal government may compel an
expenditure of County resources to comply with an ICE detainer issued pursuant to 8 USC § 1226 or 8
USC § 1357(d), there shall be no expenditure of any County resources or effort by on-duty County
personnel for this purpose, except as expressly provided within this Ordinance.
(d)
Any person who alleges a violation of this Ordinance may file a written complaint for
investigation with the Cook County Sheriff’s Office of Professional Review.
Effective Date: This Ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.
Approved and adopted this 7th day of September 2011.

Elected Officials Budget Summary Report
WHEREAS, like other local and state governments Cook County has been experiencing a budget crisis
for the last several years; and
WHEREAS, as the unit of government responsible for the County’s overall budget it is incumbent upon
the Cook County Board of Commissioners to closely monitor spending throughout the current fiscal year;
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Comptroller currently tracks all spending, including that of all elected
officials and departments, within the County thru the Quarterly Appropriation Trial Balance; and
WHEREAS, in an effort to streamline the information the Comptroller is directed to prepare a separate
report detailing the appropriation and expenditures of all County elected officials on a mid-year and yearend basis, and said reports will have no fiscal impact as the information is already tracked by the
Comptroller; and
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Elected Officials Budget Summary Report shall be
distributed twice a year encompassing expenditures from December 1st to June 30th and thru November
30th for the end of the fiscal year report; and

DISCUSSION ON THE PENSION MULTIPLIER CHANGE
FOR SPECIAL PURPOSE FUNDS AND GRANTS
WHEREAS, the department of Budget and Management released a memo on August 18, 2011 to address
the indirect cost rates to be used for grants and special purpose funds.
WHEREAS, the department of Budget and Management would like to ensure that the general fund does
not subsidize any indirect costs attributable to special purpose funds or grants.
WHEREAS, it was determined by the department of Budget and Management that the pension amount
for special purpose funds should be calculated at the actuarial rate rather than the required contribution
rate.
WHEREAS, the change to an actuarial allocation model for pension contributions would mean using a
4.95 multiplier instead of a 1.54 multiplier. The resulting impact will go from 13.09% to 42.07% for
special purpose funds.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOVLED, that the Cook County Subcommittee on Pension meet to
discuss this change and it’s impact on the overall Cook County employer contribution.

WHEREAS, Ramadan, celebrated the world over by more than one billion Muslims, is the month when
Muslims believe God gave the first verses of the Koran to the Prophet Muhammad, and is a sacred
Muslim holiday, spanning the ninth month of the Islamic calendar; and
WHEREAS, Ramadan is one of the five “pillars” or duties in the religion of Islam, and observance of
Ramadan is considered necessary to the strengthening of one’s faith; and
WHEREAS, Ramadan is a time to spiritually purify one’s soul through self-sacrifice, more frequent
prayer and self-reflection, and presents an opportunity to learn about patience, humility and
submissiveness to God; it is also a time to mend troubled relationships, forgive others, and give to charity;
and
WHEREAS, the month of Ramadan involves daily fasting from sunrise to sunset and, because everyone
is eating dinner after sunset, Muslims often invite friends and family to share in the evening meal during
Ramadan ; and
WHEREAS, Ramadan concludes with a three-day festival, Eid ul Fitr, which celebrates the month-long
struggle toward a higher spiritual state.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Toni Preckwinkle, as Cook County Board President
and on behalf of the more than 5.4 million residents of Cook County, do hereby extend my gratitude to

For purposes of determining median income, only the income of the borrower or borrowers
shall be considered.

with terms established in a written agreement signed by the borrower, the lender,
and the contractor before the date of payment.
(10)The payment from loan proceeds by a lender to a contractor under a home repair or
improvement contract, where the contractor has been, on two or more occasions within the
previous 24-month period, determined by a court or agency of competent jurisdiction to be

b. The lender has received a written affidavit from the contractor stating that there
have not been two or more such determinations regarding the contractor within the
previous 24-month period.
(11) Such other circumstances that the Chief Financial Officer may determine to be

more than six percentage points in the case of a first lien mortgage, or by more than eight
percentage points in the case of a junior mortgage, the yield on Treasury securities having

received by the creditor; or
(2) The total points and fees exceed:
a. Five percent of the total loan amount if the loan amount is $16,000.00 or
greater; or
b. Eight hundred dollars if the loan amount is less than $16,000.00.

business purpose unrelated to the residential real property securing the loan and shall not
include a loan with a total loan amount over $250,000.00.
Treasurer means the Treasurer of the County.

the County will not award a contract to such financial institution. For purposes of this
division section, a County contract shall not include designation as a County depository.
The Chief Financial Officer shall notify the Treasurer of this determination.

Nothing in this section shall affect the validity of any contract entered into in
connection with any debt obligations issued by or on behalf of the County prior to a
determination by the Chief Financial Officer that an entity participating in the contract is a

may suspend the ineligibility of a financial institution in order to allow Execution of a
contract with the financial institution upon written application by the head of a County
agency or department affected by the proposed contract setting forth facts sufficient in the
judgment of the purchasing agent to establish:
a. That the public health, safety or welfare of the County requires the goods or

140

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
services of the financial institution; and
b. That the County is unable to acquire the goods or services at comparable price
and quality, and in sufficient quantity, from other sources.
(c) County depositories.
(1) All financial institutions, seeking designation as a County depository by the County
Board upon the request of the Treasurer, shall submit to the Chief Financial Officer, prior
to any such designation, a pledge affirming that neither it nor any of its affiliates is or will
become a predatory lender within the County. Upon receipt, the Chief Financial Officer
shall forward this pledge to the Treasurer. The pledge shall be signed by the chairman of
the board, chief executive officer, or other officer of the financial institution acceptable to
the Chief Financial Officer. The pledge shall be in substantially the following form:
We pledge that we are not and will not become a predatory lender as defined in Cook
County's Predatory Lending Ordinance. We further pledge that none of our affiliates is,
and none of them will become, a predatory lender as defined in this Ordinance. We
understand that becoming a predatory lender or becoming an affiliate of a predatory lender
may result in the loss of our designation as a County depository.
(2) Upon receipt of any written complaint regarding predatory lending practices by any
financial institution seeking designation as a County depository or serving as a County
depository, the Chief Financial Officer shall refer such complaints to the Treasurer who
may conduct an investigation of the complaint in accordance with the Treasurer's policies
and procedures.
Effective date: This Ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

(c) Pre-Bid conference or site inspection. The Bid Documents shall include details of any pre-Bid

mandatory. The CPO shall keep a record of all Persons who request Bid Documents. The CPO will notify
all Persons recorded as having requested Bid Documents of any changes with respect to such conference
or inspection no later than at least 24 hours prior to the original scheduled date and no less than two (2)
business days prior to any newly scheduled date for such conference or inspection.
(d) Communications with the County regarding competitive bidding process. From the time the
Bid Notice is issued until the successful Bidder has been recommended to the Board by the CPO, all
communications to the County relating to the Bid must be directed in writing (which may be electronic)
only to the CPO, or as otherwise specified in the Bid Documents. Upon receipt of such a request, the CPO
will determine if a response will be provided. Any such response shall be provided in an addendum to all
Persons requesting the Bid Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, communications may be made to
the Office of Contract Compliance in writing for the purpose of complying with Division 8, Minority and
Women-Owned Business Enterprise Program.
(e) No changes to Bids. No Bid may be changed, amended or supplemented in any way after the
date and time for submission of Bids.

at the time and location as stated in the Bid Notice or as prescribed in an addendum issued by the CPO.
All Bids shall be opened, and the name of the Bidder and the Bid Price shall be read publicly. If it is
determined that an error was made in the public reading of the Bids, the CPO shall notify all Bidders of
such error and reconvene the Bid opening to correct the record as soon as reasonably possible. If the Bids
are submitted electronically, no public reading shall be required so long as a record of the Bids opened is
publicly available immediately after the Bids are opened.
(g) If only one Bid is received. If only one Bid has been submitted, the CPO will determine
whether to open the Bid or return the Bid to the Bidder via certified mail and re-issue the Bid Notice or
use a different method to make the Procurement. If the Bid was submitted electronically, and is not
opened, it shall be deleted from the electronic procurement system.
(h) Evaluation of Bids. The CPO shall review, evaluate and tabulate Responsive Bids. In
determining the apparent low Bid, the CPO shall consider the Responsibility of the Bidder and all
applicable preferences and incentives provided in this Procurement Code. The CPO shall then direct the
Bids along with the tabulation to the Using Agency for review. Upon full review of the Bids and Bid
tabulations, the Using Agency shall notify the CPO in writing of its Procurement recommendation, with
justification supporting such recommendation. The CPO shall review the recommendation of the Using
Agency, and shall post on the County’s website the CPO’s recommended Bid for award.
(i) Bid protest. Any Bidder who reasonably believes that the recommended Bidder is not the
lowest Responsive and Responsible Bidder, or has a complaint about the bid process, may submit a bid
protest, in writing, and directed to the CPO. Any bid protest must be submitted no later than three (3)
business days after the date upon which the CPO posts the recommended Bid for award. The bid protest
must specify why the protester believes the recommended Bidder is not the lowest Responsive and
Responsible Bidder, or why the protestor believes the bid procedure was unfair, including a statement of
how the alleged unfairness prejudiced the protesting Bidder and the action requested of the CPO. A bid
protest based on an issue which could have been clarified through a request for clarification or

168

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
information pursuant to Sec. 34-136 (d) Communications with the County regarding competitive bidding
process, will not be considered if the protesting Bidder failed to make such request. When a bid protest
has been submitted, no further action shall be taken on the Procurement until the CPO makes a decision.
The CPO shall issue a written decision on the bid protest to the protesting Bidder and to any other Bidder
affected by such decision as soon as reasonably practicable. If the bid protest is upheld based on a lack of
fairness in the bid procedure, the CPO shall re-bid the Procurement. If the CPO determines that the
recommended Bidder was not Responsive and Responsible, that Bidder shall be disqualified and the CPO
may either recommend the lowest Responsive and Responsible Bidder or re-bid.
(j) Board Action. Upon resolution of any bid protests, or expiration of the three (3) day protest
period with no protests, the CPO shall submit the Contract to the Board, through its Finance Committee,
for approval and authorization for the CPO to Execute the Contract. Once the Contract has been approved
by the Board, the CPO shall post on the CPO’s website information regarding the Procurement.
(k) Right to reject Bids. The County shall have the right to reject any and all Bids. The CPO is
authorized to exercise this right on behalf of the Board. The CPO shall include a provision in the Bid
Documents reserving the right to reject any and all Bids.
(l) Procurements Under $150,000.00. The competitive bidding process for procurements greater
than $5,000.00 and less than $150,000.00 may consist of a solicitation posted on the CPO’s website. The
CPO shall promulgate policies and procedures to implement such Procurements. The CPO is not required
to read or announce such Bids publicly. The CPO shall select the lowest Responsive Bid made by a
Responsible Person, and shall post on the CPO’s website information regarding the Procurement.
Sec. 34-137. Small procurements.
Procurements of the same or similar supplies, goods, equipment or services by a Using Agency in
an aggregate amount from the same vendor of less than $5,000 in the same fiscal year do not require a
competitive method. The CPO shall promulgate policies and procedures to implement such Procurements.
Sec. 34-138. Requests for qualifications or proposals.
(a) Criteria for use of request for qualifications or proposals. The CPO in consultation with the
Using Agency may determine that it is in the best interest of the County to make a Procurement utilizing
the Request for Qualifications or Request for Proposals process. Examples of Procurements for which an
RFQ or RFP process is appropriate include but are not limited to: Procurements involving services
requiring a high degree of professional skill where the ability or fitness of the Person plays an important
part; Procurements where the requirements are not clearly known; Procurements where quality rather than
quantity is a primary factor; and Procurements where it is not in the best interest of the County to make
price a primary determinative factor. An RFP process is a competitive process under this Procurement
Code, and a Person selected through an RFP process is not considered a “sole source.”
(b) Content of RFQs and RFPs. The CPO shall determine what provisions RFQs and RFPs should
contain in consultation with the requesting Using Agency and will incorporate. The Using Agency shall
provide the CPO with the necessary details, provisions and requirements for the RFQ or RFP. RFQs and
RFPs shall include a provision stating that the County may negotiate a Procurement with one or more
Respondents or Proposers.

169

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111

Agency and approval from the Using Agency regarding the contents of the RFQ or RFP. Notice of all
RFQ’s and RFP’s shall be posted on the CPO’s website.

more witnesses after the designated date and time for submission. A representative of the Using Agency
may be present at the opening but shall not be required to attend the opening. The names of the
Respondents or Proposers shall be available to the public after the Procurement has been completed.
(e) Evaluation and Selection for Contract Negotiation. The CPO in coordination with the Using
Agency shall develop evaluation criteria which are included in the RFQ or RFP. These criteria may
include, but are not limited to experience and qualifications of the Respondent or Proposer, the quality,
content and completeness of the Response or Proposal, the demonstrated willingness and ability of the
Respondent or Proposer to satisfy the requirements as described in the RFQ or RFP, and, if applicable,
the cost proposal. The evaluation shall be performed by a A committee led chaired by the CPO or a
designee of the CPO, with representatives of the Using Agency and other persons designated by the CPO.
Respondents or Proposers shall be accorded fair treatment with regard to evaluation of their Responses or
Proposals. Any or all Respondents or Proposers may be requested to make presentations and/or submit
clarifications or revisions to their Responses or Proposals for the purpose of obtaining best and final
Responses or Proposals. The Using Agency shall document the results of the evaluation. The contents of
the Responses or Proposals shall not be disclosed to competing Respondents or Proposers during the
evaluation process or any discussions.
(f) Contract negotiation, approval and Execution. The Using Agency may send its recommendation
to the CPO, setting forth the reasons for such recommendation, which shall be based upon the evaluation
criteria. Board approval is not required to negotiate a Contract. Negotiation of a Contract’s terms shall
take place between the prospective Contractor(s) and representatives of the Purchasing Department and
the Using Agency. After a Contract is negotiated, the CPO shall either Execute the Contract, if within the
CPO’s authority, or forward the Contract to the Board for approval and authorization for the CPO to
execute the Contract. Such request shall include the justification for the Contract and the selection of the
Contractor.
Sec. 34-139. Sole source procurements.
Procurements of supplies, equipment, goods or services may be made without use of one of the
competitive processes if there is either only one source or there is a need for the unique or specialized
skill, experience, or ability possessed by a particular source. The Using Agency must submit a letter to the
CPO justifying the sole source Procurement, and provide any other documents or information required by
the CPO.
Sec. 34-140. Comparable government procurement.
If a governmental agency has awarded a contract through a competitive method for the same or
similar supplies, equipment, goods or services as that sought by the County, the Procurement may be
made from that vendor at a price or rate at least as favorable as that obtained by that government agency
without utilizing a competitive procurement method set forth in this Procurement Code.
Sec. 34-141. Emergency procurements.
The CPO may make Procurements and execute Contracts without use of one of the competitive
processes set forth in this Procurement Code and without prior approval of the Board, when such

170

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
Procurements are necessary (i) due to a threat to public health or safety, (ii) for repairs to County property
in order to protect against further loss or damage, (iii) to prevent or minimize serious disruption in County
services, (iv) to ensure the integrity of County records, or (v) in the reasonable opinion of the CPO, for
the best interests of the County. If practicable under the circumstances, the CPO shall obtain quotations or
Proposals from at least three Persons. The CPO shall report the basis for the emergency Procurement and
reasons for the selection of the Contractor to the Finance Committee of the Board within five (5) business
days of making an emergency Procurement.

Sec. 34-143. Consortium and group procurements.
Procurements may be made pursuant to the County’s membership or participation in a purchasing
consortium, provided that the Board has approved such membership or participation, for, at least in part,
the purpose of obtaining advantageous pricing and other efficiencies for the County. Procurements made
through a purchasing consortium shall be approved and executed as set forth in this Procurement Code.
Sec. 34-144. Innovative procurement.
(a) The CPO may make a Procurement using innovative methods of procurement, including but
not limited to electronic procurement, reverse auctions, electronic bidding, electronic auctions, and pilot
procurement programs that have no cost to the County. In order to implement innovative methods of
procurement, either directly or through a service provider, the CPO must make a determination that such
process is competitive and in the best interest of the County.
(b) As an alternative or in addition to directly conducting procurement using innovative methods,
the CPO may make a Procurement of electronic procurement services for conducting reverse auctions,
electronic auctions, or provide an on-line or electronic forum for competitive Bids, Requests for
Qualifications and Requests for Proposals and other types of innovative methods of procurement on the
County’s behalf. The Contract for such Procurement may contain such terms as the CPO deems
necessary, including, but not limited to, terms that specify the source and amount of the compensation.
With respect to Procurements made pursuant to this section, the CPO is authorized to charge a reasonable
service fee to the Contractors from which Procurements are made in order to cover part or all of the
County’s costs associated with such electronic procurement, including the costs of engaging a service
provider. Such service fee shall be paid as directed by the CPO.
(c) The CPO shall have authority to adopt rules and regulations for the proper administration and
enforcement of the provisions of this section, including the authority to modify the requirements of this

General Provisions

Sec. 34-260. Short title.
This subdivision shall be known and may be cited as the Cook County Minority- and WomenOwned Business Enterprise General Ordinance. This subdivision is applicable to all Contracts, including
Public Works Contracts other than as modified pursuant to subdivision 2 of this Division 8.
Sec. 34-261. Findings.
(a) The County has heretofore adopted a Minority Business Enterprise Ordinance to ensure that
minority and women's businesses are provided full and equal opportunity to participate in Contracts.
(b) The Supreme Court of the United States in City of Richmond v. Croson, 488 U.S. 469 (1989),
has enunciated certain standards which are necessary to maintain effective affirmative action programs in
compliance with constitutional requirements.
(c) The County is committed to implementing its affirmative action program in conformance with
the United States Supreme Court's decision in City of Richmond v. Croson.
(d) In furtherance of this commitment, and at the direction of the Board, County staff and
consultants conducted an investigation into the scope of any discrimination in County Procurements, and
in the award of and participation in contracts in the metropolitan Chicago economy, the extent to which
such discrimination or the effects thereof has denied and continues to deny minority and women's
business enterprises equal opportunity to participate in Procurements and to recommend the appropriate
affirmative action steps to be taken to eliminate any such discrimination and its continuing effects.
(e) Minority and women's businesses continue to be awarded prime contracts and subcontracts in
dollar amounts that are disproportionately lower than the availability of such businesses willing and able
to perform Contracts.
(f) The County's procurement practices in the past have contributed to the above identified
underutilization of minority and women's businesses on Contracts.
(g) Minority and women's businesses continue to be disadvantaged by discriminatory practices in
the local construction industry and economy when competing for Contracts and in seeking subcontracting
opportunities on such Contracts.
(h) The County was a passive participant in the discriminatory practices of businesses which
discriminate against minority and women's businesses by entering into contracts with such businesses.

187

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
(i) Despite its good faith efforts and implementation of previous affirmative action programs,
minority and women's businesses remain at a competitive disadvantage in competing for Contracts and
subcontracts.
(j) Race and gender neutral measures or affirmative action programs without numerical goals
have not and are not likely to eliminate the competitive disadvantage of minority and women's businesses
in participating in Contracts due to discrimination in the local economy.
(k) The numerical goals for the participation of minority and women's businesses in Contracts are
commensurate with the availability of minority and women's businesses willing and able to perform
County work.
Sec. 34-262 Policy and purpose.
Based on the foregoing findings, the policy and purpose of this division are as follows:
(a) It is the public policy of the County to strive to achieve the full and equitable participation of
minority and female owned businesses in the County's procurement process as both prime and
subcontractors.
(b) The County is committed to a policy of preventing discrimination in making Procurements,
and eliminating arbitrary barriers to participation in Procurements by all persons, regardless of race, sex,

Procurements, in compliance with all applicable laws.

192

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111

(25%) of the annual total dollar amount of Contracts other than Public Works Contracts to MBEs, and ten
percent (10%) of the total dollar amount of such Contracts to WBEs.
(b) The CCD, in consultation with the CPO and the Using Agency shall establish Contract
Specific Goals for each Contract. In establishing a Contract Specific Goal, the CCD shall consider the
availability of sufficient Certified MBEs and WBEs for the supplies, materials and equipment or services
required as part of the Procurement.
(c) No goal shall be treated as a quota nor shall it be used to discriminate against any Person on
the basis of race, color, national origin, religion or sex.
Sec. 34-268. Certification
The CCD shall Certify only Persons that meet all the following criteria:
(a) The Person must be either an MBE or a WBE, or must establish that such Person has
individually suffered bias such that his or her opportunities to form and operate a successful business have
been substantially diminished because of race, ethnicity, culture or disability. (b) The Person must be
either an individual who is Socially and Economically Disadvantaged or 51 % Owned by one or more
individuals who are Socially and Economically Disadvantaged.
(1) The Ownership by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Person must be real,
substantial, and continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of the Person as reflected in Ownership
documents.
(2) The contributions to acquire the Ownership interest must be real and substantial. If Expertise
is part of the contribution, the Expertise must be of the requisite quality generally recognized in a
specialized field, necessary to the Person’s potential success, specific to the type of work the Person
performs and documented in the Person’s records.
(b) The Person must be managed and Controlled by one or more Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged individual.
(1) There must not be any formal or informal restrictions that limit the customary discretion of the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s). There can be no restrictions through corporate
charter provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any other formal or informal devices that prevent the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s), without the cooperation or vote of any nonSocially and Economically Disadvantaged individuals, from making any business decision of the Person,
including the making of obligations or the dispersing of funds.
(2) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must possess the power to direct
or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Person and to make day-to-day as well as
long-term decisions on management, policy, operations and work.
(3) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) may delegate various areas of the
management or daily operations of the Person to individuals are not Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged. Such delegations of authority must be revocable, and the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged individual(s) must retain the power to hire and fire any such Person. The Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must actually exercise control over the Person’s operations,
work, management and policy.

193

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111

(4) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must have an overall
understanding of, and managerial and technical competence, experience and Expertise, directly related to
the Person’s operations and work. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must have
the ability to intelligently and critically evaluate information presented by other participants in the
Person’s activities and to make independent decisions concerning the Person’s daily operations, work,
management, and policymaking.
(5) If federal, state or local laws, regulations or statutes require a particular license or other
credential to own or Control a certain type of Person, then the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
individual(s) must possess the required license or credential.
(6) A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside employment or
other business interests that conflict with the management of the Person or prevent the owner from
devoting sufficient time and attention to manage and Control the Person’s day to day activities.
(c) Only an independent Person may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An independent Person is
one whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another Person. Recognition of an applicant
as a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a Person
is independent. In determining whether an applicant is an independent business, the CCD will:
(1) Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Persons in such areas as personnel, facilities,
equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.
(2) Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified Persons associated with nonCertified Firms compromise the applicant's independence.
(3) Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Persons to determine whether a
pattern of exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Persons compromises the applicant's
independence.
(4) Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified Persons
with normal industry practice.
(d) The Person shall be Certified only for specific supplies, equipment, goods or services, or for
types of work in which the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and
Expertise to manage and Control the Person’s operations and work.
(e) In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the CCD by rule may accept formal certifications
by other entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if the CCD determines that the certification
standards of such entities are comparable to those set forth herein.
(f) The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the Office of
Contract Compliance. Failure of the Person to seek recertification by filing the necessary documentation
with the CCD as provided by rule may result in decertification.
(g) It is the responsibility of the Certified PCE to notify the CCD of any change in its
circumstances affecting its continued eligibility for the Program. Failure to do so may result in the PCE’s
decertification.

194

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
(h) The CCD shall decertify a PCE that does not continuously meet the eligibility criteria.
(h) Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by the
County. The challenged PCE shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be
maintained.
(j) A Person that has been denied certification or recertification or has been decertified may
protest the denial or decertification as provided by rule.
(k) A Person found to be ineligible may not apply for certification for six (6) months after the
effective date of the final decision.
(l) A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for Certification or a Certified PCE
pursuant to procedures established by the CCD. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the
individual challenging the eligibility of an applicant for Certification or a Certified PCE. The burden of
proof shall rest with the complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The
CCD shall be the final arbiter of all challenges. The presumption that the challenged PCE is eligible shall
remain in effect until the CCD renders a final decision.
Sec. 34-269. Utilization plan; commercially useful function.
(a) Utilization Plan required. The CPO shall include in Contract Documents for Contracts
covered by this Division, a requirement that a Utilization Plan be submitted which either: (i) commits to
PCE participation equal to or greater than the applicable Program Goals or Contract Specific Goals, or (ii)
requests a waiver of all or a portion of a Program Goal or Contract Specific Goal. The Utilization Plan
shall be in such form and contain such information as is required by the CCD. Failure to include a
Utilization Plan will render the submission not Responsive. The CCD shall review and either approve or
reject the Utilization Plan. For purposes of evaluation a Utilization Plan, only PCEs which perform a
Commercially Useful Function shall be considered.
(b) Commercially Useful Function. To be considered in meeting Goals, a PCE must perform a
Commercially Useful Function, as determined pursuant to this subsection 34-269(b). “Commercially
Useful Function” means the performance of a distinct element of work required for the Procurement, with
the requisite skill and Expertise.
(1) In the case of a Procurement of goods or equipment, ordering from a manufacturer or
distributor for delivery directly to the Using Agency is not a Commercially Useful Function; provided,
however, that to the extent such practice is consistent with normal industry practices, a PCE subcontractor
may enter into second tier subcontracts. However, if a PCE Contractor or subcontractor subcontracts a
significantly greater portion of the work of the Contract than would be expected on the basis of normal
industry practices, the PCE shall be presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function.
(2) In the case of a Procurement of services, a Person which subcontracts with another Person to
perform the services required does not perform a Commercially Useful Function unless such Person also
performs significant supervisory or management responsibilities. A Broker does not fulfill a
Commercially Useful Function. In the case of a Joint Venture partner, each Joint Venture partner must
perform a Commercially Useful Function.
(c) PCE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra
participant in the Contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of PCE
participation.

195

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111

(d) When a PCE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the Certified
PCE and the Person seeking to include that PCE in its Utilization Plan, may present evidence to rebut this
presumption.
(e) Once a Utilization Plan has been approved, the Contractor cannot make changes to the
Utilization Plan, including substituting PCEs named in the Utilization Plan, without the prior written
approval of the CCD, CPO and the Using Agency. The CCD shall promulgate procedures for changes to
the Utilization Plan.
Sec. 34-270. Methods to Achieve Goals and Compliance.
A Person may achieve the applicable Contract Specific Goals in any one or more of the methods
set forth below. The same PCE, whether as a contractor, subcontractor or supplier, cannot be utilized as
both a MBE and a WBE on the same Contract.
(1) PCE as prime Contractor. An MBE or WBE may count its own participation toward the
achievement of the applicable MBE or WBE goal. Such PCE will be required to meet the other goals by
another method described herein. If a WBE is also a MBE, such WBE’s participation may count toward
either the MBE or WBE Goal but not both.
(2) Joint Venture with one or more PCE. Where a Person engages in a Joint Venture with one or
more PCEs, the Utilization Plan shall include a written agreement at least the information set forth in
subsection 34-384 (ii) 1 through 4 below. The CCD shall consider the following in determining whether
the proposed Utilization Plan satisfies the Program Goals based upon such written Joint Venture
agreement and the Utilization Plan.
a. Each Joint Venture partner’s initial capital investment;
b. The extent to which the PCE’s proposed participation in the performance of the
Contract constitutes a Commercially Useful Function;
c. Whether the PCE’s share in the risks and profits of the Joint Venture is proportional to
their ownership interest;
d. Whether the PCE will have duties, responsibilities, management Control and risk with
respect to the Joint Venture in proportion to its ownership interest;
(3) Subcontracting. A Person may achieve the Contract Specific Goals by means of
subcontracting with, or purchasing from one or more PCEs.
Sec. 34-271. Request for a total or partial waiver; Good Faith Efforts.
(a) In reviewing a partial or total request for waiver of a Goal, the CCD shall determine whether a
Person has made good faith efforts to meet the applicable Goals and to what extent the waiver request
should be granted. In determining whether a Person has made Good faith efforts, the CCD will consider
whether the Person has taken the following actions:
(1) Review lists of PCEs maintained by the County and other State and local governments and
agencies to identify qualified PCEs for solicitation for Bids;

196

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
(2) Divide Procurement requirements into small tasks or quantities. This shall include, where
appropriate, breaking out Contract work items into economically feasible units, consistent with the
availability of PCEs, to facilitate PCE participation, even when the Contractor would otherwise prefer to
perform these work items with its own forces.
(3) Adjust any insurance requirements imposed by the Person seeking PCEs, or otherwise assist
PCEs in obtaining any required insurance, where economically feasible, to encourage participation by
PCEs;
(4) Make timely attempts to contact PCEs providing the type of supplies, equipment, goods or
services required for the Procurement; and provide them with a convenient and timely opportunity to
obtain and review all information concerning the Procurement necessary to enable such PCE to respond;
(5) Follow up initial contacts of PCEs to determine if they are interested participating in the
Procurement;
(6) Negotiate in good faith and on a timely basis with PCEs to enable them to participate in the
Procurement. Evidence of such negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of
PCEs that were contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and
specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached. The
Contractor may not reject PCEs as being unqualified without sound reasons. That there may be some
additional costs involved in finding and using PCEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's
failure to meet the Goals, as long as such costs are reasonable.
(7) Make efforts to assist interested PCEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies, materials,
or related assistance or services, where appropriate; provided, however, that such efforts shall not be
inconsistent with the requirement that the PCE be responsible for actually obtaining and paying for such
items.
(8) Establish delivery schedules which will encourage participation by PCEs, where the
requirements of the Procurement permit;
(9) Use the services and assistance of the CCD’s staff, the Small Business Administration, the
Office of Minority Business Enterprises of the U.S. Department of Commerce;
(10) Timely notify appropriate community and minority and women's business organizations
identified as assist agencies of the opportunity for participation in the Procurement;
(11) Demonstrate to the CCD that no PCE exists with which a mentor/protégé relationship could
be established, as described in Sec. 34-271.
(b) In determining whether a Bidder or Respondent has made Good Faith Efforts, the levels of
participation by PCEs set forth in Utilization Plans submitted by other Persons for the same Procurement
may be considered. For example, if the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent fails to meet the
Contract Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average PCE participation obtained by other Bidders or
Respondents, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent made Good Faith
Efforts.
(c) Where the County requires professional services, the County must be able to call upon those
professionals whose particular training and experience are most beneficial to the County.

197

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
(1) The County sets an annual "best efforts" goal of 35 percent PCE participation for the total
professional services and consulting services utilized by the County.
(2) A Utilization Plan shall be required, and if a waiver or partial waiver is requested, “good
faith” efforts shall be demonstrated as set forth in Sec. 34-271; provided, however, that such Persons shall
not be required to attempt to subcontract with PCEs if sub-contractors would not typically be utilized for
the type of Procurement. In such cases, the Person shall document the reasons for not sub-contracting in a
waiver request.
(3) The Contractor will endeavor to maximize use of PCEs for supplies, equipment, goods or
services for such Contractor’s business operations not specifically for the Procurement.
(4) If such Persons is required to have or has an affirmative action plan and goals, such plan and
goals shall be submitted with their Utilization Plan. The CCD shall compare such plan and goals with the
Person’s actual affirmative action achievements and such achievements may be considered by the County
in future Procurements.
(d) Mentor/protege agreements. Where a Contractor enters into mentor/protege agreement with a
PCE to improve or develop certain aspects of the business of the PCE, the CCD shall evaluate the effect
of such agreement as a factor in determining good faith efforts. The mentor/protege agreement may
provide for the Contractor to assist the PCE in such areas as technical aspects of the PCE’s business,
improving financial management, or providing on-the-job training. To constitute good faith efforts, the
mentor/protégé agreement shall satisfy the following requirements.
(1) The PCE performs a Commercially Useful Function;
(2) The agreement shall be included in the Utilization Plan; and
(3) The agreement clearly defines the respective responsibilities of the Contractor and the PCE
and includes specific, measurable goals to be attained by both parties through the performance of the
agreement. In order to be a factor in establishing best efforts, the mentor/protégé agreement must be for a
reasonable period of time.
(e) The CCD may grant a total or partial waiver based upon the following criteria:
(1) There are not sufficient PCEs capable of providing the supplies, equipment, goods or services
required for the Procurement;
(2) The Procurement cannot reasonably be divided;
(3) The price required by potential PCEs is more than ten percent above competitive levels; and
(4) Any other factor relating to good faith efforts as set forth in the Person’s Utilization Plan.
Sec. 34-272. Calculating PCE participation.
In calculating a PCE’s participation, only dollar amounts commensurate with a PCE’s
performance of a Commercially Useful Function may be counted.
(a) The dollar value of that portion of a Procurement that is performed by the PCEs’ own forces
shall be counted, including the cost of supplies, materials and equipment furnished by the PCE for the

198

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
Procurement, whether purchased or leased (except to the extent purchased or leased from the Contractor
or the Contractor's Affiliate).
(b) The dollar amount of fees or commissions charged by a PCE for providing a bona fide
service, such as professional, technical, consultant, managerial, insurance brokerage or surety services,
shall be counted, provided the fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily
charged for similar services.
(c) When a PCE is a Joint Venture partner, only the dollar value of the distinct, clearly defined
work performed by the PCE with its own forces, shall be counted.
(d) Only the dollar value must be commensurate with the work the PCE actually performs.
(e) One hundred percent (100%) of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a
PCE Manufacturer or Regular Dealer shall be counted.
(f) One hundred percent of the fees or transportation charges for the delivery of supplies,
equipment, materials or goods shall be counted only if the payment of such fees is a customary industry
practice and such fees are commensurate with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(g) If a PCE ceases to be Certified during its performance on a Procurement, the dollar value of
work performed under a Contract with that Person after it has ceased to be Certified shall not be counted.
(h) Only the dollar amount actually paid to the PCE shall be counted toward the participation of a
PCE.
Sec. 34-273. Review of contract performance.
(a) Compliance with Utilization Plan. The CCD shall review the Contractor's compliance with its
Utilization Plan as necessary during the performance of the Contract. The CCD may establish such
requirements for periodic Contractor reporting on compliance with its Utilization Plan as the CCD
determines appropriate and necessary. A Contractor shall be required to provide any additional requested
compliance documentation within 14 days of request by the CCD.
(1) If the CCD determines that the Contractor has failed to comply with its Utilization Plan, the
CCD shall notify the CPO of such failure. The CPO shall then send notice of default to the Contractor,
and the Contractor shall have such time to cure the default as is provided in the Contract. If no such
period is provided, the Contractor shall have ten days to cure such default. For purposes of this Section,
providing a plan for bringing the Contract into compliance with the Utilization Plan may constitute a cure,
if compliance cannot reasonably be achieved within the applicable cure period, and if compliance is
achieved in accordance with such plan.
(2) If a Contractor fails to provide any documentation required by the CCD, the CCD shall notify
the CPO of such failure. The CPO shall then send notice of default to the Contractor, and the Contractor
shall have such time to cure the default as is provided in the Contract. If no such period is provided, the
Contractor shall have ten days to cure such default.
(b) Bid and target market programs. To address more specifically the barriers to PCE
participation as prime Contractors in County work, the CCD may recommend to the CPO to institute the
following special PCE bidding provisions, following determination of the appropriateness of such
provisions.

199

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111

(1) In connection with the award of a Contract subject to competitive bidding on which a PCE has
bid and where the PCE is bidding on the item in question for the first time; and has never successfully bid
on a Cook County purchasing contract, the Contract Compliance Director may, at the opening of the bids
on the item, compare the PCE Bid with the lowest Bid, and, if the PCE's Bid is closely competitive as
defined by guidelines to be established by the Contract Compliance Director with that of lowest actual
Bids, direct the CPO to declare the PCE the successful Bidder. A PCE may use this procedure only once
to become the successful Bidder on any particular item. Thereafter, the PCE must be totally competitive
in terms of price to be the successful Bidder.
(2) The Contract Compliance Director shall develop and coordinate a target market program as
follows:
a. The Contract Compliance Director shall review the availability of PCEs providing
various goods and services and shall identify for inclusion in a potential program for bidding among PCE
Persons certain commodity areas with sufficient PCE availability to ensure that the County receives a
competitive price. The Contract Compliance Director shall report his/her findings and recommendations
to the Contract Compliance Committee;
b. Upon a determination by the CCD that such a program is advisable for any
particular commodity procurement, the Contract Compliance Director will institute
the following procedures:
1. The Contract Compliance Director will notify the CPO of identification of
those commodity codes appropriate for a target market program;
2. To the extent practicable, the CPO, with the aid of the Contract
Compliance Director, shall divide procurement in the designated commodity
areas into economically feasible sizes to facilitate Bids or offers from PCEs
and shall designate contracts to be offered under the target market program;
3. The CPO shall offer PCEs the opportunity to bid on such contracts in a
limited competition;
4. All standard County rules for bidding will then become effective and,
provided that at least three PCEs Bid or make an offer on the contract, the
lowest Responsive and Responsible Bidder among the PCEs will receive the
contract;
5. In the event less than three PCEs Bid or make an offer on the Contract
or if there is no Responsive Bid or offer received from a Responsible PCE,
the CPO shall rebid the Contract not subject to the target market program.
c. Participation in the target market program shall be limited to Minority
Business Enterprises, Women's Business Enterprises and Joint Ventures consisting
exclusively of Minority Business Enterprises, Women's Business Enterprises or both.
The PCE Contractor on a target market Contract may subcontract up to 49 percent of
the dollar value of the target market Contract to subcontractors who are not Minority
Business Enterprises or Women's Business Enterprises.
Sec. 34-274. Prompt payment of PCEs.

200

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111

If an invoice from a Contractor includes payment for supplies, equipment, goods or services
furnished by a PCE, Contractor shall pay such PCE for such supplies, equipment, goods or services
within thirty (30) days after receipt of payment from the County. The CCD shall investigate any
complaint or charge of excessive delay in payment, and shall report the results of such investigations to
the Contract Compliance Committee and to the County Comptroller. Failure of Contractor to comply with
this Sec. 34-388 shall constitute a material breach of the Contract.
Sec. 34-275. Reporting and review.
The CCD shall report to the Board on an annual basis with respect to the following:
(1) The percentage of the total dollar amount of Procurements for such year actually received by
PCEs;
(2) The number of MBEs and WBEs available for participation in Procurements, by category;
(3) An evaluation of the effectiveness of this division in ensuring equitable participation by PCEs
in Procurements;
(4) An assessment of the continuing need for the Program;
(5) Identification of any enforcement problems; and
(6) Any recommendations with respect to modifying or improving the Program, including
discontinuing or modifying Program Goals in those cases where Minority Business Enterprises and
Women's Business Enterprises no longer are disadvantaged by the effects of discrimination in their
participation in Procurements.
Sec. 34-276. Prohibited provisions.
Any agreement between a Contractor and a MBE or WBE in which the Contractor requires that
the MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
Subdivision II. Participation in Cook County Public Works Contracts
Sec. 34-285. Short title; incorporation of provisions.
This subdivision may be known and cited as the Cook County Public Works Minority- and
Women-Owned Business Enterprise Ordinance. The provisions of the Cook County Minority- and
Women-Owned business Enterprise General Ordinance are applicable to Public Works Contracts, except
to the extent modified hereby.
Sec. 34-286. Findings.
(a) The findings set forth in subdivision I Sec. 34-261 of this division 8 are incorporated herein by
this reference.
(b) The requirement in subdivision I that minority- and women-owned businesses (M/WBEs) be
allotted certain percentages of County construction contracts was ruled unconstitutional as applied to

201

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
construction contracts in Builders Association of Greater Chicago v. County of Cook, 256 F.3d 642 (7th
Cir. 2001). See also Builders Association of Greater Chicago v. City of Chicago, 2003 WL 1786489,
2003 U.S. Dist. Lexis 23287 (N.D. Ill. 2003).
(c) The President and the Board of Commissioners of the County of Cook, after considering (i)
evidence presented at trial in Builders Association of Greater Chicago v. City of Chicago, 298 F.Supp.2d
725 (N.D. Ill. 2003) and Northern Contracting, Inc. v. Illinois Department of Transportation, 2005 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 19868 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 8, 2005); (ii) County statistical evidence of continuing discrimination
against Blacks, Hispanics, Asians and women in the County's Procurements; (iii) the Report title,
"Review of Compelling Evidence of Discrimination Against Minority- and Women-Owned Business
Enterprise in the Chicago Area Construction Industry and Recommendations for Narrowly Tailored
Remedies for Cook County, Illinois;" as well as (iv) anecdotal evidence of discrimination against
minorities and women in the County's Public Works Contracts; and (v) receiving and considering written
reports, adopts the following findings as a strong basis in evidence supporting a narrowly tailored,
remedial affirmative action program in Public Works Contracts.
(d) The County seeks to provide a level playing field and equal access for all prime contractors
and subcontractors to participate in Public Works Contracts;
(e) The County has engaged in committee hearings in which the County has heard anecdotal
evidence of discrimination in the construction industry, has commissioned a study on the levels of PCE
participation in Public Works Contracts, has reviewed the report prepared indicating evidence of
discrimination in Public Works Contracts and has considered the evidence in relevant case law; and
(f) In the absence of application of the Program to Public Works Contracts, the County has
witnessed a drastic decline in PCE in its Public Works Contracts, to levels below the availability of PCEs,
and thus, the County would be a passive participant in a discriminatory marketplace without the
application of PCE goals.
Sec. 34-287 Policy.
Based on the findings set forth in subdivision I, Sec. 34-261 and the findings set forth in
subdivision II, Sec. 34-286, and in addition to the policy set forth at Sec. 34-262, the policy and purpose
of this subdivision is to establish and implement goals for participation of PCEs in Public Works
Contracts, in accordance with all applicable laws.
Sec. 34-288. Program goals.
The Program Goal applicable to Public Works Contracts shall be a goal of twenty-four percent
(24%) of the annual total dollar amount of Public Works Contracts to MBEs and a goal of not less than
ten percent (10%) of the annual total dollar amount of Public Works Contracts to WBEs. In establishing a
Contract Specific Goal for Public Works Contracts, the CCD shall consider the availability of sufficient
Certified MBEs and WBEs for each trade required as part of the project.
Sec. 34.-289. Commercially useful function.

202

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
To determine whether a PCE is performing a Commercially Useful Function, the County will
evaluate whether the portion of the work subcontracted to or by a PCE is in accordance with industry
standards. For example, if a PCE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a Contract than would be
expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful
Function. In addition, to perform a Commercially Useful Function, the PCE must be responsible, with
respect to materials, equipment and supplies used in performing its portion of the Contract, for
negotiating price, determining whether quality meets specifications, ordering the material, installing
(where applicable) and paying for the material itself.
DIVISION 9. CONTRACT MANAGEMENT

(b) Expenses. Contracts for services shall also require Contractors to submit
documentation of the types and amounts of expenses incurred related to the work
performed if the Contractor uses County funds to pay for any such expenses or seeks

conference or inspection no later than at least 24 hours prior to the original scheduled date and no less
than two (2) business days prior to any newly scheduled date for such conference or inspection.

communications to the County relating to the Bid must be directed in writing (which may be electronic)
only to the CPO, or as otherwise specified in the Bid Documents. Upon receipt of such a request, the
CPO will determine if a response will be provided. Any such response shall be provided in an addendum

211

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
(e)
No changes to Bids. No Bid may be changed, amended or supplemented in any way after
the date and time for submission of Bids.
(f)
Bid opening. All Bids shall be opened and a record of such Bids shall be made on the
date, and at the time and location as stated in the Bid Notice or as prescribed in an addendum issued by
the CPO. All Bids shall be opened, and the name of the Bidder and the Bid Price shall be read publicly. I
f it is determined that an error was made in the public reading of the Bids, the CPO shall notify all
Bidders of such error and reconvene the Bid opening to correct the record as soon as reasonably possible.
If the Bids are submitted electronically, no public reading shall be required so long as a record of the Bids
opened is publicly available immediately after the Bids are opened.
(g)
If only one Bid is received. If only one Bid has been submitted, the CPO will determine
whether to open the Bid or return the Bid to the Bidder via certified mail and re-issue the Bid Notice or
use a different method to make the Procurement. If the Bid was submitted electronically, and is not
opened, it shall be deleted from the electronic procurement system.
(h)
Evaluation of Bids. The CPO shall review, evaluate and tabulate Responsive Bids. I n
determining the apparent low Bid, the CPO shall consider the Responsibility of the Bidder and all
applicable preferences and incentives provided in this Procurement Code. The CPO shall then direct the
Bids along with the tabulation to the Using Agency for review. Upon full review of the Bids and Bid
tabulations, the Using Agency shall notify the CPO in writing of its Procurement recommendation, with
justification supporting such recommendation. The CPO shall review the recommendation of the Using
Agency, and shall post on the County’s website the CPO’s recommended Bid for award.
(i)
Bid protest. Any Bidder who reasonably believes that the recommended Bidder is not the
lowest Responsive and Responsible Bidder, or has a complaint about the bid process, may submit a bid
protest, in writing, and directed to the CPO. Any bid protest must be submitted no later than three (3)
business days after the date upon which the CPO posts the recommended Bid for award. The bid protest
must specify why the protester believes the recommended Bidder is not the lowest Responsive and
Responsible Bidder, or why the protestor believes the bid procedure was unfair, including a statement of
how the alleged unfairness prejudiced the protesting Bidder and the action requested of the CPO. A bid

information pursuant to Section 34-136 (d) Communications with the County regarding competitive
bidding process, will not be considered if the protesting Bidder failed to make such request. When a bid
protest has been submitted, no further action shall be taken on the Procurement until the CPO makes a
decision. The CPO shall issue a written decision on the bid protest to the protesting Bidder and to any
other Bidder affected by such decision as soon as reasonably practicable. If the bid protest is upheld based
on a lack of fairness in the bid procedure, the CPO shall re-bid the Procurement. If the CPO determines
that the recommended Bidder was not Responsive and Responsible, that Bidder shall be disqualified and
the CPO may either recommend the lowest Responsive and Responsible Bidder or re-bid.
(j)
Board Action. Upon resolution of any bid protests, or expiration of the three (3) day
protest period with no protests, the CPO shall submit the Contract to the Board, through its Finance
Committee, for approval and authorization for the CPO to Execute the Contract. Once the Contract has

Procurements Under $150,000.00. The competitive bidding process for procurements
greater than $5,000.00 and less than $150,000.00 may consist of a solicitation posted on the CPO’s

is not required to read or announce such Bids publicly. The CPO shall select the lowest Responsive Bid
made by a Responsible Person, and shall post on the CPO’s website information regarding the
Procurement.
Sec. 34-137.

Small procurements.

Procurements of the same or similar supplies, goods, equipment or services by a Using Agency in
an aggregate amount from the same vendor of less than $5,000.00 in the same fiscal year do not require a
competitive method. The CPO shall promulgate policies and procedures to implement such
Procurements.
Sec. 34-138.

Requests for qualifications or proposals.

(a)
Criteria for use of request for qualifications or proposals. The CPO in consultation with
the Using Agency may determine that it is in the best interest of the County to make a Procurement
utilizing the Request for Qualifications or Request for Proposals process. Examples of Procurements for
which an RFQ or RFP process is appropriate include but are not limited to: Procurements involving
services requiring a high degree of professional skill where the ability or fitness of the Person plays an
important part; Procurements where the requirements are not clearly known; Procurements where quality
rather than quantity is a primary factor; and Procurements where it is not in the best interest of the County
to make price a primary determinative factor. An RFP process is a competitive process under this
Procurement Code, and a Person selected through an RFP process is not considered a “sole source.”
(b)
Content of RFQs and RFPs. The CPO shall determine what provisions RFQs and RFPs
should contain in consultation with the requesting Using Agency and will incorporate the necessary
details, provisions and requirements for the RFQ or RFP. RFQs and RFPs shall include a provision
stating that the County may negotiate a Procurement with one or more Respondents or Proposers.

one or more witnesses after the designated date and time for submission. A representative of the Using
Agency may be present at the opening but shall not be required to attend the opening. The names of the
Respondents or Proposers shall be available to the public after the Procurement has been completed.
(e)
Evaluation and Selection for Contract Negotiation. The CPO in coordination with the
Using Agency shall develop evaluation criteria which are included in the RFQ or RFP. These criteria
may include, but are not limited to experience and qualifications of the Respondent or Proposer, the
quality, content and completeness of the Response or Proposal, the demonstrated willingness and ability
of the Respondent or Proposer to satisfy the requirements as described in the RFQ or RFP, and, if
applicable, the cost proposal. The evaluation shall be performed by a committee chaired by the CPO or a
designee of the CPO with representatives of the Using Agency and other persons designated by the CPO.
Respondents or Proposers shall be accorded fair treatment with regard to evaluation of their Responses or
Proposals. Any or all Respondents or Proposers may be requested to make presentations and/or submit
clarifications or revisions to their Responses or Proposals for the purpose of obtaining best and final
Responses or Proposals. The Using Agency shall document the results of the evaluation. The contents of

213

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
the Responses or Proposals shall not be disclosed to competing Respondents or Proposers during the
evaluation process or any discussions.
(f)
Contract negotiation, approval and Execution. The Using Agency may send its
recommendation to the CPO, setting forth the reasons for such recommendation, which shall be based
upon the evaluation criteria. Board approval is not required to negotiate a Contract. Negotiation of a
Contract’s terms shall take place between the prospective Contractor(s) and representatives of the
Purchasing Department and the Using Agency. After a Contract is negotiated, the CPO shall either
Execute the Contract, if within the CPO’s authority, or forward the Contract to the Board for approval and
authorization for the CPO to execute the Contract. Such request shall include the justification for the
Contract and the selection of the Contractor.
Sec. 34-139.

Sole source procurements.

Procurements of supplies, equipment, goods or services may be made without use of one of the
competitive processes if there is either only one source or there is a need for the unique or specialized
skill, experience, or ability possessed by a particular source. The Using Agency must submit a letter to
the CPO justifying the sole source Procurement, and provide any other documents or information required
by the CPO.
Sec. 34-140.

Comparable government procurement.

If a governmental agency has awarded a contract through a competitive method for the same or
similar supplies, equipment, goods or services as that sought by the County, the Procurement may be
made from that vendor at a price or rate at least as favorable as that obtained by that government agency
without utilizing a competitive procurement method set forth in this Procurement Code.
Sec. 34-141.

Emergency procurements.

The CPO may make Procurements and execute Contracts without use of one of the competitive
processes set forth in this Procurement Code and without prior approval of the Board, when such
Procurements are necessary (i) due to a threat to public health or safety, (ii) for repairs to County property
in order to protect against further loss or damage, (iii) to prevent or minimize serious disruption in County
services, (iv) to ensure the integrity of County records, or (v) in the reasonable opinion of the CPO, for
the best interests of the County. If practicable under the circumstances, the CPO shall obtain quotations or
Proposals from at least three Persons. The CPO shall report the basis for the emergency Procurement and
reasons for the selection of the Contractor to the Finance Committee of the Board within five (5) business
days of making an emergency Procurement.
Sec. 34-142.

Joint procurements.

Procurements may be made pursuant to the Governmental Joint Purchasing Act, 30 ILCS §525.
Sec. 34-143.

Consortium and group procurements.

Procurements may be made pursuant to the County’s membership or participation in a purchasing
consortium, provided that the Board has approved such membership or participation, for, at least in part,
the purpose of obtaining advantageous pricing and other efficiencies for the County. Procurements made
through a purchasing consortium shall be approved and executed as set forth in this Procurement Code.

The CPO may make a Procurement using innovative methods of procurement, including
but not limited to electronic procurement, reverse auctions, electronic bidding, electronic auctions, and

The County's procurement practices in the past have contributed to the above identified
underutilization of minority and women's businesses on Contracts.
(g)
Minority and women's businesses continue to be disadvantaged by discriminatory
practices in the local construction industry and economy when competing for Contracts and in seeking
subcontracting opportunities on such Contracts.
(h)
The County was a passive participant in the discriminatory practices of businesses which
discriminate against minority and women's businesses by entering into contracts with such businesses.
(i)
Despite its good faith efforts and implementation of previous affirmative action
programs, minority and women's businesses remain at a competitive disadvantage in competing for
Contracts and subcontracts.
(j)
Race and gender neutral measures or affirmative action programs without numerical
goals have not and are not likely to eliminate the competitive disadvantage of minority and women's
businesses in participating in Contracts due to discrimination in the local economy.
(k)
The numerical goals for the participation of minority and women's businesses in
Contracts are commensurate with the availability of minority and women's businesses willing and able to
perform County work.
Sec. 34-262

The CCD shall Certify only Persons that meet all the following criteria:
(a)
The Person must be either an MBE or a WBE, or must establish that such Person has

236

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
(1)

The Ownership by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Person must be real,
substantial, and continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of the Person as reflected
in Ownership documents.

(2)

The contributions to acquire the Ownership interest must be real and substantial. If
Expertise is part of the contribution, the Expertise must be of the requisite quality
generally recognized in a specialized field, necessary to the Person’s potential success,
specific to the type of work the Person performs and documented in the Person’s records.

(b)
The Person must be managed and Controlled by one or more Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged individual.
(1)

There must not be any formal or informal restrictions that limit the customary discretion
of the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s). There can be no
restrictions through corporate charter provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any
other formal or informal devices that prevent the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged individual(s), without the cooperation or vote of any non-Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged individuals, from making any business decision of the
Person, including the making of obligations or the dispersing of funds.

(2)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must possess the power to
direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Person and to make
day-to-day as well as long-term decisions on management, policy, operations and work.

(3)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) may delegate various areas
of the management or daily operations of the Person to individuals are not Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged. Such delegations of authority must be revocable, and the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must retain the power to hire and
fire any such Person. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must
actually exercise control over the Person’s operations, work, management and policy.

(4)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must have an overall
understanding of, and managerial and technical competence, experience and Expertise,
directly related to the Person’s operations and work. The Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged individual(s) must have the ability to intelligently and critically evaluate
information presented by other participants in the Person’s activities and to make
independent decisions concerning the Person’s daily operations, work, management, and
policymaking.

(5)

If federal, state or local laws, regulations or statutes require a particular license or other
credential to own or Control a certain type of Person, then the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged individual(s) must possess the required license or credential.

(6)

employment or other business interests that conflict with the management of the Person
or prevent the owner from devoting sufficient time and attention to manage and Control
the Person’s day to day activities.

(c)
Only an independent Person may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An independent Person
is one whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another Person. Recognition of an

237

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
applicant as a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that
a Person is independent. In determining whether an applicant is an independent business, the CCD will:
(1)

Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Persons in such areas as personnel, facilities,
equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.

(2)

Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified
Persons associated with non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's independence.

(3)

Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Persons to determine whether a
pattern of exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Persons compromises the
applicant's independence.

(4)

Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified
Persons with normal industry practice.

(d)
The Person shall be Certified only for specific supplies, equipment, goods or services, or
for types of work in which the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and
Expertise to manage and Control the Person’s operations and work.
(e)
In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the CCD by rule may accept formal
certifications by other entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if the CCD determines that the
certification standards of such entities are comparable to those set forth herein.
(f)
The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the
Office of Contract Compliance. Failure of the Person to seek recertification by filing the necessary
documentation with the CCD as provided by rule may result in decertification.
(g)
It is the responsibility of the Certified PCE to notify the CCD of any change in its
circumstances affecting its continued eligibility for the Program. Failure to do so may result in the PCE’s
decertification.
(h)

The CCD shall decertify a PCE that does not continuously meet the eligibility criteria.

(i)
Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by
the County. The challenged PCE shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be
maintained.
(j)
A Person that has been denied certification or recertification or has been decertified may
protest the denial or decertification as provided by rule.
(k)
A Person found to be ineligible may not apply for certification for six (6) months after the
effective date of the final decision.
(l)
A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for Certification or a Certified
PCE pursuant to procedures established by the CCD. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the
individual challenging the eligibility of an applicant for Certification or a Certified PCE. The burden of
proof shall rest with the complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The
CCD shall be the final arbiter of all challenges. The presumption that the challenged PCE is eligible shall
remain in effect until the CCD renders a final decision.

238

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111

Sec. 34-269.

Utilization plan; commercially useful function.

(a)
Utilization Plan required. The CPO shall include in Contract Documents for Contracts
covered by this Division, a requirement that a Utilization Plan be submitted which either: (i) commits to
PCE participation equal to or greater than the applicable Program Goals or Contract Specific Goals, or (ii)
requests a waiver of all or a portion of a Program Goal or Contract Specific Goal. The Utilization Plan
shall be in such form and contain such information as is required by the CCD. Failure to include a
Utilization Plan will render the submission not Responsive. The CCD shall review and either approve or
reject the Utilization Plan. For purposes of evaluation a Utilization Plan, only PCEs which perform a
Commercially Useful Function shall be considered.
(b)
Commercially Useful Function. To be considered in meeting Goals, a PCE must perform
a Commercially Useful Function, as determined pursuant to this subsection 34-269(b). “Commercially
Useful Function” means the performance of a distinct element of work required for the Procurement, with
the requisite skill and Expertise.
(1)

In the case of a Procurement of goods or equipment, ordering from a manufacturer or
distributor for delivery directly to the Using Agency is not a Commercially Useful
Function; provided, however, that to the extent such practice is consistent with normal
industry practices, a PCE subcontractor may enter into second tier subcontracts.
However, if a PCE Contractor or subcontractor subcontracts a significantly greater
portion of the work of the Contract than would be expected on the basis of normal
industry practices, the PCE shall be presumed not to be performing a Commercially
Useful Function.

(2)

In the case of a Procurement of services, a Person which subcontracts with another
Person to perform the services required does not perform a Commercially Useful
Function unless such Person also performs significant supervisory or management
responsibilities. A Broker does not fulfill a Commercially Useful Function. In the case of
a Joint Venture partner, each Joint Venture partner must perform a Commercially Useful
Function.

(c)
PCE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an
extra participant in the Contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of PCE
participation.
(d)
When a PCE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the
Certified PCE and the Person seeking to include that PCE in its Utilization Plan, may present evidence to
rebut this presumption.
(e)
Once a Utilization Plan has been approved, the Contractor cannot make changes to the
Utilization Plan, including substituting PCEs named in the Utilization Plan, without the prior written
approval of the CCD, CPO and the Using Agency. The CCD shall promulgate procedures for changes to
the Utilization Plan.
Sec. 34-270.

Methods to Achieve Goals and Compliance.

A Person may achieve the applicable Contract Specific Goals in any one or more of the methods
set forth below. The same PCE, whether as a contractor, subcontractor or supplier, cannot be utilized as
both a MBE and a WBE on the same Contract.

239

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111

(1)

PCE as prime Contractor. An MBE or WBE may count its own participation toward the
achievement of the applicable MBE or WBE goal. Such PCE will be required to meet the
other goals by another method described herein. If a WBE is also a MBE, such WBE’s
participation may count toward either the MBE or WBE Goal but not both.

(2)

Joint Venture with one or more PCE. Where a Person engages in a Joint Venture with
one or more PCEs, the Utilization Plan shall include a written agreement at least the
information set forth in subsection 34-384 (ii) 1 through 4 below. The CCD shall
consider the following in determining whether the proposed Utilization Plan satisfies the
Program Goals based upon such written Joint Venture agreement and the Utilization
Plan.

(3)

Sec. 34-271.

a.

Each Joint Venture partner’s initial capital investment;

b.

The extent to which the PCE’s proposed participation in the performance of the
Contract constitutes a Commercially Useful Function;

c.

Whether the PCE’s share in the risks and profits of the Joint Venture is
proportional to their ownership interest;

d.

Whether the PCE will have duties, responsibilities, management Control and risk
with respect to the Joint Venture in proportion to its ownership interest;

Subcontracting. A Person may achieve the Contract Specific Goals by means of
subcontracting with, or purchasing from one or more PCEs.
Request for a total or partial waiver; Good Faith Efforts.

(a)
In reviewing a partial or total request for waiver of a Goal, the CCD shall determine
whether a Person has made good faith efforts to meet the applicable Goals and to what extent the waiver
request should be granted. In determining whether a Person has made Good faith efforts, the CCD will
consider whether the Person has taken the following actions:
(1)

Review lists of PCEs maintained by the County and other State and local governments
and agencies to identify qualified PCEs for solicitation for Bids;

(2)

Divide Procurement requirements into small tasks or quantities. This shall include, where
appropriate, breaking out Contract work items into economically feasible units, consistent
with the availability of PCEs, to facilitate PCE participation, even when the Contractor
would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces.

(3)

Adjust any insurance requirements imposed by the Person seeking PCEs, or otherwise
assist PCEs in obtaining any required insurance, where economically feasible, to
encourage participation by PCEs;

(4)

Make timely attempts to contact PCEs providing the type of supplies, equipment, goods
or services required for the Procurement; and provide them with a convenient and timely
opportunity to obtain and review all information concerning the Procurement necessary
to enable such PCE to respond;

240

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
(5)

Follow up initial contacts of PCEs to determine if they are interested participating in the
Procurement;

(6)

Negotiate in good faith and on a timely basis with PCEs to enable them to participate in
the Procurement. Evidence of such negotiation includes the names, addresses, and
telephone numbers of PCEs that were contacted; a description of the information
provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting;
and why agreements could not be reached. The Contractor may not reject PCEs as being
unqualified without sound reasons. That there may be some additional costs involved in
finding and using PCEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet
the Goals, as long as such costs are reasonable.

(7)

Make efforts to assist interested PCEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies,
materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate; provided, however, that
such efforts shall not be inconsistent with the requirement that the PCE be responsible for
actually obtaining and paying for such items.

(8)

Establish delivery schedules which will encourage participation by PCEs, where the
requirements of the Procurement permit;

(9)

Use the services and assistance of the CCD’s staff, the Small Business Administration,
the Office of Minority Business Enterprises of the U.S. Department of Commerce;

(10)

Timely notify appropriate community and minority and women's business organizations
identified as assist agencies of the opportunity for participation in the Procurement;

(11)

Demonstrate to the CCD that no PCE exists with which a mentor/protégé relationship
could be established, as described in Section 34-271.

(b)
In determining whether a Bidder or Respondent has made Good Faith Efforts, the levels
of participation by PCEs set forth in Utilization Plans submitted by other Persons for the same
Procurement may be considered. For example, if the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent fails to
meet the Contract Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average PCE participation obtained by other
Bidders or Respondents, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent made
Good Faith Efforts.
(c)
Where the County requires professional services, the County must be able to call upon
those professionals whose particular training and experience are most beneficial to the County.
(1)

The County sets an annual "best efforts" goal of 35 percent PCE participation for the total
professional services and consulting services utilized by the County.

(2)

A Utilization Plan shall be required, and if a waiver or partial waiver is requested, “good
faith” efforts shall be demonstrated as set forth in Section 34-271; provided, however,
that such Persons shall not be required to attempt to subcontract with PCEs if subcontractors would not typically be utilized for the type of Procurement. In such cases, the
Person shall document the reasons for not sub-contracting in a waiver request.

(3)

The Contractor will endeavor to maximize use of PCEs for supplies, equipment, goods or
services for such Contractor’s business operations not specifically for the Procurement.

241

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
(4)

If such Persons is required to have or has an affirmative action plan and goals, such plan
and goals shall be submitted with their Utilization Plan. The CCD shall compare such
plan and goals with the Person’s actual affirmative action achievements and such
achievements may be considered by the County in future Procurements.

(d)
Mentor/protege agreements. Where a Contractor enters into mentor/protege agreement
with a PCE to improve or develop certain aspects of the business of the PCE, the CCD shall evaluate the
effect of such agreement as a factor in determining good faith efforts. The mentor/protege agreement may
provide for the Contractor to assist the PCE in such areas as technical aspects of the PCE’s business,
improving financial management, or providing on-the-job training. To constitute good faith efforts, the
mentor/protégé agreement shall satisfy the following requirements.
(1)

The PCE performs a Commercially Useful Function;

(2)

The agreement shall be included in the Utilization Plan; and

(3)

The agreement clearly defines the respective responsibilities of the Contractor and the
PCE and includes specific, measurable goals to be attained by both parties through the
performance of the agreement. In order to be a factor in establishing best efforts, the
mentor/protégé agreement must be for a reasonable period of time.

(e)

The CCD may grant a total or partial waiver based upon the following criteria:

(1)

There are not sufficient PCEs capable of providing the supplies, equipment, goods or
services required for the Procurement;

(2)

The Procurement cannot reasonably be divided;

(3)

The price required by potential PCEs is more than ten percent above competitive levels;
and

(4)

Any other factor relating to good faith efforts as set forth in the Person’s Utilization Plan.

Sec. 34-272.

Calculating PCE participation.

In calculating a PCE’s participation, only dollar amounts commensurate with a PCE’s
performance of a Commercially Useful Function may be counted.
(a)
The dollar value of that portion of a Procurement that is performed by the PCEs’ own
forces shall be counted, including the cost of supplies, materials and equipment furnished by the PCE for
the Procurement, whether purchased or leased (except to the extent purchased or leased from the
Contractor or the Contractor's Affiliate).
(b)
The dollar amount of fees or commissions charged by a PCE for providing a bona fide
service, such as professional, technical, consultant, managerial, insurance brokerage or surety services,
shall be counted, provided the fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily
charged for similar services.
(c)
When a PCE is a Joint Venture partner, only the dollar value of the distinct, clearly
defined work performed by the PCE with its own forces, shall be counted.

242

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
(d)

Only the dollar value must be commensurate with the work the PCE actually performs.

(e)
One hundred percent (100%) of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained
from a PCE Manufacturer or Regular Dealer shall be counted.
(f)
One hundred percent of the fees or transportation charges for the delivery of supplies,
equipment, materials or goods shall be counted only if the payment of such fees is a customary industry
practice and such fees are commensurate with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(g)
If a PCE ceases to be Certified during its performance on a Procurement, the dollar value
of work performed under a Contract with that Person after it has ceased to be Certified shall not be

(h)
of a PCE.

Only the dollar amount actually paid to the PCE shall be counted toward the participation

Sec. 34-273.

Review of contract performance.

(a)
Compliance with Utilization Plan. The CCD shall review the Contractor's compliance
with its Utilization Plan as necessary during the performance of the Contract. The CCD may establish
such requirements for periodic Contractor reporting on compliance with its Utilization Plan as the CCD
determines appropriate and necessary. A Contractor shall be required to provide any additional requested
compliance documentation within 14 days of request by the CCD.
(1)

If the CCD determines that the Contractor has failed to comply with its Utilization Plan,
the CCD shall notify the CPO of such failure. The CPO shall then send notice of default
to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall have such time to cure the default as is
provided in the Contract. If no such period is provided, the Contractor shall have ten days
to cure such default. For purposes of this Section, providing a plan for bringing the
Contract into compliance with the Utilization Plan may constitute a cure, if compliance
cannot reasonably be achieved within the applicable cure period, and if compliance is
achieved in accordance with such plan.

(2)

If a Contractor fails to provide any documentation required by the CCD, the CCD shall
notify the CPO of such failure. The CPO shall then send notice of default to the
Contractor, and the Contractor shall have such time to cure the default as is provided in
the Contract. If no such period is provided, the Contractor shall have ten days to cure
such default.

(b)
Bid and target market programs. To address more specifically the barriers to PCE
participation as prime Contractors in County work, the CCD may recommend to the CPO to institute the
following special PCE bidding provisions, following determination of the appropriateness of such
provisions.
(1)

In connection with the award of a Contract subject to competitive bidding on which a
PCE has bid and where the PCE is bidding on the item in question for the first time; and
has never successfully bid on a Cook County purchasing contract, the Contract
Compliance Director may, at the opening of the bids on the item, compare the PCE Bid
with the lowest Bid, and, if the PCE's Bid is closely competitive as defined by guidelines
to be established by the Contract Compliance Director with that of lowest actual Bids,
direct the CPO to declare the PCE the successful Bidder. A PCE may use this procedure

243

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
only once to become the successful Bidder on any particular item. Thereafter, the PCE
must be totally competitive in terms of price to be the successful Bidder.
(2)

The Contract Compliance Director shall develop and coordinate a target market program
as follows:
a.

The Contract Compliance Director shall review the availability of PCEs
providing various goods and services and shall identify for inclusion in a
potential program for bidding among PCE Persons certain commodity areas with
sufficient PCE availability to ensure that the County receives a competitive price.
The Contract Compliance Director shall report his/her findings and
recommendations to the Contract Compliance Committee;

b.

Upon a determination by the CCD that such a program is advisable for any
particular commodity procurement, the Contract Compliance Director will
institute the following procedures:

c.

Sec. 34-274.

1.

The Contract Compliance Director will notify the CPO of identification
of those commodity codes appropriate for a target market program;

2.

To the extent practicable, the CPO, with the aid of the Contract
Compliance Director, shall divide procurement in the designated
commodity areas into economically feasible sizes to facilitate Bids or
offers from PCEs and shall designate contracts to be offered under the
target market program;

3.

The CPO shall offer PCEs the opportunity to bid on such contracts in a
limited competition;

4.

All standard County rules for bidding will then become effective and,
provided that at least three PCEs Bid or make an offer on the contract,
the lowest Responsive and Responsible Bidder among the PCEs will
receive the contract;

5.

In the event less than three PCEs Bid or make an offer on the Contract or
if there is no Responsive Bid or offer received from a Responsible PCE,
the CPO shall rebid the Contract not subject to the target market
program.

Participation in the target market program shall be limited to Minority Business
Enterprises, Women's Business Enterprises and Joint Ventures consisting
exclusively of Minority Business Enterprises, Women's Business Enterprises or
both. The PCE Contractor on a target market Contract may subcontract up to 49
percent of the dollar value of the target market Contract to subcontractors who
are not Minority Business Enterprises or Women's Business Enterprises.

Prompt payment of PCEs.

If an invoice from a Contractor includes payment for supplies, equipment, goods or services
furnished by a PCE, Contractor shall pay such PCE for such supplies, equipment, goods or services
within thirty (30) days after receipt of payment from the County. The CCD shall investigate any

244

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
complaint or charge of excessive delay in payment, and shall report the results of such investigations to
the Contract Compliance Committee and to the County Comptroller. Failure of Contractor to comply with
this Section 34-388 shall constitute a material breach of the Contract.
Sec. 34-275.

Reporting and review.

The CCD shall report to the Board on an annual basis with respect to the following:
(1)

The percentage of the total dollar amount of Procurements for such year actually received
by PCEs;

(2)

The number of MBEs and WBEs available for participation in Procurements, by
category;

(3)

An evaluation of the effectiveness of this division in ensuring equitable participation by
PCEs in Procurements;

(4)

An assessment of the continuing need for the Program;

(5)

Identification of any enforcement problems; and

(6)

Any recommendations with respect to modifying or improving the Program, including
discontinuing or modifying Program Goals in those cases where Minority Business
Enterprises and Women's Business Enterprises no longer are disadvantaged by the effects
of discrimination in their participation in Procurements.

Sec. 34-276.

Prohibited provisions.

Any agreement between a Contractor and a MBE or WBE in which the Contractor requires that
the MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
Subdivision II. Participation in Cook County Public Works Contracts
Sec. 34-285.

Short title; incorporation of provisions.

This subdivision may be known and cited as the Cook County Public Works Minority- and
Women-Owned Business Enterprise Ordinance. The provisions of the Cook County Minority- and
Women-Owned business Enterprise General Ordinance are applicable to Public Works Contracts, except
to the extent modified hereby.
Sec. 34-286.

Findings.

(a)
The findings set forth in subdivision I Section 34-261 of this division 8 are incorporated
herein by this reference.
(b)
The requirement in subdivision I that minority- and women-owned businesses (M/WBEs)
be allotted certain percentages of County construction contracts was ruled unconstitutional as applied to
construction contracts in Builders Association of Greater Chicago v. County of Cook, 256 F.3d 642 (7th
Cir. 2001). See also Builders Association of Greater Chicago v. City of Chicago, 2003 WL 1786489,
2003 U.S. Dist. Lexis 23287 (N.D. Ill. 2003).

245

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
(c)
The President and the Board of Commissioners of the County of Cook, after considering
(i) evidence presented at trial in Builders Association of Greater Chicago v. City of Chicago, 298
F.Supp.2d 725 (N.D. Ill. 2003) and Northern Contracting, Inc. v. Illinois Department of Transportation,
2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19868 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 8, 2005); (ii) County statistical evidence of continuing
discrimination against Blacks, Hispanics, Asians and women in the County's Procurements; (iii) the
Report title, "Review of Compelling Evidence of Discrimination Against Minority- and Women-Owned
Business Enterprise in the Chicago Area Construction Industry and Recommendations for Narrowly
Tailored Remedies for Cook County, Illinois;" as well as (iv) anecdotal evidence of discrimination against
minorities and women in the County's Public Works Contracts; and (v) receiving and considering written
reports, adopts the following findings as a strong basis in evidence supporting a narrowly tailored,
remedial affirmative action program in Public Works Contracts.
(d)
The County seeks to provide a level playing field and equal access for all prime
contractors and subcontractors to participate in Public Works Contracts;
(e)
The County has engaged in committee hearings in which the County has heard anecdotal
evidence of discrimination in the construction industry, has commissioned a study on the levels of PCE
participation in Public Works Contracts, has reviewed the report prepared indicating evidence of
discrimination in Public Works Contracts and has considered the evidence in relevant case law; and
(f)
In the absence of application of the Program to Public Works Contracts, the County has
witnessed a drastic decline in PCE in its Public Works Contracts, to levels below the availability of PCEs,
and thus, the County would be a passive participant in a discriminatory marketplace without the
application of PCE goals.
Sec. 34-287.

Policy.

Based on the findings set forth in subdivision I, Section 34-261 and the findings set forth in
subdivision II, Section 34-286, and in addition to the policy set forth at Section 34-262, the policy and
purpose of this subdivision is to establish and implement goals for participation of PCEs in Public Works
Contracts, in accordance with all applicable laws.
Sec. 34-288.

Program goals.

The Program Goal applicable to Public Works Contracts shall be a goal of twenty-four percent
(24%) of the annual total dollar amount of Public Works Contracts to MBEs and a goal of not less than
ten percent (10%) of the annual total dollar amount of Public Works Contracts to WBEs. In establishing a
Contract Specific Goal for Public Works Contracts, the CCD shall consider the availability of sufficient
Certified MBEs and WBEs for each trade required as part of the project.
Sec. 34.-289.

Commercially useful function.

To determine whether a PCE is performing a Commercially Useful Function, the County will
evaluate whether the portion of the work subcontracted to or by a PCE is in accordance with industry
standards. For example, if a PCE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a Contract than would be
expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful
Function. In addition, to perform a Commercially Useful Function, the PCE must be responsible, with
respect to materials, equipment and supplies used in performing its portion of the Contract, for
negotiating price, determining whether quality meets specifications, ordering the material, installing
(where applicable) and paying for the material itself.

minimum net present value savings to the County of three percent (3.00%) of the debt service on the
Refunded Bonds being refunded, or (b) the Refunding of the Refunded Bonds which are chosen to be
refunded will restructure the debt service burden of the County, or (c) the issuance of such Refunding
Bonds to pay all or a portion of any installment of interest coming due on any of the Prior Bonds,

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY
AGREEMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 29, 2011 from
MARIA SALDAÑA, Bureau Chief, Bureau of Economic Development
I hereby transmit for your approval a request for the Office of Capital Planning and Policy, as authorized
by the Cook County Purchasing Agent, to participate in the City of Chicago (the “City”) Job Order
Contract (JOC) program to complete the 16 capital projects listed below (the “Projects”). JOC is a
quantity based procurement process that allows facility owners to complete a multitude of
repair/maintenance and construction projects with a single, competitively bid contract. The JOC process
generally involves first selecting a pool of potential contractors through a competitive procurement
process, and then identifying projects for such selected contractors.
The City has already completed a JOC competitive procurement process, and it has created the pool of
general contractors to perform certain projects generally associated with maintenance, repairs, and routine
work. Participating in, or “piggy backing” on the City’s existing JOC contract would allow the County to
enjoy the myriad cost savings achieved through volume purchases.
The JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group. The Gordian Group
maintains an area price book, which captures the prices for specific construction work items within this
region. JOC contractors bid against the prices included in the price book. The cost, therefore, of any work
performed by the contractor is a contractor markup from the price book. The Gordian Group would
receive a 2% administrative fee from Cook County based on the total project cost of the work.
I specifically request authorization for the Purchasing Agent, on behalf of the Office of Capital Planning
and Policy, to:
b. Enter into and execute an agreement with the Gordian Group on the same terms as, and actively
participate in, the City’s JOC agreement for the coordination and administrative management of
the Job Order Contracting program;
c. Do all such acts and things and to execute all contracts necessary to complete the Projects using
vendors selected through the City’s JOC program.
d. The following projects would be included and assigned by the Gordian Group to participating
JOC contractors:
a. Remove and Replace Air Dryers at Stroger Hospital
b. Remove and Replace Lime in Basins at Stroger Hospital
c. Boiler Room Valve Replacement at OFH

CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT
TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 15, 2011 from
DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court

272

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
requesting approval from the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $15,000.00 from Account
335-240, Printing and Publishing to Account 335-268, Court Reporting to cover the cost of court
reporting and transcription services for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Reason:

The funds are needed to pay for court reporter and transcription services needed for the
remainder of the fiscal year.

From Account 335–240

Total

$15,000.00

To Account 335-268

Total

$15,000.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to the date?
On June 13, 2011 it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds.
The balance in the account at that time was $19,552.00 and the balance 30 days prior to that was
$23,205.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 335–240 was identified as the source of transferred funds since the FY 2011 budgeted
amount of $50,000.00 for rubber stamps (draw down contract) will not be fully needed in FY 2011.
The current contract has sufficient funds for the remainder of the fiscal year, hence, the availability
of funds for the transfers.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from Account 335-240.

None.
4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The actual cost to procure new rubber stamps was less than anticipated resulting in excess funds
that are sufficient to meet the rubber stamps needs for the remainder of the fiscal year, hence, the
availability of funds for the transfer.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 20111
Highway, the intersection of Northwest Highway at Wilke Road (CH V68), in the Village of Arlington
Heights. This two-agreement approach became necessary when the Illinois Administrative Code was
amended to provide that all future Tiered Approach to Corrective Action Objectives Agreements be based
upon a State-mandated form. The Supplemental Agreement contains greater protections for Cook County
than the state form and together they are considered as a single “Agreement”.
The Agreement has been prepared in compliance with Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA)
directives toward a tiered approach in dealing with petroleum contamination to soils. For contaminate
concentrations which are of low levels, Tier 1 residential remediation, the IEPA allows for their
remaining in place subject to certain conditions which are, in part, that pumping of potable water in the
location be prohibited, that excavators in the location be informed of the proscribed status for material
handling and that any excavated material be properly disposed. The IEPA requirements also call for these
Agreements to, by reference, be recorded against the property.
The location listed as subject for Highway Authority Agreements is, in part, located along a County
highway and so being, the County has control of the right-of-way through the Highway Department
Permit Office. The County, by executing the Agreement, will agree to restrict the extraction of potable
water from this location, inform Permittees of the proscribed status of the referenced location and require
that Permittees properly dispose of excavated soil.
The Agreement further indemnifies and holds the County harmless from liabilities and damages arising
from the petroleum contamination; as well as makes provisions for reimbursement of expenses incurred
by the County should the Highway Department be required in the course of normal maintenance to
expose and dispose of contaminated soils.
The Agreement was prepared following a Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office prepared Standard
Agreement and has been examined and approved by this Department and the State's Attorney's Office. It
is respectfully requested that, should your Honorable Body concur in this recommendation, the resolution
be adopted and the Agreement executed and that an executed copy of the Agreement be returned to Fifth
Third Bank for further processing and forwarding to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.

OFFICE OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER
TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 26, 2011 from
ABISHI CUNNINGHAM, JR., Public Defender
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $8,000.00 from Account
260-260, Professional and Managerial Services to Account 260-445 Operation of Automotive Equipment
to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet our obligation to the Cook County Sheriff's office for
gasoline.
Reason:

Due to the increase in gas prices, it is necessary to increase the funding in the Operation of
Auto Equipment account so that there are sufficient funds to cover FY2011 expenses.

From Account 260-260

Total

$8,000.00

To Account 260-445

Total

$8,000.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent on July 25th, 2011 that this account needed an infusion of funds to meet current
obligations. The balance in the account on July 25th was $5,976.00 and the balance 30 days prior
was $8,518.00

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The account used for the source of funds was identified because there is a unobligated balance of
$16,000.00 in the account. No other accounts were considered.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
This account was originally budgeted to accommodate any professional services that might be
required once the software integration program was in place to download case files from the circuit
court clerk's office. The development software integration program was delayed and therefore,
there is an unobligated surplus in the account.

qualified and were invited to participate in Step 2 and submit a sealed bid. The County is
seeking the most economic flat rate convenience percentage fees to be charged to taxpayers

Transmitting a Communication from
MARIA DE LOURDES COSS, Purchasing Agent
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $1,400,000 Contract No. 10-84-129 with
Warehouse Direct, Mount Prospect, Illinois, for Countywide Office Supplies.
Board approved amount 09-01-10:
Increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$1,373,256.50
1,400,000.00
$2,773,256.50

The original award amount of $1,373,256.50 has been encumbered by Cook County
departments through various purchase orders prior to the one year contract anniversary. Based
on analysis of the contract, usage history and annual spend, it appears that the initial amount
requested was for a one-year period, not a two-year period. In order to continue operation of
County services, the contract will need to be increased by an additional $1,400,000. The
expiration date of the current contract is September 14, 2012.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1,400,000.00. (Various-350 Accounts)
