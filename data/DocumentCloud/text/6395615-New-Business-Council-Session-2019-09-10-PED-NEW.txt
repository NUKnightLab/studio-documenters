Community Benefits Requirements.

Pursuant to City of Detroit Ordinance 35-16 (?Ordinance?), also known as the Community
Benefits Ordinance, if the Property involves a Tier 2 Development Project (as de?ned by the
Ordinance), then the Applicant will:

a.

Partner with the City, and, when appropriate, a workforce development agency to

community and local residents. The Applicant will adhere to the mitigation
requirements, if any, stated in the attached Addendum 1 4. b. Requirements, which is

Applicant shall provide the City with the following during the Term:

a.

Upon request, the Applicant shall provide the Planning Development Department

If the average number of full-time employees at the Property for any given year of the Term
is less than the Employee Commitment Number, the Applicant agrees to pay to the City, in
addition to the Commercial Rehabilitation Tax due under the CREC, an amount equal to the
difference between the amount of ad valorem tax that would be due on the Property without
the CREC, and the amount of Commercial Rehabilitation Tax due on the Property under the
CREC, for that given year, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the shortfall in
the number of full-time employees indicated in the Status Report, and the denominator of
which is the Employee Commitment Number. Prior to taking any action to require the
Applicant to pay an amount to the City pursuant to this Section, the City must afford the
Applicant an opportunity to present reasons for the employment shortfall at a public hearing.

In the event that the Applicant fails to report in the Status Report the number of full-time
employees at the Property for a given year of the Term, the number of full-time employees at
the Property for purposes of this Section shall be deemed to be zero (0).

RE: Commercial Rehabilitation Certificate Real Estate Interests LLC on behalf of 3750 Woodward Avenue LLC
Property Address: 3750 Woodward Avenue
Parcels Number: 01004190?8.

Dear Ms. Trudeau

The Office ofthe Chief Financial Officer, Office of the Assessor, has reviewed the Commercial Rehabilitation certificate application
for the properties located at 3750 Woodward Avenue in the Midtown area in the City of Detroit.

The rationale for issuing Commercial Rehabilitation certificates under PA 210 of 2005, as amended, is based on the anticipation of
increased market value upon completion of new construction and /or significant rehabilitation of existing commercial property and
commercial housing property. Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not necessarily generate additional market
value.

The proposed project by 3750 Woodward Avenue LLC is to construct a mixed?use development including 225 room hotel, 80,000
square feet of retail space, hundreds of multi-family residence, affordable housing, co-living housing units, and 60 residential
condominiums on 3.780 acres ofvacant land that previous contained a commercial building and contains paved parking. The project
is expected to increase commercial activity, create employment, and revitalize an urban area

The 2019 values are as follows;

 

 

Building Assessed Building Land Assessed Value Land
Parcel Address Value Taxable Value (SEV) Taxable Value
01004190-8 3750 Woodward Av? - - 55 3.812.800 3.812800

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This property meets the criteria set forth under PA 210 of 2005, as amended. It applies to a building or a group of contiguous
buildings, a portion of a building or group of contiguous buildings previously used for commercial or industrial purposes, obsolete
industrial property, and vacant property which, within the immediately pr?ceding 15 years, was operating as a c0mmercial business
enterprise.

A review of the general plans, along with the criteria set forth under the Commercial Rehabilitation Act, indicated that the proposed
project located at 3750 Woodward Avenue is eligible as it pertains to the Commercial Rehabilitation certificate criteria under PA
210 of 2005, as amended.

RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Commercial Rehabilitation District (PA 210) for 3750
Woodward Avenue

DATE: September 3, 2019

CC: Maurice Cox, Director, Planning and Development

Kevin Schronce, Central Region, Planning and Development

In order to ensure that establishment of a Commercial Rehabilitation District and issuance of a
certificate for a Commercial Rehabilitation District is consistent with the City?s Master Plan of Policies
and will have the reasonable likelihood to increase commercial activity; create, retain or prevent a loss
of employment; revitalize an urban area; or increase the number of residents in a community, pursuant
to State of Michigan, Public Act 210 of 2005 (section 207.843 and section 207.844), the Planning and
Development Department's Planning Division submits the following interpretation. The Petitioner is Real
Estate Interests, LLC

Location and Project Proposal:

The project will be a 3.8 acre mixed use development to provide retail, hotel, housing, and dining
experience with interwoven public spaces. Project plans to incorporate a 225 room hotel, 80,000 square
feet of retail space, hundreds of multi-family residences, affordable housing, co-living housing units, and
60 residential condominiums

Master Plan Interpretation

The subject site area is designated Mixed Residential-Commercial (MRC). Mixed Residential-
Commercial areas consist primarily of high density housing developed compatibly with commercial
and/or institutional uses. This classification is well suited to areas proximal to existing centers of major
commercial activity, major thoroughfares, transportation nodes, or gateways into the city.

The following policies ofthe Lower Woodward neighborhood describe the following recommendations:
I Policy 2.1: Develop Woodward and Cass as high-density mixed use corridors with housing and

ground-floor commercial
I Policy 3.1: Along Woodward, encourage high-density mixed uses complimentary to the area?s

cultural anchors
I Policy 8.1: Recognize and protect distinctive urban vistas along Woodward to the Central

Business District
I Policy 9.1: Develop design guidelines to promote linkages among and to the various cultural and

entertainment districts

The proposed development conforms to the Future General Land Use characteristics of the
area.

RE: Request for the Establishment of an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District at
2001 Park Avenue, Detroit, Michigan

Honorable City Council:

Please accept this letter as a request to establish an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
Development District, pursuant to the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act, MCL 125.2781, et.
seq. The applicant company is In?nity Acquisitions, LLC, an af?liate entity of In?nity Homes
Corp. whose address is 42400 Grand River Avenue, Suite 112, Novi, Michigan, 48375.
This request relates to the property located at 2001 Park Avenue, Detroit, Michigan 48226, tax
parcel ID No. 02000382 (the ?Property?). The Property is described in detail in Attachment A

to this letter.
I. Summary and History of the Applicant, the Property, and the Project.
In?nity Acquisitions, LLC and In?nity Homes Corp.

The applicant company is an af?liate IHC, a Michigan corporation, which has
dedicated its corporate mission to making the American dream of owning a new home a reality
for thousands of Michigan residents and families. TAC is the owner of the Property, and IHC is

the developer for the Project.

Established in 2000, IHC has built over 1,300 single and multi-family homes throughout
Southeastern Michigan. IHC specializes in home building, land development, land and real
estate acquisitions, residential and commercial leasing, property management of company-owned
properties, and property management. IHC was founded on the core principles of developing
and establishing a solid reputation for providing not only affordability in the residences built, but
also providing an unparalleled level of quality and customer service to all IHC residents and
customers. IHC is proud to deliver products that it considers to be ?lasting investments? to all

IHC residents and customers.

City of Detroit City Council
June 6, 2019
Page 2 of 7

business model is aggressive, yet ?nancially conservative. IHC is a fully diversi?ed
development company with the ability and resources to transform large tracts of land and
obsolete, unkempt buildings into affordable, desirable, and well-built residential housing. IHC
transforms buildings and properties from the initial acquisition and design stages, through state
and local government entitlements, through land development, sales and marketing and ?nal
home building construction processes. Our current inventory of nearly 1,000 entitled and
improved homesites in addition to several hundred acres of land throughout southeastern
Michigan under our current ownership positions us to continue to be an industry leader in our

marketplace for years to come.

Founded in Michigan, IHC and its af?liates are dedicated to the development and revitalization
of Michigan communities by providing affordable, quality housing options to Michigan
residents. in developing and rehabilitating residential housing, IHC has demonstrated a
relentless commitment to preserving the traditional and historic characteristics of Michigan

communities and architecture.

The Property.

TAC acquired the Property in February 2018. Situated on the Property is a historic 12-story
high-rise building (the ?Building?) designed by the infamous Albert Kahn?the ?architect of
Detroit?. The Building totals 105,000 square feet and was constructed in 1922. Although
currently obsolete and in complete disrepair, the Building is truly a historical landmark for the

City.

The Property was previously owned by the late Ralph Sachs, who acquired the Property in 1981.
During his ownership, Sachs allowed the Building and the Property to fall into complete
disrepair. Due to its unkempt, dated, crumbling, and inef?cient infrastructure, the Building has
been sitting idle for years. In fact, in 2015, during Sachs? ownership, the Building was slated for
demolition. At that time, the City of Detroit Law Department described the condition of the
Building as ?open, vacant and dangerous.?l The City ?rrther stated that the Building ?is the very
de?nition of irreparable harm to the public.? Upon Sachs? death, the Building and the Property
were listed for sale. TAC purchased the Property from Sachs? estate.

The Project.

TAC will undertake a complete transformation and rehabilitation of the Property and the
Building from an obsolete, desolate structure into a state-of?the?art, multi-use facility that will be
used for residential housing and retail (the ?Project?). The Project will include rehabilitation of
all lZ-?oors of the Building, and will yield approximately 77 new residential apartments.
Twenty Percent?or approximately 15 units?will be designated as affordable housing units.
The Project will yield approximately 61,550 square feet of new living space, plus an additional
15,000 square feet of general common areas for residents. The Project will also yield more than

5,500 square feet of new retail space, which TAC plans to develop into a restaurant and/or retail.
All of these Project components are included in request for OPRA incentive. After the
Project is complete, TAC and IHC will retain ownership and management of the Building and
the Property to ensure that their high-standards for Building quality, cleanliness, and

maintenance are preserved.

With the aforementioned improvements, TAC plans to add between 50-60 full-time and/or part-
time jobs to operate, manage, and maintain the Building, the Property, and the retail/restaurant
facilities to be developed in the Building. The addition of these jobs will add an anticipated 
in payroll annually to the City of Detroit. TAC also anticipates to add between 300-400
temporary ?ill-time and/or part?time high-skilled jobs to facilitate the Project, including jobs for
demolition, remediation, rehabilitation, and construction. The addition of these jobs will add
over in payroll annually to the City of Detroit.

It is extremely important to TAC to preserve the culture and history of the Property during
restoration, and hiring Detroit-based workers is a critical part of that process. TAC has already
hired Detroit-based architectural and design ?rm Kraemer Design Group to design the Project,
and collaboration between TAC and Kraemer is well underway. For construction-related
employment opportunities, TAC and its general contractor plan to send Requests for Proposals
to, and solicit bids from, Detroit?based contractors to work on the Project. Through the RFP and
bid?solicitation process, TAC plans to hire as many Detroit-based contractors as possible for the
Project. Alter construction and rehabilitation, TAC plans to hire Detroit residents for ?ill- and
part-time permanent positions for retail operations and building management job opportunities.
Please see President Jones Incentive Information Chart, submitted with this Petition, for
further information on anticipated job opportunities and plan for hiring Detroit residents to ?ll

these opportunities.

In order to complete this rehabilitation and transformational Project, TAC plans to invest over
in the Property and the surrounding area. The Building requires more than in
investment just to restore it to a safe and economically ef?cient ?mctional condition. As part of
the plan to develop the Property into a state-of-the-art residential and retail campus, the
Building and the Property require extensive rehabilitation and remediation. The rehabilitation
and remediation plan includes, but is not limited to: removal of environmental hazards; electrical
modi?cations; gas system modi?cations; foundation improvements; improvements to
ventilation; HVAC repair and replacement; security and safety enhancements; repairing and
likely replacement of elevators and special equipment; updating public infrastructure including
roads, sidewalks, utilities, and sewage systems; improvements to Property walkways, driveways,
landscaping, fencing, site lighting, and drainage; lead and asbestos abatement and removal; and
improvement and restoration of the crumbling and desolate exterior facade.

In 2017, the Building was dubbed ?the last downtown building that of?cially had been
designated ?dangerous??. The Building and the Property are historical and cultural landmarks in
the City, and TAG anticipates that the Detroit community will bene?t greatly from their repair
and restoration. In order to preserve the historical and cultural integrity of the Building.
restoration, rehabilitation, and repair will be exceptionally expensive.

The improvements will begin once the requested Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District is
established and continue through 2021. Given the desolate and hazardous condition of the
Building when it was acquired by TAC, TAC has already begun emergency remediation 
repair of electrical systems, securing Building and Property premises, and light environmental
remediation) in order to make the Property safe. TAC has secured plans to begin rehabilitation
of the Building and the Property, including a plan and blueprints for rehabilitation and plans for

environmental remediation.

In short, TAC is thrilled to begin this Project and assume its role in the revitalization and
restoration of Detroit. TAC is not some out?of?state developer looking for an easy investment
and quick capital gain. Rather, TAC (and IHC) has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to
creating affordable, quality housing in Michigan, and views this Project as a long-term
investment in the City of Detroit. TAC is committed to cultural, architectural, and community
preservation in completing this Project. And, as a local Michigan company, TAC (and IHC) is
humbled by the opportunity to restore and revive a historic Detroit landmark, while creating new
job opportunities and critical housing options for Michigan residents.

TAC has secured initial Verbal support from the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation and may
request CRP or other related support from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.

II. Applicable Michigan Statute to Determine OPRA Eligibility.

TAC requests the establishment of an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District for the Property.
This request is made pursuant to section 125.2783 of the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act,

which states, in relevant part:

(1) A quali?ed local governmental unit, by resolution of its legislative body, may
establish 1 or more obsolete property rehabilitation districts that may consist of 1
or more parcels or tracts of land or a portion of a parcel or tract of land, if at the
time the resolution is adopted, the parcel or tract of land or portion of a parcel or
tract of land within the district is either of the following:

Obsolete property in an area characterized by obsolete conunercial property or
commercial housing property.

(2) The legislative body of a quali?ed local governmental unit may establish an
obsolete property rehabilitation district on its own initiative or upon a written
request ?led by the owner or owners of property comprising at least 50% of all
taxable value of the property located within a proposed obsolete property
rehabilitation district. The written request must be ?led with the clerk of the

quali?ed local governmental unit.

Need for Exemption Certificate.

Securing an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation exemption certi?cate is critical to ability to
?nance the Project and rehabilitate the Property. Without an exemption certi?cate, TAC will
have signi?cant ?nancial obstacles to overcome in funding the Project. If TAC is unable to
secure an exemption certi?cate, TAC will be unable to undertake rehabilitation of the Property

and the Building.

As outlined above, the Property and the Building is in complete disrepair, has been vacant for
over a decade, and is currently obsolete. It is tragic that the Building?s prior owner demonstrated
such neglect and disconcert for the condition of the Building and the Property?which are true
historic landmarks in the City of Detroit. It will take a signi?cant investment (upwards of 
not including acquisition of the Property) to restore the Building and the Property to functioning

condition.

TAC and its af?liate IHC currently employ approximately 40 full-time employees. TAC
anticipates that the Project will add 4-5 full?time employees to TAC payroll by 2020. These new
TAC employees will work exclusively in the City of Detroit.

anticipated capital and private investments in the Project are as follows:

 

 

 

Infrastructure $25,000 0.12%
Site Improvement $25,000 0.12%
Demolition $525,000 2.42%
Building New Construction $0 0.00%
Building Renovation $12,240,000 56.41%
Machinery Equipment Purchased $250,000 1.15%
Furniture Fixtures Purchased $200,000 0.92%
Other Soft Costs $680,000 3.13%
$7,755,000 35.74%
Total Investment $2 I .70 0,000 100.00%

 

 

Anticipated Funding Sources for the Project are as follows:

IV. Length of Requested Exemption.

TAC requests an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Exemption Certi?cate for a period of twelve
(12) years.

V. Statement of Economic Advantages Arising From Exemption

TAC anticipates that the City of Detroit will experience signi?cant economic bene?ts from
rehabilitation of the Property. These economic bene?ts include, but are not limited to:

. Restoration of a historic, iconic, cultural and architectural Detroit landmark.

- Creation of up to 400 short-term jobs to facilitate and complete the Project, which will
yield an anticipated increase in payroll in Detroit.

0 Creation of 50 - 60 long-term jobs to manage, operate, and maintain the Building
(including Building retail and restaurant space) and the Property, which will yield an
anticipated increase in payroll in Detroit.

I Development of state-of-the-art rental housing in Detroit, which will attract and
accommodate new residents and professionals to the City.

0 rehabilitation Project will yield a signi?cant increase in the taxable value of the
Property, and increased tax payments to the City. Restoring the Property and the
Building to an economically ef?cient, functional structure will yield higher tax payments
to the City. TAC is current on all taxes owed on the Property. See Attachment B, Paid

Receipt of Current Taxes.

In addition to this request, TAC has also applied for, or anticipates applying for, the following
public assistance programs:

a Historic Preservation Tax Incentive
. MEDC Community Revitalization Program

VI. Closing

For all of the above reasons, TAC respectfully requests that the City Council establish an
Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District encompassing the Property located at 2001 Park
Avenue. Should you have any questions regarding the Project, the Property; or otherwise, please
contact our legal representative Regina Staudacher at 248.723.0311.

Abandoned Park Avenue
Building Suddenly Faces
Demolition

By Paul Beshouri Aug 15. 2014, 3:16pm EDT

21w

Another slice of downtown Detroit's historic architecture looks ready to fall.
According to the I the city is "taking legal steps" to force the
demolition of the Park Avenue Building, an Albert Kahn design completed in
1922. Today, the building is a mess of gaping windows secured only by a ?imsy

fence.

The city's court ?lings get pretty dramatic, declaring the building to be "the
very de?nition of irreparable harm to the public." In reality, that title
more accurately applies to the building's longtime owner, Ralph Sachs. You
might remember Sachs as the owner of the historic Hotel Charlevoix, which
he neglected for decades until tumbling bricks convinced a judge to order

demolition last year.

The PAB, however, appears to be in much better condition than the Charlevoix.
It also boasts some beautiful exterior ornamentation. Why suddenly push for
demolition rather than mothball it for later renovation? Two words: ?ag
District. The PAB stands in Columbia Park, one of the district's planned
"neighborhoods." Plans describe Columbia Park as a modern
neighborhood anchored by a new public green space."

UPDATE We 're hearing that the empty Hotel Charlevoix property is

Re: Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District Infinity Acquisitions LLC

Dear Mr. Cox:

The Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of the Assessor, has reviewed the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
District lrjcated at 2001 Park in the Foxtown area in the City of Detroit.

The rationale for creating Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Districts under PA 146 of 2000, as amended, is based on the
anticipation of increased market value upon completion of new construction and /or significant rehabilitation of existing
commercial property and commercial housing property Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not
necessarily generate additional market value

infinity Acquisitions LLC intends to completely renovate the vacant 12?story historic office building consisting of 92,293
square feet of building area, built in 1923, on .184 acres of land into a mixedause facility with 77 new residential apartments
with 20% ofthe units with affordable rent, 5,500 square feet of retail and a general common area for residents
Rehabilitation is proposed to include lead and asbestos removal, restoration of exterior facade, foundation improvements,
HVAC repair/replacement, elevator repairs, and electrical and gas system modifications

This property meets the criteria set forth under PA 146 of 2000, as amended it applies to blighted, functionally obsolete
and contaminated properties. ?Rehabilitation," meaning that changes to qualified facilities that are required to restore or
modify the property, together with all appurtenances, to an economically efficient condition Rehabilitation also includes
major renovation and modification including, but not necessarily limited to, the improvement offloor loads, correction of
deficient or excessive height, new or improved fixed building equipment, including heating, ventilation, and lighting,
reducing multistory facilities to 1 or 2 stories, adding additional stories to a facility or adding additional space on the same
floor level not to exceed 100% of the existing floor space on that floor level, improved structural support including
foundations, improved roof structure and cover, floor replacement, improved wall placement, improved exterior and
interior appearance of buildings, and other physical changes required to restore or change the obsolete property to an
economically efficient condition

A field investigation indicated that the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District located at 2001 Park is eligible as
it pertains to the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act under A 146 of 2000, as amended

RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Obsolete Property District (PA 146) at 2001 Park Avenue
DATE: August 9, 2019

CC: Maurice Cox, Director, Planning and Development

Kevin Schronce, PDD Central, Planning an Development

In order to ensure that the creation of an Obsolete Property District is in conformance with the City's
Master Plan of Policies and will have the reasonable likelihood to increase commercial activity; create,
retain or prevent a loss of employment; revitalize an urban area; or increase the number of residents in
a community, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public Act 146 of 2000 (section 125.2788), the Planning and
Development Department submits the following interpretation. The Petitioner is Infinity Acquisitions,
LLC

Location and Project Proposal: Project will rehabilitate an approximately 105,000 square foot property
into a multi-use facility for residential and retail. Project is anticipated to be 12?floors and yield
approximately 77 new residential apartments. 20% of the units will be designated as affordable housing.
The project is approximately 61,550 square feet of residential and 15,000 square feet of general
common areas for residents. The project will accommodate approximately 5,500 square feet of new
retail space

Master Plan Interpretation

The subject site area is designated Mixed Residential-Commercial (MRC). Mixed Residential-Commercial
areas consist primarily of high density housing developed compatibly with commercial and/or institutional
uses. This classification is well suited to areas proximal to existing centers of major commercial activity,
major thoroughfares, transportation nodes, or gateways into the city.?

The proposed development conforms to the Future General Land Use characteristics of the
area.

Detroit City Council

Coleman A. Young Municipal Center
2 Woodward Ave Suite 1340

Detroit, MI 48226

RE: Request for the Establishment of an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act (OPRA)
Certificate at 40 Hague Street, Detroit, Michigan 48202 for RainCheck

Development, LLC

Honorable City Council:

Please accept this letter for an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Certi?cate (OPRC) for the
property located at 40 Hague Street, Detroit, Michigan 48202, which is referred to herein as the
?Property? and described on Attachment A. The Property will be rehabilitated by the petitioner
and current owner, RainCheck Development, LLC.

Company and Project Synopsis

RainCheck Development, LLC (the ?Developer?) is led by Neal Check. Mr. Check serves as the
manager and has worked more than 25 years in the low voltage industry, providing lighting.
security, entertainment systems, and home automation services via SoundCheck, Inc. Check
then combined his extensive tech-based knowledge with a passion for developing construction
projects, kicking off a new venture in single family residential development that feature smart-
home technology. Thus, TechHome Building Co., LLC was formed. Currently, RainCheck
Development has a new townhome development underway on 4th Street in Midtown Detroit that
highlights these smart home features. Their development experiences continues in New Center,
where RainCheck has purchased and is renovating the historic Sanders Confectionary on

Woodward Avenue.

The proposed project contains three parcels. 40 Hague contains the current building and is
approximately 0.49 acres. 8524 Woodward Avenue is approximately 0.16 acres contains the
southwestern parking lot. The third and final parcel at 59 East Philadelphia Street is the
southeastern parking lot and is approximately 0.86 acres. The property is roughly bounded by
Hague Street to the northwest, an alleyway to the northeast, the property line and East
Philadelphia Street to the southeast, and Woodward Avenue to the southwest. The project is
located in the North End Neighborhood of Detroit with the northern terminus of the Q-Line
located approximately one?half mile south along Woodward. The property is currently occupied
by a vacant 2-story of?ce building totaling approximately 37,000 square feet and two parking

lots.

The proposed project will entail the rehabilitation of the current building into 38 residential
apartment units. Each unit will include new, modern appliances, and feature open, loft-style ?oor
plans. As part of the rehabilitation, the building will receive new utility distribution including
electrical and plumbing, new energy efficient heating, cooling and ventilation systems, new
energy ef?cient windows and doors, kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, appliances, and ?xtures,

Request for Establishment of an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Certi?cate at
40 Hague Street, Detroit MI 48202
for RainCheck Development, LLC

an improved access stairwell, and repairs to the building structure as needed. The structure will
also be brought up to code, as applicable.

The Necessity for Tax Relief

Substantial investment is necessary to rehabilitate the area into a viable, long?term
development. Additionally, the underutilized property will require repair and selective demolition
with the property rehabilitation. The overall internal rate of return for the proposed development
will be extremely low without the receipt of an OPRC and therefore, the development would not

be possible without it.

The costs associated with the rehabilitation require multiple capital sources including equity
contributed by RainCheck Development, LLC. Members as well as an interim construction loan,
and upon completion, a long-term loan product. In order to secure this financing and future
tenants, the operating costs of the proposed renovations and redevelopment of the project need
to be kept as low as possible (including property taxes).

PA 146 Request
A 12?year abatement is being requested.
Economic Advantages of the Rehabilitation

Upon completion. the Development will return an obsolete property to productive use and will
increase residential density in an area characterized by disinvestment. Activation of this
property will spur further growth and act as a catalyst for future redevelopment of numerous
vacant and blighted properties along Hague Street, and the Woodward Avenue corridor of the
North End Neighborhood, providing spinoff consumer spending in an area that is currently left
out of redevelopment planning.

The granting of the OPRA tax abatement will not result in any fewer taxes to the City of Detroit
in the short-term or long-term. On a short-term basis approximately 18 construction jobs will be
created. The general contractor, Monahan Co, has several Detroit-based subcontractors that
they have used in the past and that they have requested bids from to ensure Detroit-based
contractors and workers bene?t from the redevelopment.

Upon successful redevelopment, the proposed redevelopment associated with the Development
will create approximately one full?time equivalent (FTE) job related to the management and
maintenance of the property. This new job, along with the new residents living at the
development, will generate increased income taxes for the City of Detroit.

Following expiration of the 12-year abatement the building will deliver a significant increase in
tax revenue. Over time, the successful redevelopment and cultural growth will a positive impact

on the neighborhood.

Closing

RainCheck Development, LLC, is composed of seasoned professionals with extensive
experience in residential development throughout Metro Detroit.

Schedule

Construction activities are anticipated to commence fall of 2019 and last 18 months.

Statement of Economic Advantages

The proposed Development will bring needed investment to a vacant area of Detroit?s North End
Neighborhood. The Development will increase residential density in an area that is characterized
by vacancy and has the perception of being unsafe. Activation of this property will spur further
growth and infill development, and act as a catalyst for future redevelopment of numerous vacant
and blighted properties along the Woodward Avenue corridor and the surrounding neighborhoods
and provide spinoff consumer spending in the North End.

The granting of the tax abatement will not result in any fewer taxes to the City of Detroit in the
short?term or long-term. Upon successful redevelopment, the Development will generate
increased property taxes, through the newly renovated apartment building.

On a short?term basis approximately 18 full-time equivalent (FTE) construction jobs will be created
for a construction period of approximately 18 months.

On a long-term basis the proposed redevelopment associated with the District will create
approximately one FTE job and anticipated to house approximately 82 new Detroit residents
within the 38 units. Therefore, it is anticipated the City of Detroit will collect approximately 2.4%
income tax per resident per year. The table below illustrates the resident tax impact the
development will have following completion.

Detroit's North End Neighborhood was once an important hub of automobile production in the
early 20th century, housing more than 50,000 workers. Additionally, several popular Motown
musicians including Aretha Franklin and Diana Ross called the neighborhood home. The North
End is just beginning its renaissance of in?ll housing projects to revitalize a vibrant neighborhood.
The proposed 40 Hague Redevelopment project is part of the neighborhood's transitional area

between the commercial nature of Woodward Avenue and the residential neighborhood branching
east. The 40 Hauge Redevelopment works to transform an underutilized Property into a
contemporary residential apartment building and will increase residential density in an area that
is characterized by vacancy and has the perception of being unsafe. Investment such as this will
help create an integrated and vibrant North End for all Detroiters.

Following expiration of the 12-year abatement the building will deliver a signi?cant increase in tax
revenue. Over time, the successful redevelopment and cultural growth will have a city-wide

impact.

TO: Ashley McCleod, Housing and Revitalization
FROM: Esther Yang, Planning and Development
RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Obsolete Property District (PA 146) at 40 Hague Street and 59 E.

Philadelphia Street
[Petition #895]
DATE: June 13, 2019
CC: Maurice Cox, Director, Planning and Development
Kevin Schronce, Central Region, Planning and Development

In order to ensure that the creation of an Obsolete Property District is in conformance with the City?s
Master Plan of Policies and will have the reasonable likelihood to increase commercial activity; create,
retain or prevent a loss of employment; revitalize an urban area; or increase the number of residents in
a community, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public Act 146 of 2000 (section 125.2788), the Planning and
Development Department submits the following interpretation. The Petitioner is RainCheck
Development LLC

Location and Project Proposal: 40 Hague Street and 59 East Philadelphia Street

Note: 40 Hague Street and 59 East Philadelphia Street; 8524 Woodward Avenue is an address that does
not exist and may be a retired parcel. According to city records, the property located at indicated 8524
Woodward is absorbed into the parcel with the address of 40 Hague Street.

The project proposal seeks to renovate existing structure to create 38 residential apartment units and
parking lot improvements on 59 E. Philadelphia Street. The proposed development will include 36,700
square feet of living space divided into 2 studios, 28 one-bedroom units, and 8 two-bedroom layouts. A
minimum of 20% of units will be priced to meet affordable unit requirements for 80% of the Area
Median Income. Greenspace will be incorporated throughout the development; a landscaped interior
courtyard will feature eating areas and a rooftop garden. Further greenspace will be created by
converting western parking lot into a fenced private park for residential use.

Master Plan Interpretation
The subject sites are located on areas designated as Neighborhood Commercial and Low/Medium

Density Residential (RLM)

The subject site area is designated Neighborhood Commercial (CN). Neighborhood Commercial Districts
generally consist of a large collection of contiguous storefronts along a street or streets. This commercial
type is pedestrian oriented with wide sidewalks and landscaping. Parking should be on the street, in
structures (with ground floor retail), at the rear of commercial establishments or in concentrated nodes
at the periphery ofthe area. In addition to commercial uses, Neighborhood Commercial areas may also
include institutional uses such as libraries and post offices.

 

 

The subject site area is designated Low/Medium Density Residential (RLM). Low/Medium Density
Residential areas should have an overall density of 8 to 16 dwelling units per net residential acre. The
areas are often characterized by two or four family homes with small yards, on-street parking, or
garages with alley access. The residential classifications allow for neighborhood-scale commercial
development. For instance, in a Low/Medium Density Residential area, small scale commerce 
convenience stores) should exist to serve residents' day-to-day needs.

The following policies of the Middle Woodward neighborhood describe the following recommendations:
. Goal: 3 Increase Residential Density
- Policy 3.1 Develop East and West Grand Boulevard, and Woodward as a high-density mixed use
area, with housing and ground-floor commercial

The project proposal seeks to convert the interior of an existing structure that states former building
operations to include residence, printing and engraving services, professional offices, schools, and
automotive sales and services into high-density residential. The subject site is zoned B4 where multi-
family dwellings are conditional. The proposed impacts are primarily internal within the structure with
external landscaping upgrades and are not believed to have a negative impact on the character of the
surrounding area.

The proposed development conforms to the Future General Land Use recommendations for
this area.

(OPRA) tax abatement we submit the following Employment Narrative.

1.

The proposed Development is comprised of 8524 Woodward Avenue, 40 Hague Street, and 59
East Philadelphia Street in Detroit's North End Neighborhood. The property is loosely bounded by
Hauge Street to the north, an alley to the east, East Philadelphia Street to the south, and the
property lineNVoodward Avenue to the west. The project includes renovating the building located
at 40 Hague Street. Once the rehabilitation is completed, the two-story building will offer 38 loft
style apartments in the North End Neighborhood. Living space totals approximately 26,900 square
feet. Two studios, 32 one-bedroom units, and four two?bedroom layouts will be made available.
Twenty percent of the residential units (8 in total) will be reserved as affordable units at 60% Area
Median Income (AMI), which will consist of five (5) one bedroom units and three (3) two bedroom
units. The proposed redevelopment will create additional housing and increased residential density
in an area of the North End Neighborhood that has been behind the curve for investment and
redevelopment.

Greenspace will be incorporated throughout the development; a landscaped interior courtyard will
feature eating areas and a unique place for residents to relax and entertain. Further greenspace
will be created by converting the western parking lot (8524 Woodward Avenue) into a fenced private
park for resident use. Additionally, improvements will be made to the eastern parking lot (59 East
Philadelphia Street) to serve as designated residential parking.

On a short-term basis approximately 18 full-time equivalent (FTE) construction jobs will be created
for a construction period of approximately 18 months.

On a long-term basis the proposed redevelopment associated with the District will create
approximately one FTE job and anticipated to house approximately 82 new Detroit residents within
the 38 units. Total investment is approximately $8 Million.

The future permanent job creation will be associated with the management and maintenance of the
property. RainCheck is currently working with third party management companies and it is planned
that the management is be Detroit based, employing Detroit residents. During the construction
period, The Monahan Company, as the project's general contractor, is well-versed and has an
inventory of Detroit-based subcontractors that they intend to utilize during redevelopment activities.

RE: Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Certificate - RainCheck Development LLC
Property Address: 40 Hague
Parcel Number: 01002660-0

Dear Ms. Trudeau:

The Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of the Assessor, has reviewed the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
certificate application for the property located at 40 Hague at the North End area Of the City of Detroit.

The rationale for granting Obsolete Property Rehabilitation certificates under PA 146 of 2000, as amended, is based on the
anticipation ofincreased market value upon completion ofnew construction and /or significant rehabilitation of existing commercial
property and commercial housing property. Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not necessarily generate
additional market value.

RainCheck Development LLC intends to rehabilitate the building into 38 loft style residential units consisting of two studios, 32 one-
bedroom units, and 4 two?bedroom units with modern appliances of which twenty percent of the unit being reserved as affordable
units. The two?story building at 40 Hague is currently vacant and consist of 36,944 square feet of office building area, built in 1935
and situated on .658 acres of land. Rehabilitation will include new utility distribution, including electrical and plumbing, new energy
efficient heating, cooling and ventilation systems, new energy efficient windows and doors, kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, fixtures
and an improved access to the stairwell with repairs to the building structure as needed.

The 2019 values are as follows:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Building Assessed Building Land Land

01002660-0 4O Hague 529,100 529,100 20,800 20.800

 

This property meets the criteria set forth under PA 146 of 2000, as amended. It applies to blighted, functionally obsolete and
contaminated properties. "Rehabilitation," meaning that changes to qualified facilities that are required to restore or modify the
property, together with all appurtenances, to an economically efficient condition.

The property is located near the North End area and is expected to increase commercial activity, create employment, retain
employment, increase the number of residents in the community and revitalize an urban area.

A field investigation indicated that the prOperty located at 40 Hague is eligible as it pertains to the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
Act under PA. 146 of 2000, as amended.
