Item No. 2

Approval of the FY2019 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV)
Administrative Plan
Presenters:

Cheryl Burns, Chief HCV Officer
Derek Messier, Chief Property Officer

Recommendation
The Chief Executive Officer recommends that the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority
approve the FY2019 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Administrative Plan.
The requested action in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable Chicago Housing Authority
board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) regulations.
Background
Pursuant to HUD regulations, CHA is required to implement an administrative plan to govern its HCV Program.
The HCV Administrative Plan provides required information on the rules CHA will follow in the administration of
the HCV Program. The FY2019 HCV Administrative Plan contains updated and minor policy changes as needed
to be consistent with HUD requirements and current practice.
CHA held a 30-day public comment period conducted from September 28 through October 29, 2018.
Announcements for the public comment process appeared on CHA’s website and in the Chicago Defender,
Chicago Sun-Times and Hoy newspapers CHA also distributed resident notices across RAD properties and sent
email notification to HCV participants.
During the public comment period, both residents and the public alike were able to submit comments orally
and in writing, regarding the information contained in the Proposed FY2019 HCV Administrative Plan. CHA held
three public hearings during the 30-day comment period on October 9, October 11, and October 17.
Prior to finalizing the Proposed FY2019 HCV Administrative Plan, CHA gave consideration to comments received
during the public comment period. Public comments and CHA responses will be provided to the Board prior to
approval and will be available to the public in the final plan amendment posted on CHA’s website after Board
approval.
