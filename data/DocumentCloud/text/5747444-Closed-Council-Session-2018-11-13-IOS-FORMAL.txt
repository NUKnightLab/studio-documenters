To: The Honorable Detroit City Council:

Subject: Law Administration and Operation Appropriation #00527 Increase

The Law Department respectfully requests authorization to increase their fiscal year 2018-19
budget expenditures by $746,210 in the Law Administration and Operations appropriation #00527, for
procuring unbudgeted outside legal services for defending the City of Detroit in various legal matters.

In View of recent lawsuit filings against the City of Detroit, the Law Department is in need of
additional outside legal services. In addition to the City law department?s customary case load, there are
extraordinary events that have required engagement of outside counsel.

Additionally, Miller Canfield has been providing legal services relating to the bankruptcy,
restructuring efforts, and litigation, and this amendment continues those services. Soon after the
bankruptcy plan was approved in late 2014, the City moved as quickly as possible to transition work away
from Jones Day to Miller Canfield. Miller Canfield?s rates are generally less than 50% of those of Jones
Day. The City continues to use Miller Canfield for many bankruptcy and restructuring issues such as, for
example, the creation ofthe retiree protection trust fund. Miller Ca nfield provides discounted rates (using
2015 rates discounted by except for two attorneys in the bankruptcy department an area where
rates are typically higher. This additional funding will also allow the City to add $500,000 to the contract.

To offset the expenditure appropriation increase, there is an unbudgeted general fund revenue
of $746,210 for the settlement amount received from the State of Michigan Department of Attorney
General for the LIBOR settlement from the Deutsche Bank. That was a class action alleging manipulation
of interest rates. The City was a class member and received the $746,210 settlement as a result.

I am requesting approval from your Honorable Body to adopt the enclosed resolution. If you have
any questions or concerns regarding this matter, please feel free to contact me at (313) 237-5037.

A waiver of reconsideration is requested.

November 5, 2018
To: The Honorable Detroit City Council:
Subject: Law Administration and Operation Appropriation 00527 Increase

The Department of Corporation Counsel respectfully requests authorization to increase the
fiscal year 2018-19 budget expenditure by $746,210 in the Law Administration and Operations
appropriation 005727, for procuring unbudgeted outside legal services for defending the City of
Detroit in various legal matters.

In view of recent lawsuit filings against the City of Detroit, the Law Department is in need
of additional outside legal services. Speci?cally, in addition to the City law department?s
customary case load, the following extraordinary events have required engagement of outside
counsel:

Eight pending cases relating to towing disputes, all filed within the last year or so (closed session
pending);

Seven pending cases involving claims of wrongful incarceration, all filed within the past year
(closed session pending);

Lawsuit challenging the constitutionality Of the no-fault law, filed this year;
63 medical marihuana appeals from decisions of the BZA, all filed in the last 2 years;

Just in the past several months, Law has had to engage outside counsel for several DPD officers
and other City employees due to a legal conflict of interest that prevents the Law Department from
representing them. For example, where City denies representation to a DPD officer, the City must
still must provide representation of the officer until the denial has been upheld by an arbitrator (if
DPOA seeks arbitration). The law department must engage outside counsel for that representation;

In recent years there has been a significant inc1ease in first party no?fault lawsuits brought by
medical providers. The result' 1s that there is often multiple lawsuits asserted for 1 injured person
1 by the injtued pe1 son and others by medical providers who are dissatisfied with City payments
These cases are ordinarily handled in?house but the volume has strained the capacity of the law

department.

Finally, Miller Canfield has been providing legal services relating to the bankruptcy,
restructuring efforts, and litigation, and this amendment continues those services. Soon after the
bankruptcy plan was approved in late 2014, the City moved as quickly as possible to transition
work away from Jones Day to Miller Canfield. Miller Canfield?s rates are generally less than 50%

those of Jones Day. The City continues to use Miller Canfield for many bankruptcy and
restructuring issues such as, for example, the creation of the retiree protection trust fund.

The City proposes that the seventh amendment cover the period 1/1/2019? 6/30/2020.
The City proposes adding $500,000 to the contract to bring the not to exceed cap up to
$12,200,522.56. Miller Canfield provides discounted rates (using 2015 rates discounted by 
except for two attorneys in the bankruptcy department? an area where rates are typically higher.

To offset the expenditure appropriation increase, the general fund revenue appropriation?
Misc. Revenue increase by $746,210 for the settlement amount received from the State of

I am requesting approval from your Honorable Body to adopt the enclosed resolution. If
you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter, please feel free to contact me at 237?

To Whom It May Concern,

The Belle Isle Conservancy is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to
protect, preserve, restore and enhance the natural environment, historic
structures and unique character of Belle Isle as a public park for the enjoyment
of all now and forever.

We are the result of the merger of four dedicated park enthusiast groups who
shared a passion for Belle Isle and its history. Since our formation in 2011, we
have completed many projects to restore the island and its numerous historical
gems. Through fundraising efforts, we have reopened (2012) and assumed
management of the Belle Isle Aquarium and have executed extensive (aquarium
specific) repairs including but not limited to: roof repairs, sidewalk repaying,
reinstallation ofaquarium skylights, and restoration of the lily pond.

The Belle Isle Conservancy works in close partnership with the Michigan
Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) and the City of Detroit to bring
additional resources for supporting and sustaining the park. Together, we
contribute to upholding Belle Isle?s status as a rich portion of history for the
community to enjoy. Our efforts also extend to assist the MDNR with meeting
critical needs on the island, like helping to secure funding for the repairs
currently being bade to the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory.

We are applying for a raffle license in order to utilize raffles as a fundraising tool
at some of our major events, such as the annual Polish the Jewel Belle Isle
Legacy Luncheon. These large fundraising events are responsible for a major
portion of the funding we need to invest in future projects on Belle Isle. Some of
those projects include: beach revitalization and new splash park, aquarium
improvements, and anti?littering campaign.

Please consider granting the Belle Isle Conservancy a raffle license so that we

HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL:

RE: CITY COUNCIL RECESS from: Wednesday, November 21, 2018 through Tuesday, January 8, 2019

Ordinance No. 15-00, Chapter 21 Article 3, requires the approval of your Honorable Body for the purchase of
Goods and Services over the value of $25,000, all Contracts for Personal Services, Renewals, or Extensions of
Contracts, or the exercise of an option to renew or extend a Contract. Based upon the above scheduled Recess, there
will be a delay in obtaining your approval for needed Goods and Services. As a result, I will be unable to meet my
obligation to obtain needed Goods and Services for the user agencies, and they, in return, will be unable to meet
their obligation to supply mandated services to the People of the City of Detroit.

Therefore, during the Recess, I request that your Honorable Body approve our purchase of Goods and Services
requiring your Approval under Ordinance No.15-00 under provisions as follows:

I. Weekly list of Contract Agenda Items and Grant Award Notification, which are distributed by the
Office of the City Clerk to Members of the City Council each Thursday, will be held through
Wednesday of the following week.

11. In the event any Council Member objects to the Contract or Purchase Order or the Grant Award
the Contract or Grant award will be held either until formal action by the City Council or
withdrawal of the objection by the objecting Council Member.

2. No Contract, Purchase Order, or Grant shall be issued if a Protest has been ?led, or if a Supplier has not obtained
any required Tax Clearances, Insurance, Af?davits, or Bonding.

The ?rst list under the Recess procedures will be prepared by the Of?ce of Contracting and Procurement on
Thursday, November 28, 2018.
