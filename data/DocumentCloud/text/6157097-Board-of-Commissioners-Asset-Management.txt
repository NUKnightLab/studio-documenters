Summary: The objective of the JOC program is to provide an alternate procurement method to enable the County

The request to increase in the amount of $3,500,000.00 is based on the available capacity of the JOC Contractors.
The Gordian Group’s fee for the services provided is assessed as a percentage of the value of construction procured
by the County through the JOC program. The increase requested through this amendment was calculated by the
applying The Gordian Group’s percent fee against the total value of construction that is available to be purchased
by the County through its JOC contracts. The County is under no obligation to expend the amount requested, and
is only obligated to pay The Gordian Group’s fee when the construction work is procured through the JOC program.
This amendment will allow the County to utilize these services on the new JOC contracts during their contract term.
This contract was awarded through a Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures in accordance with Cook County
Procurement Code. The Gordian Group, Inc. was awarded based on established evaluation criteria.
