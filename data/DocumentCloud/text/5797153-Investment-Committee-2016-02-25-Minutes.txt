the Retirement System's Executive Director has full authority over the employees of the
System, and

but will not increase the Retirement System's administration budget, and
, this matter was discussed in open session, therefore be it
, the Board accepts the recommendation of the Executive Director and adopts
the titles and rate increases as presented by the Executive Director:

Maria Gatzaros, Dimitrios Papas and Viola Papas (the “Common Shareholders”) executed
and delivered to the Retirement System a Security and Pledge Agreement (the “Stock
Pledge”) whereby the Common Shareholders pledged all of their common stock to the
Retirement System as security for the performance of AHC’s obligations to the Retirement
System under the Commitment, including the obligation to pay the cumulative preferred
dividend of 12% per year on the Stock until the date that the Loan was repaid, and
, On December 17, 1992, the Retirement System issued another Loan

shares of Stock], and

, In 2006, the Borrower secured a loan from Comerica Bank in the
amount of $16,500,000 which repaid Standard Federal thus cancelling the credit
enhancement of the Board leaving only the preferred stock investment which earned a
cumulative preferred dividend of 12% albeit due to insufficient cash flow from operations
and financial covenants had precluded payment of dividends leaving approximately
$14,244,000 due at year end 2015, and
, In December, 2015, AHC common shareholder Jim Papas (Ted
Gatzaros deceased) notified the Board of an interest in acquiring the preferred stock held by
