THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS

Appeal of John & Margaret Jasinski, Amish Investment Corp., and Ron Brunsfeld
Appeal No. APP-001-02-2002, 001-03-2002 & 001 -04-2002
The property involved consists of six (6), vacant lots of record in Arthur Mcintosh and Company's
Hillside Addition to Barrington, a platted subdivision in unincorporated Barrington Township, Cook
County, Illinois, commonly described as 1170 S. Summit Ave. ; 1166-1170 S. Grove Ave: and, 11641166 S. Summit Ave. in the R-5 Single Family Residence District. Each lot is in excess of 21,000 sq.
ft. in area, District #14.
Pursuant to the Cook County Zoning Ordinance, Article 13.3.5, the Cook County Board of
Commissioners shall consider the decision of the Zoning Administrator per Appeal Docket
Nos. 001-02-2020, 001-03-2002 and 001 -04-2002 in unincorporated Barrington Township. The
Zoning Administrator's decision aggrieved the applicant seeking permit applications to build
single-family homes on parcels deemed "environmentally sensitive" by the Cook County
Comprehensive Land Use and Policies Plan.
On January 15, 2003 the Zoning Board of Appeals overturned the ruling of the Administrator,
citing a Supreme Court case limiting the jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers.
On March 18, 2003 the County Board approved the Zoning and Building Committee Report March 11,
2003, in which the Committee voted to stay the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals, remand the
matter to that body for reconsideration and to report back to the Zoning and Building Committee by
April 18, 2003 (moved by Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Commissioner Butler).
Commissioner Quigley voted No on this matter.
Recommendation: "The recommendation is based on the fact that the only unambiguous
statement by the Corps is that this property does not contain wetlands under the jurisdiction of
the Corps. If the Appeals Division of the Corps sends a further letter before the County Board
makes its decision, we recommend that the terms of that letter be followed by the County
Board. That means, if the Corps reiterates that this property does not include wetlands subject
to the jurisdiction of the Corps, the building permit or permits should be issued. However, if the
Appeal Decision is that the property does include such wetlands, the permit or permits should
not be issued."

* The next regularly scheduled meeting is presently set for Tuesday, November 6, 2007.
