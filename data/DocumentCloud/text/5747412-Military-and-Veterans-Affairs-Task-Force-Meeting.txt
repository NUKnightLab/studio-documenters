authorization to increase the ?scal year 2018-19 appropriation 0844 Charter Commission by
$275,000 and decrease 00870 Non-Department Centralized payments by $275,000
for operating expenses of the Commission. The Commission offers the following in support of its

budget request to amend the City?s FY 2018 - 2019 budget.

gubernatorial primary therea?er and may be submitted at other
times in the manner provided by law. A primary election shall be

2012 Detroit City Charter, Sec. 9-403.

In view of the City?s FY 2018-2019 budget having been established prior to the
Commission?s November 6. 2018 creation at Michigan?s general election for governor, it is the
Commission?s position that requesting the City to amend its FY 2018-2019 budget to provide for
FY 2018 2019 Commission expenses is realistic and appropriate. First, Section 9-403 of the
2012 Detroit City Charter explains a Detroit Charter Revision Commission?s creation by the will
of the People of the City of Detroit should the proposition to revise an existing Detroit City charter
be adopted at the gubernatorial primary election. Additionally, Section 19 of the Act explains

municipalities' legislative bodies? responsibilities for Chatter Commission expenses.

The Commission?s projected FY 2018 - 2019 budget contains expense categories including
but not limited to Commission personnel, of?ce space, furnishings and utilities, and Commissioner
meeting stipends. These categories and others within the attached proposed FY 20l8 2019
Commission budget are consistent with expenditure categories included in both the 1994 1996

and 2009 2012 Detroit Charter Revision Commission budgets.

We are requesting approval from your Honorable Body to adopt the enclosed resolution.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter, please feel free to contact me at (313)

459-6208.

We request a waiver of Reconsideration.

Ordinance Request

The State's City Income Tax Act was recently amended. The amendment made several
changes to the Uniform City Income Tax Ordinance [Part II in the act]. For example, the Act
now permits cities that have an income tax to enter into voluntary agreements with non-
resident employers, whereby the employer will withhold city income taxes from all
employees that are Detroit residents [currently the withholding obligation applies only to
employers operating in the City).

Please draft an ordinance that allows the City of Detroit to enter into voluntary agreements
with non-resident employers, whereby the employer will withhold city income taxes from
all employees that are Detroit residents. This change will ensure that the City of Detroit is to
collect city tax dollars at the maximum rate.
