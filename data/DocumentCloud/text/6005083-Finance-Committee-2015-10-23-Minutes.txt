III. Action Items
A. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, August 21, 2015
Director Estrada, seconded by Director Wiese, moved to accept the minutes of the
Finance Committee Meeting of August 21, 2015. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
With regard to request number 5, Mr. Elwell noted that it is a sole source contract for services that are being
used to assist in the procurement area. This individual has experience working with the County. He would
like to extend the contract until the administration is able to get its own staff in place.
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, provided an overview of request number 6. He stated that this
is an increase and amendment of a contract that was originally the product of a Request for Proposals (RFP)
process. The funding for that contract was expended earlier than expected due to several reasons, including
those relating to unexpected changes in executive leadership. The Committee will recall that the Chief
Operating Officer (COO) for Hospital-Based Services departed with relatively short notice this summer; that

B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
position is being filled on an interim basis by Dr. Karen Duncan, who is a consultant from HMA. In addition
to that, the administration is using a larger amount of services than was expected relating to quality
improvement activities. Services relating to activity around behavioral health strategy and integration are
being provided by HMA; some of that cost should be offset by grant dollars that will be received from the
Sprague Foundation, but that is part of the reason why additional dollars are needed for the contract. It is his
hope that the administration will be able to recruit for the positions these individuals are filling. He noted that
the greatest amount of activity relates to three (3) positions; there is also a much more modest amount that is
for as-needed activity, particularly relating to strategies around Medicaid reimbursement. Director Junge
stated for the record that she would like to see HMA do a better job of recruiting minorities for their principals,
as opposed to subcontracting out to meet minority- and women-owned business enterprise goals. She stated
that HMA has not had many people of color in those positions; particularly in terms of the work that is being
done on this contract, she believes HMA needs to hire people who bring the experience of CCHHS’
communities to the table.
With regard to request number 7, Mr. Elwell stated that this request relates to the provision of software and
analytics. MHN has software in nineteen (19) hospitals and connects all of the Federally-Qualified Healthcare
Centers (FQHCs); primary care doctors within the MHN network get immediate notice if their patient shows
up as an inpatient or discharge in one of network hospital’s emergency departments (EDs), and can quickly
follow-up with the patient. This was originally a sole source contract, as, at that time, this vendor was the only
one with this product and collaborative grouping of organizations. MHNU’s contract was originally set to end
on March 31, 2016; the new third party administrator (TPA) is expected to start on March 31, 2016, so
extending the contract with MHNU to June 2016 will allow for uninterrupted service during the transition to
the new TPA. Additionally, other vendors now have similar products available, so this extension will allow
time to issue an RFP for this type of product/service, to see what other options are available.
Director Junge inquired regarding the number of staff on board at MHNU. Mr. Elwell stated that he will get
that information; he noted that the biggest part of the contract relates to software.
Director Richardson-Lowry noted that this is a really high spend for a sole source contract with a short
extension timeline. She indicated that, particularly in this atmosphere with transparency issues relating to
government purchasing and this kind of contracting, there has to be great rigor around sole source contracts.
She expressed concerns with respect to any extension of time that ties CCHHS to a vendor who has created a
proprietary product that creates an ongoing maintenance obligation, which could easily take CCHHS into
perpetuity - that cannot be in the best interests of this organization. In the future, she would like to see a
deeper dive or further explanation as part of the record as to the justification relating to sole source contracts.
Mr. Scheer noted that this contract ties together nineteen (19) other hospitals and FQHCs with CCHHS; that
would seem to be a pretty important factor in this. Another outsider is going to have an extremely difficult
time doing that, so CCHHS may very well be tied to them. He added that finding or creating comparable
software might also be challenging. Director Richardson-Lowry indicated that details beyond the software’s
proprietary nature should be included as part of the record when presenting requests like this for consideration,
including information on the other hospitals and FQHCs – who are they, where are they located, how does it
correlate, what is the specific thing that ties all of the institutions together? Director Estrada added that it is
also important to include a statement to understand the benefit to the patient and the hospital. Dr. Shannon

Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
stated that there was a presentation made a couple of months ago by representatives of MHN, where they
showed the activity and performance that comes from this product and service. Anyone in the MHN network
gets this feedback in real time; he pointed out that the network also includes CCHHS’ primary care clinics.
There is a performance enhancement and feedback collaborative associated with this, and what has been seen
as part of the payoff is a reduction, because there is a tighter follow-up post-discharge from the ED or hospital.
That being said, he stated that the comments made today are completely germane - if a better product is out
there, let’s take a look at it.
With regard to request number 13, Mr. Elwell stated that this is a sole source contract for a type of intrauterine
device (IUD) that has recently been approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); this is
a unique device and is made by only one (1) manufacturer.
Mr. Elwell provided an overview regarding utilizing comparable government procurement as the competitive
selection methodology for a contract. The contract for request number 14 was procured in this fashion; Cook
County originally had issued the RFP and negotiated the contract for similar services.
With regard to request number 17, Mr. Elwell stated that this contract marks the start of the process to build
the new Core Medical building. This contract is the first part of what has been a long process that started back
in May 2014. The development team from Clayco will now work with staff on the detailed planning of
building size and capabilities, determining what should be located in that building, and determining what is
needed from a clinical perspective. This planning process is expected to take three (3) to four (4) months. He
added that the building has been budgeted for $90 million net; the overall budget for it is $100 million, but
there are some soft costs that will bring it down to $90 million.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Estrada, moved the approval of request numbers
1 through 17. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

 IV.

Report from the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy (continued)
During the Committee’s discussion of the subject of overtime, Mr. Elwell provided additional information. One
example of overtime use relates to the Pharmacy Department – there was a good-sized amount of overtime paid to
pharmacists who covered mail order business by taking an additional shift and getting paid overtime for it. With
regard to the subject of guaranteed overtime for nurses, he stated that this was not specifically included as a
provision in the Collective Bargaining Agreement for nurses; rather, there was guaranteed overtime for nurses
because of the way shifts were organized – and that issue is being addressed. In addition, the administration is
looking at other factors that influence overtime, including ensuring that departmental and Human Resources
records are accurate and up to date with regard to those employees who are on administrative leave or who are on
leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).
Director Gugenheim referenced previous comments made by Mr. Elwell on the subject of community health
workers, and the suggestion to reassign staff members who live in those communities to that role. She expressed
concern with that concept –the essence of the role of community health workers is that people are not assigned,
they are recruited from the community, by the people in that community; they are of it, not sent into it. Director
Estrada agreed; he stated that he has run community health worker programs in the past. From his experience,
those people not only live in the community, but they are active members and partners in the community, not just
with their local health provider but with all of the community’s organizations; there is a specific kind of mindset
that they have, that makes them so effective.
Caryn Stancik, Executive Director of Communications, provided an update regarding the CCHHS and CountyCare
marketing campaign. She stated that, over the course of the next couple of weeks, she and staff will be sitting
down with the new vendor to map out what the plan will look like. First and foremost is a focus on ophthalmology
services; a focus on oncology services is also on the list. Additionally, she expects to be spending a lot of time on
marketing plans relating to redetermination over the next couple of months. She noted that the administration will
be individualizing the marketing plan based on service line, Centers of Excellence and capacity.
During the discussion of challenges relating to the quality of facilities, Chairman Collens inquired whether there is
a way to track decline in use of CCHHS facilities. Mr. Elwell responded affirmatively; he stated that he can
provide that information to the Board. That information has been tracked over the last three (3) years, and reflects
a decrease in the use of CCHHS clinics. Director Richardson-Lowry stated that, if there has been a decline in use
of CCHHS clinics, there has to be an uptick somewhere else. She inquired whether data was available to identify
where the uptick is, and to determine the specific categories of services involved.
Mr. Elwell provided an update on the community triage center, which is a pilot project expected to open early next
year to provide prevention and diversion services for individuals who are at risk of arrest due to behavioral health
conditions. It will operate 24 hours per day/7 days per week/365 days per year. It will have staff there who can
make an evaluation of the person and make a warm hand-off in the community where they live. Mr. Elwell stated
that CCHHS will work very closely with its partner, the Chicago Police Department, who has excellent Crisis
Intervention Training, to make the hand-off better. If this pilot center works, he expects that CCHHS will need
approximately five (5) centers located in Chicago, and would then plan to expand to suburban locations.
There were no emergency purchases to report at this time.
Chairman Collens, seconded by Director Wiese, moved to receive and file the four (4)
reports under Section IV. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
