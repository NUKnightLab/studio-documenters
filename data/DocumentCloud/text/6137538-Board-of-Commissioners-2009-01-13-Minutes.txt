THE HONORABLE EARLEAN COLLINS, COUNTY COMMISSIONER
$2 BILLION DOLLAR NATIONAL ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN
TO EMPLOY OVER 1 MILLION LOW-INCOME YOUTHS
YEAR ROUND AND IN THE SUMMER
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII, Section 6(a)
of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and perform any function
pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. economy is experiencing the worst slow down in the past 30 years and is facing a
severe recession; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. economy has shed more than 1 million payroll jobs in the 10 months of 2008 and
now has on average 2.8 million more unemployed persons than one year ago; and
WHEREAS, at 33% this was the worst summer teen (16 to 19) employment rate in post-World War II
history, and this national employment crisis is crippling the teen job market, with Black and Latino youth
the hardest hit groups; and
WHEREAS, in the summer of 2008, more than 2 million low-income youth were out of work and on the
streets; and
WHEREAS, in October 2008, 68% of teens were jobless and there were 500,000 fewer teens employed
than October 2007 and the nation’s teen employment rate fell by three percentage points over the past 12
months; and
WHEREAS, youth, particularly Black and Hispanic youth, are living in a “Depression” with very high
jobless rates , 80% of Black youth and 75% of Hispanic youth across the country; and
WHEREAS, President Bush, President-elect Obama and Congress are now proposing a very large
stimulus package to restart the U.S. economy; and
WHEREAS, from 1964 until 2000, there was a separate summer youth employment program for over
750,000 low-income youth and these jobs were often the first jobs for low-income youth, giving them a
chance to work and gain experience to later find a job on their own; and
WHEREAS, the summer youth employment program was eliminated when the youth employment and
training program was revamped in 2000; and
WHEREAS, teen employment has a variety of long-term benefits for youth as well as the short-term
improvement in their earnings and income, and the more teens work when they are 16 and 17 the more
likely they are to work when they are 18 and 19 and so forth; and

338

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 13, 2009
WHEREAS, the most beneficial youth employment programs are those programs that focus on
combining education and productive work within the youth’s neighborhood. Teens would earn money
while they are producing meaningful work, and they will spend this money immediately providing a
direct economic stimulus to the U.S. economy.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board urges President Bush,
President-elect Obama and Congress to allocate $2 billion of the next proposed economic stimulus
package to create community-based programs like the Green Job Corps and the 5-E (Energy Efficiency,
Environmental Education and Employment) Disconnected Youth Service Corps as outlined in the Obama
for President platform on poverty; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be delivered to President Bush,
President-elect Obama, and each Member of the Illinois Congressional delegation.
Approved and adopted this 13th day of January 2009.

COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
AN ORDINANCE TO ESTABLISH
A COOK COUNTY CIRCUIT BREAKER PROGRAM
WHEREAS, there is an over reliance on real estate property tax as a means of revenue
generation in Cook County and the State of Illinois; and
WHEREAS, families in Cook County are overburdened with high real estate property
taxes in a time when national and local economic conditions have deteriorated, and
incomes are uncertain; and
WHEREAS, low and moderate income homeowners, as well as homeowners who lose
part or all of their income, can quickly become overburdened by real estate property taxes
if levies or home values rapidly increase and annual assessment adjustments to reflect
declining market conditions are not possible; and
WHEREAS, for all homeowners except seniors with very low incomes, real estate
property taxes are unrelated to a property owner’s ability to pay; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Circuit Breaker Program does not adequately address the needs
of Cook County Homeowners; and
WHEREAS, a Cook County Property Tax Circuit Breaker would prevent real estate
property taxes from overloading a family’s budget by limiting the real estate property tax
to five percent (5%) of a family’s income up to a maximum benefit of $700; and
WHEREAS, for municipalities with real estate property tax rates below one hundred
fifty percent (150%) of the median Cook County real estate property tax rate, the Cook
County Board of Commissioners desires such municipalities to join in its efforts to
ensure that families residing in such municipalities are not overburdened by real estate
property taxes by giving these municipalities the option to contribute to a circuit breaker
fund and provide their residents real estate property tax relief; and
WHEREAS, for municipalities with tax rates at or above one hundred fifty percent
(150%) of the median Cook County real property estate tax rate, the Board of
Commissioners recognizes the inability of such municipalities to contribute to a circuit
breaker fund and desires to provide the residents of such municipalities real estate
property tax relief with out contribution from such municipalities; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners desires to enact a Cook County
Circuit Breaker program to provide real estate property tax relief to low and moderate
income households in Cook County.

Approved and adopted this ____ day of _________________.
Commissioner Claypool, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, moved to amend Communication
No. 297144 by accepting the Substitute Ordinance. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Suffredin pointed out the two major changes in the substitute Ordinance: 1) the distinction
between participating and non-participating municipalities is removed; and 2) all funds provided under
the Circuit Breaker program are distributed proportionally to qualifying homeowners.
Chairman Daley stated that the letters received on this subject matter will be entered into the record.
Commissioner Claypool stated that the purpose of the ordinance is to provide targeted tax relief for
individuals who are affected by the current economic climate and rising property tax bills.
Chairman Daley asked who will bear the cost of the proposed Circuit Breaker program.
Commissioner Claypool stated that under the substitute Ordinance the cost will be borne by Cook
County. Funds from expiring TIFs are also a potential funding source, but that would require additional
legislation.
Chairman Daley inquired whether the funding source is indicated in the substitute Ordinance.
Commissioner Claypool stated that he believes that they are two separate items that are linked together
but not necessarily in the substitute Ordinance.
Chairman Daley asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers, in
accordance with Cook County Code, Sec. 2-108(dd):
1.
2.

Honorable Daniel J. McLaughlin – President, Village of Orland Park
George Blakemore – Concerned Citizen

Chairman Daley called on James M. Houlihan, Cook County Assessor, to address the Committee
regarding the Circuit Breaker Program. Assessor Houlihan provided a brief summary of the program.
Commissioner Maldonado suggested that a cap should be imposed on the income of eligible homeowners
as part of the requirements to participate in the Circuit Breaker program.
Assessor Houlihan responded that he would consider supporting an income cap in addition to the five
percent (5%) limitation. Further, Assessor Houlihan stated that he can work with Commissioner
Maldonado with regard to identifying an alternative funding source for the Circuit Breaker Program.
Commissioner Schneider asked for clarification of the City of Chicago’s position on the merits of this
proposal.

376

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 13, 2009
Myer Blank, Executive Director, Chicago Tax Assistance Center, stated that the property tax advisory
council looked at various relief programs throughout the country and saw a significant number of
jurisdictions that had Circuit Breaker programs. It is a viable option, but at this point the City of Chicago
has not taken a position on this particular proposal.
Commissioner Suffredin asked how many Cook County property taxpayers experienced a recent
reduction in their homeowners’ exemption, from $20,000 to $5,000.
Assessor Houlihan stated that certain taxpayers in the City of Chicago recently experienced an exemption
reduction from $40,000 to $26,000. As the phase-out of the 7% program continues, the exemption will be
reduced to $20,000, and then to $5,000. He will provide more detailed statistics regarding the number of
affected homeowners to the Committee.
Commissioner Butler asked how much will it cost for the Circuit Breaker Program and who will pay for
it.
Assessor Houlihan stated that if the Circuit Breaker Program is limited to households earning $100,000 or
less, the estimated cost of the program is between $63 and $90 million; the total cost to the county would
vary based on whether residual TIF funds are used, and whether bonds are issued to pay for the program.
Commissioner Murphy suggested that other taxing bodies such as the Water Reclamation District be
included in this program.
Commissioner Silvestri suggested that imposing a means test would alter the intent of the program, and
asked if the program should be considered a temporary or pilot program.
Assessor Houlihan said that would be a decision for the Board of Commissioners, but he would not object
to considering a pilot program, especially since this is a new idea for Cook County.
Vice Chairman Sims considered a similar proposal last summer, targeted specifically for the Village of
Ford Heights. Assessor Houlihan stated that the Ford Heights proposal was part of the genesis for the
proposed Ordinance before the Committee today.
Chairman Daley stated that the Assessor’s Office has the home rule authority to determine assessments
generally throughout the County, and higher assessments can be considered a cause of higher tax bills.
Assessor Houlihan stated that his office looks at income data, sales data and the economic data when
determining assessments. If, for example, he lowered assessments across the board by 20% to reflect the
down turn in economic conditions, that reduction would necessitate an increase in the tax rate, and tax
bills would basically remain the same. Taxpayers would still complain about high assessments because
they would not see a reduction in what they must pay as a result of those assessments.
Assessor Houlihan acknowledged he is aware of a timing problem with the three year reassessment cycle.
For example, the South Suburban reassessments are just being completed for the year ended January 1,
2008, but there has been a considerable decline in market value since that date. Assessments will not
reflect the new, lower market values. Assessor Houlihan is working with the Board of Review to identify
ways in which the County might address the problem of changing market values not being reflected in
assessment levels.

377

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 13, 2009
Chairman Daley asked Commissioner Claypool if he had an amendment to the Substitute Ordinance.
Commissioner Claypool responded that at this time they will take the suggestions offered into
consideration and make any appropriate changes to the Proposed Substitute Ordinance at a later date.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved to adjourn.
carried and the meeting was adjourned.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 13, 2009
Plaintiffs, represented by the Roger Baldwin Foundation of the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) and the firm of Kirkland & Ellis, filed a Motion for Appointment of a
Receiver on May 29, 2007. This petition was resolved by the entry of an Agreed Order
Appointing a Transitional Administrator by the District Court on August 14, 2007. The
Board of Commissioners agreed to the entry of the subject order during its meeting of July
31, 2007.
In accordance with the Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator, paragraph
5(f), the Transitional Administrator possesses the authority to petition the District Court for
authority to expend funds in carrying out his duties under the Order. The Transitional
Administrator has recently brought such an issue to the Court in accordance with paragraph
5(f).
The TA had retained Jani-King, Inc. to provide janitorial services at the facility. The JaniKing contract was approved by the Board at the December 17, 2008 meeting. However, an
arrearage of $300,365.39 had previously accrued. This figure was reviewed by the JTDC
purchasing department and determined to be correct.
The TA had requested the District Court to enter an order providing for payment of the
$300,365.39 to Jani-King and the Court entered the order on December 18, 2008.
Upon approval, the Cook County Comptroller will prepare a check made payable to JaniKing in the amount of $300,365.39 in compliance with the court order. The funds will be
drawn from Account 569-235.
The Cook County Comptroller is requested to prepare the check by January 21, 2009 which is

Appointing a Transitional Administrator (TA) by the District Court on August 14, 2007. The

31, 2007.
In accordance with the Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator, paragraph
7(c-e), Cook County is required to set aside funds for the reasonable costs and expenses of
the Office of the Transitional Administrator (OTA). On June 18, 2008, the District Court
entered an order amending this portion of the TA Order permitting the Transitional
Administrator to maintain the OTA funds in a separate account to be disbursed by him for the
sole purpose of satisfying the reasonable costs and expenses of the staff of the OTA. The

436

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 13, 2009
Commissioner Claypool offered the following clarification for the record: This produces the equivalent of
an income stream that then would support a bond just like any other traditional income stream. It is not,
unlike some of the conversation heard today, “robbing Peter to pay Paul.” It is not taking part of our
budget or healthcare or pensions or something else to balance out, but rather is taking something that was
not previously available to the County that now is available to the County to support a new source.
Commissioner Daley clarified for the record that next year the levy would be $730 million.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Claypool, moved to withdraw the motion to
approve Communication No. 297355.
Commissioner Claypool, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, moved to adjourn. The motion
carried.

and 1644 West Walnut until this contract can be awarded. The expiration date of the current
contract was November 30, 2008.

Transmitting a Communication, dated December 18, 2008 from
TAKASHI REINBOLD, Director, Department of Budget and Management Services
submitting the 4th Quarter Performance Reporting Report for January 13, 2009.

438

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 13, 2009
The Department of Budget and Management Services is submitting a copy of the 4th Quarter
Performance Reporting. This report highlights performance data associated with services, activities and
programs within Cook County Departments and is a starting point used in budgeting, long-term planning
and goal setting.
Performance measures are essential in assisting County Officials and Citizens to identify effective and
efficient decisions that pertain to future resources, allocations and service delivery. The Performance
Reporting is an ongoing development that enables the County to share data on a range of programs,
benchmark its performance to comparable jurisdictions and improve service delivery through the
application of best management practices and efficient use of resources.
The Vehicle Steering Committee concurs with this recommendation.
