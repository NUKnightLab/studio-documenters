JAMES L. ELDRIDGE, JR., C hief Administrative Officer, Bureau of Administratio n
requesting authorizati on for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $ 15,000,000.00, Contract No. 98-431323 with Peoples Energy Services Corporation, Chicago, Illinois, to increase the tota l dollar amou nt of
the contract from $20,000,000.00 to $35,000,000.00 for natural gas purchases. Th is wi ll keep the contract
in force to provide di scounted natura l gas for the County's heating and cooli ng needs through the contract
term November 30, 2003.

Increase req uested:
Adjusted amount:

$20,000,000.00
15,000,000.00
$35,000,000.00

492

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JA NUARY 24, 2002

Reason:

Due to the natural gas market cost increases experienced last year during the 2000-200 1
heating and cooli ng season, $ 17,793,904.92 has been spent against this contract commencing
December 1, 1998. Under the terms of the contract it is stated that "It is the intent of the
parties that this contract continue until November 30, 2003". " If the payment due contractor
pursuant to Attachment B Section IV Payment, under this contract appears likely to exceed
$20,000,000.00 prior to the expiration of the term of this contract on November 30, 2003, the
Chief Administrative Officer or his desig nee will transm it a request for additional fund ing for
this contract to the Cook County Board of Commissioners".

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Request does not change annual funding amount to any department's
gas heating account. The dol lar increase reflects the monthly increase in spot market gas pricing on
which the contract is based and passed throug h to the County. Sufficient funds are appropriated to cover
natural gas costs.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Si lvestri, moved that the County Purchasing
Agent be authorized to increase the requested contract. The motion carried unanimously.
