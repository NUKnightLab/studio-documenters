Harris.
(General Item No. 1)
The Resolution for Item 1 ratifies the contract with Oracle Corporation to provide Relational Data
Base Management System software licenses to support the Relocation Tracking System as well as
future CHA technology initiatives. CHA began development of the Relocation Tracking System
in 2001 based upon the Oracle RDBMS model. In order to avoid software copyright violations,
the Authority must ensure the purchase "right to use" licenses. ITS staff participated in purchase
agreements with Oracle Corporation on behalf of the City of Chicago and was therefore, familiar
with the volume discounts the City negotiated. The ITS department recommended that the CHA
purchase Oracle licenses via the City's Agreements to benefit from the City of Chicago's volume
discount. Oracle agreed to have the City's volume discount apply to CHA's smaller purchase in
exchange for CHA placing its order prior to the expiration of its then current fiscal quarter at the
end of May 2002. Proceeding under the City's agreement resulted in a fifty percent reduction in
price.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-61
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
memorandum dated June 13, 2002 entitled “Request for ratification of a Software
License Contract with Oracle Corporation for Relational Data Base Management

therein;
