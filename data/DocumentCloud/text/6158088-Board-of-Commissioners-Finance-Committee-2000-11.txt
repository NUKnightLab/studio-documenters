THE COOK COUNTY LAW LIBRARY ORDINANCE (PROPOSED
ORDINANCE AMENDMENT). Transmitting a Communication, dated October
27, 2000 from Bennie E. Martin, Executive Law Librarian:
Requesting authorization to amend the Cook County Law Library Ordinance to
increase the Law Library filing fee from $9.00 to $10.00. An increase in the
price of books has rendered our current $9.00 filing fee inadequate.

paper or other appearance filed by each party in all civil cases, but no
additional fee shall be required if more than one party is represented in a
single pleading, paper or other appearance.
The Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County shall commence such
charges and collections upon receipt of written notice from the County
Board President that Cook County has acted to establish and maintain
such a law library.
Such fees shall be in addition to all other fees and charges of the Clerk
of the Circuit Court of Cook County, and assessable as costs, shall be

designated as the Cook County Law Library Fund. Disbursements from
such funds shall be by the Cook County Treasurer, on the order of the
County Board. The President of the County Board, with the advise and
consent of the County Board, may appoint a Library Committee of not

such library. Such orders shall be pre-audited by the Cook County
Auditor, and reports thereof rendered to the County Board.
Such fees shall not be charged in any criminal or quasi-criminal cases.
