DISCUSSION ITEMS

A. Equitable Care Dr. Margolius Dr. Nemer

Before Dr. Margolius started, Dr. Watts introduced Lourdes Negron?McDaniel, Director of
lnciusion and Diversity to the committee. Ms. Negron?McDaniel stated that herteam has
been looking at race, ethnicity and language data for the past two years with positive
results. Dr. Margolius stated that MetroHealth serves racial and ethnic minorities better
than the national benchmark. Latino patients have worse outcomes in chronic disease
management and we have an opportunity to be the leader in Cleveland for Latino care
with the right investment of resources. Patients with primary care providers have a

better health in all outcomes, which highlights the importance of continuing to invest in a
strong Primary Ca re team and services. Our ACO efforts succeeded in that patients
served by Payers who have care coordination and population health efforts do better.
