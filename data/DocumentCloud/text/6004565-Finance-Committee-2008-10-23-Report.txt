The Committee reviewed the information presented. Discussion took place with regard to physician productivity
and lack of support staff for physicians; Chairman Carvalho noted that review of support staff levels for physicians
may be necessary in order to expand services in the most cost?productive way. Specific data on the number of
patients that physicians see per hour at the Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County was
provided by Dr. Enrique Martinez, its Chief Medical Of?cer.

With regard to the information presented on vendor eligibility efforts, Chairman Carvalho requested that additional
information be added that describes how they convert the approval to cash].

On the subject of the revenue cycle project, Director Mufioz asked when the functions would be consolidated under

REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM

OCTOBER 23, 2008

PAGE 5

During the discussion of the Contracts and Procurement Approval items, Director O?Donnell inquired regarding the
request to increase the contract by $120,000.00 for nursing registry services with Professional Nursing, Inc. She
asked whether this was related to the request to decrease the contract by $120,000.00 for nursing registry services
with Maxim Healthcare Services Inc.

Laslie Duffy, Director of Procurement of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, stated that she spoke with
the nursing director, Mary O?Flaherty, on the issue. They have decided to decrease the amount of money to one
nursing registry because they have not been able to secure the services they needed; a decrease and subsequent
increase of another contract for the same amount is needed so they can use another provider that has been able to
provide the services they needed.

Mr. Small added that there are multiple resources for these services that have been established with estimates of
what might be spent for each of them. It is really a moving target based on which supplier provides the registry
personnel; from time to time they need to shift money because one is supplying more, or less, of what is required.

In response to a question from Chairman Carvalho, in which he inquired whether the contracts were the result of a
bid process or through a request for proposals, Ms. Duffy responded that they were the result of a bid process; this
contract was awarded in February. She stated that she was in the middle of investigating the issue. It was later
determined that the contracts were the result of a request for proposals.

Johnny Brown, Chief Operating Of?cer of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, provided some additional
background information. He stated that there are several vendors for these services, each with a specific contract
limit. Due to the need for availability and the need for some specialized nursing staff, the contracts are sometimes
adjusted based upon those factors.

Timothy Webb, a representative from Maxim Staf?ng Solutions, addressed the Committee. He explained that his
company has not been able to provide these services because they have never received approval from either the
County Board or the System Board that the contract is approved. He stated that actions took place at the February
6, 2008 and February 17, 2008 County Board meetings; at the ?rst meeting it was approved as amended and at the
second meeting it was withdrawn. It was his understanding that additional information was needed from his
organization, which was then provided.

Ms. Duffy stated that she would investigate the issue and report back to the Committee.

The Committee had a discussion on contract compliance issues. The issue was de?ned and reviewed;
questions with regard to waivers and ?nal authority determining compliance were posed.

Director O?Donnell, seconded by Chairman Carvalho, moved to approve the Contracts and Procurement
Approval items. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Upon further investigation, Chairman Carvalho informed the Committee that it was determined that there is no
contract in place for the item on the agenda requesting a decrease in the contract with Maxim Healthcare Services,
Inc., in the amount of $120,000.00.

Having voted on the prevailing side, Director Ramirez, seconded by Director O?Donnell, moved to
reconsider the vote by which the Contracts and Procurement Approval items were approved. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Director O?Donnell, seconded by Director Ramirez, moved to strike the request to decrease the contract with
Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc. in the amount of $120,000.00 for the provision of nursing registry services
(Contract No. 08-41-198). THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Chairman Carvalho stated that the State?s Attorney?s Of?ce would like the Opportunity to review this further; there
is a question of how this could be done consistent with the County procedures. He stated that at this time the item
would be deferred to allow for further review.

 

Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Update

Chairman Carvalho and Board Chairman Batts provided the Committee with an update on the ?scal year 2009
budget meetings that have taken place. Those involved in the meetings are: Chairman Carvalho, Board Chairman
Batts, Director O?Donnell, Director Butler, Mr. Small and Mr. Calkin.

They are continuing to meet with the1h individual Commissioners. There is a budget hearing before the
Commissioners on Monday, October 279?, followed by a public hearing on Tuesday, October There is a
schedule with dates for Commissioners to submit amendments, with the preliminary budget approval to take place
on November 

REPORT OF THE FWANCE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM

OCTOBER 23, 2003

PAGE 7

Chairman Carvalho restated the core message with regard to the System?s budget. They are net reducing by five
hundred positions, they are asking for less than in?ation, they are asking for $47 million odd dollars that the rest of
the ask is capital. They also heard that there is uncertainty with regard to capitai requests, as there may not be a
capital bond. The County Board would have to approve going to bond; they would have to decide if the bond
market is in the right place for them to go to bond. If they do not approve going to bond, the question arises as to
what resources are available for the capital needs of the System and the other County entities. This may require re-
thinking the way the System procures capital needs; options such as leasing using Operating revenues instead of
purchasing may need to be discussed.

 

Fiscal Year 2009 Revenue Proiections

Mr. Calkin presented information on the ?scal year 2009 revenue projections. (See Attachment 
Board Chairman Batts inquired whether information was available on trends with regard to the sales tax collections.

Mr. Calkin reSponded that collections at the increased rate have only occurred for the past two months. He expects
to have information at the end of the month that shows how much the System is receiving as a result of the increase.

Chairman Carvalho inquired whether the denominator was known with regard to System?s share of the sales tax
collection; he questioned the determinant of allocations of revenue collected versus appropriations.

Mr. Small stated that there is no amount, ?xed or otherwise, that is put into an account for the System.

Chairman Carvalho stated that if the County Board decides to only fund ninety-six or ninety-feur percent of the
System?s budget request, they should ?x a separate line with that difference, thereby allowing the System to
determine where those cuts will be made, rather than requiring the System Board to determine the cuts on a line-
item basis.

 

Update on status of procurement policy and procedures

Ms. Duffy provided the Committee with an update on the status of the procurement policy and procedures.
Elizabeth Reidy, Deputy Chief of the Civil Actions Bureau of the Of?ce of the State's Attorney, met with Ms.
Duffy and Mr. Small on October 21st, at which time she was asked to assist in these efforts. She will be working
with Ms. Duffy to develop the policy and procedures that will give the System the guidelines to act as an
independent purchasing department while maintaining a good relationship with the County?s Purchasing
Department.

Ms. Duffy provided an additional update on the status of the review of group purchasing organizations (GPOs).
She stated she was able to get a sampling of around $3.2 million of line items to the alliance to which the County
currently belongs, UHC (the contracting entity is Novation). They were able to match $700,000; out of that, they
were able to find twenty to twenty-five percent savings.

Ms. Duffy added that she has the ruling from the State's Attorney which allows her to access the GPO contract
instead of going through a request for proposals; they will enter into discussions with the three medicalfsurgical
distributors that are on contract and start moving forward.

I Summagy 

The Cook County Health and Hospitals System results of 
operations for the ?scal year at the end of August were .
favorable as compared to the 2008 year to date budget. The
System favorable operating performance was the result of
lower than expected year to date operating expenses. Operating
revenue was below the budget, but not enough to offset the
favorable level of operating eXpenses. Operating revenue was
below the budget by $38,288,792 or 11.6% while operating
expenses were below the budget by $56,044,955 or 

Operating Revenue
Patient Service Revenue as of the end of the month of August

. was $27, 770, 289 below the budget as compared to the year to
date 2008 budget for the same period. This is a shortfall of
approximately 12.5%. The bulk of the Shortfall is associated
with lower than expected Medicaid revenue. Medicare year to
date patient service revenue is above the level expected
in the budget. It is anticipated that System?s Medicaid revenue
will be approximately 14% below the budget for ?scal 2008.
Medassets, the revenue cycle vendor, continues to make
improvements to the revenue realization process that may
reduce some of the expected shortfall by the end of the year.

The Inter Governmental Transfer revenue is below the budget at
the end of August by $11,253,094 or 10.8%. This is due to the
phase out of one component of the IGT revenue. The System?s
management and consultant?s continue to work with the state
Medicaid?of?cials to offset the loss of the planned IGT revenue.
The phase out of IGT revenue is an annual decline of System
revenue of $15, 004, 000 for 2008. The discussions with the state
have identi?ed money that could come to the System as the
result of a reconciliation of a state pool of Medicaid funds. It
has been determined that this reconciliation amount may be as

much as $11,600,000 and it is expected that it couldall be
received by the System before the end of the ?scal year. 

Operating Expenses .

Operating expenses for the System at the end of the ninth month
of the ?scal year were below budget by $56,044,955 year to
date. This lower level of expenses is primarily due to a lower
than expected level of expenditures for Supplies, Purchased
Services, and Utilities.

Salaries and Wages ($3,515,998) 

Salaries and Wages are above the budget at the end of
August. The System measures the level of labor expense on an
accrual basis. There are differences in the manner that the
budget is allocated to the months of the ?scal year and the
actual experience of the expense for this category of expense;
The budget allocation to each month of the ?scal year does not
re?ect the actual experience of prior years. The summer
month?s actual expense is often affected by the use of vacation
and holiday replacement compensation.

Employee Bene?ts ($629,364) or .

Employee Bene?ts are estimated as a percentage of actual -
Salaries and Wages. Salaries and Wages at the end of August
were over the budget and employee bene?ts were over
the budget too.

Supplies - $22,005,333 or 19.9%

Supply expense for all three institutions is signi?cantly under
budget. Each facility made an effort to ?nd all the unprocessed
invoices and make sure they are processed in a timely fashion.
The accrual for August was-based on the year to date actual paid
expenses plus 40.0%. In 2007 275 days of average supply
expense was $88,565,200. In 2008 the estimated supply
expense at the end of August is $77,082,260.

Purchased Services - $36,019,999 or 31.8%

The estimated year to date expenses at the end of August for
Purchased Services was based on the same methodology used to
estimate August expenses for Supplies. In 2007 275 days of
average daily expense for Purchased Services was $90,333,700
and the estimated expense at the end of August 2008 is
$77,082,260.

Depreciation

Estimates of Depreciation expense are based on the 200.7
audited Depreciation expense. This estimate is probably
conservative because the rate of investment in capital has been
less than the estimated Depreciation expense.

Utilities - $2,164,984'or 13.7% 

Utility expense through the end of August 2008 is below the
budget by 13.7%. The ?nance staffdid not attempt to allocate
the budget for utilities to the months of the ?scal year that
historically had the highest utility expense. The August

- variance may be the result of seasonal variances. in utility
utilization.

Services Contributed by Other County Departments"

The process to estimate the value of the services contributed by
other County departments to the System will be reviewed later
in this ?scal year'and next ?scal year. The amount recorded in
the August statements is nine months of the average 
expense from the 2007 audited statements. 

Year to Date Expense per Adiusted Patient Day
A comparison of the cost per adjusted patient day for July year
to date and August year to date is as follows:

System Expenses per Adjusted Patient Day 2007 versus

day based on 2007 audited expenses and YTD August 2008
expenses per adjusted patient day is as follows:

System Total 2007 2008

Salaries and Wages 1,471.05 1,935.46
Employee Bene?ts 533.45 722.88

Supplies 363.96 460.08

Utilities 49.16 70.86
Contributed Services 19.80 24.91

Total 2,955.63 3,800.08 28.6%

The increase of 28.6% in the expense per adjusted patient day
from 2007 to August of 2008 is due in part to a signi?cant
decline in volume of the System facilities. The volume of each
facility has changed as follows: 

Volume as Measured in Adjusted Patient Days I

Facility 2007 - . 2008 Change
J. H. Stroger 190,083 184,941 . 
Oak Forest 97,275 36,203 -62.8%
Provident 37,371 34,3 94 
Total 324,728 255,537 -21.3%

The change in volume of system facilities in 2008 is due to a
change in the clinic volumes, the reduction in set up and staffed
System beds, and the closure of Long Term Care at Oak Forest
Hospital.

Non Operating Revenue I .

Non Operating Revenue at the end of August was below the
budget in total by $32,687,212 or The budget for each of
the non-operating revenue sources was allocated to the months
of the ??scal year on an equal basis. Revenue from sales tax is
over twenty million dollars below the budget at the-end of
August. It is expected that an increase in receipts from the new
rate of sales tax will be begin to be collected in October. The
annual collection of sales tax revenue for ?scal 2008 may be 
closer to the budget level by the end of the ?scal year because
of the timing of the implementation of the new tax rate.
