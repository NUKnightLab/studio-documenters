(SHERIFF'S) DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SUPERVISION AND INTERVENTION
CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication from
MICHAEL F. SHEAHAN, Sheriff of Cook County
by
DAVID S. DEVANE, Executive Director, Department of Community Supervision and Intervention
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with ADT Security Services,
Oak Brook, Illinois, for the rental of twenty (20) EMS 2000 cellular radio frequency units.
Reason:

In response to overcrowding in the Cook County Jail, the Department of Community
Supervision and Intervention (DCSI) has substantially increased the number of inmates
re leased into its Electronic Monitoring (EMS) program . During fiscal year 2003 DCSI
anticipates the program will expand by 11 % to an average daily population of 1550.
However, one ongoing problem, which negatively impacts further expansion of the EMS
program is the lack of basic telephone service at some inmates' homes. This condition causes
otherwise qualified inmates to be routinely excluded from program participation and others to
be returned to jail because phone service is cancelled after the inmate is released to the EMS
program.
To address this issue, DCSI is proposing a pilot program in which it would enter into a
contract with ADT Security Services to rent twenty (20) EMS 2000 cellular units for one
year.
Board approval for this contract is being requested on a sole source basis because ADT
Security Services is the only company in North America which sells and services EMS 2000
equipment.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant funded amount: $43,820.00. Contract period: June I , 2003
through May 3 1, 2004. (837-582 Account). Requisition No. 3837011 8.
The Chief Information Officer has reviewed this item and concurs with this recommendation.
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the request of the Executive
Director of the Sheriffs Department of Community Supervision and Intervention be approved, as
amended and that the County Purchasing Agent be authorized to enter into the requested contract. The
motion carried unanimously.

William P. Colson - Attorney; Paul Furlow - Co-President of Tech Lighting; and Marty
Fields - President, Jet Age Container

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Business and Economic Development of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County met pursuant to notice on Monday, May 19, 2003 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room,
Room 569, County Building, 11 8 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Chainnan Collins asked Gwendolyn Clemons to provide a brief overview of the Class 6b property tax
incentive and how the incentive helps retain businesses in Cook County.
Gwendolyn Clemons, Director of the Department of Planning and Development, stated that the
Department of Planning and Development, through the Economic Development Division, supports,
retains and attracts businesses to Cook County. There are a variety of tools that are used to grow
businesses in Cook County that are offered through various mechanisms. Through the business center,
the Department of Planning and Development provides direct assistance to companies that have had
inquiries, called into the office or that are following up on various requests. Further, Ms. Clemons stated
that the Department of Planning and Development facilitates and assists in property tax incentives and
operates the "No Cash Bid" program. Ms. Clemons stated that every year the Department of Planning
and Development produces "The Marketing Report," which highlights the number of businesses that the
Department has assisted in the last year. In conclusion, Ms. Clemons stated that the Department of
Planning and Development provides direct business development assistance to more than 1,600 domestic
and foreign companies and provides market and trade-related information to an additional 2,500
businesses.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the problem with Class 6b proposals is that commissioners do not have
enough time to review the proposals and take action. He noted that the timeframe should be lengthened,
and suggested that new language be added to the Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance.
Gwendolyn Clemons commented that the Department of Planning and Development had been working
with the State' s Attorney' s Office, which has drafted language that will be used in terms of outreach to all
municipalities indicating that the Department of Planning and Development must be given thirty days so
the County Board can review and act upon the applications. Further, Ms. Clemons stated that her office
received the new language last week from the State's Attorney's Office. The Department of Planning and
Development is in the process of putting together an infonnation package that will be distributed to
everyone involved in the process. Finally, Ms. Clemons noted that the State's Attorney's Office will be
working with the Assessor's Office to strengthen the language.
Commissioner Hansen asked if legally, any new language is needed as a pre-condition in order for the
Department of Planning and Development to have more time when proposals are before the Board.
Gwendolyn Clemons stated that the State's Attorney's Office informed her office that this could be
handled administratively.
Commissioner Hansen commented that this matter needs to be immediately clarified; and the Chainnan of
the Business and Economic Development Committee and the commissioners should be notified on both
counts. He concluded by noting that commissioners should receive something in writing if an
amendment is needed.

1558

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 20, 2003

Chairman Collins agreed with Commissioner Hansen ' s comments. The chairman stated that pa11 of the
problem is that this is the first time the committee on Business and Economic Development has met to
discuss proposals. She noted that in the future, all proposals would be placed on a Board Agenda and
then referred to committee for discussion.
Commissioner Hansen stated that he wanted to be certain that the county is acting according to the law
and the timeframe is not shortened. He then requested a copy of the State's Attorney ' s legal opinion.
Gwendolyn Clemons stated that a copy of the legal opinion would be distributed to the commissioners
today. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)

the Village of Bedford Park is very eager to assist in the expansion of their employee base but help retain
the company in the Village. Mr. Colson submitted a Resolution of support from the Village of Bedford

Container Company, which projects an increase of 45 new jobs over a five-year period, and amounts to

requests in terms of the amount of the incentives compared to the number of jobs created.

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated April 15, 2003:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization for the Purchasing
Agent to advertise for bids for the Countywide Repair and Replaeement of Asphalt and
Conerete Pavement Restoration Pavement Program - Phase I. It is respectfully requested that
this Honorable Body approve this request.

1564

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 20, 2003

This first phase consists of the repair and replacement of asphalt parking lots and roadways.
It also provides for concrete repair and replacement of sidewalks and stair entrances and
surrounding building sidewalks, stairs, handicap ramps, curbs and gutters. Locations
included are the 4th, 5th and 6th District Courthouses, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County
Campus and the Department of Corrections Campus.
Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.
*Referred to the Construction Committee on 5/6/03.

Commissioner Silvestri asked the difference between the repair and replacement of asphalt and concrete
and the pavement restoration program.
Michael LaMont responded that there is no difference between the two statements.
In response to Commi ssioner Silvestri 's question regarding the repa ir or replacement of concrete, Michael
LaMont stated that concrete will be replaced where necessary. He stated that the contract is a two-year
contract, and the contact will show the unit prices so that if a problem occurs at another location within
the next two years, the price would be set in the contract.

In response to several questions regarding the Maywood Courthouse, Michael LaMont responded that all
the asphalt at the Maywood Courthouse is being replaced, including the access road.
Commissioner Silvestri asked the status of building an entrance/exit to Harrison Street.
Michael LaMont responded that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy is still reviewing this option.
He said one problem is that the ComEd property goes up to the IDOT right-of-way, and that part of the
land is contaminated.
Commissioner Collins stated that last year Enterpriz Cook County, the Office of Economic Development
and ComEd met to look at the area in terms of overall development and what it would mean to the Village
of Maywood. The other issue was the building of a ramp from the CTA station so the public could have
better access to the Maywood Cou1thouse and help relieve some of the traffic downtown. Commissioner
Collins concluded by noting that through cooperation between the state, city and the county, the area
could become a more viable economic area for the residents of the Village of Maywood.
Chaimrnn Sims suggested that Commissioner Collins let Michael LaMont know who he should talk to in
regards to this matter.
Michael LaMont stated that one of the goals in the Office of Capital Planning and Policy was to pursue a
master plan of the area and start moving in that direction. He also asked Commissioner Collins to notify
him of any future meetings regarding plans for the area.
Commissioner Collins stated that there should be a meeting within the next three weeks.
Commissioner Gorman asked when the project would be completed.

1565

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 20, 2003
Michael LaMont stated that he hopes to have the permits issued by August, which is when the work will
begin. He stated that all the work will not be completed this season; it is intended to be a two-year
contract into the spring of 2005 .

*Referred to the Construction Committee on 5/6/03.
Jn response to Commissioner Silvestri' s question regarding when Division VIII was built, Michael

Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization to enter into a
professional services contract with JOSE DEAVILA AND ASSOCIATES for
architectural/engineering services for the "Green Light" Fixture Replacement Program Phase II. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.

1566

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 20, 2003

This project provides for a survey of all buildings constructed prior to I 990 in order to
replace inefficient lights with more efficient lights. Phase II involves replacement of light
fixtures at the Cook County Administration Building and Courthouse at 26th and California,
the County Building and offices not completed in Phase I at the Rolling Meadows, Markham,
and Skokie courthouses. The energy savings provided by this project will equal its cost in
about three years.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $200,000.00. Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

*Referred to the Construction Committee on 5/6/03.
In response to Commissioner Moreno's question, Michael LaMont stated that the energy saving products
are still being evaluated. A test was done for a product that lowers the voltage in lighting systems, it is a
device which is hooked up into the incoming power and lowers the voltage saving energy without a
significant decrease in lighting level. The test was done in a parking garage. He further stated that he has
not brought this before the Board, because it still is under review.
Commissioner Moreno asked if the products are consistent with those potential energy devices that the
Office of Capital Planning and Development is reviewing.
Michael LaMont stated that the consultant would be looking at the energy devices. He stated that this is a
design contract for the consultants to prepare the plans and look at the products. Mr. LaMont stated that
this is the second phase of the project; the first phase was done in-house. He said the Office of Capital
Planning and Policy does not have all the technical expertise which is the reason consultants are often
hired .

Commissioner Collins, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved the approval of Communication
No. 259114. The motion carried.

to the contract with Drv ANE BROTHERS ELECTRIC CO., contractor for Department of

WHEREAS, Bessie Coleman' s legacy may be unfamiliar to some, but many are touched by her
endeavors in their everyday life, and
WHEREAS, Bessie Coleman was born in Texas in 1892 to an African American mother and a Choctaw
Indian father, and was the twelfth of thirteen children, and
WHEREAS, when her father left the family when she was seven, Bessie Coleman worked and helped her
mother to bring in money for the family, and
WHEREAS, after displaying an aptitude of mathematics in high school, Bessie Coleman strove to
further her education herself by attending Langston Industrial College, but a lack of money forced her to
drop out in 1910, and
WHEREAS, Bessie Coleman moved to Chicago in 1915 and got a job as a manicurist, and as she worked
she listened to stories of pilots returning from World War I, and in particular she was enthralled by the
exploits of the female French pilots, and upon hearing those stories she decided to learn to fly, and
WHEREAS, Bessie Coleman' s resolve conquered the prejudice she faced attempting this dream, as no
American flight school would accept her, because of her race and her gender, so she saved her money,
took French language lessons and traveled to France to earn her pilot's license, and
WHEREAS, Bessie Coleman returned to the United States with her pilot' s license, and later perfonned
as a daredevil stunt pilot and exhibition flier, earning the title of "Brave Bessie" as a result of her aerial
feats, and
WHEREAS, Bessie Coleman 's ties to Chicago continued throughout her life, as her first exhibition was
at Chicago's Checkerboard Airdrome, known today as Midway Airport, and
WHEREAS, Bessie Coleman then set her sights on opening a flight school for African-Americans, and
began raising money through lectures in schools and churches for that purpose, and
WHEREAS, Bessie Coleman's life was tragically cut short when her plane unexpectedly rolled over due
to jammed controls during a test run for a Memorial Day event, and she fell more than a mile to her death,
but her death was not in vain, as it brought about the federal regulation requiring seatbelts to be worn on
all air flights, and
WHEREAS, the road leading into O ' Hare' s terminals is named Bessie Coleman Drive, as a token of
appreciation to a woman who touched Chicago and remained here eternally, and
WHEREAS, each year, on Memorial Day, members of several flying clubs fly in formation over the
cemetery in southwest Chicago where Bessie Coleman was laid to rest, and drop flowers on her grave,
now, therefore
BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does hereby honor the life,
success and memory of Bessie Coleman, a pioneer who proved that hard work and determination can
bring success, and her success would shed light on the shadow of intolerance to pave the way for others to
share that dream.
Approved and adopted this 20th day of May 2003 .
