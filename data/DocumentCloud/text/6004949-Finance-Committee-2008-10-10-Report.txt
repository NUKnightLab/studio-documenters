that a quorum was present.

 

 

Status Report on the Group Purchasing Organization and related matters

Leslie Duffy, Director of Procurement of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, presented a status
report on group purchasing organizations (GPO). (See Attachment Questions were raised with regard to
estimated savings; Ms. Duffy indicated that research is currently being done, but issues such as lack of training
and staff resources are challenges she faces.

During the discussion of the item, Chairman Carvalho suggested that an analysis be done to examine the savings
that could be realized by entering into a group purchasing organization that is outside of Cook County ordinance
boundaries.

David R. Small, Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, responded
that Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council (MCHC) had been commissioned in 2007 to do an analysis on
group purchasing. Their report stated operational and organizational changes that the System is proposing to do.
They performed a thirteen hundred item review, comparing it to just one GPO. Mr. Small did not recall the
exact ?gure, but he stated that it was a very signi?cant cost difference.

Chairman Carvalho asked whether the analysis in 2007 was based upon existing Cook County ordinances,
including those involving contract compliance.

?Mr. Small replied that the question relating to contract compliance and GPOs has been raised with the State?s
Attorney. The question was, would each purchase of a single item with a particular vendor under the GPO need
to meet the ordinance requirements?

Elizabeth Reidy, Deputy Chief of the Civil Actions Bureau of the Of?ce of the State's Attorney, informed the
Committee of the preliminary opinion of the State?s Attorney?s Of?ce on the matter. She stated that it was
determined that each purchase with a vendor for an item under a GPO would be subject to MBEIWBE
compliance.

Chairman Carvalho noted that this would seem to have an affect on the pricing and that the MCHC analysis
should be done both assuming compliance with contract compliance and without.

Director Munoz requested a copy of the 2007. MCHC analysis].

Mr. Small stated that he could provide the analysis.

Discussion turned to the subject of the JD Edwards system. It has been mentioned that it is inadequate for the
System?s needs; Chairman Carvalho stated that this opinion is being questioned. In order to prepare for when
this discussion comes up, he stated that de?ciencies should be tracked, documented and accumulated, along with
the improvements that would be available with an alternative system.

Chairman Carvalho asked Mr. Small for an update on the procurement policy.

Mr. Small stated that he expected to have the full package of procurement policies and procedures at the next
meeting of the Finance Committeez.

 

Update from MedAssets on Revenue Cvcle Proiect

Robert Wright, Executive Project Director and Gretchen Ryan, Project Manager from MedAssets, presented an
update on the Revenue Cycle Project. (See Attachment Questions were raised and discussion took place on
the information provided.

Chairman Carvalho stated that the information provided on the revenue cycle raises the question which
improvements are related to faster processing, and which improvements are related to better processing?

Director Munoz asked whether that information could also include a month-to-month comparison relating to
volume.

Mr. Wright stated that he could provide the information at the next Finance Committee meeting.

Director O'Donnell stated that in the 2009 Budget, it was anticipated that an additional $20 million would be
generated as a result of MedAssets' efforts. She asked whether progress measurement was available to ensure
that efforts are on target with the expectations.

Mr. Small stated that this information could be supplied on a regular basis?.

While discussing entering doctors? orders into the system, Chairman Carvalho inquired whether the system is set
up to capture the right name for the right doctor. He referenced instances long age under a prior system in
which this information was being entered under only one doctor?s name as the admitting doctor, even after he no
longer worked there.

Ms. Ryan stated that her initial answer would be yes, but that she would follow up on the question and get a
de?nitive answers. 

Discussion turned to information technology and the different systems used. Mr. Small clari?ed some points
with regard to the systems interactions and compatibility. He stated that the earlier issues surrounding the two
hundred points of interface between the systems had been identi?ed; the technological application interaction
issues have been resolved. 'What remains to be resolved is related to how the information is de?ned and used.

During the presentation, the subject of the Limit of Liability policy arose. Mr. Small stated that they are
reviewing the completed draft policies; this is expected to be presented to the Finance Committee fairly soon.

Discussion took place on the subject of big-picture policy questions such as those relating to the Limit of
Liability policy. Comments were made with regard to how these issues should be presented, discussed and
deliberated; also discussed were some of the questions that will need to be addressed in order to decide these
matters.

In response to a question from Director O?Donnell with regard to aged receivables, Mr. Small stated the System
has taken off 2.25 million accounts for close to $1 billion, and takes it through the audits of 2004. For 2005,
2006 and 2007, he stated that he would be coming forward with a policy for the Board to adopt that allows the
System to recognize and Write them off sooner, on a basis. He provided information on efforts by
information services to migrate the 2005 and 2006 accounts to an inactive status. These are accounts that have
already been written off, but have not been taken off the system.

Mr. Wright stated that the action on these accounts is purely from an administrative standpoint; there is zero
profit and less impact, the true rationale for doing this is not to get the books cleared from a dollar standpoint,
.because that has already been dealt with.

Chairman Carvalho clari?ed the issue: they have been written off the books, they don?t show up on the
accounting statements, nobody thinks that they are still there, except the computer, because no one took them
out of the computer.

Pitt Calkin, Interim Chief Financial Officer for the Cook County Health and HosPitals System, stated that this
issue was referenced in Deloitte Touche?s management letter as one of its comments. There is a management
response to this comment, where going forward, this is expected to be done on a basis like most
hospitals do around the country.

Discussion continued on the presentation, with detailed questions relating to coding and charges.

After the presentation, Mr. Small provided the Committee with an update on the 2009 Budget. He stated that
they are concluding the ?nal load of the information into the County?s budget system. It is expected that
verification of the information will be done next week. At some point next week, the CD containing the budget
and a cover memorandum will be delivered to the President and to the County Commissioners, prior to the
meetings that have been scheduled with them to discuss it.

Chairman Carvalho referenced the contretemps regarding the release of the 2009 Budget document. After the
September 26th Finance Committee meeting and the October 3rd Board meeting, he was under the impression
that there was a short summary of the budget that would be available for reporters once the budget was approved
by the full Board and had so-infonned a reporter prior to the Board meeting. He was incorrect, but left the
meeting just as it ended. He apologized to the public for the error and the confusion created by this. He noted
that in prior years, no information regarding the health system?s budget was ever available to the public prior to
presentation of the complete County budget to the public by the County Board President, so in many ways, the
public has had available to it much more information, discussed openly in several Finance Committee and Board
meetings, than it has ever had before. He regretted the confusion surrounding the specific pieces of paper to be
released and the timing of their release.

With regard to scheduling for the Strategic Planning plenary session, Director Golden requested that the
Directors check their schedules for either October 30"1 or in the ?rst or second week of November.
Additionally, she noted that there was a draft letter handed out at the last meeting; if any changes are suggested,
please let them know.

 

Review and discussion of the following:

- Report of the Finance Committee for the meeting of August 18, 2008
(deferred on September 12, 2008 and September 26, 2008).

0 Report of the Finance Committee for the meeting of September 12, 2008
(deferred on September 26, 2008).

- Report of the Finance Committee for the meeting of September 26, 2008.

Chairman Carvalho explained the purpose of having the Finance Committee reports on the agenda, even a?er
the Board has approved them. This provides Committee members the opportunity to review and discuss the
reports. Additionally, if any errors are found in the report, corrections can be made and rati?ed at the Board
.level. He stated that on a going-forward basis, the agenda will always include the previous meeting?s report for
review; the reason why there are three reports for this meeting is because the Committee has run out of time to
discuss the earlier reports at previous meetings.

Chairman Carvalho inquired whether any members had corrections to the reports. Hearing none, Chairman
Carvalho moved to the next item on the agenda.
