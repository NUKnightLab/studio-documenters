Minutes of the May 25, 2017, Budget Committee Meeting
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the minutes of the May 25, 2017, Budget
Committee Meeting. Ms. Paziotopoulos seconded the motion and it passed by unanimous
voice vote.
Prison Rape Elimination Act
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated July 27, 2017, regarding the
FFY16 Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) Plan Introduction. He said that PREA calls
for federal, state, and local corrections systems to have a zero-tolerance policy regarding
prison rape (as defined by PREA) in prisons, jails, police lock-ups, and other confinement
facilities. The Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) identified a need for additional
cameras at the Illinois River Correctional Center, a medium security adult male
correctional facility, and the Logan Correctional Center, a maximum security correctional
center for women. The two correctional centers were chosen due to their sensitive and
vulnerable populations and as a result of a facility internal affairs and operations review

of all camera installations. The two locations were deemed as having the greatest needs
for additional cameras after an operations staff review of current IDOC security camera
inventory. ICJIA’s FFY16 PREA award was $124,797. Staff recommends designating the
funds to IDOC to purchase security cameras and peripheral equipment as part of its
Inmate Sexual Assault – Prevention and Intervention Program.
Motion: Ms. Kramer moved to approve the recommended FFY16 PREA designation.
Ms. Wolff seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
Victims of Crime Act
FFY15
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated July 27, 2017, regarding
FFY15 and FFY16 Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) Plan Adjustments. He said staff
recommended designating $47,697 in FFY15 funds to the McLean County Child
Advocacy Center and the Sangamon County Child Advocacy Center. These funds will
allow these programs to operate until the end of calendar year 2017 when a new Notice of
Funding Opportunity will open.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended FFY15 VOCA designations.
Ms. Kramer seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice vote with
recusals by Ms. Barnes and Hon. Robb.
FFY16
Associate Director Givens said staff recommended designating $455,000 in FFY16 funds
to the City of Chicago Department of Family and Support Services for its Statewide
Domestic Violence Hotline.
Motion: Hon. Robb moved to approve the recommended FFY16 VOCA designation.
Ms. Wolff seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
Violence Against Women Act
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated July 27, 2017, regarding
FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16 Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Plan Adjustments.
He said that these recommended designations to five multidisciplinary team response
program (MDTs), represented as groups A – E in the memo, comprise funds for the final
year of a three-year funding period for these programs. A new Notice of Funding
Opportunity will be issued in the next calendar year for a new scope of work.

Motion: Ms. Paziotopoulos moved to approve the recommended FFY15 and FFY16
VOCA designations for Multidisciplinary Team Response Program Group A (Cook
County Domestic Violence MDT), as described in the table on Page 2 of the memo (Page
16 of the meeting materials package). Ms. Barnes seconded the motion and the motion
passed by unanimous voice vote, with a recusal by Ms. Kramer.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended FFY15 VOCA designations for
Multidisciplinary Team Response Program Group B (Cook County Sexual Assault
MDT), as described in the table on Page 2 of the memo (Page 16 of the meeting materials
package). Ms. Dunne seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice
vote with a recusal by Ms. Kramer.
Motion: Hon. Robb moved to approve the recommended FFY15 VOCA designations
for Multidisciplinary Team Response Program Groups C, D, and E (Kankakee County
Sexual Assault MDT, Peoria County Domestic Violence MDT, and St. Clair County
MDT, respectively), as described in the table on Page 2 of the memo (Page 16 of the
meeting materials package). Ms. Kramer seconded the motion and the motion passed by
unanimous voice vote.
State Appropriations
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated July 27, 2017, regarding
SFY18 state-appropriated program funding for Ceasefire, Safe From the Start, and
Community-Based Violence Intervention and Prevention.
Ceasefire
Associate Director Givens said that the mission of Ceasefire Illinois, a unit at the
University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health, is to work with community and
government partners to reduce violence in all forms and help design interventions
required for community and city anti-violence plans. Ceasefire is an evidence-informed
public health approach to reduce violence, he said. He noted $6,094,300 was made
available, via SB-0006, to support Ceasefire in SFY18. Staff recommended designating
$5,484,870 of those funds to the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health
to support this program. He called attention to the supplemental Grant Recommendation
Report document that had been provided to the Board members detailing the Ceasefire
program.
Community-Based Violence Prevention and Intervention
Associate Director Givens said that Illinois’s SFY18 budget included $8,000,000 for
Community-Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Program (CB-VIP) grants and
administration. Staff recommended that approximately $6,700,000 to $7,200,000 was

made available under a Notice of Funding Opportunity with grants ranging from
$100,000 to $1,000,000 to support programming for an initial 10-month period. He said
the anticipated grant period would be Oct 1, 2017, to June 30, 2018. He said he funding
opportunity would be be open to public and not-for-profit entities providing communitybased violence prevention and intervention services in Illinois. The opportunity would
not be open to Cure Violence/Ceasefire (University of Illinois at Chicago) or its subgrantees for similar activities for the same population because they received a separate
state SFY18 appropriation for that purpose, he said. He noted the target population would
be youth and young adults, including, but not limited to, those who are identified as being
at heightened risk for violence or those who engage in high-risk behavior or violence.
Associate Director Givens called attention to the third bullet point on Page 2 of the memo
(Page 28 of the meeting materials package). He said that the following text should be
disregarded:
“… (additional points will be given for applications that reflect more than one
category).”
Executive Director Maki said that the designations represent the first of the stateappropriated program funds that will be subject to the Grant Accountability and
Transparency Act (GATA) requirements and, therefore, ICJIA staff will need to adhere to
policies and procedures over which they do not have much control. He said this could
increase the amount of time that it will take to process these designations and actually
distribute the funds.
Safe From the Start
Associate Director Givens said that the Safe From the Start (SFS) grant program is
designed to assist in the development, implementation, and evaluation of comprehensive
and coordinated community-based models to identify, assess, and serve children,
(primarily ages 0-5) who have been exposed to violence in their homes and/or
communities. He said that staff recommends designating a maximum of $1,031,400 in
SFY18 SFS funds to entities as described in the table on Page 3 of the memo (Page 29 of
the meeting materials package).
Motion: Ms. Barnes moved to approve the recommended SFY18 Ceasefire designation
to the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health. Ms. Paziotopoulos
seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice vote with abstentions by
Ms. Dunne, Director Schmitz, and Ms. Wolff.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended SFY18 Community-Based
Violence Prevention and Intervention Notice of Funding Opportunity. Ms. Kramer
seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice vote.

Motion: Hon. Robb moved to approve the recommended SFY18 Safe From the Start
designations. Ms. Wolff seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice
vote.
Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Act
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated July 27, 2017, regarding the
FFY17 Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Plan Introduction. He said the
Residential Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) guidelines require that a minimum of 10
percent of each federal award is made available to local correctional facilities. He said in
2016, ICJIA issued a notice of funding opportunity to solicit applications for local opioid
medication-assisted treatment services using RSAT and JAG local set-aside funds. He
reported that no applications were received and the local RSAT set-aside dollars
remained unspent. He said in May 2017, ICJIA issued a notice of funding opportunity to
solicit applications for state and local correctional treatment and aftercare services to be
supported with anticipated FFY17 RSAT funds and local funds remaining from the
FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16 awards. He said the notice detailed federal RSAT
requirements and model RSAT programs and best practices. Four applications were
received from state agencies, but none were received from local agencies, he said. He
added ICJIA’s application for FFY17 RSAT funds was submitted June 28, 2017, and the
award was expected to commence October 1, 2017.
Associate Director Givens said that four applications were received in response to the
May 2017 RSAT Notice of Funding Opportunity. The applications were scored by a team
of ICJIA grant and research staff following ICJIA’s GATA-compliant, merit-based
review process. He said two of the four applications met the minimum scoring threshold.
Staff recommended the following designations; $84,715 in FFY16 RSAT funds to IDOC
to support its Dual Diagnosis / Female Treatment program and $46,060 in FFY17 funds
to the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice (IDJJ) to support treatment programs at its
Illinois Youth Center at Harrisburg facility. He said the FFY17 designation was
contingent on the receipt of the award.
Motion: Ms. Kramer moved to approve the recommended FFY16 and FFY17 RSAT
designations. Ms. Barnes seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous
voice vote.
Justice Assistance Grants
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated July 27, 2017, regarding the
FFY13, FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16 Justice Assistance Grants (JAG) plan adjustments.

Executive Director Maki said thee JAG designation recommendations were the first
resulting from the GATA-compliant competitive process. The designations are more
aligned with population and need as opposed to past legacy-based designations, he said.
Designation Reductions
Associate Director Givens called attention to the chart on Page 1 of the memo (Page 37
of the meeting materials package) describing $322,222 in FFY13 and FFY14 funds
recently returned to ICJIA. He said that staff recommended making the funds available
for future programming.
Motion: Hon. Robb moved to approve the recommended FFY13 and FFY14 JAG
designation reductions. Ms. Wolff seconded the motion and the motion passed by
unanimous voice vote with a recusal by Ms. Barnes.
Recommended Designations
Notice of Funding Opportunity: Comprehensive Law Enforcement Response to Narcotics
Associate Director Givens said that at the February 24, 2017, Budget Committee
meeting, the committee approved the use of $4.2 million in then-available FFY14,
FFY15, and FFY16 JAG funds to issue a competitive notice of funding opportunity in the
second quarter of 2017 for comprehensive law enforcement responses to narcotics. He
said proposals were solicited in March 2017 for three types of programing supporting a
three-pronged strategy designed to address both the supply and demand for narcotics:
1. Police-led substance use diversion/deflection programs.
2. Multijurisdictional large-scale narcotic trafficking enforcement.
3. Multijurisdictional narcotic prosecution programs.
Associate Director Givens called attention to the chart at the bottom of Page 3 of the
memo (Page 39 of the meeting materials package) comparing available fund distribution
within the 2017 funding opportunity’s three categories with how JAG funds were
previously distributed to the programs. He then called attention to the chart on Page 4 of
the memo (Page 40 of the meeting materials package) describing FFY13, FFY14, FFY15,
and FFY16 designation recommendations pursuant to the conclusion of the GATAcompliant merit-based review of applications. He called attention to the maps on pages
45, 46, and 47 of the meeting materials package illustrating the geographic distribution of
the recommended Comprehensive Law Enforcement Response to Narcotics program
designations.

Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the FFY13 and FFY16 JAG designation
recommendations for police-led diversion/deflection programs. Ms. Kramer seconded the
motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
Motion: Ms. Barnes moved to approve the FFY13, FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16 JAG
designation recommendations for multijurisdictional large-scale narcotic trafficking
enforcement programs. Ms. Wolff seconded the motion and the motion passed by
unanimous voice vote, with a recusal by Ms. Kramer.
Motion: Ms. Paziotopoulos moved to approve the FFY13, FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16
JAG designation recommendations for multijurisdictional narcotic prosecution units
programs. Ms. Wolff seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice
vote.
Continuations of Current Programs
Associate Director Givens said that as Director Maki explained in his January 23, 2017,
memorandum to the Board, ICJIA will be using standardized notices of funding
opportunity (NOFOs) to make JAG awards, as required by the Grants Accountability and
Transparency Act and ICJIA’s JAG Strategic Plan. He said that given ICJIA’s current
staffing levels, it is not possible to transition all JAG programs simultaneously to NOFOdriven awards; therefore, staff has grouped the JAG programs into four primary strategic
areas and will issue a staggered series of corresponding NOFOs to which potential
grantees will be able to apply over the next two years per the schedule on Page 5 of the
memo (Page 41 of the meeting materials package). Other programs offering
comprehensive responses that did not fit into the parameters of that NOFO also are in
need of funding, he said. He said while previously described staffing limitations preclude
the use of a competitive process at that time, staff recommended designating the funds to
support programs described in the table at the bottom of Page 5/6 of the memo (Page
41/42 of the meeting materials package). Referring to that chart, he said the
recommended designation to the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice for its Youth
Offender Re-Entry Program in the amount of $91,800 should be dismissed.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the FFY15 and FFY16 JAG designation
recommendations to ICJIA, Coles County, Winnebago County, and IDOC for program
continuations. Ms. Kramer seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous
voice vote.
Motion: Ms. Dunne moved to approve the FFY16 JAG designation recommendation to
the Cook County Public Defender’s Office for program continuation. Ms. Wolff
seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice vote.

recommendations to Be Well Partners in Health and Haymarket Center for program
continuations. Hon. Robb seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous
voice vote with a recusal by Ms. Dunne.
Designation Increase
Rockford Partnerships to Reduce Violent Crime
Associate Director Givens said that in August 2016, the Budget Committee approved a
designation to the Rockford Metropolitan Agency for Planning (RMAP) to implement the
Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent Crime program. Reports from RMAP indicate that
it will not be able to complete all of these tasks on their accelerated schedule. Staff
recommended an increase of $25,204 to RMAP’s FFY14 JAG designation to extend its
agreement to the full 12-month period of performance for a total designation of $181,098.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the FFY14 JAG designation increase
recommendation to RMAP. Ms. Dunne seconded the motion and the motion passed by
unanimous voice vote.

RE:

State Fiscal Year 2018 Funding for the Illinois Family Violence
Coordinating Council

ILLINOIS FAMILY VIOLENCE COORDINATING COUNCIL
The Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council comprises 14 local family violence
coordinating councils that offer local forums to share and discuss information promoting
a coordinated response to family violence in communities.
Established in 1993, the councils work to improve institutional and professional criminal
justice responses to family violence issues. The councils engage in prevention, education,
and the coordination of intervention and services for victims and perpetrators of child
abuse, domestic violence, and elder abuse.
Each council is judicially led by the chief judge or a judge appointed by the chief judge.
A separate fiscal agent administers the annual allocation of funds. Funds are used to
support a part-time local council coordinator for each council and coordination of
committee work, training, travel, and other related activities as determined by the Local
Council Planning/Steering Committees. Planning/Steering Committees and local council
coordinators establish the goals and objectives for the upcoming year. All local council
activities are approved by the Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council.
Staff recommends that $439,000 in SFY18 Illinois Family Violence Coordinating
Council general revenue funds are designated as described in the table below. These
funds will allow the programs to operate for one year.

Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council

Funding Source:

State Fiscal Year 2018 General Revenue Funds

Agency Budget:

N/A

Request Type:

State Appropriation

Program Description
The Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council comprises 14 local family violence coordinating councils
that offer local forums to share and discuss information promoting a coordinated response to family violence in
communities.
Program Activities
Established in 1993, the councils work to improve the criminal justice institutional and professional response to
family violence issues. The councils engage in prevention, education, and the coordination of intervention and
services for victims and perpetrators of child abuse, domestic violence, and elder abuse.
Goals
Annually, up to 15,000 professionals from across Illinois participate in trainings and council projects. These
include family violence training and education of criminal justice and community professionals; development of
criminal justice procedures, protocols, and services related to family violence; and the facilitation of
coordinated community response to family violence in local areas. The councils provide opportunities for
communication between criminal justice professionals and community service providers and encourage
information and resource sharing, thereby providing for development of a network of safety and assistance for
family violence victims.
Priorities
The Authority brings together key leaders from the justice system and the public to identify critical issues
facing the criminal justice system in Illinois, and to propose and evaluate policies, programs, and legislation that
address those issues. The agency also works to ensure the criminal justice system in Illinois is efficient and
effective. With the Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council, Illinois is one of the few states that has a
systematically organized, statewide infrastructure that operates at both the state and local levels. Since the
1970's, a comprehensive, coordinated approach to preventing family violence has been promoted as the most
efficient and effective way to penetrate systems and mobilize them for the greatest change.

Funding Prospectus
Funds are used to support a part-time local council coordinator for each council and coordination of committee
work, training, travel, and other related activities as determined by the Local Council Planning/Steering
Committees. The Planning/Steering Committee and local council coordinator establish the goals and objectives
for the upcoming year. All local council activities are approved by the Illinois Family Violence Coordinating
Council.
Past Performance
Annually, up to 15,000 professionals from across Illinois participate in trainings and council projects. These
include family violence training and education of criminal justice and community professionals; development of
criminal justice procedures, protocols, and services related to family violence; and the facilitation of
coordinated community response to family violence in local areas. These Local Councils provide opportunities
for communication between criminal justice professionals and community service providers as well as
encourage the sharing of information and resources, thereby providing for development of a network of safety
and assistance for family violence victims.
Due to a budget impasse in SFY16 and SFY17, the number of active local councils receiving funding has
decreased from 23 to 14. The program director will work with inactive local councils to reinstate programming
for SFY 2019.

DATE:

September 28, 2017

RE:

Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act

This memo introduces recommended adjustments to the FFY16 Sex Offender
Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) Plan and introduces the FFY17 SORNA
Plan.
In July 2011, Illinois submitted a substantial implementation package to the Department
of Justice’s Office of Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering,
and Tracking (SMART Office) for review. The SMART Office provided a report to
Illinois outlining areas in which Illinois was not in compliance with SORNA. One of the
principal areas in need of improvement was Illinois State Police’s (ISP) lack of an
electronic records management system for electronic collection, exchange and posting of
registrant information.
Since that time, SORNA funds have been used by ISP to obtain an electronic records
management system and scan the backlog of paper records submitted to the ISP Sex
Offender Registration and Notification Unit. In August 2016, ICJIA designated the entire
FFY16 SORNA award of $259,576 to ISP for staff overtime to scan the remaining
backlog of paper records. While the project was successful in eliminating the backlog, at
the end of the period of performance, $214,904 of the funds remained unspent.
ICJIA expects receipt of the FFY17 SORNA award in the amount of $248,403 by
September 30, 2017. Staff requests permission to issue one Notice of Funding
Opportunity using both FFY16 and FFY17 funds for awards to law enforcement agencies
for the procurement of equipment to facilitate the electronic submission of sex offender
documents to ISP. Equipment would include scanners, computers, servers and related
peripherals.

Notice of Funding Opportunity

Program Description
States that are not in substantial compliance with the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA)
lose a portion of their annual JAG award. The lost funds are returned to the states through the SORNA program.
SORNA funds may only be used to maintain or enhance state compliance with the SORNA Act requirements.
Program Activities
The Illinois State Police (ISP) used federal fiscal year 2012 SORNA funds to purchase an electronic filing
system. The system has enabled ISP to electronically share registration documents in a more efficient manner
by supporting registrant document scanning and sharing. Scanned documents include, but are not limited to,
notification/registration forms, correspondence to and from the offender, and court documents. FFY15 SORNA
funds were used to procure a high capacity server dedicated to storage of Sex Offender Registration Unit
documents. With adequate server capacity, ISP used FFY16 funds for staff overtime to digitally scan existing
paper documents to eliminate the backlog of paper records and move toward the more efficient paperless
submission, storage and dissemination of sex offender records. Lapsing FFY16 SORNA funds and the
anticipated SFY17 SORNA award will be used to support a notice of funding opportunity to law enforcement
agencies for the procurement of equipment to facilitate electronic submission of sex offender documents to ISP.
Equipment would include scanners, computers, servers and related peripherals.
Goals
The goal is to enable the ISP Sex Offender Registration Unit to enhance public safety with conversion to an allelectronic records system that will allow more efficient sex offender record management and move Illinois
closer to federal SORNA compliance.
Priorities
Electronic submission, storage, and dissemination of sex offender registration documents is a priority use for
SORNA funding.

RE:

State Fiscal Year 2018 Funding Adjustments for VAWA Arrest Grants to
Encourage Arrest and Enforcement of Protection Orders Program for the
Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council

ILLINOIS FAMILY VIOLENCE COORDINATING COUNCILS
In 2014, the Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council under the Illinois Criminal
Justice Information Authority was awarded renewal funding of $900,000 from the U.S.
Department of Justice Office (DOJ) for the Violence Against Women Grant to Encourage
Arrest and Enforcement of Orders of Protection Program. The grant period was originally
from October 2014 through September 30, 2017, but the period was extended by the DOJ
to September 30, 2018.
Recommended Designation
Macon Resources was designated $25,075 in SFY15 and $24,981 in SFY16 for the
program. Blue Tower Solutions was designated $17,000 in SFY17 and took over the
implementing agency and fiscal agent roles for the program on April 1, 2017. Staff
recommends designating an additional $35,000 to Blue Tower Solutions to allow the
program to continue through September 30, 2018.
Further detail is provided in the attached Designation Recommendation Report.
Staff will be available at the meeting to answer any questions.

Request Type:

Continuation

Program Description
The Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council comprises 23 local family violence coordinating councils
that offer local forums to share and discuss information promoting a coordinated response to family violence in
communities. In 2014, IFVCC received federal fiscal year 2014 Violence Against Women Act Grants to
Encourage Arrest Policies and Enforcement of Protection Orders, which supports training, implementation
and follow-up with local jurisdictions on the protocols. Additionally, utilizing the model protocols, guidelines,
the Promising Practices Mini-Toolkits were developed for first responders (911/dispatchers and emergency
medical professionals) and court personnel (clerks, bailiffs, victim/witness coordinators and probation). By
providing resources and guidelines for other associated disciplines, the coordinated community response to
family violence will be strengthened along with the ongoing implementation and evaluation of the protocols.
Program Activities
During the continuation grant period, Blue Tower Solutions has continued to be a resource in the state to assure
access to the criminal justice system for victims with disabilities. Resources developed include the merger and
revision of Violence Against People with Disabilities Protocols and Violence Against Older Adults Protocols.
Blue Tower Solutions also provided assistance and feedback with webinars for protocols related to disabilities
and older adults. This grant will continue these services.

 VAWA A / FFY14
September 28, 2017

Priorities
Illinois is one of the few states that has a systematically organized, statewide infrastructure that operates at both
the state and local levels. Since the 1970's, a comprehensive, coordinated approach to preventing family
violence has been promoted as the most efficient and effective way to penetrate systems and mobilize them for
the greatest change.
Funding Prospectus
Funds are used to support a contractual coordinator as well as coordination of committee work, training, travel,
material development and other related activities.
Past Performance
Blue Tower Solutions has received funds from the VAWA Arrest grant since April 1, 2017. This designation
would amend the current grant to increase funding and extend the grant period from September 30, 2017 to
September 30, 2018.
Budget Detail
Travel – coordinator travel for meetings and trainings
Contractual – coordinator time, bookkeeper time, stipends to local council coordinators for

Request Type:

(Funding Opportunity #1474-332)

Program Description
Upon direct referral from the Illinois Department of Child and Family Services Intact Family Services (IFS)
Program utilizes comprehensive casework and services to work with families and allow children to remain
safely at home, rather than being placed in state foster care. Since all IFS families have at least one child
affected by child abuse and neglect, IFS is proposing the expansion of services to include licensed, trained
therapists to conduct evidence-based, trauma-informed therapy to minor victims of child abuse and neglect.
Program Activities
VOCA funding will support the program’s hiring of two new full-time therapists to conduct evidence-based,
trauma-informed therapies for minor victims of child abuse and neglect. Each therapist will carry an 11-client
caseload and provide therapy to approximately seven families per week, with an estimated one to two children
per family receiving trauma-informed therapy.
Goals
Funding will help therapists and participants collaborate to increase child safety, to prevent child abuse/neglect
recidivism, enhance family functioning, and increase knowledge of trauma coping mechanisms among children.
Furthermore, funding to include therapy for the IFS program population will ultimately strengthen family unity,
grow family understanding on how to prevent child abuse/neglect, and reduce emotional/psychological trauma
symptoms among children.
Priorities
Programs funded under this Notice of Funding Opportunity fall under priorities #3 Core Services, #5
Underserved, and #9 Long-term Needs, established by the Victim Services Ad Hoc Committee in January 2017.
Funding Prospectus
Staff expects to fund these programs for three years. Staff will analyze the program after the first 12 months to
ensure it is meeting its goals and objectives prior to recommending future funding.
