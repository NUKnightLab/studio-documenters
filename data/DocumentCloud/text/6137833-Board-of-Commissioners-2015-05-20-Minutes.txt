WHEREAS, Memorial Day, originally called Decoration Day, is the last Monday of May, and is a day of

WHEREAS, Memorial Day is a time for the Nation to appropriately remember and honor our American
heroes; and
WHEREAS, our service men and women answered the call of duty and made the ultimate sacrifice to
maintain the security of our country and the liberties we hold so dear; and
WHEREAS, our nation is honor bound to remember those who died on distant shores defending our Nation
and our way of life; and
WHEREAS, citizens across Cook County, the State of Illinois and the entire United States will pause to
remember the sacrifices of the men and women who died in service to our nation; and
WHEREAS, on this Memorial Day, as throughout the year, we pray for the families of the fallen and show
our respect for the contributions these service members made to the continuation of American freedom; and
WHEREAS, our grateful Nation honors their selfless service, and we recognize a debt of honor beyond
our capability to repay; and

and those who gave their lives to protect the freedom and democracy for our country; and

THE HONORABLE RICHARD R. BOYKIN, COUNTY COMMISSIONER
COOK COUNTY BOARD RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING MAY 31, 2015 AS
“STOP THE STIGMA SUNDAY”
WHEREAS, in 2013 President Barack Obama proclaimed May to be National Mental Health Awareness
Month; and
WHEREAS, in 2011 Illinois made greater reductions in state funding for mental health than any other state
in the United States of America; and
WHEREAS, the most recent round of state budget negotiations in Springfield indicate that Illinois is on
track to continue its status as one of the poorest funders of mental health services in the nation; and,
WHEREAS, the City of Chicago closed six of its 12 Community Mental Health Clinics in April of 2012;
and
WHEREAS, according to Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, the reduction in funding for mental health
services across multiple levels of government, including the Chicago clinic closures, has resulted in the
Cook County Jail being the largest mental health facility in the state and possibly the nation; and
WHEREAS, according to a joint report authored by the Mental Health Movement of Chicago and
AFSCME Council 31, Chicago’s closure of half of its mental health clinics resulted in a failure by the City
of Chicago to account for hundreds and perhaps thousands of people who had depended on these clinics for
mental health treatment services; and
WHEREAS, that same report, entitled “Abandoning the Most Vulnerable,” cites a complete lack of a
comprehensive effort to determine how many people lost access to mental health treatment services after
the Chicago clinic closures and similar lack of effort to make contact with the individuals who lost access
to treatment and connect them with new service providers; and
WHEREAS, Cook County, which is charged with providing services to the most vulnerable members of
our local population, deals every day with the consequences of an inadequate safety net that has stranded
too many of our residents without access to care that they urgently need; and
WHEREAS, among we count among those consequences an overcrowded Jail, court system and Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center, all of which constitute a significant drain on Cook County’s budget and
resources; and

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

May 20, 2015

WHEREAS, in addition to funding barriers, the stigma associated with having a mental illness has
prevented many people from receiving the treatment they require; and
WHEREAS, churches across Cook County will be hosting a program called “Stop the Stigma Sunday” on
Sunday May 31, 2015; and
WHEREAS, in recognition of “Stop the Stigma Sunday,” clergy and church leaders will feature in their
sermons and Sunday programs a segment on mental health destigmatization; and
WHEREAS, as part of “Stop the Stigma Sunday,” materials will be provided to clergy and church
leadership to assist them in crafting their presentations to their congregations; and
WHEREAS, as it is good, fitting and appropriate that Cook County government should lend its support to
such a critical initiative that addresses such an important public policy challenge.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County President and the Board of
Commissioners recognize May 31, 2015 as “Stop the Stigma Sunday”; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County President and the Board of Commissioners express
their support and appreciate to the men and women of faith, as well as those community activists and leaders
who will take the time on May 31, 2015 to raise awareness and combat the stigma that all too often
surrounds mental health issues in Cook County and beyond.

Approved and adopted this 20th of May 2015.

WHEREAS, Charles and Marjorie Benton initiated and provided the $200,000 grant that the League of
Women Voters used to fund the televised presidential forums during the 1976 primaries. Those forums led

WHEREAS, the impact felt by the loss of Charles Benton is significant. In the words of the great American
journalist Bill Moyers, “The world feels emptier today, like the forest when a great oak falls. And those of
us whose lives were touched by Charles are a little lonelier knowing he is gone. What an enthusiast he was
for things that mattered to democracy and humanity.” His loss will be felt even more acutely by his wife of
over sixty-two years, Marjorie, their daughter Adrianne Furniss and her husband, Robert; son, Craig, and
his wife Tina Ashmore; his five treasured grandchildren, Savannah Taylor, Colby Benton, Hemingway
Benton, Carrie Furniss, and Lily Furniss.

falling within the term, or as set forth below:
(1) A current certificate of insurance, or other evidence acceptable to the Director of Risk
Management, evidencing all insurance required to be maintained by grantee under Section 66-62.,
, must be on file with the Director at all times; therefore, an updated certificate of insurance must
be provided to the Director upon expiration and renewal of any policies required under the license
agreement.
(2) The annual license fee in effect from time to time.
(3) A certified report of current facilities and their locations, including plans, drawings or such other

(b) Failure to fulfill annual requirements. If grantee fails to fulfill the annual requirements by July 1,
grantee shall be subject to penalties as set forth in Section 66-91 and, in addition, the Director may revoke
the license at any time thereafter by terminating the license agreement as set forth below; provided,
however, that if grantee provides the certificate or other acceptable evidence of insurance and pays the
annual fee within 15 days after receipt of notice from the County of failure to comply with the annual
requirements (which shall constitute a violation notice under Section 66-87), grantee may request an
extension as to Section 66-60(a)(3) and the Director may grant such extension as the Director deems
appropriate (which shall constitute additional time to cure pursuant to Section 66-88(c)). If such extension
is granted, no penalties will accrue and the County will not be entitled to revoke the license if the
requirement is fulfilled prior to the expiration of the extension period. If grantee fails to provide the annual
report within the extension period, then penalties shall be assessed retroactively to the date which is five

notice shall be ineffective if the grantee fulfills all requirements prior to the effective date set forth in the
notice. If a grantee fails to fulfill the annual requirements as provided herein, then the County may exercise
the rights and remedies described in this article, including assessment of penalties and requiring removal
or deactivation of such person's facilities. In addition, the County may refuse to process any applications or

subsequent ten-year term. Such a request shall be made to the Director not less than six months prior to the
then current license expiration date, unless a later date is agreed to in writing by the Director.
(a) Request for license renewal shall be made in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section
66-59 of this article for a new license; however, Board authorization shall not be required for license
renewals, which may be approved by the Director. If a grantee having existing facilities fails to timely apply
for or diligently pursue a renewal of a license, then the County through the Director may exercise the rights
and remedies described in this article, including assessment of penalties and requiring removal of such
person's facilities.
(b) Notwithstanding the fact that the County Director may determine that a grantee has been in
reasonable compliance with the terms and conditions imposed by this article and the license agreement, the
County Director shall have no obligation to renew the license. If the County Director does not renew the
license, the County Director shall have the option to require the removal of all grantee's facilities and other
property located within the licensed area, at the grantee's expense, in accordance with Section 66-80.
Should the Director not renew a license following an application to renew, the annual license fee
accompanied with accompanying the renewal application shall be refunded. No provision of this article
shall be deemed or construed as to require the Board or Director to grant a license. The Director may
consider any relevant facts and circumstances, including the qualifications of the applicant and compliance
with the license agreement in the past, in determining whether to grant or renew a license. The Director
shall inform the Board within 30 days of any renewal license applications denied by the Director.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

Contract Number(s): 12-30-391
Concurrences:
The vendor has met the Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprises Ordinance.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: In 2012, this Board approved contract number 12-30-391 to facilitate the County’s WAN
Refresh and Broadband Network Expansion projects, for a contract period of 11/1/2012 through
10/31/2014. This Board later approved an increase to the contract amount in order to expand the scope
of both projects to encompass the Juvenile Detention Center, the 26th and California Campus, and the
Medical Examiner’s Office.
Under the current contract, System Solutions, Inc. (SSI) is responsible for delivering high speed network
hardware and hardware installation services upon the completion of fiber optic construction projects.
Owing to factors outside of SSI’s control, delivery of the hardware and installation services is still
pending. Specifically, fiber construction delays and permitting issues arising under a separate
construction contract have delayed SSI’s completion of tasks under this contract. The Bureau of
Technology therefore respectfully requests that this Board extend the contract term in order to ensure
completion of the projects detailed above. This contract was awarded through the use of a Comparable
Government Procurement agreement through a City of Chicago contract, pursuant to Section 34-140 of
the Cook County Procurement Code.

(2) Reasonable efforts to accommodate include, but are not limited to, allowing an employee:
a. To take a day of paid leave or vacation, where applicable under the employee’s
employment
agreement;
b. To be excused from work without pay and without discipline or other penalty; or

RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE LARRY SUFFREDIN, COUNTY COMMISSIONER
REQUESTING A HEARING OF THE LEGISLATION AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL
RELATIONS OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS TO DISCUSS
SUPPORTING THE INTERMEDIATE SERVICE CENTERS OF COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, the Intermediate Service Centers (“ISCs”) of Cook County play a crucial role in providing
shared services to the public and non-public school districts of suburban Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the Regional Safe Schools Program (“RSSP”) is one of the critical educational programs
offered to the youth of suburban Cook County, and has been offered to the suburban Cook County public
schools districts since 1997; and
WHEREAS, the RSSP initiative serves as the key youth drop-out and expulsion prevention program that
keeps young people (Grades 6-12) in school with an opportunity for graduation and enhanced success;
and
WHEREAS, should these students not receive educational services and enter into the juvenile justice
system, the cost to the State of Illinois is egregious; and
WHEREAS, Governor Rauner February budget address eliminated grant support for the RSSP throughout
the State; and
BE IT RESOLVED, since the dissolution of the Suburban Cook County Regional Office of Education
(“ROE”) # 14 in 2010, the ISCs have taken on all duties and responsibilities of the Suburban Cook County
Regional Office of Education; and
BE IT RESOLVED, all other 101 counties in the State of Illinois provide fiscal supports for their ROEs,
and consider their ROEs to be a branch of county government;
BE IT RESOLVED, Counties supply such tangible supports such as providing rent-free space in county
buildings, county-supplied insurance benefits, county personnel to carry out ROE duties, and salary

Page 110 of 200

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

May 20, 2015

stipends for ROE administrators; and
BE IT RESOLVED, the continued diminishment of state and federal grants and funding has caused the
ISCs to incur annual fiscal deficits; and
BE IT RESOLVED, the continued existence of the ISCs is now in question due to the existing fiscal
constraints and lack of support of Cook County; and
BE IT RESOLVED, these fiscal constraints call into question whether the ISCs can continue to provide
educator licensure support, bus driver training (for all of Cook County and Chicago Public Schools),
issuance of building and occupancy permits, Health/Life Safety inspections, annual Illinois State Board of
Education compliance visits, non-public school recognition services, truancy services, McKinney-Vento
homeless services, and professional development activities at several levels;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Legislation and Intergovernmental Committee of the Cook
County Commissioners will hold a Hearing to examine the relationship between the County of Cook and
the Intermediate Service Centers; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the intent of the Hearing will be to investigate how supports can be
provided to the Intermediate Service Centers to carry out their critical mission of serving the youth of Cook
County, Illinois.
Approved and adopted this 20th of May 2015.

Article VII, Section 6(a); and
WHEREAS, pursuant to its home rule power, Cook County may exercise any power and perform any
function relating to its government and affairs including the power to regulate for the protection of the
public health, safety, morals, and welfare; and
WHEREAS, in the spring of 2014, Arizona-based Lipsmark, LLC announced that it intended to market
powdered alcohol under the name “Palcohol”; and

Page 111 of 200

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

May 20, 2015

WHEREAS, the product was briefly approved for sale by the U.S. Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and
Trade Bureau, but the approval was temporarily rescinded because label approvals were given in error; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has concluded that it does not have a legal basis to
block market entry of the product at this time; and
WHEREAS, the Food and Drug Administration commented that its review focused solely on the
non-alcohol ingredients added to the product and that it does not have concerns that the ingredients, when
added to the alcoholic beverage products, render the products adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act; and
WHEREAS, in March of 2015, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade approved labels for Palcohol; and
WHEREAS, in Palcohol is expected to be offered for sale this summer; and
WHEREAS, Lipsmark plans to manufacture Palcohol in two different formulations: an ingestible beverage
formulation and a non-ingestible industrial formulation; and
WHEREAS, Palcohol’s ingestible beverage formulation is freeze-dried powderized alcohol which turns
water into either vodka or rum, or optional flavors including cosmopolitan, mojito and the Powderita- a
powdered margarita; and
WHEREAS, a package of Palcohol weighs only an ounce, can fit into a pocket and in addition to being
mixed with liquids, can be sprinkled onto food, or snorted, which increases the risk of abuse, binge
consumption and concealment; and
WHEREAS, snorting powdered alcohol elevates the risk of alcohol poisoning and is extremely dangerous
because the alcohol is quickly absorbed by the body and results in immediate intoxication; and
WHEREAS, ingestible powdered alcohol has the potential to be a public health nuisance; and
WHEREAS, the portable nature of ingestible powdered alcohol makes it more enticing and easier for
underage drinkers to use discreetly; and
WHEREAS, underage drinking is a significant problem that threatens the health and safety of our youth,
contributes to crime and negatively impacts the entire community; and
WHEREAS, many states, including New York, Alaska, Delaware, Louisiana, South Carolina and Vermont
have already banned ingestible powdered alcohol, and Colorado and Ohio are considering bans; and
WHEREAS, the public health risks and potential for abuse created by ingestible powdered alcohol far
outweigh any value it may have in the marketplace; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, the above recitals are expressly incorporated herein and made
part hereof as though fully set forth herein.
BE IT FURTHUR ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 6, Alcoholic
Liquor, Article II, Division 1, Sec. 6-39 of the Cook County Code of Ordinances is hereby enacted as

AMENDING THE COOK COUNTY ETHICS ORDINANCE TO CLARIFY
THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF ETHICS’S EXISTING POWERS
TO IMPOSE FINES FOR ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS AND TO SUE
TO ENFORCE ITS DETERMINATIONS
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a Home Rule Unit of Government pursuant to the 1970 Illinois
Constitution, Article VII, Section 6; and,
WHEREAS, pursuant to its home rule power, the County of Cook may exercise any power and perform
any function relating to its government and affairs, including the power to regulate for the protection of the
public health, safety, morals and welfare; and,
WHEREAS, in 1993, this Board of Commissioners exercised that home rule power to enact the Cook
County Ethics Ordinance (“Ethics Ordinance”), which is, by its own terms, applicable to the conduct of all
County officials, appointees and employees; and,
WHEREAS, this Board of Commissioners further exercised that home rule power to create the Cook
County Board of Ethics (“Board of Ethics”) to enforce the Cook County Ethics Ordinance; and,
WHEREAS, from time to time, this Board of Commissioners has amended the Ethics Ordinance;

vesting in the Board of Ethics the power to make findings of violations and impose fines; and

Resolution Supporting NACo’s “Stepping Up Initiative” to Reduce the Number of People with Mental
Illnesses in Jails
WHEREAS, counties routinely provide treatment services to the estimated 2 million people with serious
mental illnesses booked into jail each year; and
WHEREAS, prevalence rates of serious mental illnesses in jails are three to six times higher than for the
general population; and
WHEREAS, almost three-quarters of adults with serious mental illnesses in jails have co-occurring
substance use disorders; and
WHEREAS, adults with mental illnesses tend to stay longer in jail and upon release are at a higher risk of
recidivism than people without these disorders; and
WHEREAS, county jails spend two to three times more on adults with mental illnesses that require
interventions compared to those without these treatment needs; and
WHEREAS, without the appropriate treatment and services, people with mental illnesses continue to cycle
through the criminal justice system, often resulting in tragic outcomes for these individuals and their
families; and

Page 187 of 200

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

May 20, 2015

WHEREAS, Cook County and all counties take pride in their responsibility to protect and enhance the
health, welfare and safety of its residents in efficient and cost-effective ways; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has successfully reduced its total jail population by 20% since 2013; and
WHEREAS, Cook County’s ‘County Care’ program has expanded behavioral health services in
communities throughout Cook County, and stakeholders have joined in an effort to enroll jail detainees in
‘County Care’ before they are released; and
WHEREAS, every Cook County Jail detainee with mental health needs is interviewed by a social worker,
before discharge from the jail, in order to arrange for appropriate community-based transitional services
such as medical appointments, counseling, behavioral health services and supportive housing; and
WHEREAS, through the Stepping Up initiative, the National Association of Counties, the Council of State
Governments Justice Center and the American Psychiatric Foundation are encouraging public, private and
nonprofit partners to reduce the number of people with mental illnesses in jails;

Commissioners, do hereby sign on to the Call to Action to reduce the number of people with mental
illnesses in our county jail, commit to sharing lessons learned with other counties in state of Illinois and
across the country to support a national initiative and encourage all county officials, employees and
residents to participate in Stepping Up. We further resolve to:
Continue to convene or draw on a diverse team of leaders and decision makers from multiple
agencies committed to safely reducing the number of people with mental illnesses in jails.
Continue to collect relevant data and use it as baseline information to guide decision making.
Continue to work with all stakeholders to examine treatment and service capabilities in order to
determine which programs and services are available to people with mental illnesses and co-occurring
substance use disorders. As well as identifying state and local policy and funding barriers to minimizing
contact with the justice system and providing treatment and supports in the community.
Implement research-based approaches that advance our goal of reducing the jail population and the
number of mentally ill jail detainees.
Continue to create processes to track progress using data and information systems, and to report on
successes.

census of the population will be taken on the first day of April, 2020, and
WHEREAS, a complete and accurate count of Cook County and Illinois population is essential to the

WHEREAS, the number of Illinois representatives serving in the House of Representatives, and locally
elected officials serving in the State General Assembly, county and local elective positions, are determined

WHEREAS, there are several federal programs benefiting Cook County, and Illinois that use census
enumerations and population numbers as part of their funding formulas, including formulas for education,
health, transportation, and human services programs, and

as they have done in the past, will allocate state funds to carry out a multi-cultural, multi-lingual,
multi-media outreach campaign to increase individual state mail-back response rates, and encourage the
involvement of every resident, and
WHEREAS, in the 2000 and 2010 Censuses, Cook County organized a strong and effective Census
Complete Count Committee to focus the County’s elected officials, faith organizations, and a wide range
of business and community leadership in promotion and support of an accurate and complete count of its
population, and
WHEREAS, over the next three years the Census Bureau will conduct local tests, including potential
operations tests in Cook County in 2016, of new concepts, methods, and procedures for improving public
cooperation for possible use in the next census in 2020, and
WHEREAS, it is vitally important for Cook County, and Illinois to do everything it can to ensure that
every Illinois resident is counted in the upcoming census;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby
urge the Illinois General Assembly to pass legislation to become effective immediately:
1.Authorizing the appropriate funds necessary to carry out a broad, state-wide multi-cultural,
multi-lingual, multi-media outreach campaign to educate, inform, and encourage the cooperation of every
Illinois resident with the 2020 Census, including the authorization of immediate funding to support Census
Bureau conduct of potential testing activities in Cook County during 2016, 2017, and 2018;
2.To authorize the Governor to establish a statewide Complete Count Committee, appointing members,
as he deems necessary who shall serve without compensation and at the pleasure of the Governor;
3. To ensure that the Committee begin its work immediately, to develop, recommend, and assist in the
administration of a census outreach strategy, to participate fully with all preliminary testing conducted
within the state in 2016, 2017, and 2018, of new and different methods and procedures for encouraging
public cooperation for use in the 2020 federal decennial census of population required by Section 141 of
Title 13 of the United States Code.
4.The census outreach strategy shall include, but not be limited to, State agency initiatives to encourage
participation in the 2020 Census, the establishment and support of school-based outreach programs,
partnerships with non-profit community-based organizations, and a multi-lingual, multi-media campaign
designed to ensure an accurate and complete count of Illinois population.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of the Resolution be tendered to the Speaker of the
Illinois House of Representatives and the President of the Illinois Senate.
