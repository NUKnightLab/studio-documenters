RE:

Honorable City Council:

Paragraph #01 Please accept this letter as a request to establish an Obsolete Property
Rehabilitation Development District for the property located at 2550, 2532, and 2536
West Grand Blvd, Detroit MI and fully described on Attachment A.

Paragraph #02 2550 Grand Boulevard, LLC is a limited liability company established
to acquire 25 50, 2532, and 2536 West Grand Blvd, a commercial half occupied building
in order to adaptively redevelop the building into a ?ve?story market rate mixed?use
building in the New Center neighborhood. The project will strengthen the New Center
neighborhood by reusing a functionally obsolete building and make the neighborhood

more attractive to new residents.

 

Paragraph #03b The facility cannot be successfully rudet?ulupctl without the applicant
rec-cit it'll}. an Obsolete l?ropertv Rehabilitation Act Excnu?yt Certificate. A careful
examination of the pro forma will indicate that the project is not economically feasible
without the OPRA. The tax relief is critical in order to proceed with the project in Detroit.
This is a mixed use rehabilitation project and will add an estimated eight to ten jobs to be
provided by the projected retail tenants. The site presently has no full time staff and it
will create new direct full employment jobs. It will add one-hundred-seventeen new
households with their immediate multiplier effect on the neighborhood economy.

Signi?cant capital investment is needed. The entire building, in recent times, has been
used as a church. It will require the full cadre of capital improvements and equipment to
permit a market rate development to operate ef?ciently and to attract the new residents
including new furnaces, HVAC system and one hundred-seventeen apartments. The total

development cost is estimated at $14.646,000.

Paragraph #04 2550 W. Grand Boulevard, will be requesting an exemption for the full
twelve years. At this stage, it is requesting the formation of an OPRA District

Paragraph #05 The economic advantages of the project are signi?cant. It will adaptively
reuse a functionally obsolete building, that is vacant most of the week except for church
services or activities, and pays no taxes. It will be converted into a mixed use
development containing a retail store and market rate multifamily residential community
in a neighborhood outside of downtown Detroit. The combined households will be
bringing over $6 million/year in household income to further expand the viability of the
New Center neighborhood. The additional income will encourage the further
development of commercial businesses which in turn will attract more residents. All
taxes are presently zero since the building operates as a church and in the short term
bring in additional income taxes and in the long term (after the 12-year abatement
period, signi?cantly expand property taxes.

Paragraph #06

We are completely dedicated to the City of Detroit to providing quality mixed income
residential experience while at the same time creating a pro?table venture to the bene?t
of its investors and the city. We propose to dedicate eighteen (18) one-bed room
apartments and ?ve two bed room apartments so they are affordable to households
having a household income at 80% AMI. This will be an excellent public private
partnership where the City is providing the incentives to make the project feasible. It is a
win-win situation. The city earns more taxes and improves the neighborhood to
encourage more investment. Without the incentive the project would not be economically

feasible.

Your prompt attention is appreciated in order that we can start construction as soon as
possible.

Re: Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District - 2550 Grand Boulevard LLC
Address: 2550, 2532 and 2536 West Grand Boulevard
Parcel Numbers: 08001652-7, 08001659. and 08001658.

Dear Mr. Cox:

The Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of the Assessor, has reviewed the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
District located at 2550, 2532 and 2536 West Grand Boulevard in the NW Goldberg area in the City of Detroit.

The rationale for creating Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Districts under PA 146 of 2000, as amended, is based on the
anticipation of increased market value upon completion of new construction and /Or significant rehabilitation of existing
commercial property and commercial housing property. Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not
necessarily generate additional market value.

2550 Grand Boulevard LLC plans to redevelop and expand the building into a five-story mixed-use development
containing approximately 6,100 square feet for a retail store and 117 residential loft units with approximately 60,834 total
square feet and 23 of the units dedicated to affordable house. The two-story building at 2550 West Grand Boulevard is
currently 50% vacant and is being used as a 2 story Of?ce and place of worship, has 35,880 square feet of building area,
built in 1951, and situated on 1.119 acres of land. The other addresses consists of parking lots on a total of .276 acres of
land. Rehabilitation will include adding 3 stories to the building, reconfiguring and new construction of the interior for
residential loft units, new HVAC system and new furnaces.

This property meets the criteria set forth under PA 146 of 2000, as amended. It applies to blighted, functionally obsolete
and contaminated properties. "Rehabilitation," meaning that changes to qualified facilities that are required to restore or
modify the property, together with all appurtenances, to an economically efficient condition. Rehabilitation also includes
major renovation and modi?cation including, but not necessarily limited to, the improvement of floor loads, correction of
deficient or excessive height, new or improved fixed building equipment, including heating, ventilation, and lighting,
reducing multistory facilities to 1 or 2 stories, adding additional stories to a facility or adding additional space on the same
floor level not to exceed 100% of the existing floor space on that floor level, improved structural support including
foundations, improved roof structure and cover, floor replacement, improved wall placement, improved exterior and
interior appearance of buildings, and other physical changes required to restore or change the obsolete property to an
economically efficient condition.

A ?eld investigation indicated that the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District located at 2550, 2532 and 2536
West Grand Boulevard is eligible as it pertains to the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act under PA 146 of 2000, as
amended.

RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Obsolete Property District (PA 146) at 2550, 2532, and 2536 W.
Grand Boulevard
DATE: June 1, 2019
CC: Maurice Cox, Director, Planning and Development

Kevin Schronce, Central Region, Planning and Development

In order to ensure that the creation of an Obsolete Property District is in conformance with the City?s
Master Plan of Policies and will have the reasonable likelihood to increase commercial activity; create,
retain or prevent a loss of employment; revitalize an urban area; or increase the number of residents in
a community, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public Act 146 of 2000 (section 125.2788), the Planning and
Development Department submits the following interpretation. The Petitioner Ofthis project is the
2550 W. Grand Boulevard, LLC.

Location and Project Proposal: 2550, 2532, 2536 W. Grand Boulevard; Project seeks adaptively redevelop
a half-occupied commercial building into a five-story market rate mixed-use building in the New Center
neighborhood. Project is proposing to dedicate a portion of residential units as affordable at 80% Of the
Area Media Income (18 one-bedroom apartments and 5 two-bedroom apartments).

Master Plan Interpretation:

The subject site area is designated Mixed Residential-Commercial (MRC). Mixed Residential-
Commercial areas consist primarily of high density housing developed compatibly with commercial
and/or institutional uses. This classification is well suited to areas proximal to existing centers of major
commercial activity, major thoroughfares, transportation nodes, or gateways into the city.

The following Master Plan goals and/or policies Of the Rosa Parks neighborhood describe the following

recommendations to support/advise project:
I Policy 3.1 Redevelop West Grand Boulevard with mixed-use development including high

density residential

I Policy 5.2 Encourage high?density, mixed-use development along West Grand Boulevard

I Policy 7.1 Promote design guidelines for facade, streetscape, and landscape improvements
along West Grand Boulevard, Grand River, and Linwood

I Policy 9.1 Incorporate streetscape, landscape and signage improvements along West Grand
Boulevard

The proposed development conforms to the Future General Land Use characteristics of the
area.

?Property?).

The City intends to convey the Property to Banyan Investments, LLC, which has indicated
that it or its af?liate(s) intend to complete a partial rehabilitation and redevelopment of the Property
which is composed of three adjoining three and four-story buildings. Located in Detroit?s
Rivertown neighborhood east of downtown, the three buildings have been vacant for
approximately twenty years. Previous uses have included a variety of residential, industrial, and
retail purposes, most notably Stone Soap Company, Inc., from which the proposed development
gained the Stone Soap name. The project entails the demolition of the two eastern buildings (1460
and 1490 Franklin Street) and the retention of a wall of the third building (1450 Franklin Street).
When completed, the multistory building will function as residential and commercial space,
totaling approximately 132,000 square feet. The Stone Soap Development will feature commercial
spaces on the ?rst and second floors of the building, which include a theater, wine bar, market,
and of?ce space. The total of?ce, commercial, and theater space will occupy approximately 23,000

square feet.

Due to the substantial costs required to rehabilitate and redevelop the Property, the
proposed owner has indicated an intention to also seek the issuance of a Neighborhood Enterprise
Zone certi?cate, pursuant to PA 147 of 1992, for the residential component of the project. The
City requests the establishment of a Commercial Redevelopment District pursuant to Public Act
255 to support the rehabilitation of the commercial portions of the project.

Please see Exhibit A for the tax parcels, addresses and proposed district legal description
and Exhibit for a depiction of the proposed district.

RE: Commercial Redevelopment District City of Detroit
Property Address: 1450, 1460 and 1490 Franklin Street
Parcels Number: 07000027., 07000026. And 07000025.

Dear Ms. TrudeaU'

The Of?ce of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of the Assessor, has reviewed the proposed Commercial
Redevelopment District for the property located at 1450, 1460 and 1490 Franklin Street in East Riverfront area of
the City of Detroit.

The rationale for creating Commercial Redevelopment Districts under PA 255 of 1978, as amended, is based on the
anticipation of increased market value upon completion of new construction and/or significant restoration of
commercial and former industrial property where the primary purpose and use of which is the operation of a
commercial business enterprise and shall include office, engineering, research and development, warehousing parts
distribution, retail sales, hotel or motel development, and other commercial facilities. Commercial business
enterprise also includes a business that owns or operates a transit-oriented development or a transit?oriented
facility. Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not necessarily generate additional market value.

The district as proposed by City of Detroit consists of the vacant former Stone Soap warehouse buildings with
previous uses as a variety of residential, industrial and retail purposes are in very poor condition and have a 3 story
building with 40,992 square feet built in 1927 and a 2 and 4 story building with a total of32,644 square feet built in
1907. The district request also includes a parking lot at 1450 Franklin The total acreage of the combined
properties is .656 acres. The owner proposes to convey the property to Banyan Investments LLC to complete a
partial rehabilitation and redevelopment by demolishing the buildings except for one wall of the next to 1450
Franklin Street and redeveloping the site into a multi-story building with residential and commercial space totaling
approximately 132,000 square feet. The first and second floors of the building will include a theater, wine bar,
market and office Space totaling approximately 23,000 square feet. The building is impaired clue the property has
suffered from decay and neglect.

This area meets the criteria set forth under PA 255 of 1978, as amended. It applies to functionally obsolete
properties requiring restoration meaning changes to obsolete commercial property other than replacement as may
be required to restore the property, together with all appurtenances, to an economically efficient condition.

A field investigation and district request review indicated that the proposed Commercial Redevelopment District
located at 1450, 1460 and 1490 Franklin Street is eligible as it pertains to the Commercial Redevelopment Act under
P.A. 255 of 1978, as amended.

RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Commercial Redevelopment District (PA 255) for 1450, 1460,
and 1490 Franklin Street. [Associated to Petition #1122]

DATE: October 25, 2019

CC: Katherine Trudeau, Deputy Director, Planning and Development

Kevin Schronce, PDD Central, Planning and Development

in order to ensure consistency with the City's Master Plan of Policies, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public
Act 255 of 1978 (section 207.655), the Planning and Development Department?s Planning Division submits
the following interpretation for the proposed establishment of a Commercial Redevelopment District.
The petitioner is the City of Detroit Planning and Development Department

Location and Project Proposal: The City intends to convey the property to Banyan Investments, LLC to
complete a partial rehabilitation and redevelopment of the property. The subject site seeks to function
as a residential and commercial space, totaling approximately 132,000 square feet. It will feature
commercial spaces on the first and second floors of the building, which include a theater, wine bar,
market, and office space. The total office, commercial, and theater space will occupy approximately
23,000 square feet.

Master Plan Interpretation

The subject site area is designated Mixed Residential-Commercial (MRC). Mixed Residential-
Commercial areas consist primarily of high density housing developed compatibly with commercial
and/or institutional uses. This classification is well suited to areas proximal to existing centers of major
commercial activity, major thoroughfares, transportation nodes, or gateways into the city.

The following policies of the Near East Riverfront neighborhood describe the following
recommendations:
I Policy 1.1: Develop the riverfront as a mixture of high density residential and commercial uses
preserving view and public access to open space along the riverfront
- Policy 2.1: Throughout the area, encourage the conversion of obsolete industrial buildings into
residential lofts
I Policy 4.1: Develop neighborhood commercial nodes south ofJefferson with a mix of locally
serving, small-scale businesses, entertainment related development, service establishments,
and civic space
Policy 9.1: Site design must demonstrate special regard for visual corridors/vistas and
easements offering access to the river and the Central Business District

The proposed development conforms to the Future General Land Use characteristics of the
area.

District "at 5918 St. Antoine Street (also identified as 603 East Edsel Ford Drive),

Detroit, Michigan 48202 for 603 Edsel Ford, LLC

Honorable City Council:

Please accept this letter as a request to establish an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District
(OPRD) for the property located at 5918 St. Antoine Street (603 East Edsel Ford Drive), Detroit,
Michigan 48202. which is referred to herein as the "Property" and described on Attachment A.
The Property will be rehabilitated by the petitioner and current owner. 603 Edsel Ford. LLC.

Company and Project Synopsis

603 Edsel Ford, LLC (the "Developer") was founded in 2017. Michael Rivait, Managing Partner
of 603 Edsel Ford, LLC and owner of Rivait Design Build Group (the general contractor 
has been investing in southeast Michigan since 1985 and is well-versed in real estate, building
and contracting, and development. In nearly 35 years, Rivait Design Build has built over 200
energy ef?cient homes and residential projects, before espanding to include additional
construction and development or senior living condos and apartment buildings. With
demonstrated experience in building and rehabilitating residential properties in southeast
Michigan, the Developer is poised to successfully rehabilitate this historic building.

The proposed OPRD contains two parcels totaling approximately 0.326 acres and is located at
5918 St. Antoine Street (alternately identi?ed as 603 East Edsel Ford Drive). The proposed
OPRD is bounded by Hastings Street to the north, the property line to the east, East Edsel Ford
Drive to the south, and St. Antoine Street to the west. The OPRD is located in the North
Midtown neighborhood of Detroit with the Q-Iine located approximately one-half mile to the
southwest to provide transportation alternatives. The property is occupied by a three-story
residential apartment building plus a basement garden level constructed in 1912. The total
building area is 21,120 square feet, including 16,675 in rentable square feet. The building is
currently uninhabitable, with roof leaks, no windows, and no operating utilities.

The proposed OPRD will entail the rehabilitation of the current building into 24 residential
apartment units. Each unit will include modern ?oorplans and ?nishes.

As part of the rehabilitation, the building will be gutted to receive new utilities including electrical
and plumbing, new energy efficient heating, cooling and ventilation systems, new energy

efficient windows and doors. kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, appliances, and fixtures. and
repairs to the building structure as needed. The structure will be brought up to current code as

applicable.
The Necessity for Tax Relief

Substantial investment is necessary to rehabilitate the area into a viable, long-term
development. Additionally. the property currently contains a dilapidated and deteriorating
building that will require repair and selective demolition with the property rehabilitation. The
overall internal rate of return for the proposed development will be extremely low without the
receipt of the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District (and Certi?cate), and therefore. the
development would not be possible without it.

The costs associated with the rehabilitation require multiple capital sources including equity
contributed by 603 Edsel Ford, LLC members, as well as an interim construction loan. and upon
completion. a long-term loan product In order to secure this ?nancing and future tenants, the
operating costs of the proposed renovations and redevelopment of the project need to be kept

as low as possible {including property taxes).

The prOposed Development included within the request will result in approximately 100
construction jobs and one full-time equivalent (FTE) job associated with the ongoing
management and maintenance for the proposed residential development.

PA 146 Request
A 12-year abatement is being requested.
Economic Advantages of the Rehabilitation

Upon completion. the Development will return an obsolete property to productive use and will
increase residential density in an area characterized by vacant land and disinvestment.
Activation of this property will spur further growth and act as a catalyst for future redevelopment
of numerous vacant and blighted properties along the St Antoine Street and Harper Avenue
corridors. and the surrounding neighborhoods and provide spinc? consumer spending in an
area of Midtown and New Center that is currently left out of redevelopment planning.

The granting of the OPRA tax abatement will not result in any fewer taxes to the City of Detroit
in the short?term or long-term. On a short-term basis approximately 100 construction jobs will be
created. Rivait Design Build Group (the GC) is experienced and has lined-up Detroit-based
contractors through their years of experience. In addition. the Developer has reached out to the
Skilled Trades Taskforce in order to ensure Detroit-based contractors bene?t from the

development.

Upon successful redevelopment, the proposed redevelopment associated with the Development
will create approximately one full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs related to the management and
maintenance of the property. This new job. along with the new residents living at the
development. will generate increased income taxes for the City of Detroit.

Following expiration of the 12-year abatement the building will deliver a significant increase in
tax revenue. Over time, the successful redevelopment and cultural growth will have a city-wide

impact.
Closing

603 Edsel Ford, LLC is a compassionate group of professionals with a proven track record and
experience in multi-family investments in Southeast Michigan and the City of Detroit.

Members of the Development team have reached out to Midtown members of the Midtown
community, and neighboring property owners regarding the new ownership and anticipated
improvements and garnered signi?cantly positive feedback.

The team is looking forward to pursuing this redevelopment and creating a community space on
the outskirts of Detroit?s Midtown Neighborhood.

Respectfully Submitted.

and plumbing, new energy efficient heating, cooling and ventilation systems, new energy efficient
windows and doors, kitchen and bathroom cabinetry. appliances, and fixtures, and repairs to the
building structure as needed. The structure will also be brought up to code per applicable code

requirements.

Attachment A
Page 3 of 5

Time Schedule

Construction activities are anticipated to commence in the spring of 2019. Construction
completion is anticipated for late in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Statement of Economic Advantages

The proposed Development will bring needed investment to a vacant area of Midtown Detroit
The Development will increase residential density in the blocks of Midtown and New Center that
are characterized by vacancy and have the perception of being unsafe. Activation of this property
will spur further growth and infill development, and act as a catalyst for future redevelopment of
numerous vacant and blighted properties along the St. Antoine and Harper Avenue corridors, and
the surrounding neighborhoods and provide spinoff consumer spending in Midtown and New

Center.

The granting of the tax abatement will not result in any fewer taxes to the City of Detroit in the
short?term or long-term. Upon successful redevelopment. the Development will generate
increased income taxes, through the new jobs and residents that the project will create.

On a short-term basis approximately 100 construction jobs will be created. Rivait Design Build
Group (the general contractor has experience and contacts to hire Detroit?based
subcontractors and have reached out to the Skilled Trades Taskforce in order to ensure Detroit"

based contractors benefit from the development.

On a tong?term basis the proposed redevelopment associated with the District will create
approximately one full?time equivalent (FTE) job and house approximately 58 new Detroit
residents. Therefore. it is anticipated the City of Detroit will collect approximately 2.4% income
tax per resident per year. The table below illustrates the resident tax impact the development will

have following completion.

Additionally, there will be other indirect benefits such as spin off spending in the City that will
contribute to the economic benefits produced by this investment. It will further help meet the
demand for housing in Detroit, with a reported 2.6% vacancy rate across metro Detroit (Crain?s,
5/13/17) and a demand for residential units in Midtown and the surrounding areas that Increases
faster than the supply of new units (The Detroit News. 8i24i1T). Investments in the community
such as this that will have long-term effects and provide sustainable principals will retain and
foster local talent that is vital to securing the City?s economic future.

1. What is the plan for hiring Detroiters?

The developer has been rehabbing properties in the City of Detroit for the last 3 years and I have met many Detroit resident workers

and skilled trades that I will be hiring to complete this project. In addition, the development team has reached out to the Skilled Trades
Taskforce to ensure Detroit workers bene?t from the project.

2. Please give a detailed description of the jobs available as listed in the above chart, i.e: job type, job quali?cations, etc.

It is anticipated that 1 full?time equivalent (FTE) permanent jobs associated with the management and maintenance aspects of the
proposed development.

The developer will be hiring skilled and non?skilled labor for all of the rehab and construction which would include roofers, framers,

electricians, plumbers, heating, window installation, insulators, drywallers, painters, finish carpenters, cabinets installers, ?ooring,
clean up, security.

3. Will this development cause any relocation that will create new Detroit residents?

No, the building is not habitable, however there was a homeless veteran, Mike, that was living in the building at the time of purchase.
Mike was not receiving his bene?ts because of all the paper work, etc. that made it very dif?cult for him to get his business in order. The
development team was able to ?nd him a senior home in Oxford that dealt with his type of circumstance. When offered this solution,
Mike was very apprehensive about leaving the building - he wanted to stay there to try and help. The developer ?nally convinced him to
move to this new environment and that he needed to have a warm bed, running water and electricity. He was very thin in need of new
dentures and hygiene. It has been a year now and he is now doing great! The developer was able to help get his ?nances in place with

Veteran?s Affairs, Mike has put on some weight, and he has new dentures ordered and on the way. The developer does keep in touch
with Mike, and he has always been thankful for the help provided to him.

4. Has the developer reached out to any community groups to discuss the project and/or any potential jobs?

Midtown Detroit, lnc. has noted significant disinvestment of this area of the neighborhood and is very supportive of the project plans to
bring new housing units to Midtown as is aims to jump-start new investment for this neighborhood.

The developer has reached out to the of?ce of Ms. Mary Shef?eld, their local Council Member for District 5, to discuss the project plans
and obtain support forthe project.

5. When is construction slated to begin?
Late spring of 2019.

6. What is the expected completion date of construction?
December of 2019.

RE: 603 Edsel Ford

Dear Ms. Pavelko,

On behalf of Midtown Detroit, Inc. (MDI), I would like to express our support for the proposed
redevelopment of the apartment building located at 603 Edsel Ford.

This project will rehabilitate an apartment building, originally built in 1912. This brick building is
structurally sound but will require a full renovation, including a new roof, windows, and
mechanicals for the building. Once completed, this renovation will add 24 new units with
hardwood floors, tiled bathrooms, custom cabinets, granite countertops, and other high?end
finishes. The addition of these units will provide more rental options for a neighborhood facing

98% occupancy.

MDI understands that the developer is pursuing an OPRA tax exemption for this project. This
OPRA will provide valuable financial assistance to support the completion of a project, which will
be a much-needed benefit to the surrounding neighborhood. The new affordable units being
provided close to a major bus and streetcar line will also add additional benefit.

The overall reactivation of this site will build upon revitalization efforts taking place in the
Midtown and New Center neighborhoods and will continue to push the City of Detroit forward.
It is for this reason that is pleased to offer its full support for this project. Should you have
any questions, please feel free to contact me at 313.420.6000.

Sincerely,

94.1.7544??

RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Obsolete Property District (PA 146) at 5918 St. Antoine
DATE: June 1, 2019

CC: Maurice Cox, Director, Planning and Development

Kevin Schronce, Central Region, Planning and Development

In order to ensure that the creation of an Obsolete Property District is in conformance with the City?s
Master Plan of Policies and will haVe the reasonable likelihood to increase commercial activity; create,
retain or prevent a loss of employment; revitalize an urban area; or increase the number of residents in
a community, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public Act 146 of 2000 (section 125.2788), the Planning and
Development Department submits the following interpretation. The Petitioner of this project is 603

Edsel Ford LLC.

Location and Project Proposal: 5918 St. Antoine; The subject site is currently occupied by a three-story
residential apartment building plus a basement garden level constructed in 1912. The proposed project
seek to rehabilitate the current building into 24 residential apartment units to be upgraded with modern
floor plans and finishes. The project will include approximately 16,675 square feet of living spaces, divided
into 7 one-bedroom units and 17 two-bedroom units. A minimum of 20% ofthe unit (2 one-bedroom units
and 3 two-bedrooms) will be priced to meet affordable unit requirements for 80% of the Area Median

income (AMI).

Master Plan Interpretation:
The subject site area is designated Mixed Residential - Industrial (MRI). Mixed Residential Industrial

areas offer live-work opportunities for artists and trades people to create a lively mixture of residential,
commercial, light industrial and/or entertainment opportunities. This designation is eSpecially
appropriate for historically industrial areas that may be suited to loft conversion.

The following Master Plan goals and/or policies of the Middle Woodward neighborhood describe the
following recommendations to support/advise project:

Goal 3 Increase residential density
The subject site is currently zoned M3 and this zoning district does not permit residential land-uses as a
matter of right. Residential units are only permitted as a conditional land use if it is a loft-conversion or a
residential use combined in structure with permitted commercial uses. A rezoning may be necessary,
with that said, the proposed use does conform to the Master Plan in that it will rehabilitate an existing
residential structure and strengthen availability of residential opportunities in the area.

The proposed development conforms to the Future General Land Use characteristics of the
area.

Re: Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District 603 Edsel Ford LLC
Property Address: 5918 St. Antoine Street (aka 603 East Edsel Ford Drive)
Parcel Number: 03001687.

Dear Mr. Cox:

The Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office ofthe Assessor, has reviewed the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
District located at 5918 St. Antoine Street in the Milwaukee Junction area in the City of Detroit.

The rationale for creating Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Districts under PA 146 of 2000, as amended, is based on the
anticipation of increased market value upon completion of new construction and /or significant rehabilitation of existing
commercial property and commercial housing property. Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not
necessarily generate additional market value.

603 Edsel Ford LLC plans to rehabilitate the three-story, 15,053 square foot, apartment building with a garden level
basement built in 1912 on .198 acres of land located at 5918 St. Antoine. The building is currently uninhabitable with roof
leaks, no windows and no Operating utilities. Rehabilitation will include gutting the building, new windows, new roof, new
mechanical, plumbing and electrical systems, and energy efficient heating, cooling and ventilation systems along with new
apartment fixtures for 24 residential units.

This property meets the criteria set forth under PA 146 of 2000, as amended. It applies to blighted, functionally obsolete
and contaminated properties. "Rehabilitation," meaning that changes to qualified facilities that are required to restore or
modify the property, together with all appurtenances, to an economically efficient condition. Rehabilitation also includes
deficient, or excessive height, new or improved fixed building equipment, including heating, ventilation, and lighting,
reduci'r'iE'multistory facilities to 1 or 2 stories, adding additional stories to a facility or adding additional space on the same
floor level not to exceed 100% of the existing floor space on that floor level, improved structural support including
foundations, improved roof structure and cover, floor replacement, improved wall placement, improved exterior and
interior appearance of buildings, and other physical changes required to restore or change the obsolete property to an
economically efficient condition.

A field investigation indicated that the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District located at 5913 St. Antoine Street
is eligible as it pertains to the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act under P.A.146 of 2000, as amended.
