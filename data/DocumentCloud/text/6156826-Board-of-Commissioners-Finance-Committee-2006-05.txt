action litigation was originally brought in 1999 and was subsequently resolved
by the entry of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the parties that
was approved by the District Court in December 2002. Plaintiffs, represented
by the Roger Baldwin Foundation of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU),
filed a Petition to Enforce Memorandum Agreement on November 8, 2005.
Counsel for the parties have reached a proposed resolution to the pending
Petition that involves the entry of an "Agreed Supplemental Order" (ASO) by
the Court. The proposed agreement does not require Cook County to transfer
settlement funds to the plaintiffs' class as part of this resolution . Rather, Cook
County will be required to reimburse the Monitors' Designees and the
Compliance Administrator with reasonable compensation and their reasonable
and necessary expenses incurred in the course of their work pursuant to the
ASO (Paragraph 14). Accordingly, we request authority to permit the entry of
the Agreed Supplemental Order by the District Court. This request was
approved by the Finance Committee's Subcommittee on Litigation at its
meeting of May 2, 2006.

HARRIS & HARRIS (PROPOSED CONTRACT) FOR COLLECTION
SERVICES FOR DELINQUENT TRAFFIC FINES AND FEES . Transmitting a
Communication, dated November 17, 2005 from Dorothy Brown, Clerk of the
Circuit Court:
I am writing to inform you of an initiative for which I would appreciate your
consideration and support at the December 6, 2005 Board Meeting.
Specifically, I would like to request authorization from the Cook County Board
of Commissioners for the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court and the Office
of the State's Attorney to engage the firm of Harris & Harris for a two year
period to perform accounts receivable collection services for delinquent fines
and fees due and owing to the Clerk's Office. The goals of this initiative are to
collect as much revenue as possible and to bring past due accounts that are
deemed uncollectible by an independent qualified firm to closure.
The collection services provided by Harris & Harris will be performed on a
competitive basis with no cost to Cook County. All fees associated with the
collection of a past due fine or fee will be added in addition to the fine or fee
amount as permitted by Illinois Public Act 093-0836, which became law in
2004.

 FINANCE AGENDA

MAY 16, 2006

The scope of the collection services that Harris & Harris would be engaged to
perform would concentrate solely on past due Traffic fines and fees.
The horizon of time that will be addressed for the collection of past due fines
and fees will span in excess of ten (10) years.
Established in 1968, Harris & Harris has the resources necessary to perform
collection services for a court system the size of the Circuit Court of Cook
County efficiently and effectively, using state-of-the art technology as well as
industry standard collection procedures. The decision to select Harris & Harris
for this engagement was predicated on a due diligence review performed by
the Clerk of the Circuit Court of several firms who presented their services for
consideration.
