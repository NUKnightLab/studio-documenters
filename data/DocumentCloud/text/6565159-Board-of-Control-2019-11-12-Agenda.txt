Council members’ advance questions; asked for confirmation that the total expense of $96,000.00 is to
only cover the 2 remaining months of 2019; and asked if the cost for 2020 is disproportionate to the fuel
costs of 2019 due to the addition of the Harvard Road facility. Lenora Lockett asked if there are fuel tanks

lease of office space and aircraft tie-down fees located at the Cuyahoga County Airport Safety Building,
Area B Suites G-L, 26300 Curtiss Wright Parkway, Highland Heights for the period 1/1/2017 – 12/31/2019
to extend the time period to 6/30/2022, to expand the scope of the lease to include Suite F and for
additional funds in the amount not-to-exceed $43,732.50 $48,532.50.
Funding Source: Revenue Generating
John Meyers, Department of Public Works, presented. Trevor McAleer asked for clarification on the
amount of additional funds as the department’s briefing materials conflicts with the amount shown on
the agenda. Andria Richardson, Clerk of the Board of Control stated that the amendment to the agreement
only included the amount for the rent for the extended term and did not itemize the $4,800.00 for tiedown fees, as referenced in the department’s briefing materials. Trevor McAleer asked Ms. Richardson
for confirmation that the agreement contained the incorrect amount; stated that the total cost should be
itemized to include tie down fees in the agreement and not just in the OnBase request, as Mr. Meyers had
indicated; and asked if the document can be changed to include the additional expense. Nan Baker asked
why the extension of time did not run through December, 2022. Michael Dever motioned to amend the
agenda; Trevor McAleer seconded. Lisa Rocco motioned to approve the item; Michael Dever seconded.
Item BC2019-794 was unanimously approved, as amended.

b) Recommending a payment in the amount of $50,000.00 to Global Cleveland for operational support
for the period 11/4/2019 – 12/31/2019.
Funding Source: General Fund
Paul Herdeg, Department of Development and Mark Griffin, Office of the Inspector General, presented.
Nan Baker asked about the concerns of the Office of the Inspector General, which resulted in this request
not being submitted sooner as the funding may have proven more beneficial earlier in the year; and asked
if the funding request for 2020 will be submitted earlier in the year. Trevor McAleer asked if using federal
funds by any vendor is a reason for the County to debar. Michael Dever motioned to approve the item;
Dale Miller seconded. Item BC2019-796 was unanimously approved.

MOU AGREEMENTS WITH PUBLIC SECTOR PARTNERS FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE LAB @ CUYAHOGA
COUNTY (ADDITIONAL AGREEMENT)
In 2019 the Office of Innovation and Performance will launch a new program, The Lab @ Cuyahoga County
(The Lab), to connect local entrepreneurs and businesses with public sector partners to test new ideas,
products, or services in a real-world environment for 12 to 16 weeks. Transforming Cuyahoga County into
a living lab for the latest innovations, The Lab provides local entrepreneurs and businesses with the subject
matter expertise, data, and customer feedback needed to make the jump from product ideation and
validation to product launch. The Lab will be offered to businesses and entrepreneurs located in the five
county region outlined by Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency (Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake,
Lorain, Medina), with Cuyahoga County as a preferred location.
To expand the reach and impact of The Lab, the Office of Innovation and Performance invited other public
sector agencies to participate. This item brings forth an Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) with the
following public sector partner for participation in The Lab's inaugural cohort for approval and County
signature:
1)
Cuyahoga County Public Library
The MOU is used to set expectations and ensure communication and coordination between the County
and the public sector partners for The Lab. It outlines the responsibilities of each party, the term of the
agreement, how to terminate the MOU, and what partner organizations need to know regarding use of
products or services as part of The Lab. MOUs were developed in partnership with the Law Department
to allow for other public sector agencies to join Cuyahoga County in participating in The Lab. Through
these MOUs additional test environments and subject matter expertise will be made available to local
entrepreneurs and business, expanding the reach and impact of The Lab and allowing the program to
support a diverse cohort.
The success of an entrepreneur or business isn’t based on an idea alone. Access to mentoring, capital, and
customers is essential for entrepreneurs and businesses to overcome the barriers to entry that exist in
any market. The Lab will support the growth of the local economy by creating a test-bed environment for
local entrepreneurs and businesses to gain real-world feedback on their idea, product or service before
launch.
