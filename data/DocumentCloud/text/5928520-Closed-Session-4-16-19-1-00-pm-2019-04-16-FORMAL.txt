April 2, 20 18

To: The Honorable Detroit City Council:
Subject: Law Administration and Operation Appropriation #00527 Increase

The Law department respectfully requests authorization to increase their fiscal year 2018-19
budget expenditures by 500,000 for procuring unbudgeted outside legal services for defending the
City of Detroit in various legal matters. Pursuant to the number and complexity of recent lawsuit
filings against the City of Detroit, the Law Department is in need of additional funding for outside
legal services for defending the City of Detroit.

The law department continues to keep as many cases as possible in?house, including four
wrongful incarceration cases, many complex commercial claims including putative class actions,
many recently filed labor and employment cases, many high exposure personal injury cases, all first
and third party auto cases (in the hundreds), etc. The law department secures outside counsel only
as absolutely necessary to best protect the City?s interests. Those cases include several wrongful
incarceration cases, multiple civil rights claims arising from alleged wrongful raids by former
members of the DPD narcotics? unit, an inverse condemnation case involving property near the City
airport, and numerous towing related cases arising from the improper issuance of ?tow permits? in
2016. The City also is obliged to engage outside counsel for several DPD officers and other City
employees due to a legal con?ict of interest that prevents the Law Department from representing
them.

To offset the expenditure appropriation increase in the Law Administration appropriation, a
decrease in the Central Data Processing appropriation expenditure budget for the same amount
in appropriation 00024.

I am requesting approval from your Honorable Body to adopt the enclosed resolution. If you
have any questions or concerns regarding this matter, please feel free to contact me at (313) 237-5037.

A Waiver of reconsideration is requested.

HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: TONYA MONIQUE JOHNSON CITY OF DETROIT and BONITA STONE
CASE NO.: 18?006594 NF
FILE NO.: (CB)

On March 18, 2019, a case evaluation panel evaluated the above-captioned lawsuit and awarded
FIFTY-NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS in favor of Plaintiff. The parties have
until April 15, 2019, to either accept or reject the case evaluation. Failure to ?le a written
acceptance or rejection within this period constitutes a rejection.

Based upon our review of the facts and particulars of this lawsuit, which are set forth in a
confidential memorandum that is being separately hand-delivered to each member of Your
Honorable Body, it is our considered opinion that acceptance of the case evaluation award is in
the best interest of the City of Detroit.

We, therefore, request Your Honorable Body to authorize acceptance of the case evaluation
award; and, in the event that Plaintiff accepts the award, to deem such acceptance as a settlement
and to direct the Finance Director to issue a draft in the amount of FIFTY-NINE THOUSAND
DOLLARS payable to CANNER LAW PLLC., her attorneys, and TONYA
MONIQUE JOHNSON, to be delivered upon receipt of properly executed Releases and
Stipulation and Order of Dismissal entered in Lawsuit No. 18-006594 NF, approved by the Law

Department.
