GENERAL BACKGROUND
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable Chicago
Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.
In 2005, the Chicago Housing Authority (“CHA”) issued a solicitation for the provision of a
comprehensive electronic document management system under RFS 06-01449. The Chicago Housing
Authority selected Clarity Partners, LLC to provide an Enterprise Document Management System
(“EDMS”) using a commercial software system solution, known as FileNet. FileNet is a leading provider
of business process and content management solutions.
Clarity Partners configured and implemented the FileNet system at CHA, which consisted of the business
process management, a central document repository, system documentation and related training.
Additionally, the implementing vendor provided configuration services for the data capture solution
Quillix/MuWave and post- production support. In October 2006 IBM Corporation acquired FileNet
Corporation and integrated the business process management and document management solution into
IBM’s service offerings.
The CHA utilizes the EDMS / FileNet application extensively in our daily operations. EDMS supports
departments such as Housing Choice Voucher, Finance, Development Management and Resident Services
by providing the ability to store, maintain, retrieve and archive electronic records. To date over 7 million
documents are stored in the CHA’s EDMS repository.
Prudent business practices dictate having maintenance agreements in place with the system’s developer in
order to obtain preventative and remedial maintenance. Maintenance support typically consists of
software upgrades, bug fixes and remote telephonic and electronic support. Having a maintenance
agreement in effect decreases the risks of potentially adverse impact from a system outage by reducing
restoration time and increasing system availability.
The EVP of Finance concurs with the recommendation to enter into a one (1) year extension of the
Software Support Agreement with IBM for FileNet maintenance and support services, on a fixed rate
basis and schedule, for compensation not to exceed, $117,551.94 for the one year term.
The CEO/President recommends the approval to enter into a one (1) year extension of the Software
Support Agreement with IBM for FileNet maintenance and support services, on a fixed rate basis and
schedule, for compensation not to exceed $117,551.94 for the one year term.
