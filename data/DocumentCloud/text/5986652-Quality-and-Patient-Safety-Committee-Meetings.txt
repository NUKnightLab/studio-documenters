requested a chart reflecting the positions within the Department of Professional Education and related

information on the breakdown and how the organization compares to comparably sized institutions with

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Strategic Planning Discussion (continued)
During the review of the information, Director Richardson-Lowry requested that a map be provided that
includes a clear legend that reflects where CCH clinics and Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)
are located, and include the categories of services provided by CCH clinics versus the FQHCs. This will
help the Board as they think strategically about where to move or not, and where there might be synergy
or not. It will also inform their thinking with respect to marketing strategies, as well as any potentials
around mergers and forecasting.
Additionally, Director Richardson-Lowry stated that, with respect to the nomenclature relating to the
maternal infant mortality rate, particularly amongst African Americans, the term “project,” was used.
Project by definition has a start and an end. In an earlier conversation, Chair Gugenheim noted that, by
having the mentality of it being a project, the organization did not get to the point where the systemic
issues were addressed.
As the organization moves towards addressing the systemic issues and
maximizing the opportunities, she requested that the term “project” not be used.
With regard to slide 34 of the presentation, in the category of Opportunities within the SWOT Analysis,
Director Richardson-Lowry requested that the word “maternal” be included with the bullet on prenatal
and pediatric patient base.
Director Driscoll, seconded by Director Koetting, moved to approve the
proposed clinical training affiliation agreements. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

Director Koetting, seconded by Director Richardson-Lowry, moved to recess
the open meeting and convene into a closed meeting, pursuant to the following
exceptions to the Illinois Open Meetings Act: 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(1), regarding
“the appointment, employment, compensation, discipline, performance, or

Invest In Resources:
Recruit, hire and retain the
best employees who are
committed to the CCH
mission

Develop and administer post-match survey to be sent to all local
students that rotated here-to determine what factors led to
choosing another program over CCH.

Complete

Identify clinical areas of need (positions unfilled/positions not
filled with superior clinical faculty).

In Progress

Implement institutional exit interviews to include questions about
why graduate chooses to leave.

Complete

Annually review alignment of program's educational goals with
those of the institution and identify opportunities to improve
alignment.

In Progress

Develop a metric that measures success of retaining superior

 History of Medical Training in the U.S.
Learning By Doing (Service >Education)
• 1765 - 1st Med School
• 1876 - Association of American Medical Colleges

• 1910- Flexner Report
• 1920’s-Internship and Residency following Med School became standard
• 1965 – Medicare Established: payments to hospitals to subsidize resident education
• 1996 – Medicare Caps Residency Slots
• 1999 – To Err Is Human
• 2002 – ACGME institutes duty hour regulations (80 hours per week, 30 hour call, one day off per
week)
• 2014 – ACGME establishes the CLER Program

 Moving Away From A Service-Based Residency Model
Generally Accepted Benefits of Residencies/Fellowships
• Still facilitate a cost effective model of 24/7 care of acutely ill patients
• Are associated with safer care and better outcomes1

• Help to attract attending physicians
• Provide valuable feedback that can improve hospital performance
• Improve physician hiring decisions (when familiar with graduate’s skills)
• Reduce recruiting costs
• Improve retention of newly hired attending physicians

 Recruit Outstanding Medical Students
International Vs. American Medical Graduates?
There are not enough American Medical Graduates (AMGs) to Fill All of the Residency Slots in the US
(12,500 of 30,000 1st Year slots filled by IMGs)

• ~25% of All Residents and ~30% of Fellows in the US are International Medical Graduates (IMGs)
• IMGs pass boards at nearly the same rate as AMGs
• ~25% of all practicing physicians in the US are IMGs including1:
• 40% of Primary Care Physicians
• >50% of those practicing Geriatric Care
• 2/3 of all physicians practicing in Non-Urban Medically Underserved Areas
