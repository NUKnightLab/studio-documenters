(Alderman Matthew O’Shea)

Larry Shure presented the staff’s recommendation that the Commission preliminarily find
that: (a) pursuant to Article III, Section G.1. of the Rules and Regulations of the
Commission on Chicago Landmarks (the "Rules and Regulations"), that the significant
historical or architectural features are all exterior elevations and rooflines; (b)
Preliminarily find that the subject building, a 2-story frame house constructed in 1916,
contributes to the character of the Longwood Drive District, which includes spacious lots
with large homes built in a wide variety of architectural styles during the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries, many of which were designed by prominent architects; (c)
Preliminarily find that the demolition of a contributing building or structure within a
landmark district is a per se adverse effect on the significant historical and architectural
features, pursuant to Article III, Section G.3.b., of the Rules and Regulations; (d)
Pursuant to Section 2-120-780 of the Landmarks Ordinance, preliminarily find that the
demolition of the subject property will adversely affect and destroy significant historical
and architectural features of the property and the district; and, (e) Issue a preliminary
decision disapproving the demolition application.
The owners of the building, Sanaa Hachem and David McClain, and their attorney,
Thomas Ramsdell, asked that the Commission approve the demolition permit.
Alderman O’Shea addressed the Commission and spoke in support of the preservation of
the building.
Mr. Shure informed the Commission that a preliminary decision disapproving the
demolition application would trigger an informal conference and, if the informal
conference did not reach an accord, a public hearing on the permit application in
accordance with the provisions of the Chicago Landmarks Ordinance.
Motioned by Smith, seconded by Wong. Approved unanimously. (7-0)

Proposal:

Renewal of expired approval: Proposed construction of a new three-story
masonry building with ground floor commercial and two upper floor
residential units.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The design of the storefront and entry columns shall be simplified.
The number and width of the metal storefront columns and vertical
storefront mullions shall be reduced in keeping with the typical
appearance of these elements in the district. Column enclosures and

Proposal:

Proposed exterior and interior rehabilitation of the 4-story commercial

 building including brick and terra cotta work and replacement of
storefronts and ground-floor facade.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. In this particular instance, considering that the existing brick on the
front façade was damaged by sandblasting and has been previously
painted for more than 30 years, the brick may be repainted as proposed
to match the original brick color. Prior to repainting, several more
areas of paint shall be stripped from the brick façade to confirm the
original color of the brick. Specifications for vapor-permeable latex
paint and color samples shall be reviewed and approved as part of the
permit application;
2. As proposed, the painted terra cotta ornament on the front façade shall
be stripped, repaired as necessary, and left exposed. Any mismatched
units from previous repairs may be painted to match the color of the
original terra cotta. Paint stripping specifications, material safety data
sheets, and paint specifications and color samples shall be reviewed
and approved as part of the permit application;
3. Any brick and terra cotta replacement units shall match the original
brick and terra cotta in shape, profile, color, and finish. New mortar
shall match the historic mortar in color, joint profile, texture, and
strength/type. Samples to be reviewed and approved by staff prior to
order and installation;
4. Once the EIFS and metal cladding is removed in its entirety from the
base of the building, Historic Preservation staff shall be notified in
order to conduct a site visit to confirm existence of any remaining
historic fabric to be repaired or replaced to match, or, if any physical
scarring exists, to inform the design of the ground floor. The proposed
ground-floor configuration shall be revised to be consistent with such
uncovered physical evidence, if any. The final ground-floor storefront
design shall be subject to staff review and approval; and,
5. As proposed, all storefront display and transom windows shall have
clear vision glass. The storefront mullions shall have a profile as
shown in the design drawings. The recessed ceiling soffits within the
ground-floor retail spaces shall be set back by at least 3’ from the
inside face of the transom glass. As tenants are finalized, any
modifications to the location of the storefront mullions, new signage,
and any exterior lighting shall be reviewed and approved by Historic
Preservation staff prior to order and installation. The granite and
color/finish samples of the storefront system shall be reviewed and
approved by staff prior to order and installation.
