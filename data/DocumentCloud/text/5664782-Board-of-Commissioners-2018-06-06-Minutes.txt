time the vehicle is required. This contract is being extended to allow the County additional time to review

Summary: Track Group, Inc. will provide electronic monitoring and Global Positioning System (GPS)
services for the Adult Probation Department, the Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department and
the Cook County Sheriff’s Office for youth and adults who are ordered by the court to wear electronic
monitoring devices.
Track Group, Inc. will provide GPS monitoring equipment and services for adult probationers and pretrial
defendants in order to comply with Public Act 95-0773, also known as the Cindy Bischof Law, which calls
for the monitoring of certain domestic violence offenses to be monitored by the Adult Probation
Department Home Confinement Unit as a condition of bail or probation. Offenders are ordered to wear a
GPS tracking device to help monitor compliance with orders to stay away from the complaining witness,
the complaining witness’s home/workplace, or any other protected address specified. There are currently
more than 350 adults under GPS monitoring and 110 victims who carry GPS devices to create mobile
exclusion zones. Effective January 1, 2015, new legislation (Public Act 98-1012, 725 ILCS 5/110-5)
significantly expanded the types of charges required to be considered for GPS monitoring as a condition of
bail.
GPS technology is used by the Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department to monitor high-risk
minors in home confinement as an alternative to secure detention or as condition of release into the
community. These devices are deployed at various points of the judicial process from pre-adjudication
through post-dispositional stages of court proceedings.
The contract was awarded through the Request for Proposals (RFP) process in accordance with the Cook
County Procurement Code. Track Group, Inc. was selected based on established evaluation criteria.

WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property Assessment
Classification 8 that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for an abandoned commercial
facility; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Classification System for Assessment defines abandoned property as
buildings and other structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous months,
have been purchased for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances may exist that
justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 8; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in
whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify
finding the property is deemed abandoned; and
WHEREAS, Class 8 requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period of qualifying
abandonment in cases where the facility has been abandoned for less than 24 consecutive months upon
purchase for value; and
WHEREAS, the municipality states the Class 8 is necessary for development to occur on this specific real
estate. The municipal resolution cites the qualifications of this property to meet the definition of abandoned
with special circumstances; and
WHEREAS; commercial real estate is normally assessed at 25% of its market value, qualifying
commercial real estate eligible for the Class 8 can receive a significant reduction in the level of assessment
from the date that new construction or rehabilitation has been completed, or in the case of abandoned
property from the date of substantial re-occupancy. Properties receiving Class 8 will be assessed at 10%
of the market value for 10 years, 15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the County

A RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE STATE OF ILLINOIS SENATE BILL 3228
TO OFFER OPPORTUNITY FOR JUVENILE OFFENDERSSERVING LIFE SENTENCES THE
CHANCE FOR PAROLE
WHEREAS, The U.S. Supreme Court ruled six years ago that sentencing schemes that require life
sentences with no hope of parole for crimes committed by juveniles violated the U.S. Constitution; and,
WHEREAS, on May 6, 2018, the Injustice Project, in partnership with the Chicago Sun-Times, published
an article stating that in Illinois more than 160 prisoners are serving life sentences for crimes they committed
as juveniles, with virtually no hope of parole or early release under current law; and,
WHEREAS, Using Illinois Department of Corrections data, Injustice Watch examined the number of
prisoners serving 50 or more years in prison who were taken into custody before their 18th birthday; and,
WHEREAS, Because Illinois almost entirely abolished parole in 1978, the 167 juvenile offenders do not
get the same chance to show rehabilitation and change that they might get in other states. The only juvenile
offenders with parole opportunities are the aging handful who were convicted before the law changed four
decades ago; and,

85

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

June 6, 2018

WHEREAS, Courts across the country varied standards on what length of a prison term can legally be
considered a life sentence, and whether and when they should be eligible for parole; and,
WHEREAS, At least 13 other states and Washington, D.C., have passed laws giving young offenders a
chance to ask for parole release or a sentence reduction after first serving as few as 12 and as many as 35
years in prison, depending on the state and severity of the crime; and,
WHEREAS, The Illinois Senate Criminal Law Committee last month sent to the full Senate a bill that
would permit inmates who committed crimes before the age of 21 the periodic chance to ask for parole,
after first serving 10 years for lesser crimes and 20 years for first-degree murder or aggravated sexual
assault; and,
WHEREAS, Research indicates that incarceration has a jarring effect on life expectancy, a study by
Vanderbilt University Professor Evelyn Patterson found each year of incarceration likely reduces a
prisoner’s life expectancy by two years.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners do hereby
support and encourage the 100th General Assembly of the State of Illinois in the passage of Senate Bill
3228.

Summary: This report is to comply with the amendments to Article X of the Cook County Code
(PERFORMANCE BASED MANAGEMENT AND BUDGETING), approved by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners on June 29, 2016. The purpose of the amendments was to enhance the
effectiveness of the annual budget process by establishing administrative units called “programs.”
Amendments to Article X also created a new process for the submission of performance data.
“Programs” were identified for the purpose of being the primary building blocks of an agency’s or
department’s budget request, making it possible to distinguish assigned employees and costs (i.e. inputs),
and the resulting program performance metrics, i.e. outputs, outcomes, and efficiency.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AMENDMENT TO SECTION 74-63 ASSESSMENT CLASSES
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that CHAPTER 74 TAXATION,
ARTICLE II REAL PROPERTY TAXATION, DIVISION 2 CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR
ASSESSMENT, SECTION 74-63 ASSESSMENT CLASSES of the Cook County Code is hereby amended
as Follows:
158

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

June 6, 2018

Sec. 74-63. - Assessment classes.
Real estate is divided into the following assessment classes:
***
(7) Class 6b. Real estate used primarily for industrial purposes, consisting of all newly constructed
buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned
property, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other
structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their
value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation
adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for
the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears
to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
***
d. In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that
special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose
of Class 6b, unless:
1. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been
vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or
2. There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been
vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.
The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall
be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b
application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the
County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned"
for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The
applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special
circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution
to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special
circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution
validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b
need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor,
but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to
request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b
eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance
regarding special circumstances has been requested.

If the real estate is located within an Industrial Growth Zone, prior to filing a Class 6b
eligibility application with the Assessor and in lieu of an Ordinance or Resolution, an
applicant may obtain from an authorized officer of the municipality or an authorized officer
of the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area, a letter stating that the municipality or the County Board, as the case
may be, supports and consents to the filing of the Class 6b application with the Assessor.
Such authorized officer shall have been designated by the legislative body of the
municipality or, in the case of an unincorporated area, by the Cook County Board.
A copy of the authorized officer letter and a certified copy of the legislative action
designating the authorized officer shall be included with the Class 6b application and
submitted to the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development for verification prior to
filing of the application with the Assessor.
In addition, the letter from the authorized officer shall:
1. Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;
2. State the applicant's intended use of the property; and
3. State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division, was received
and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case may be.
Following verification that the Class 6b application is in an Industrial Growth Zone and has
been properly submitted with a letter from an authorized officer and a certified copy of the
legislative action designating the authorized officer, the Bureau of Economic Development
will forward the application to the Assessor's Office for filing. A certified copy of the
legislative action designating the authorized officer and the authorized officer letter shall be
included with the Class 6b application at the time of filing the application with the Assessor.
The applicant must demonstrate that the industrial development project qualifies for the
Class 6b classification.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the
instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that
special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose
of a Class 6b under the TEERM Program if:
1. There has been no purchase for value; and
2. The buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least 12 continuous
months.
The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, and
a determination that the applicant's participation in the TEERM Program is necessary for the
development to occur, and that without such designation the industrial enterprise would not
be economically viable causing the property to be in imminent risk of remaining vacant and

unused, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the
Class 6b application under the TEERM Program.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution where applicable shall:
1. Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;
2. State the applicant's intended use of the property; and
3. State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division, was received
and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case may be.
If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is
required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of
Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain
the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and
present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to
its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A
certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well
as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of
filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later
than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the
Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file,
at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that
a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Critical Emergency Employee Retention Modification (CEERM) Program: In the instance
where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of a Class
6b under the TEERM Program if:
1. There has been no purchase for value; and
2. The buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least 3 continuous
months.
At least 250 positions would be retained at the subject location and the applicant's
participation in the CEERM Program is necessary for the development to occur, and that
without such designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing
the property to be in imminent risk of remaining vacant and unused, shall be included in the
Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application under the
CEERM Program.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution where applicable shall:

and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case may be.
If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is
required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of
Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain
the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and
present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to
its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A
certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well
as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of
filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later
than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the
Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file,
at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that
a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program: In the instance where real estate does not
meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County
Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding that
the property is deemed "qualified" for purpose of Class 6b under the SER Program if:
1. The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same location for a
minimum of ten years prior to the date of application for the SER Program; and
2. The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of hardship
supporting a determination that participation in the SER Program is necessary for the
industrial enterprise to continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff,
and that without such designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically
viable causing the property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused.
The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, and a determination that the applicant's participation in the SER Program is
necessary for the industrial enterprise to continue operations at its current location and
maintain its staff, and that without such designation the industrial enterprise would not be
economically viable causing the property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and
unused, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the
Class 6b application under the SER Program.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution where applicable shall:

1. Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;
2. State the applicant's intended use of the property; and
3. State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division, was received
and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case may be.
If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is
required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of
Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain
the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and
present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to
its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"qualified" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A
certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well
as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the
property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing
the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than
the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution
is not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time,
a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution
or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Applications for Class 6b incentives pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER Program or
CEERM Program must be received by the Assessor's Office on or before November 30, 2018
to receive consideration.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Class 6b
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the property and the number
of persons employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports, recipients shall be required to
certify whether the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER
application continues its operations at that location. In addition, recipients of Class 6b
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program shall be required to report to the Assessor
within 30 days if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER
application ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports will be forwarded by
the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the
County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within the time
established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating
to the non-filing. Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the
time of the SER application ceases operations at that location, then the Class 6b incentive
granted pursuant to the SER program shall terminate.
e. This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially
assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial re-occupancy, or
in the case of incentives granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, from the date of the notice
163

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

June 6, 2018

of approval. In the case of incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program, this classification
shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date of the notice of approval, or until the
industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application ceases
operations at that location if that occurs sooner.
f. Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program or the CEERM
Program, this incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten
percent assessment level pursuant to Section 74-64(7), if the following requirements are met:
1. The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of intent to request renewal of the incentive
from the municipality or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;
2. The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate
is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial
use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and
consents to renewal of the Class 6b; and
3. A copy of the Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Assessor's
Office before the expiration of the ten percent assessment level period.

Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

165

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

respect to the preparation of such fiscal notes. The fiscal impact statement shall, to the degree
possible, consist of an estimate in dollars of the anticipated change in revenue, expenditures, or

the measure. If after investigation, it is determined that no dollar estimate is possible, the fiscal
impact statement shall contain a statement to that effect, setting forth the reasons why no dollar
estimate can be given. The fiscal impact statement shall include an explanation of the basis or
reasoning on which the estimate is founded, including all assumptions involved. A copy of the

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF SHERIFF'S OFFICE CONDUCTING
COOK COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT’S BACKGROUND CHECKS
WHEREAS, An investigative report recently exposed multiple counts of sexual abuse of Chicago Public
School (CPS) students at the hands of staff and teachers; and,
WHEREAS, Ineffective background checks or the disregard of negative background checks exposed
students to educators and staff with criminal convictions and arrests for sex crimes against children; and,
WHEREAS, Although all school districts require potential school staff, volunteers and contract workers
to pass a background check before they work with students, the report cited a lack of control over
commissioning, receipt, and action of information received from background checks; and,
WHEREAS, Currently the Chicago Police Department, like CPS a department of the City of Chicago,
conducts criminal background checks on all CPS potential staff; and,
WHEREAS, The background check function could be directed to an outside vendor, however, such a
contract would still be under the management and control of a department of the City of Chicago; and,
WHEREAS, As is best practice in law enforcement, currently the city and the county operate a separation
of powers in law enforcement functions; and,
WHEREAS, It is imperative to have separation of power to ensure all units of government are performing
its core functions to the highest standard; and,
WHEREAS, The Cook County Sheriff’s Office has the ability to conduct in depth criminal background
checks, including criminal records, educational credentials, and prior employment on potential staff and
conduct random checks to catch the arrests of current staff; and,
WHEREAS, It is the first duty of any unit of government to ensure the protection of children, especially
those entrusted in the care of such government.
