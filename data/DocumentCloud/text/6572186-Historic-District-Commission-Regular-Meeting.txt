PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

SCOPE: REHAB BUILDING
EXISTING CONDITIONS
As per the applicant:
The building located at 2001 Park Avenue is known as the Park Avenue Building. The structure
was designed by Albert Khan Associates and was constructed in 1922 as a speculative
commercial office building. The building fills the 80’ x 100’ lot at the northwest corner of Park
Avenue and Adams Avenue. It is twelve stories tall and built using reinforced concrete and steelframe construction. The Park Avenue Building is faced with brick, cast concrete, and limestone.
The brick is buff-colored and laid in a running-bond pattern. Most of the decorative cornice at
the top of the building is gone, however, a portion of the original denticulated cornice remains.
The masonry has had previous emergency stabilization under this owner. The Adams and Park
Avenue facades are identical in composition and are symmetrically arranged. The Adams Avenue
elevation is vertically divided into five bays by brick pilasters. The first floor of the Park Avenue
Building originally contained storefront windows in each bay of the building. The storefrontlevel windows have since been altered. The building is faced with a base of pink and grey flecked
granite. At the Park Avenue facade, the southern storefront (at the corner) has an infill brick
storefront wall approximately four feet in height. Currently the storefront facades on both Park
Avenue and Adams Avenue are entirely boarded and/or bricked over. The second story on both
facades features large limestone segmental arch window surrounds. Above each arch are
limestone spandrel panels featuring three figural plaques. The transoms above the windows at
the twelfth floor are completed in a round arch. A circular medallion is centered between each
pair of arched windows. The western elevation is hidden from view by the Briggs Houze
Apartment building (114 West Adams) but a light court runs down this side of the building from
the second floor through twelfth. The northern (back) elevation faces onto the alley and has one
bay (the eastern-most bay) ornamented in the same manner as the Park Avenue facade. The
remainder of the northern (back) facade is devoid of ornamentation. A very deteriorated fire
escape runs down the alley facade, from floors twelve through five. A portion of the fire escape
was removed in the emergency stabilization. The roof of the building is flat. A very deteriorated,
collapsing elevator penthouse is at the northwest corner of the roof.
PROPOSAL
The current project proposes a complete rehabilitation of the property. Specific work items proposed for
this project includes the following:
Masonry Restoration (Throughout)
• All damaged, deteriorating, or spalling masonry units are to be removed and replaced with new
material to match original units. Missing units are to be replaced to match the remaining adjacent
materials and new brick will match the existing as closely as possible in size, color, texture, and

 •

compressive strength. Any salvaged brick will be reused where replacement is needed before
new brick is used.
The deteriorated original speckled granite base found at the first-floor will be removed and
replaced with a new stone in a black multi-color.

East Elevation
Windows
• At stories 3-10, replace existing 1/1 wood-sash units (and non-historic transom infill) with new
1/1, double-hung, aluminum sash units. to match the original existing window dimensions of the
individual elements including but not limited to lugs, muntins, head, sill, panes, jambs, sash, and
overall depth. There will be no screens or screen rail additions.

STAFF OBSERVATIONS AND RESEARCH
• Regarding the proposed signage, note that the application merely refers to location, it does not
specify materiality, design, or method of installation
• Details surrounding the new north elevation doors and sidelights at the fire escape have not been
provided
• Regarding the proposed windows replacement, the applicant has provided photographic evidence
in addition to a condition assessment from Blackberry Windows Systems which note that the
windows are deteriorated beyond repair throughout and recommends that they be replaced. Staff
does accept Blackberry’s professional opinion regarding the condition of the windows.
ISSUES
• The applicant has provided photos of the windows proposed for replacement in addition to a
condition assessment from Blackberry Windows. Blackberry Windows recommends that the
windows be replaced wholesale, but note the following:
The wood windows are located on the 3rd thru 10th floors on the North, South and, East
Facades, feature distinctive decorative “dog lug” detailing. It is not clear if this detailing
can be replicated
o Regarding the second story arched windows, Blackberry notes that it will be difficult to
identify an aluminum replacement product to match the radius shape of the existing steel
windows
o Regarding the historic steel windows at the lightwells, Blackberry does note that they are
deteriorated beyond repair. However, they note that they have not found new replica
products that will meet the sightline and profile requirements of these existing windows.
o See the provided details of the existing vs the proposed for the new windows. It does not
appear clear to staff the new windows will closely replicate the detail of the existing
o

RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the historic exterior elements that are proposed for replacment are deteriorated
beyond repair. The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation requires that these elements
be replaced with new to match the old in design, color, texture and, where possible, materials. Staff
therefore recommends that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) for the
proposal because it meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. However, staff
does recommend that the Commission issue this COA with the following conditions:
•

All new replacement windows shall match the old in dimension and detailing to include the lugs,
muntins, head, sill, panes, jambs, sash, and overall depth. The applicant shall provide details of
the existing and proposed windows which clearly demonstrate that the new windows adequately
match the design and detailing of the old to HDC staff for review and approval. If staff determines
that the new windows do not adequately replicate the old, they will forward the work item to the
Commission for review at a future meeting

 •
•

The applicant shall provide details of all proposed new signage to staff for review and approval.
If staff determines that the signage does not conform to the Standards, they will forward the work
item to the Commission for review at a future meeting
The applicant shall afford staff the opportunity to review and approve the proposed new
storefronts and exterior doors to staff for review and approval. If staff determines that the new
storefronts and exterior doors do not conform to the Standards, they will forward the work item
to the Commission for review at a future meeting.

RE: General Necessities Building/Park Avenue Building- HDC Submission
Dear Ms. Ross:
Kraemer Design Group (KDG) is writing to submit information to the Detroit Historic District Commission (HDC), on
behalf of Infinity Homes & Co. regarding the proposed rehabilitation of the Park Avenue Building located at 20012017 Park Avenue. The proposed exterior work at the Park Avenue Building will include: masonry cleaning and
restoration of the exterior; new storefronts; new exterior doors; replacement canopy over the Park Avenue entrance;
new exterior lighting; fire escape repair; new signage in keeping in character with the historic signage; new
windows; new roofing, rooftop mechanical equipment and new rooftop deck. The proposed use will be R-2
apartments, with mixed use tenants in the first-floor south half, second floor, and, possibly, the basement.
The Park Avenue Building was constructed in 1922 as a speculative commercial office building. It opened on July 1,
1923 and was designed by the Detroit architectural firm of Albert Kahn Inc. The Park Avenue Building was renamed
the General Necessities Building from November 23, 1923 to February 20, 1930. The General Necessities Company
was a wholesale supplier of re-screened coal and Solvay coke for heating fuel, as well as household ice. The building
fills the 80’ x 100’ lot at the northwest corner of Park Avenue and Adams Avenue. It is twelve stories tall and built
using reinforced concrete and steel-frame construction. The Park Avenue Building is faced with brick, cast concrete,
and limestone. The brick is buff-colored and laid in a running-bond pattern. Much of the masonry is collapsing from
the structure due to years of water infiltration. Most of the decorative cornice at the top of the building is gone,
however, a portion of the original denticulated cornice remains. The masonry has had previous emergency
stabilization under this owner.
The Adams and Park Avenue facades are identical in composition and are symmetrically arranged. The Adams
Avenue elevation is vertically divided into five bays by brick pilasters. The first floor of the Park Avenue Building
originally contained storefront windows in each bay of the building. The storefront-level windows have since been
altered. The building is faced with a base of pink and grey flecked granite. At the Park Avenue facade, the southern
storefront (at the corner) has an infill brick storefront wall approximately four feet in height. Currently the storefront
facades on both Park Avenue and Adams Avenue are entirely boarded and/or bricked over.
The second story on both facades features large limestone segmental arch window surrounds. Above each arch are
limestone spandrel panels featuring three figural plaques. The transoms above the windows at the twelfth floor are
completed in a round arch. A circular medallion is centered between each pair of arched windows. The western
elevation is hidden from view by the Briggs Houze Apartment building (114 West Adams) but a light court runs
down this side of the building from the second floor through twelfth. The northern (back) elevation faces onto the
alley and has one bay (the eastern-most bay) ornamented in the same manner as the Park Avenue facade. The
remainder of the northern (back) facade is devoid of ornamentation. A very deteriorated fire escape runs down the
alley facade, from floors twelve through five. A portion of the fire escape was removed in the emergency
stabilization. The roof of the building is flat. A very deteriorated, collapsing elevator penthouse is at the northwest
corner of the roof.
The following is a detailed description of the proposed work and its historic implications:

 Masonry Restoration
The brick, cast concrete, and limestone masonry on the exterior of the building are all in poor condition overall due
to years of water infiltration, the freeze thaw cycle, and deferred maintenance. The masonry will be cleaned and
inspected for damage. All damaged, deteriorating, or spalling masonry units are to be removed and replaced with
new material to match original units. Missing units are to be replaced to match the remaining adjacent materials and
new brick will match the existing as closely as possible in size, color, texture, and compressive strength. Any
salvaged brick will be reused where replacement is needed before new brick is used. The cleaning will be done
according to the Secretary of Interior Standards, and NPS Technical Preservation Briefs 1, 2 & 6. The speckled
granite found at the first-floor will be removed and replaced with a new stone in a black multi-color. Please see
attached drawings and photographs for additional details.
Storefronts
The first level storefronts have been significantly altered over time and are now in poor condition and boarded
over—several of the storefronts on the Park Avenue façade are bricked halfway up the height of the storefront
opening. The storefront at the northern most bay on the Park Avenue façade and the sole storefront located on the
north facade are both bricked up entirely. All ground floor exterior storefronts are to be removed and replaced with
new storefront systems designed to complement the historic character of the building without appearing falsely
historic. All new storefronts are to be consistent in look, style, and materials. Doors will be added as needed for the
ground floor tenants, these doors will be integrated into the storefront window pattern. The lugs on the transoms
will be incorporated into the designs for the new storefronts while the twisted rope mullioned transoms pieces will
be taken off the existing frame, rehabbed, and placed back onto the new frame. Any twisted rope pieces that are
damaged beyond repair will be new cast iron pieces made to replicate the Please see attached drawings for
additional details.
Exterior Doors
The main entrance into the building was historically found on the Park Avenue façade in the second bay. There is a
security CMU infill and wood door that was placed into this bay by a prior owner. It does not attach to the building.
The Park Avenue entrance into the main lobby will be replaced with a new black aluminum double door unit that
complement the historic character of the building.
The fire escape doors will be removed and replaced with new units that will be compatible with the historic
character of the building. The sidelights and doors will be recreated while the transoms will be replaced with a
louvered panel.
On the first floor of the north façade, there are two access doors on the alley façade. These doors will be replaced
with new units to complement the historic character of the building. One will be a double hollow metal service door
and the other a black aluminum entrance door with sidelight.
There are currently two entrance doors on the Adams Street façade: one leads to the southern-most retail space and
one leads to a staircase to the second floor. These doors will be removed, and a new single door will be installed in
this location. Please see drawings for additional details.
Exterior Metal Canopy at Park Avenue Entrance

Page 2 of 4
1420 Broadway   Detroit, MI   48226   p 313 965 3399   f 313 965 3555   www.thekraemeredge.com

 There is a very deteriorated metal canopy over the Park Avenue entrance that likely dates from the 1950s. This
canopy will be removed and replaced with a new unit to match the historic canopy that used to be located at this
entrance; it will be extended out further than the current canopy. Please see attached drawings for details.
Exterior Lighting
Currently there is no lighting on the exterior, but this project proposed to place lighting at the pocket above the
first-floor storefronts, at the base of the second-floor window, and on the pilasters between each set of windows on
the twelfth-floor. Finally, it is proposed that downlights lights be added to the underside of the canopy above the
Park Avenue entrance. Lighting of planters at each pilaster. Please see drawings and cut sheets for additional
details.
Exterior Decorative Storefront Awning Enclosures
On both primary façades, decorative metal awning enclosures are found between the transom windows and the
storefront windows. Decorative metal trim was on the face of the awning enclosures. A few are in fair condition, but
most are in poor condition with significant corrosion with missing and bent pieces. Previous fabric awnings were
hidden under these metal enclosures and a few remaining fragments of the dowel and awning fabric remain but are
in extremely poor condition. The decorative metal awning enclosures will be removed and replaced to match with
replicated decorative trim. All remaining remnants of the fabric awning equipment and fittings will be removed and
replaced with new fixed awnings.
Fire Escape
A single fire escape runs down the face of the north façade from floors twelve through five; it is made of black metal
and is in very poor condition with significant corrosion and structural damage. The fire escape from floors 4 through
2 and the ladder/cage to roof were removed in previous façade stabilization. The fire escape is accessible by egress
doors on each floor, which are located in the third bay. The existing fire escape is to be retained and rehabilitated or
replaced as a means of egress from the building. The missing sections from floors 2-4 and ladder/cage will be
rebuilt from new materials to match the existing as much as feasible. Connections to the building shall be
rehabilitated as necessary to ensure structural stability. Any loose or spalling masonry units shall be repaired and
reinstalled as necessary.
Exterior Signage
Historically, the building had large signage on rooftop grillage, on the limestone lintel above each storefront
window, a plaque at the southeast corner, on the glazed window units of the 1st -3rd stories, and on the metal
canopy above the Park Avenue entrance.
This project proposes to add signage to the building in the basic locations indicated on the attached drawings. To
summarize, it is proposed that signage will be located at: signage on the metal canopy above the Park Avenue
entrance, a plaque at the southeast corner on the east and south facades, signage on the band above the 1st floor
transoms, within the second floor window arch and signage on some of the glazed units of the 1st-3rd floor. Signage
will be submitted for review in these locations on a case by case basis. See historic photos attached.
Windows
On both primary facades, floors three through eleven contain pairs of double-hung wood windows in each bay.
These are double hung windows and they are in poor condition with most units missing or boarded over. Many of

Page 3 of 4
1420 Broadway   Detroit, MI   48226   p 313 965 3399   f 313 965 3555   www.thekraemeredge.com

 these windows have been modified over the years to include a makeshift transom to reduce the size of the window
opening and to provide a space to insert a window air conditioning unit. The twelfth story also contains pairs of
double-hung windows, but these units have transoms above the windows that are completed in a rounded arch, also
in poor condition. The second story on both primary facades features large limestone arch window surrounds with
steel windows that are in poor condition: the second story windows are mostly boarded over although a few glazed
units remain in some areas and the remaining steel frames and mullions are significantly rusted, broken, or missing
entirely. The side segments where noted to be casements. Overall, the north façade windows are in poor condition
with most of the glazed units missing with the windows covered with plywood or scrap materials. On the west
façade, the lightwell windows are two over two steel double hung windows.
All windows will be replaced with new black aluminum windows to match the original existing window dimensions of
the individual elements including but not limited to lugs, muntins, head, sill, panes, jambs, sash, and overall depth.
There will be no screens or screen rail additions.
Roof and Roof Deck Scope
The roof is currently a built-up roof and is in poor condition. A brick elevator and equipment penthouse is located
on the northwestern portion of the roof. The structure is in very poor condition with walls collapsing, missing,
cracked and spalled masonry units, broken windows, and heavily corroded elevator equipment.
The existing roofing will be removed and replaced with a new rubber membrane roof system. All flashing, parapets,
and coping will be inspected for damage and repaired or replaced with new. No new damage will be done to the
parapets. The existing penthouse will be rebuilt and heightened slightly to accommodate a new elevator stop at the
roof (for ADA access).
A occupiable roof deck will be added at the south side and will be accessed via the penthouse. A glass guardrail
with black supports will encompass the roof deck and walkway. New mechanical equipment will be added to the
north/middle side of the roof and a black metal perforated screen wall will be added in between the roof deck and
the mechanical units. Per code, venting must extend 7’ above the roof when a roof is occupied. The elevator
penthouse, mechanical units, and roof deck will be only minimally visible from the public right of way—please see
attached sightline study regarding the visibility of these rooftop work items.
If you have any questions regarding this submission, please don’t hesitate to contact me at (313) 965-3399 extension
215.

Dear Ms. Ross,
It is our understanding that the Historic District Commission needs more information in order to process our
application. In order to complement the initial submission Kraemer Design Group made on 10/28/19 we are now
submitting the additional requested information:
•
•

•

•

•
•

Light fixtures: all non-historic light fixtures found throughout the building will be removed and replaced
with new units. The notation on the drawing that was submitted —stating that the light fixtures would be
removed, rehabilitated, and re-installed—that were submitted on 10/28/19 is incorrect.
Windows: Kraemer Design Group proposed removing and replacing all twelve windows found on the
west façade due to the extreme deterioration of these units. We have included additional photographs of
these windows. We are also including additional detail photos of the window units on the north façade at
the first and second floor that we intend to replace.
Exterior Doors: The Park Avenue set of double doors will be removed and replaced with new door units
and new hardware, but they will be fitted within the exiting frame. The door on Montcalm will be replaced
with a new unit and new hardware and the glazed panel in the door will be a divided light to match the
sidelights.
Window boxes: The existing window boxes are constructed of black painted panels with wood blocking.
These will be replaced with new black painted units that will match existing boxes. The existing
dimensions vary for each window box unit—please refer to the drawings—but they will be replicated with
new materials to be the same size as what currently exists.
Canopies: We are providing additional details in the attached renderings and drawings.
Rooftop Mechanical: We are submitting additional information about the rooftop mechanical units.

HISTORIC WINDOW SITE REVIEW: BUDGET PRICING
The following is the written Historic Window Site Review for the
existing wood and steel windows for 2001 Park Avenue, Detroit, MI.
This information is based on a physical site visit, inspection of the
existing windows, and preliminary elevations. Our review considers
the National Park Service guidelines for restoration and replication
as provided in the NPS Wood Window Preservation Brief #9 and NPS
Steel Window Preservation Brief #13. Likewise, in providing our
recommendations for the restoration or replacement, we are
adhering to the guidelines that meet NPS and SHPO standards.
Please note this review is our opinion based on over 25 years of
historic window restoration and replication experience; however,
you must have written approval from NPS, SHPO, or the Detroit
Historic District Commission to be assured of the projects’ tax credit
approval (if applicable) or historic district compliance.
I. Existing Conditions: (319) Wood Double Hung Windows @ (11,034 Sq. ft.):

The existing windows are original to the Park Avenue
Building. The windows are in very poor condition and
are one of the key architectural features to the building’s
exterior façade. The wood windows are located on the
3rd thru 10th floors on the North, South and, East
Facades. All the existing windows appear to have gone
years without exterior repair or maintenance. Many of
these windows are not operating because the sash
balances have failed, the ropes have been cut or
deteriorated, and/or the sashes have been caulked and
painted shut. At least 30% of the window sashes have
been removed and unsalvageable.

 The window components that do remain have very little paint remaining on the
exterior and for the most part down to bare wood, that cracked, broken, weathered,
and checked.
The typical window components are all most likely second growth white pine
including 2 ¼” thick sash, ½” x ½” parting bead, 1 ½” x 1/2” sash trim, ⅞” x ½” blind
stop, and ¼” clear float glass. The exposed site line dimensions include 2” side stiles,
4 ½” bottom rail, 1 ¾” meeting rail, and 2” top rail. The exterior sill face is 2 ½”, Both
the exterior upper sash and the lower interior sash have a wood “dog lug” measuring
3 ½” x 1 ¾”; these will most likely will have to be replicated to get approval by any
historical review required. There are a few mulled windows and the vertical mullion
is 9 1/2”. As with most windows of this era and condition we assume the perimeter
exterior caulk and glazing compound will test positive for asbestos, the Haz-Mat
testing and report should include the windows.
II. Existing Condition: (31) Wood Double-Hung Window with Half Round Transoms @
(1,612 Sq. Ft.):
These windows are original to the structure and are located on the top floor of the
East, South and North Elevation. These windows are in poor condition and exhibit rot
and deterioration at critical areas on the frames and sashes to the same degree as the
rectangular head double hungs. The horizontal mullion separating the lower double
hung and the top half round is 5 ¼” high.
III. Existing Condition: (191) Cold Rolled Steel Double Hung Windows @ (2,620 Sq. ft.):
These windows are original to the structure and
are located in interior of the building in the light
well and stair wells from the 3rd floor through the
10th floor. They are fire rated with 1/4 “wire glass
and interior screw applied metal glazing stops.
They are galvanized steel but are in fair to poor
exterior condition and many not operable. The
double hung windows use a chain, pulley, and
weight system similar to their wood counterpart.
The design was to mimic a wood double hung but
made of steel to meet the fire rating on the required elevations. Note these steel
windows do not match the site line dimensions of the wood windows original to the
exterior façades. The following dimensions are for the typical components, exposed
sitelines; 1” sash rails, 2 ¾” bottom rail, 1 ½” meeting rail, 1 ¾” muntin, and 1 ½” sill
face. Even if we were able to strip and clean the exposed surface rust the internal rust
and corrosion found inside the jamb wall cavity and sashes, make the potential for
restoration futile. This will continue and make the effort and work of no value. Much
of the galvanized surfaces are rusted from years without painting.

 The perimeter caulking has failed and allowing water to penetrate the masonry
façade. Likewise, approximately 75% of the windows are inoperable. We have not
found any new replica products that will meet the site line and profile requirements
of these existing windows. We are aware of products that maybe approved but not
within the (+) or
(-) 1/8” tolerance. Typically, we are asked to match the new replica windows to the
primary façade windows by SHPO and NPS. So, there is a possibility the same window
would be approved for this replication as on the exterior elevations.
Recommendation: Complete Removal and Replication of all existing window types:
BlackBerry recommends the full replacement of the existing wood and steel windows
based on the overall poor condition of the components and the fact that approximately
30-40% of the Wood Double-hung windows have been altered or replaced with a
window of smaller dimension and the transom area filled in with board up. The
extensive damage to the wood and steel components will not allow for the restoration
of these window frames and sashes. Products are available that have been in the past
approved by NPS and SHPO for similar historic tax credit projects. A key element will
be the replication of the interior and exterior “dog lug” that exists on all the original
wood double hung windows. BlackBerry has supplied and installed many projects
requiring the use of such a replica window; the challenge is the design engineering
and cost so the product can get approval for the profiles and sitelines. The final
determination will come down to the review by SHPO, NPS, or the local historic district
commission.
Replication of the Wood Double-Hung and Steel Double-Hung Windows:
The Custom Aluminum Double Hung Replica option would be based on the use of a
window equal to the Quaker H500 Single Hung Series which has been used on many
similar NPS approved projects. This would include custom exterior panning and sill
system, custom mullion covers, interior snap trim, insulated glass with low-e/argon,
site line adapters, and AAMA 2605 painted finish. The estimated supplied and
installed price for all openings:
Budget Pricing $1,641,090.00

 IV. Replacement of (12) Large Radius Windows with Storefront and Restoration of
Existing Cast Ornamental Exterior Trim @ (1,385 Sq. ft.):
The first-floor original storefront openings are
fully boarded up, and from the interior side over
80% of the original components have been
removed or altered over the past years. The
second-floor openings are fully deglazed and
partially boarded up. The evidence to fully
determine the first-floor storefront original
design and construction will have to be verified
by photographic evidence since there such a lack
of clarity based on existing physical evidence.
The second-floor openings still have the original steel fixed and casement window
assembly, while in very poor condition the existing sitelines are approximately 2” at
the head, sill, and jambs. These steel frames are not restorable, and the steel is heavily
corroded, with failed joinery. The cast ornamental exterior trim is a rope design
approximately 1”, this material is fastened to the original window assembly.
Recommendation: Replacement of existing steel windows assembly and restoration
of cast ornamental exterior trim.
The windows can be replaced with an aluminum thermally broken Storefront System
or a thermally broken aluminum Fixed Replica Window System. The biggest issue to
be determined is the availability of either type of product to match the radius shape
of the existing steel windows. Details will have to be created and sent to
manufacturers to determine the fabrication limitations and cost. The cast metal can
be removed, and shop restored, and then re-installed to the new window system.
Please note we are not addressing the first-floor storefront openings since we need
more direction as to the assumed design of the original components.
2nd Floor Window/Storefront Budget Pricing $185,000.00
2nd Floor Cast Metal Restoration $ 74,000.00
Our budget pricing is based on the over 30 years’ experience in completing historic
restoration and replication projects. I would caution that this is budget pricing and
not final pricing, final specifications and plans would be required once your client has
approvals from NPS, SHPO, and the local historic district to provide accurate pricing.
To establish accurate pricing we would need accurate design parameters and firm
quotations from manufacturers for our materials. Our budget pricing allows for the
design, fabrication, and material, tax on material, labor (non-union/non-prevailing
wage), employment, staging, delivery, shop drawings, and supervision. Note Bonding,
Traffic Control, and Permits are not included.

 BlackBerry can assist in the design details working with manufacturers and providing
proposed assembly details and existing condition details as required for historical
approvals.

Please contact me with any questions.
