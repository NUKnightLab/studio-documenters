Re: Appointment of Acting Chief Financial Of?cer and Acting Chief Operating Of?cer

Honorable City Council,

As you know, Chief Financial Officer John Hill?s last day will be December 31, 2018.
It is my pleasure to inform this Honorable Body that effective January 1, 2019, I will be
appointing David Massaron acting Chief Financial Officer and Hakim Berry acting Chief
Operating Of?cer.

The Chief Financial Of?cer position was created by the Michigan Legislature by an
amendment to Public Act 279 of 1909. Public Act 182 of 2014, the Financial Review
Commission Act, provides that a vacancy in the office of CFO must be formally ?lled within
180 days of vacancy. In this case, we need the CFO position formally filled with City Council
Con?rmation by June 30, 2019. I will be formally submitting a candidate to this Honorable
Body for review and con?rmation no later than the spring of 2019 to make sure we remain in
full compliance with the act.

Sincerely,



Michael E. Duggan
Mayor

:is expected to be in. June, 2019. A charity raf?e or bingo would
greatly enhance the success of our fundraising event.

Dear Sir or Madam:

This letter is in response to your request of June 21, 2002, for a copy of your organization's determination
letter. This letter will take the place of the copy you requested.

Our records indicate that a determination letter issued in May 1973, granted your organization exemption
from federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the internal Revenue Code. That letter is still in effect.

Based on information subsequently submitted, we classified your organization as one that is not a private
foundation within the meaning of section 509(a) of the Code because it is an organization described in
section 509(a)(2).

This classi?cation was based on the assumption that your organization's operations would continue as stated
in the application. if your organization's sources of support. or its character, method of operations. or
purposes have changed. please let us know so we can consider the effect of the change on the exempt
status and foundation status of your organization.

Your organization is required to file Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax, only if its
gross receipts each year are normally more than 325.000. If a return is required, it must be filed by the 15th
day of the ?fth month after the end of the organization's annual accounting period. The law imposes a
penalty of $20 a day, up to a maximum of $10,000, when a return is filed late, unless there is reasonable
cause for the delay.

All exempt organizations (unless specifically excluded) are liable for taxes under the Federal insurance
Contributions Act (social security taxes) on remuneration of $100 or more paid to each employee during a
calendar year. Your organization is not liable for the tax imposed under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act
(FUTA).

Organizations that are not private foundaliOns are not subject to the excise taxes under Chapter 42 of the
Code. However, these organizations are not automatically exempt from other federal excise taxes.

Donors may deduct contributions to your organization as provided in section 170 of the Code. Bequests,
legacies, devises, transfers, or gifts to your organization or for its use are deductible for federal estate and
gift tax purposes if they meet the applicable provisions of sections 2055, 2106, and 2522 of the Code.

RE: Charter Revision; Overview and Issues

As Council Members know, the ballot initiative for a general City Charter revision was narrowly
approved by Detroit voters in the August 2018 primary election. A new 9-member Charter
Commission was elected on November 6, 2018 to revise the City Charter, and sworn in on
November 20. This preliminary report is provided to: I) advise Council and the public of the
general background for a Charter Revision Commission in 2018-19; and 2) identify selected issues
from the 2012 Charter Revision, without limitation or exclusion of meritorious new issues that
Council Members or other Detroit residents may raise in the forthcoming Charter revision process.

Overview

One primary difference between the forthcoming Charter revision process and the one that
generated the current Charter that became effective in 2012 is the very different background and
purposes of the process.

The current Charter, adopted by the voters in November 201 1, effective January 1, 2012, arose out
of relatively clear circumstances and intentions. A rogue Mayor had engaged in a wide range of
corrupt and unethical practices, and Detroiters learned that City Council was powerless acting
independently under the Charter to do anything about it.? This was the immediate impetus for that

 

The ex-Mayor resigned after the ?rst day of a removal proceeding before the former Governor, which was
initiated and conducted by City Council and its staff, pursuant to state law.

I

Charter revision, which was initiated by Council prior to the regularly scheduled August 2018
date. The primary intention was to improve the Charter?s forfeiture-of-of?ce provisions set forth
at Sec. 2-107, to deal with abuses of of?ce, which complemented enhanced ethics provisions in
the new Charter,2 and secondarily to address concerns that the of?ce of Corporation Counsel could
not represent City Council adequately regarding issues involving con?icts with the Mayor.

Without attempting at this time to set forth a comprehensive list of all changes adopted in 2012,
the new Charter also:

1) ?xed some technical problems with a previous Council-by-districts initiative adopted
by the electorate in 2009, and required the new Council to elect its own leadership
(Secs. 3-108 and 4-103); and

2) introduced the following more signi?cant new features compared to the previous 1974
Charter:

I Attempted to create more independence from the Mayor in the Charter-
mandated position of Corporation Counsel and the Law Department
(Sec. 

- Required mandatory, pre-?ling intra-govemment dispute resolution
procedures before litigation can be initiated between branches of
government, such as Council and the Mayor (Sec. 

0 Gave City Council con?rmation authority over the appointment of six
(6) key department heads (Sec. 4? 1?1 

Introduced a new Inspector General position to root out ?waste, fraud
and abuse? (Sec. 7-5301);

0 Introduced new Green Initiatives and Technologies provisions assigned
to the Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department

(BSEED) (Sec. 6-509), including a recycling mandate (Sec. 7-403);

I Required proportional funding for oversight agencies (sec. 8?214);

 

2 The Charter Commission Chair characterized the new Charter?s ethics provisions set forth at Sec. 2-lO6.l
as a Elli" model, after a ?erce attack dog featured in a Hollywood movie of that name.

3 The new Charter also expressly makes Corporation Counsel responsible for enforcing compliance with
the Charter There has been a great deal of informal debate about this, which places
Corporation Counsel in the uncomfortable position of serving both as trusted legal advisor to City of?cials,
and also as the enforcer of the Charter against these same public of?cials who are their clients. Both the
increased independence of Corporation Counsel, and its expressly designated role as Charter enforcer, like
most of the other major innovations listed here, have been less than robustly implemented in practice since
2012.

0 Proposed the creation of Community Advisory Councils (Sec. 9-101);

I Expanded the duties of the City?s Risk Management Council (Secs. 9-
701 and 9-702); and

0 Proposed city-sponsored insurance assistance (Sec. 9-801), a well-
intentioned reform that, to understanding, proved simply
impractical as well as probably impossible under state law.

Several of the above provisions have proven dif?cult to implement, and may deserve further study
and possible amendment or repeal in a new Charter revision process.

In contrast, the 2018 Charter revision was driven by no particular policy imperatives. Rather, the
previous 1997 Charter had stated that a new Charter revision initiative proposal should be on the
summer 2018 primary election ballot, and the 2012 Charter Commission simply adopted that
language verbatim (Sec. 9-403). As noted at the outset, a slim majority of City voters voted for
this next Charter revision.

The complex question of which public policies, among an extraordinarily wide range of
options, the new Charter Commission should address is wide open, and deserves serious
consideration and consultation with Detroit elected of?cials and residents. And to be both
fair and honest, serious consideration should be given to the axiom that ?restraint is a far wiser
course than revolution if chaos is to be avoided.?

Discussion

After adoption of the new Charter in 2011, which became effective in 2012, a few amendments
were successfully submitted to the voters as Charter amendments and adopted at the next election:

I See. 2-106.4 Gifts and Gratuities: Authorizing an ordinance to determine what ?other
things of value? may be awarded but do not raise any serious ethical concerns.

I See. 2-106.5 One Year Post-Employment Prohibition: Narrowing this provision to
exempt personal service contracts, which do not present the same ethical concerns.

0 Sec. 3-109 Nominating Petitions: Setting forth the speci?c number of petition signatures
required for each elective of?ce, instead of with reference to the number of votes cast at

the preceding election.

- Sec. 75-203 Civil Litigation: Authorizing Corporation Counsel to take action on their own
initiative pursuant to Sec. 75?209, rather than only when directed to do so by the Mayor.

The above amendments represented the technical issues that were most clearly problematic and
easily resolved in the language of the 2012 Charter. In addition to them, Council and residents of
the City may (or may not, depending on how they weigh the issues) wish to consider amending
the following provisions:

- Sec. 7.5-201 Law Department: Provisions restricting City of?cials to receive advice and
representation o_nly from Corporation Counsel and the Law Department are unduly
restrictive; City of?cials, including City Council when it is at odds with the Administration
on particular issues, should have the same rights and scope of action as anyone else in
Michigan when seeking legal representation and legal redress. This is especially
problematic when lawyers hired by Council to advise them on matters are inhibited from
doing so.

I Sec. 7.5-208 Intra?Govemment Dispute Resolution: These requirements, including the
requirement that representation and advice come only from the Law Department and/or
?outside? counsel, have proven to be cumbersome and to cause extreme delay in practice.
They might well be eliminated, or signi?cantly revised in some way that would make
dispute resolution short of litigation more workable.

I See. 8-208 Budget Adoption: Expressly clarify that this applies to the Detroit Water and
Sewerage Department (DWSD).

0 Sec. 9-507 Service Fees: Expressly clarify that this applies to retail water, sewerage and
drainage bills charged by the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD).

- Sec. 7-1202 Powers of the Board of Water Commissioners: Expressly clarify that 
retail water, sewer and drainage charges shall be established by the board of water
commissioners and shall be approved by the city council, as set forth in Section 56-3-
12(c) of the City Code.

0 Either delete or amend major innovations in the 2012 Charter listed above (green
initiatives, community advisory councils, funding for oversight agencies, risk management
council, and perhaps other provisions that could be improved after further study), that have
so far proved in practice to be unworkable, generally at least in part because of drafting
issues regarding their speci?c language.

0 Provide that the Council President and President Pro Tem will be the two at-large members
in order of the largest number of votes received, instead of Council electing its own
leadership, which has proved to be very time-consuming and unnecessarily divisive in
practice.

0 Deal with the inherent con?ict of interest plaguing Corporation Counsel as the of?cial
responsible for enforcing Charter compliance, where s/he also has to be trusted legal
advisor for City of?cials and employees.

Based on events at the new Charter Commission?s initial meeting on November 20, LPD has a
few friendly procedural suggestions intended to help the Commission organize itself to provide
more control and direction over future meetings. The following are a few suggestions that may
be passed onto the commission:

 Engage a person(s) to act as Parliamentarian for meeting and training for individual(s) if
necessary;

I Adopt Robert?s Rules of Order for parliamentary procedure;

0 The CFO to draft for City Council?s adoption a budget amendment that would determine
the budget for the hiring of staff and for of?ce space;

Engage the Detroit Police Department to keep control of meetings, similar to how City
Council?s Executive Protection Unit serves City Council;

0 Determine a general timeline on how the revision process will proceed, e. an overview
of the current charter, engagement/comment process, writing process, etc.; and

0 Determine where and how often the commission will meet.

LPD expects this will in all likelihood be only the ?rst of many reports regarding the next Charter
revision. There are many, many issues that may have to be debated and thought through in the
course of making the Charter the most clear, use?Jl and effective framework for local government
that it can be. The above list of recommendations is most de?nitely n_ot intended to be authoritative
or comprehensive, only as a checklist of issues that have been the subject of previous consideration
and debate. Council or residents may have other concerns, priorities or suggestions, and if so they
should be brought forward. This preliminary report is intended to start that process and the
conversations necessary to carry it forward.

If Council has any other questions or concerns regarding this subject, LPD will be happy to provide
?thher research and analysis upon request.
