Funding Source: General Fund
Dennis Sullivan, Department of Information Technology, presented. Nan Baker asked if services were
seamless during the transition between vendors, with the effective date of 5/1/2019 and asked why this
amendment only extends services for one year. Dale Miller asked why services were not bid out if a new
vendor will be providing maintenance services. Lenora Lockett explained that if an amendment is utilized
to assign interest, there needs to be consistency between the current and new vendor and may represent
a name change, the company being bought out or modified but is still the original contractor; and further
explained that if the original vendor had gone out of business that an amendment would not be
appropriate to address that situation but rather a new contract with the new entity. Dale Miller asked
what the relationship between Telerik, Inc. and Progress Software Corporation was. Ms. Lockett indicated
she would need to refer to the amendment to determine that relationship, but stated that it is typically
the pattern, that an assignment indicates an existing relationship remains between the 2 vendors. Ms.
Baker asked for clarification on who the original vendor was and what circumstances led to the assignment
of interest. Kahlil Seren stated that an internet search indicates that the parent organization, Progress
Software Corporation, owns Telerik, Inc. and believes this software may have been transferred from
Telerik, Inc. to the parent organization. Dennis Kennedy asked for clarification on why the time extension
is only through 4/30/2020 when a pricing lock was provided until 2021 and asked if there has been a
decision as to whether this contract will be extended through 2021. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve
