Major Funding Trends in Grant making

Description

Large Scale System Change

Funders are approaching grants as community or
programmatic investments with a focus on solving specific
system change issues and driving towards a big impact.

Cross-Sector Collaboration

Funders are making collaboration as a requirement for
grant applicants. The goal is to promote connections across
health care, social service and public health systems to
meet the needs of individuals and communities.

Improving Health Outcomes

Funders are focusing on supporting collaborative, systemsbased solutions that make measurable improvements in
health outcomes and are replicable in other communities.
