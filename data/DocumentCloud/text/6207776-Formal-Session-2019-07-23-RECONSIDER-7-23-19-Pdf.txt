Honorable City Council:

Re: Spirit Plaza; Petition No. 1773 The Department of Public Works City
Engineering Division, in conjunction with The General Services Department
requests the permanent closure of Woodward Avenue, from Jefferson Avenue to
Larned Street, for the purpose of continuing the activation of the Spirit Plaza
programming.

On June 12, 2017, the City of Detroit closed the referenced segment of Woodward to
activate the Spirit Plaza for an initial pilot period of 90 days.

On November 21, 2017, City Council originally approved Petition NO. 1773, which
provided for extending the temporary closure of the above referenced segment of
Woodward through the spring of 2018, so that the evaluation period could continue
through the fall and winter seasons.

In October of 2018, DPW requested City Council approval to extend the temporary
closure for a period to culminate on November 15, 2019, upon which time a
recommendation was to be brought back to City Council for the Plaza?s optional
additional year extension.

DPW is now requesting, on behalf of the General Services Department, City Council to
vacate as a public right-Of-way and convert into a private easement for public utilities of
the full width of the above referenced segment of Woodward to facilitate the established,
ongoing and future programming.

This vacation to easement, if authorized by Your Honorable Body, establishes GSD as
the agency, who is responsible for ensuring that the Plaza is appropriately maintained. In
addition, this vacation will allow for coordinating all outreach efforts to impacted
stakeholders, as well as providing the mechanism for continued planning for events and
space programming. of Detroit?s Recreation Department and Special Events
team to will continue to operate with the established agreement outlining Speci?c
responsibilities for each agency, thereby ensuring that the Plaza is being programmed in a
manner that maximizes its usage and is consistent with the vision of it being the
?People?s Plaza?. We will continue to provide the opportunity to employ a more
expansive outreach effort to individuals that encounter the space on a daily basis,
including all employees and regular visitors to the CAYMC. The vacation to easement
will also provide the Opportunity to install semi-permanent structures to enhance the
quality of programming and the overall experience in the public space.
