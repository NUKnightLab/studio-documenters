EVALUATION/RECOMMENDATIONS

 EVALUATION

I-90 WB Intermodal Connector 56T (Tower City)

• Left turn from I-77 WB exit ramp to E 30th is prohibited
• Prospect Ave. from I-90 WB exit ramp to Tower City is a
more direct route
• No revision to Prospect Avenue’s Functional Classification
required

Connector
•
•

Recommendation: Remove E 30th , Broadway Ave., and
E14th St. from the Intermodal Connector

City to the Intermodal Connector

5-29

 EVALUATION
I-90 WB Intermodal Connector 56T (Tower City)
Revise 500 feet of E14th Street, from Broadway Ave. to Orange
Ave., from a Principal Arterial to a Major Collector.
Step 1:
A principal arterial should have an AADT of 10,000 to 30,000, E
14th only has an AADT of 6,932 and this small section of 500' of
principal arterial changes to a major connector at US 422.
Step2: Urban major collectors are over under-represented in
Cuyahoga County.
Step 3: E 14th is already on the federal aid system as a principal
arterial.
Recommendation: Revise 500 ft of E14th from a principal arterial
to a major collector
