RE:

Monthly Update

Board Members,
The holiday season is upon us. A time for reflection, thanksgiving, and peace. A time for family and friends.
But before we get to the festivities, we have a very important task at hand. The passing of our budget for
2020. We made a lot of progress this year and the budget we are proposing to you continues to build on
that work. It provides us with opportunity and investment in our team and our future. It allows us to continue
to work with our partners to build a better community. This budget takes us one step closer to providing
premiere public transportation services that will set us apart as a service our community cannot live without.
I look forward to working with you and our team to be the absolute best we can be now and into the future.
Yours in accessible transportation,
Dawn Distler
Executive Director

CALL TO ORDER
Mr. DeJournett called the meeting to order at 9:00 a.m.
AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION
None
RECOGNITION
Mr. Jake Altman with the Ohio Auditor of State office presented the Auditor of State Award with
Distinction to METRO’s Finance Department. Out of over 6,000 audits performed across the state, less
than 4% receive this award, which shows this is a remarkable accomplishment.
A thank you card from the community of Barberton was read by Mr. DeJournett, thanking METRO for
having a Touch-A-Truck at the recent MumFest. It stated that our drivers were exceptional in working
with the children who toured our bus, and expressed appreciation for our presence there.
APPROVAL OF MINUTES
Mr. DeJournett asked for a motion to approve the minutes of the September 24, 2019 meeting. Ms.
Licata made a motion for approval, seconded by Mr. Prentice. The minutes were unanimously
approved.
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE & SERVICE PERFORMANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
Chair: Mark Derrig
Mr. Derrig reported that the committee met two weeks prior. In Maintenance, he indicated that road
calls were trending lower, and that the biyearly fumigation of the buses had been done. Preparations
were being made for snow and ice and the coming winter weather. Operations was still trending low
with unscheduled overtime. Customer Service had 23,032 passengers transported via paratransit in the
previous month. Mr. Derrig turned it over to Bambi Miller, Director of Customer Care and Mobility
Solutions. She spoke about the OhioHOPES program using the brochure that had been placed at the
table. OhioHOPES helps elderly citizens who are victims of abuse. Senior abuse has specific
challenges, in that, abuse goes unreported due to fear of retribution. OhioHOPES links seniors with
resources across the state’s 88 counties.
6

 Mr. Derrig also reported that all ten of the new transit buses are out and in service.
Ms. Shea reported on the successful rollout of the mobile ticketing program. About $18,000 worth of
fares have been sold since the program rolled out in August. One of the most popular tickets purchased
is the NCX bundle.
Mr. DeJournett pointed out that in Maintenance, our average monthly repeat road calls are down.
FINANCE & AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Chair: Nicholas Fernandez
Mr. Fernandez reported that the committee did meet. Financials and the Dashboard were reviewed,
everything was green, and so not much discussion was needed. A couple of policy updates will be
coming in the next month or so on credit card use, and other financial policies. Most of the meeting
centered on the budget, and the intention is to bring the budget to the board in November.
Mr. Fernandez deferred to Mr. Hampshire to provide a description of Resolution 2019-14 which
authorizes the award of a Guaranteed Maximum Price contract for the combined construction projects
consisting of the North Bus Barn Renovation, the Junk Yard Demolition, and the Independence Turn
Around. Mr. Hampshire indicated that all three projects are ready to break ground, which necessitated
determining costs. The GMP is the “not to exceed” price for the construction manager, and that if it is
exceeded, they are at risk for the remainder of the project. The recommended GMP was $3.3M, with
$2.7M of that being for the actual construction of the building structures. There are also two significant
allowances included. The first is for natural gas detection, in the amount of $185,000. The second is
for solar panel reconfiguration in the amount of $340,000. Grant funding has been obtained to cover
$1.2M of the cost.
Mr. Hampshire went on to provide a description of Resolution 2019-15, which authorized the award of
a 5 year contract for leasing tires. Although three companies submitted bids, only one of them met the
“Buy America” requirements. Ultimately, Goodyear won the bid with an amount of $1.8M over 5
years.
Resolution 2019-13 authorizing the purchase of three (3) passenger vehicles for subrecipients of the
Federal Transit Administration’s Section 5310 funding program was presented for consideration. Mr.
Fernandez made a motion for approval, seconded by Ms. Licata. All those present voted ‘yes’.
Resolution 2019-13 was approved by the Board.
Resolution 2019-14 authorizing the award of a Guaranteed Maximum Price contract for the combined
construction projects consisting of the North Bus Barn Renovation, Junk Yard Demolition, and
Independence Turnaround was presented for consideration. Mr. Fernandez made a motion for approval,
seconded by Ms. Licata. All those present voted ‘yes’, except for Mr. Spring, who voted ‘no’.
Resolution 2019-14 was approved by the Board.
Resolution 2019-15 authorizing the award of a five (5) year contract for the lease of tires to The
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company was presented for consideration. Mr. Fernandez made a motion
for approval, seconded by Mr. Prentice. All those present voted ‘yes’. Resolution 2019-15 was
approved by the Board.

 Mr. Rector reported that the APD Group (Asset Protection and Development) did meet. There are still
Operators being hired to keep the numbers where they should be. There were recently 15 more
Operators hired. There were approximately 1500 hours of training last month. The OSHA recordable
rate fell slightly and lost time increased slightly. There were no work-related injuries. Mr. Rector
reminded everyone that the Holiday Luncheon is coming up on December 18th from 11a-4p. He
mentioned that a broader property-wide tobacco policy is in the works. He also noted that there were
nine accidents in September, three of which were preventable.
GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
Mr. Spring reported that the committee did not meet.
OFFICERS’ REPORT
President:
Mr. DeJournett mentioned that he would be sending an email to the Board with APTA conference dates
of 2020 seminars for each person to choose. In particular, he wanted each member to consider
attending the August seminar for Transit Board Members & Administrators. He also pointed out that
next month we would be approving the budget and he encouraged board members to attend the Finance
Committee meeting and to look over the minutes.
Executive Director:
Ms. Distler thanked the Board for approving the projects that are coming up. Another Official-ly On
Board event took place, where we invited County Council to participate. They had the opportunity to
see the new transit vans, as well as ride by the Independence Turn Around that will soon be remodeled.
They were pleased at the investment that was being made in that area of town, and impressed with the
number of passengers that go through the property. County officials were also pleased to learn about
the FlexRide program that helps employers get employees to their workplace due to transportation
challenges.
OTHER BUSINESS

 Operations Monthly Update – October 2019
The training hours for the month of October totaled 2,444 . The training consisted of New Hire Training,
Refresher Training, Line Service training, Specialty Training, and mandatory training per the Preventable
Accident Policy.
On Monday, October 7, 2019, Dawn Distler and De Havilland McCall had an opportunity to meet with
Mr. Billy Taylor, the Director of Global Diversity and Inclusion for the Goodyear Tire and Rubber
Company. During the course of the meeting, information was provided on techniques to effectively
engage employees in the Diversity and Inclusion process, and on ways to become more involved with
the minority community.
The Director of Operations, De Havilland McCall, attended an Opportunity and Inclusion Committee
meeting held at the Greater Akron Chamber on October 8, 2019. Ms. McCall is on a sub-committee for
Minority Business Enterprise (MBE). The committee’s task is to guide the areas where the Chamber
should focus its efforts and identify where assistance in the business community is needed and in
becoming more inclusive.
The Customer Experience and Service Performance Committee met on Wednesday, October 16, 2019 at
the Robert K. Pfaff Transit Center (RKPTC). The committee report was presented by Mr. Mark Derrig on

 OCTOBER 2019 CUSTOMER CARE & MOBILITY SOLUTIONS MONTHLY REPORT
PARATRANSIT PASSENGERS: In October 2019, our paratransit programs transported a monthly high of
26,405 passengers. This represents a 15% increase over passengers transported in September 2019,
largely due to the fact that we had three more weekdays in October than September. October has been
the only month in 2019 with 23 weekdays. Additionally, as part of that total, due to more workdays, we
saw an uptick in NET passengers transported by 22% totaling 3,837 clients.
STANDDOWN FOR HOMELESS VETERANS WRAP UP
METRO has long supported this event in Summit County to assist Homeless Veterans. This year the
event served a total of 320 veterans. Twenty-one female veterans and 299 male veterans were assisted.
In addition to complimentary rides on METRO, 120 veterans choose to receive complimentary haircuts
with another 20 vouchers given out to veterans for use at a later date, and Goodwill provided 303
vouchers to be used in their retail stores. Each voucher entitled the veterans to receive $30 in
merchandise at no cost to them. As with other Summit County programs, this is a true collaboration of
support from various agencies for our veterans, and METRO serves a very important part of this event.
DEPARTMENT OF JOB AND FAMILY SERVICES NET AUDIT
METRO was audited on our Non-Emergency Transportation (NET) contract that we hold from DJFS. The
representative was very impressed and appreciative of our 100% transparency in the information we
provide monthly from our Ecolane software, as well as our open book (software) approach to our onsite audits. Once again, we had no findings and no corrective actions from our 2019 Audit.
PARATRANSIT EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES
We are preparing to conduct another Paratransit survey in December to check in with our passengers
and ask for their opinions on a variety of items. We make every attempt to stay close to our passengers,
to ensure we are meeting their expectations. In the last three months our Department has seen an
increase in applications received and processed by 5%, and we performed 29 wheelchair weight and
inspection/individual advocacy trainings. Our team continues to make processing all applications a
priority. Mobility has conducted group trainings on METRO services at Portage Lakes Career Center,
State Support Team 8, Tallmadge High School JOG group, and Stow-Munroe Falls High School. As a team
we attended or presented at a number of agencies including East Akron Neighborhood Development
Emergency Taskforce, Tri-County Transition Council, CareSource, Buckeye Health Plan, Stow Kent
Gardens Health Fair, Coordinated Intake Pilot Program with Direction Home, Northeast Ohio Travel
Training Quarterly meeting, several On The Table events, the Akron Senior Commission meeting, and the
Greater Advisory Committee Age Friendly Cities meeting.

 Capital Budget Expenditures 2020 
Projects 
Small Buses – We intend to use Federal funds to purchase small buses this year. This project is expected to be 
federally funded up to 80% of the total project cost. 
Bus Stop Amenities – We have bus stops all over that need to be upgraded or replaced in order to keep them 
in a state of good repair. This cost will cover the design and materials needed to complete the projects. 
Shelters have a useful life of about eight (8) years. We anticipate this project being federally funded up to 80% 
of the total project cost. 
To ensure continued compliance with ADA guidelines, we will be modifying around 40 bus shelter locations to 
bring them within specifications.   
Non‐revenue Vehicles – These include the purchase of shop trucks, department vans, and Road Supervisor 
vehicles. Some of our vehicles were purchased and others are currently on a leasing program. The needs for 
this budgeting cycle consist of the cost for a Polaris type vehicle for snow removal at RKP, a scissor lift that is 
past its useful life, and a trailer to transport large equipment. 
Facility Rehab and A&E – These projects include things that actually need to be repaired or replaced. This 
budget cycle includes costs to repair concrete at RKP, replace the aluminum panels at RKP, replace the fencing 
on Broadway, replace the flooring in in the vestibules and restrooms, replace lighting on Ghent Rd., remodel 
the public restrooms at RKP, provide lockers for Vehicle Service, etc. Other costs are included in case we have 
an emergency repair to the HVAC, elevator, etc.  
Hybrid Bus Battery – In 2009/2010, METRO purchased 4 Hybrid Electric buses. These buses are equipped with 
an Allison EP 40 Electric Drive unit. The Battery Packs that store energy for the hybrid drive units on these 
buses have reached their useful life and are due for replacement to maintain reliable service from these 
vehicles. 
Computer Systems/Radio Upgrade – We are upgrading our technology across the company in an effort to 
increase efficiency. Some of our software and hardware is old and needs to be upgraded. Upgrades included in 
this budgeting cycle are licenses, cradlepointes, cameras, complete two way radio replacement, NVR (network 
video recorder) replacements, etc.  
Rail Rehab – We need to keep our bridges and at grade crossings on our rail in a safe operating conditions for 
both train and vehicular traffic. 
Per the 2019 5‐Year Maintenance Plan for the Sandyville line, this work includes 1 bridge rehabilitation, the 
beginning of a tie replacement program and repair of 2 grade crossings.

 2020 Significant Budget Expense Variances &
Assumptions 
Salaries and Wages – The salaries and wages line item includes up to a three percent increase for annual 
increases, step increases for the unions, SOLA increases/year‐end bonuses, and a safety bonus.  
Both Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBA) have requirements regarding the amount and frequency of step 
increases, bonuses, allowances, etc. that have been taken into consideration when preparing next year’s 
budget. 
Benefits – The benefits line item includes holiday pay, vacation pay, personal days, sick pay, healthcare costs, 
tool/boot allowances, OPERS as well as the OPERS pick‐up, uniforms, Medicare, and Worker’s Comp. There is 
a health care lag included in this line item to cover a period up to six months in the new fiscal year when 
claims come in that occurred in the prior fiscal year, but not processed or paid until the new fiscal year. 
By implementing new cost saving measures and programs, we anticipate the cost of healthcare remaining flat 
in 2020.  
Professional Technical – This line item includes such services as legal fees, sales tax administration fees, real 
estate taxes, web site design, lab work for drug testing and mandatory physicals, Employee Assistance 
Program fees (counseling services provided to all employees at no charge to the employee), Educational 
Assistance Program (reimbursing employees for taking educational classes/college courses to further their 
knowledge in a particular area of study), officers that work at our facilities, rail inspections, schedule printing, 
and bus pass printing. 
Next year’s budgeted amount includes the cost of hiring a reputable firm to walk METRO through the strategic 
planning process. Ultimately, the Strategic Plan will be a five to ten year plan that will guide METRO in 
providing better service to Summit County. The plan will also include an FTA mandated on‐board study. We 
anticipate the cost coming in under budget. The final recommendation will come before the 
Planning/Marketing/Rail Committee first, and then the board for approval. 
Purchased Transportation – This line item has been changed to reflect the revised projection for miles 
contracted out to Thomas Limousine (TL) in 2020. The original projection was based on overall miles that TL 
drives on METRO’s behalf; however, those miles included deadhead and no‐show miles. These miles are 
important for our federal reporting requirements, but not for actual invoicing and cost projections. Our 
invoicing is based on actual people in the seats being transported. We are not invoiced for no shows and 
deadhead time to and from the client (TL absorbs that cost). We are currently in year three of a five year 
contract with TL. The fee per mile in 2020 will increase from $4.15 to $4.40. They provide evening, weekend, 
and daytime overflow trips for our four Paratransit services that include our SCAT Temporary program (for 
persons with disabilities who cannot access line service , and reside in Summit County; these services are 
mostly for medical and work trips); SCAT Senior program (for Summit County residents over the age of 62, 
these services are mostly for medical and work trips); ADA as defined and required by the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (operates ¾ of a mile from an active line service route, eligible individuals must have a barrier 
preventing them from using regular line service); and Contract Services (Paratransit services based on a 
24
contract with an established organization). 

 All of these programs have different qualifications, restrictions, and hours of operations. Thomas Limousine 
helps with all four of the above mentioned programs when we have overflow during the day, evening trips 
after hours, and weekend trips.  
METRO will continuously monitor our costs in this area to ensure that we are utilizing our resources in the 
most cost effective way.
