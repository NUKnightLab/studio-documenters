PROPOSAL:

10:45 a.m.

Green Acres Collective, LLC appeals the decision of the Buildings Safety n
Engineering and Environmental Department’s Special Land Use Review dated
December 6, 2018 which states; the subject property has been identified as
being within 1000 radial feet of a Drug Free Zone in a M3 (GENERAL
INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT). This case is appealed because appeals to the Board
of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any person, firm, partnership or
corporation, or by any City department, commission, board or other City
agency which is aggrieved 1) by a decision of an enforcing officer, or 2) by any
decision made by the Buildings and Safety Engineering Department involving
Conditional Uses. Also, the Buildings, Safety Engineering, and Environmental
Department shall not approve any request under this Chapter for a medical
marihuana caregiver center in a Drug Free Zone. The locational specifications
related to drug-free zones of subsection 354(b)(1) of this section may not be
waived or modified by the Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental
Department, nor the Board of Zoning Appeals. Applications that are not
consistent with the locational specifications of subsection (b)(1) of this section
shall be considered ineligible and shall be dismissed. Also, the proposed
MMCC located at 10371 Northlawn has been identified as being in a Drug Free
Zone (DFZ) based on its proximity to Generators Club of Detroit located at
4244-4268 Oakman. Generators Club of Detroit is a legally, operating, youth
center/school located approximately 470 radial feet from Generators Club of
Detroit, the subject property at 10371 Northlawn becomes ineligible to
establish a Medical Marihuana Growers Faculty. (Sections 61-4-72 Appeals

Stuart Carter appeals and requests to reverse the decision of the Buildings
Safety Engineering and Environmental Department (BSEED 104-18) which
determined the location at 4400 Oakam Blvd. to be in a Drug Free Zone (DFZ)
therefore ineligible to develop a Medical Marihuana Grower Facility (MMGF) in
a M3 (General Industrial District). This case is appealed because the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals from and review any order,
requirement, decision, or determination that is made by an administrative
official in the administration of this Zoning Ordinance, or any decision made
by the Buildings and Safety Engineering Department involving Conditional
Uses. Also, no Conditional Use shall be approved by the Buildings and Safety
Engineering Department, or the Board of Zoning Appeals on appeal, unless
each of the general findings of Section 61-3-231 are made; the proposed MMGF
site is located 430 feet of a “DRUG FREE ZONE” known as Northlawn Garden
Apartments (a family low income housing apartment HUD) located at 9560-70
Northlawn, Detroit, Mi. 48204. (Sections 61-4-71. Jurisdiction Over Appeals of
Administrative Decisions, Sec. 61-3-355 (b) (1). Permitted districts for medical
marihuana facilities; Conditional Uses, Sec. 61-3-353. Definitions; meaning of
