PRESIDENT
SELECTION COMMITTEE’S CHOICE FOR INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR GENERAL
ITEM #1
REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION, INTERGOVERNMENTAL &
VETERANS RELATIONS #295880
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 31, 2008 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
The correspondence from the Independent Inspector General Selection Committee (the “Committee”)
transmits the identity of its selection for the Office of Independent Inspector General. The Committee has
selected Mr. Patrick Blanchard.
As stated in the Committee’s correspondence, the Committee interviewed the three (3) candidates, set
forth in the Cook County Bar Association/Chicago Bar Association Joint Search Committee’s (the “Joint
Search Committee”) Candidate List, on Wednesday, July 30, 2008, and selected Mr. Patrick Blanchard by
a majority vote of the Committee. The Committee’s correspondence also notes State’s Attorney Devine’s
abstention from the voting process.
Pursuant to § 2-282(b)(1)(b) of the Independent Inspector General Ordinance (the “Ordinance”), I hereby
submit the Committee’s selection for the office of Independent Inspector General for your consideration
at the County Board meeting scheduled for Wednesday, September 3, 2008.
Pursuant to § 2-282(b)(1)(c) of the Ordinance, the Board of Commissioners must call a vote for Mr.
Patrick Blanchard’s appointment to the office of Independent Inspector General no later than Wednesday,
September 17, 2008.
Please note that the office of Independent Inspector General is not a Presidential Appointment; rather, the
Committee has recommended Mr. Patrick Blanchard to you, the Cook County Board of Commissioners,
according to the independent selection process set forth in the Ordinance.
As you will recall, in an effort to bring about transparency and accountability, I voluntarily removed
myself from the appointment process set forth in the Ordinance which I sponsored. The appointment and
selection process required the Cook County Bar Association and the Chicago Bar Association to submit,
to me, a Candidate List naming three (3) duly qualified candidates. The bar associations conducted a
national search with the assistance of Hudson Recruitment and Talent Management; Hudson reviewed
greater than three hundred twenty-eight (328) applications and résumés, from which Hudson created a
subgroup of one hundred sixteen (116) highly qualified candidates. Hudson conducted additional
screening and interviews of the highly qualified subgroup and created a slate of eleven (11) extremely
qualified candidates from which the bar associations selected the members of the Candidate List.
Upon my receipt of the Candidate List from the bar associations, and in accordance with § 2-282(b)(1)(b)
of the Ordinance, I publicly submitted the Candidate List to the Committee, at the July 22, 2008 Board
Meeting, for the Committee’s review, interview, and selection of a candidate to be submitted to the full
Board of Commissioners.
Lastly, I am grateful to the members of the Committee: Commissioner Jerry Butler, Commissioner John
P. Daley, Commissioner Peter N. Silvestri, Commissioner Gregg Goslin, State’s Attorney Richard A.
Devine, and Marynic Foster, Esq., Acting Director of the Cook County Board of Ethics, for promptly
convening and fulfilling their important role in this independent selection process.

vacant properties.
The Village intends to use each of these three buildings for industrial and commercial development. They

develop the properties in the same spirit as the 138th Street Corridor Plan in order to expand tax revenues.
Currently, there is no third-party-applicant for any of the parcels.
The Village agrees to report the status of each parcel to the Cook County Department of Economic
Development annually for five consecutive years or until the intended use is complete, whichever is last.
Also, the Village will apply for tax exempt status on each parcel once a tax deed is obtained until a
developer is designated.
The Village has retained the Law Offices of Kenneth W. Pilota and shall bear all costs to proceed to tax
deed and perform all legal and other activities associated with this program.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION URGING COOK COUNTY TO INTRODUCE AND THE
ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO APPROVE LEGISLATION, MODELED
AFTER H.R. 14: CONGRESSIONAL INTEGRITY AND PENSION
FORFEITURE ACT OF 2007, TO AMEND THE COOK COUNTY PENSION
CODE BY ADDING SPECIFIC LANGUAGE REGARDING COOK COUNTY
ELECTED OFFICIALS’ FORFEITURE OF PENSIONS FOR FELONY
CONVICTIONS
WHEREAS, in 2007, Representative Mark Kirk introduced H.R. 14: Congressional Integrity and
Pension Forfeiture Act of 2007, which outlined all of the offenses that would be reason for a Member of
Congress to forfeit their pension; and
WHEREAS, even though, in the Cook County Pension Code (40 ILCS 5/9), the word “officials” is listed
under the definition of “employee”, the Code makes a distinction throughout between “employees” and
“officials”, including its title “County Employees’ and Officers’ Annuity and Benefit Fund - Counties
Over 3,000,000 Inhabitants”; and
WHEREAS, Section 40 ILCS 5/9-235, of the Code, which requires the forfeiture of Cook County
Pensions when an employee is convicted of a felony, includes Cook County elected officials; it is
misleading and possibly open to dispute; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Pension Code should be strengthened to make it clear that Cook County
elected officials will also forfeit their pensions if convicted of a felony; and
WHEREAS, this amendment to the Cook County Pension Code will make a statement to Cook County
Taxpayers that Cook County elected officials’ pledge to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United
States, as well as the public trust; and
WHEREAS, taxpayers should not pay for the retirement benefits of Cook County elected officials who
have been convicted of a felony.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners requests
that Cook County’s Springfield lobbyists draft legislation and have it introduced, in the General
Assembly, to amend 40 ILCS 5/9, using H.R. 14 as a model, to make it clear that Cook County elected
officials will forfeit their pension if convicted of a felony; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urges the General
Assembly to take action by passing this legislation; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that copies of this Resolution shall be distributed to Governor Rod R.
Blagojevich, Senate President Emil Jones, Jr., Speaker of the House Michael J. Madigan, Senate
Republican Leader Frank C. Watson, House Republican Leader Tom Cross, and Members of the Illinois

INITIATING PERFORMANCE-BASED BUDGETING
WHEREAS, governments across the board are continually being asked to do more with less and
government officials and taxpayers continue to demand that public programs be delivered effectively and

WHEREAS, utilizing performance measurements as a component of performance-based budgeting is an
extremely effective tool in determining how a program is accomplishing its missions, goals and objectives
by measuring the delivery of products, services or processes; and
WHEREAS, the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) and the National Advisory Council
on State and Local Budgeting (NACSLB) recommend all governments use performance measurement as
an important component of long-term strategic planning to identify financial and program results, assess
past program performance and facilitate future program service and delivery; and
WHEREAS, to incorporate performance measures in the budgeting process we must develop indicators
to evaluate and monitor programs and services and integrate them into the budget framework; and
WHEREAS, past Cook County budgets have gone as far as delineating each department’s mission, goals,
objectives and accomplishments, all important steps in developing performance measures; and
WHEREAS, further development of balanced evaluation techniques or performance measures are
necessary to convert to a performance-based budget, there are additional factors that must be explored to
ensure Cook County can accommodate the budget modifications and technology requirements.

Budget Director and the Chief Information Officer, will prepare a report examining what steps are needed
so that Cook County’s general ledger and budget can accommodate the necessary modifications required

timely manner; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this report be tendered to the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners by October 15, 2008.
