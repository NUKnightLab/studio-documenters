Public Comment:
Mr. Steve Salvi, a resident of Bedford, Ohio stated that his mother was a library volunteer and
his former company was a vendor. He stated that the Southeast Branch staff is helpful in every
way with finding materials. The issue is too many patrons at the branch and their disruptive
behavior. He stated that he visits other branches because he does not like the atmosphere,
when he is about a mile away from the Southeast Branch. He stated that there is a failure to
monitor and enforce policies, specifically cell phones – they are disruptive. He stated he visits
the Branch 4-5 times a week and it’s been consistent throughout time.

Finance Committee Report:
Finance Committee Chair Leonard stated the Finance Committee met this afternoon and had
robust discussion. Assistant Finance Director and Deputy Fiscal Officer Bob Dolan stated we
received a small property tax distribution in January, which is typically the case, with a much larger
distribution expected and already received in February. The PLF is a little less than anticipated, but
we still feel we will be on target for the year, based on estimates, but will continue to monitor. We
had a record month for fines and fees, with passport sales hitting an all-time high.
Some expenditures at 90-100% which is because of encumbrances. Benefits are a little higher than
normal, because we make the Health Savings Account full contribution each year in January, that
will even out as the year goes on. All other expenditures as expected.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE
My Next Chapter
I recently announced my intent to retire this August after more than
40 years as a librarian and 16 years as the Executive Director of
Cuyahoga County Public Library (CCPL). Since 2003, it has been my
great privilege to serve as Executive Director of this organization.
When I reﬂect on my time with CCPL, I am amazed by and proud of
all that we have accomplished in service to our community.
• From enduring state funding cuts to completing CCPL’s largest
capital improvement program.
• From building an early childhood service model that’s nationally
recognized to expanding our services in adult basic education.
• From streamlining our physical material processes and delivery to
embracing and leading on digital content.
I am especially proud of how our library system has adapted and
evolved to ensure we can continue to support individual opportunity
and community progress, and how we have embraced technology
to deliver service to our community and advance our organizational
priorities: reading, lifelong learning and civic engagement. “We
SERVE” is not simply a motto, it’s truly an expression of the values I
see at work every day at CCPL.
Words simply cannot convey the emotion I feel about the Library’s
essential role in the community or express the great pride and
fulﬁllment I have enjoyed in leading this tremendous organization. I
thank all of the staff for their service to our community and support
over these past 16 years.
As our Board of Trustees embarks on a national search process, I am
conﬁdent they will ﬁnd the right leadership to continue the important
work that we do for our community.
In my next iteration I look forward to enjoying our top-rated library
system’s unparalleled commitment to excellence – as a customer.
Regards,

Executive Director

MAKING A DIFFERENCE
When BSL Anna Benedikt learned that her presenter for Essays for the SAT, ACT and College
Entrance program would not be able to attend on February 12th because of a family situation,
she was undaunted. Rather than cancel the program, Anna got permission to use the presenter’s
slides, handouts and notes to facilitate the program herself! The program garnered 21 enthusiastic
teens who came away with effective strategies for the essay portion of the SAT, ACT and college
entrance application. One participant came up to shake Anna’s hand at the end of the program
and thank her for doing such a great job!

A 5th grade student has been attending the Homework Center at the Brook Park Branch since
September of this year. She has been struggling primarily with math but also seeks help in
additional subject areas, such as language arts, science and social studies. The student’s parent
came in to the Homework Center to extend her thanks to the tutors. She was incredibly thankful for
the work we have done with her child and let us know her child’s GPA had increased from a 1.6
to a 3.4. It was wonderful to hear the positive impact we have had on her learning.

SYSTEM HIGHLIGHTS

The coordinator of the Woodrow Digital Literacy Project praised North Olmsted Branch
staff for allowing them to use the branch’s Homework Center room and computers on Friday
afternoons to teach their clients how to use computers and to prepare them for re-entering
the workforce with digital skills. The Woodrow Digital Literacy Project is a local nonproﬁt
organization that provides a safe, stable and supportive environment to women in recovery.

Student Friends at the Brooklyn Branch had an enlightening and very tasty experience
learning to make smoothies with the branch’s new Charlie Cart, which incorporates science,
technology and math. They watched how smoothies are made with the Vitamix blender on
the cart, and then they eagerly prepared veggies and fruit to create their own recipe by

The Independence Branch held a Guppy Tank program to teach students the basics of
entrepreneurship. The students met real business owners, developed a creative and
persuasive pitch for a business concept, and presented their pitch before a panel of judges
the ﬁnal week. The winning concept was a double-decker water bottle that holds two different
drinks and is customizable with different color combinations and accessories, such as a
mister for the water side. The winner was inspired by his own experiences as a soccer player.
He likes drinking water during the game and lemonade after the game as a treat. Judges
were impressed by the winner’s attention to detail, his personal story and his clear and
conﬁdent presentation.

Financial Statement Analysis
February 2019

Revenues
As was mentioned in the analysis for January, our largest distribution is typically in the
month of February. Our distribution for February was $14.8 million. Adding that to our
distribution from January brings us to nearly half of what we expect for the year. We will
see some small amounts each month until we receive our next large advance, which is
typically in July or August.
Our February distribution for the PLF was again smaller than anticipated. As we do
every month, we will monitor this account closely. Last year we started out the year
with smaller distributions than expected and then as the year progressed, we received
as expected and also the difference to make up for some of the smaller distributions.
Patron Fines and Fees are currently exceeding our estimates. Once again it is passport
fees and photos which are the reason for the increase. Sale of Resale Supplies is also
slightly exceeding our estimates.
All other revenue accounts are where we would expect them to be for the month and
the year.

Expenses
Expenses for Salaries and Benefits are all within budget with the exception of the
Insurance Benefits and as was mentioned last month all of the HAS accounts were
funded for the year and it would take a couple of months for the budget not to exceed
expenses.
Many of the other expense accounts have higher than expected percentages for
expenses and encumbrances because many of these accounts have standing orders
encumbered against them to pay monthly and recurring expenses.
All other expense accounts are where we would expect them to be for the month and
the year.
Investments
We had one investment purchase. A new piece of commercial paper from Natixis NY
for $100,000 at a purchase yield of 2.82%. We are slowly seeing some of the rates
rising.

 28

Transfers
We had one transfer for the month. A transfer from the General Fund to Special School
Programming for $2800.00. The amount was to cover a match for one of the 21st
Century grants.

formerly known as the county Library and Local Government Support Fund (hereinafter referred to as

WHEREAS, the libraries have in the past found that the statutory framework for allocating that 
fund has not always resulted in satisfactory allocations, and has led to appeals and litigation involving 
the libraries; and  
 
WHEREAS, trustee and directors of the various libraries have met together in good faith to agree 
upon specific percentage allocations of the Fund for each library in order to eliminate disputes and

the Fund in the year 2007 (“2007 Base Year”); and  
 
WHEREAS, the libraries have further agreed that should the Fund receipts exceed the amount 
distributed to the libraries in the 2007 Base Year during the four‐year period from 2018‐2021, any

taking into consideration the 2020 U.S. Census population figures, and in order to foster 
continued good faith and cooperation between the libraries.  The directors will also explore 
ways and opportunities to utilize more effectively their resources to better serve their patrons 
and to achieve the goals of this agreement; 
(b) The libraries will work together through available political, civic and media channels to maintain 
and  increase the level of financial support Ohio law provides for public libraries in Ohio; and  
(c) The libraries will work jointly to meet the needs of users in the present and in the future, with
