to review the 2-040-20442911-2012 CPS Student Code of Conduct 

The SCC was adopted by the Chicago Board of Education ("Board") to help schools create a saleI Civil
and respectful lparning environment for all students and school personnel. We recognize that a school's
learning climth and stpgents' ppnaviorp improve when students:

- Know whit is expected of them at school,

- Bplieve they haye the academic and social skills to achieveI
- eceivereco 'on and raisef rdoin oodw and bah vin a riaiel and

0 Feel there i? at school pares apogt and engourages lhei?r development

To achieve a safe, civil and respectful learning environment. schools should clearly define, teach,
mogpl, and [gylew a short set of expectations for positive student behavior Schools should
also pgplaln tp the behaviors that are inappropriate. If students engage in inappropriatg
behainor. schools shouldCJ'rect. redirect. andrender consequences as needed. Any discipline imposed
should be instructional andcorreclive. and out-of-school suspensions should be used as a last resertstudent's mis onduct. Moreover the Board encoura es
principals and administrators lg and implement restgiative lustice philosophies and practices as
additional tpols tp addreps student misconguct.

SCOPE OF THE STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT

The Student Code of Conduct addresses two aspects of creating a posnive school tearning environment
(1) proactively guidinq students to positive behavior, and i2) cerrecting. redirectinq and rendering

conseguences as needegl to respond to misconduct

Proactive Guidance for Behavior
Proactive guidance focuses on preveptino problems bVJrovidind students With meaningful. posmve
feedback to enhance motivation, engagement ang performance, and teaching expectations at the
pegmnino of each year. reviewing expectations as necessarinitd treatinq minor misbehaVior as a
learning opportunity. Teaching desired behaviors to minimize misconduct is based on three principles

0 All behavior is 

0 Any repeateg behavior is serv.ng a function for the student; and

0 Student behavior can be changed.

 

 

 

Schools mu?roactivelv teach. reinforceI correct and Supervise student behavior Proactiver teaching
and reinforcing positive pehaviors greatly reduces the number of subsequent misCOnducls. and modeling
for students how they are expected to interact and perform in an educational setting lmeOVe? learning
and engagement. Whether ouidino. correcting or renderinq consequences for behavior, all staff shouio

0 Have high eapectations for student success,

0 Build positive rplationships with students,

0 Crpate consistent, predictable school and class routines,

Tpach students how to behave successfully in all school settings (classroom; cafeteria halls

bathrpoms. etc);

Provide frequent. positive feedback for appropriate behavior. and
Correct misbehavior in a calm. consistent and logical manner,

Schools should consider the foliowinq research-based practices as a qurde to creatino a safe. respectful
and productive learning climate and implement these minimum expectations for proactive behaviOral

In the edpgational before removing the student from class or school.

The SCC is not intended to address the entire spectrum of student misbehavior that may occur at school
or on school property. instead. the SCC outlines a range of appropriate responses for certain
inappropriate behaviors. Local school officials retain the discretion to address student misconduct that is
not specifically included in the SCC. However. poor academic achievement is not considered-an act of
misconductI More? the SCC may not be used to discipline students for poor academic progress
or failure to complete assignments. Instead. struggling students should be considered for academic or
behavioral int?[ventig?? that target specific skills needed to improve performance. Similarly. students
must not be disciplined based totally or in part on the refusal of a student's parent or guardian to
administer or consent to the administration of medication or interventions to the student.

The SCC applies to all students. However. discipline for students With disabilities must be administered in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Appendix 52.

32

July 27, 2011

The SCC applies to actions of students during school hours. before and after school. while on school
property. while traveling on vehicles funded by the Board. at all school-sponsored events. and while usmg
the CPS Network or any computer. Information Technology Device, or somal networking websne. when
the actions affect the mission or operation of the Chicago Public Schools. Students may also be Subject
to discipline for Group 5 or 6 Inappropriate Behavrors that occur either off campus 0r during non-school
hours. including actions that involve the use of any computer. Information Technology Device 0r social
networking website. when the misconduct disrupts or may disrupt the orderly educatiOnal process in the
Chicago Public Schools.

 

The SCC provides a variety of interventions and consequences to address student misconduct that range
from the least severe intended to be instrucLive and porrective to expulsion. The SCC intends that
instructive and corrective consequences are implemented for initial incidents of misconduct. ano more
severe consequences utilized only for repeated offenses andlor inCIdents that seriously disrupt the
educational process. Before any intervention or consequence is issued. school offiCIals shall consider
options that reduce lost instructional time for the student wn?e also maintaining a sategivil?id respectful
learning environment. School offiCials shalt also consider all mitigating circumstances and shall ensure
that the student receives due process Mitigating circumstances include. but are not limited to. the
following factors:

 

 

the student's age. health, maturity. and academic placement;

0 the student?s prior conduct and record of behavior;

a the student's willingness to acknowledge misconduct attitude;

0 the level of parentlguardian cooperation and/or involvement;

- the student's Willingness to make restitution;

- the seriousness of the offense; and

the student's willingness to enroll in a student aSSistance program.

Students who are suspended sh0uld be provided a reintegration process initiated by schopl staff that

includes a review of behavioral expectations. Students who are suspended or expelled from school may
not partieipatp in extracurricular activities or school-sponsgeg events during theperiod of the Suspensmn
or expulsion. However. students on su5pension during the administration of state assessments shall be
provided an opportunity to enter the school for the purpose of takinLthe may be allowed to
participate in related test preparation agivities. upon approval by the Chief Argg Officer. Students are
subject to the rewirements and obligations set out in the Policy on Student Acceptable Use of the CPS
Network For violations of the SCC that involve impl'QILGf
use of information Technology Devices. the student mange subiect to discipline pursuant to the SCCJ in
addition to having his/her network privileges suspended.

Moreover. the followmg require special application of the SCC:

Age Appropriate Discipline

The Board recognizes that students of different grades and ages are at different developmental levels.
thus their behavior will be different and may call for different responses. In determining the appropriate
level of interventions and consequences, in addition to mitigating circumstances school offICIals sh0uld
consider the grade level and age of the student. This approach may result in a less severe intervention
and consecuence for a lower grade or younger student as compared to a higher grade or older student

The SCC does not apply to students attending prekindergarten and kindergarten and strict application of
the Code to pro-kindergarten and kindergarten students is prohibited. School officials may refer to the
SCC as a guide and may exercise discretion to issue appropriate interventions and consequences for
students in pro-kindergarten or kindergarten who engage in inappropriate behavior. However. any
decision to suspend. expel or reassign a pro-kindergarten or kindergarten student must be reviewed and
approved by the appropriate Chief Area Officer.

8 an and Res or tve Justlc andt SC

The Code also reflects alternative proactive and preventive approaches to classroom management and
student discipline. Specifically. the Board recognizes and embraces the philosophy of restorative justice
Restorative justice principles involve those who have a stake in a specific offense in collectively
identifying and addressing the harm done and the needs and obligations of all involved in order to heal
and correct the situation as fully as possible:ol?oon - 

 

- . .

. . .. 
When restorative justice practices are availableaed?adeeuate appropriater implemented
and when all parties voluntarily embrace and participate in restOrative justice practices. these practices
should be utilized as outlined in the SCC. For a list of examples of restorative practices please see

Appendix liG?ie?the?Appendiat of this policy.

POLICE NOTIFICATION

When certain misconduct by a student amounts to a criminal act or poses danger to the health. safety or
welfare of other students and staff at a school. it may be necessary and appropriate to contact the
Chicago Police Department (CPD) and to seek their assistance. The inappropriate behawors that requue
a school official to notify the CPD are identified throughout the SCC by the placement of an asterisk 
preceding the specific inappropriate behavior. If a student engages in such behavior. a school 
must contact the CPD. Whenever the schoot notifies the police concerning student misconduct. the
school must also immediater attempt to contact the parent/guardian of that student If questions arise
concerning police notification, please consult the appropriate Area Office or the Law Department at (773)
553-1700

However. there are other inappropriate behaviors by students where it is necessary for a school offiCiaI to
assess the nature of the misconduct and the extent to which the health. safety 0r welfare of other porsOns
are placed in danger by a student's actions. In those instances. school officials must make 3 Judgment
call as to whether contacting CPD is appropriate. To assist school officials in making this determination
the inappropriate behaviors preceded by double asterisks are those the SCC c0nsiders possmle
violations of criminal law. depending on the specific facts and Circumstances. and may requue police
notification, School officials should consider whether the misconduct is particmarly egregious and/or the
student persists in misconduct after being told to cease such behavior and continues to endanger the
health. safety or welfare of others.

The discretionary exercise of a school offiCiaI's authority to notify the CPD should involve the
consideration of a variety of factors. These factors include. but are not limited to

The age of the student engaging in misconduct.

The extent to which the student acted intentionally or recklessiy;

Whether the student has received prior warnings; and

Whether the student's misconduct is specifically intended to cause others physical harm or
endanger the health, safety or welfare of others.

If a school official has any questions regarding the depiSion of whether to notify the police, he or she
should contact the appropriate Area Office or. if necessary. the Law Department. as soon as posSible and
before notifying the police. However. at no time should the safety of students and/or staff be
compromised to adhere to this provision of the SCC.

BALANCED AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE STRATEGIES

Following is a listing of generally accepted balanced and restorative strategies Balanced and
restorative justice strategies may be used at the discretion of the principal in lieu of or in addition to
certain other MW interventions set forth in the SCC. when all parties voluntarily agree to
participate and the appropriate resources are available to support a meaningful effort. I

Withether?interventiees?This list is not exhaustive of all balanced and
rest0rative justice strategies.

Circles
(Also called Peacemaking Circles. Circles of Understanding)

Circles - sometimes called peacemaking Circles - use traditional circle ritual and structure to involve the
victim. victim supporters. the offender. offender supporters. police. and all interested community
members. Within the circle. people can speak from the heart in a shared search for understanding of the
event. and together identify the steps necessary to assist in healing all affected parties and prevent future
offenses.

Circles typically involve a multi-step procedure that includes: (1) application by the offender to parliCipate
in the circle process; (2) a healing circle for the victim; (3) a healing Circle for the offender. (4) a circle to
develop consen5us on the elements of a healing plan; and follow-up circles to monitor the progress of
the offender. The healing plan may incorporate commitments by the school. community. and family
members. as well as by the offender. Specifics of the circle process very fr0m community to community
and are designed locally to fit community needs and culture. Circles also may be used in schools to
improve school culture and build relationships.

54

July 27. 2011

July 27, 2011

Goals
The goals of circles include.

- Promote healing for all affected parties

- Provide an opportunity for the offender to make amends

Empower victims. community members. families. and offenders by givmg them a voice and a
shared responsibility in finding constructive resolutions

Address the underlying causes of offense behavior

Build a sense of community and its capacity for resolving conflict

Promote and share community values

Improve school culture

Implementation

A successful circle process depends upon a healthy partnership between the school and the community.
Participants from both need training and skill building in the circle process. peacemaking, and consensus
building. The school can subsequently custOmize the circle process to fit local resources and culture

Circles are not appropriate for all offenses. The connection of the offender to the community. the sincerity
and nature of the offender's efforts to be healed. the input of victims. and the dedication of the offender's
support group are key factors in determining whether a case is appropriate for the circle process

Community Service

Community service is work performed by an offender for the benefit of the school community as a format
or informal sanction. Just as neighborhoods and school communities are harmed by criminal and
delinquent activities. they can be at least partially restored by meaningful service that contributes to their
improvement. Community service offers one way an offender can be held accountable to repair some of
the harm caused by his or her criminal or delinquent actions.

Goals
The goals of community service are to:

0 Hold offenders acc0untable for the harm they have caused to the school community

0 Provide school communities with human re50urces that can assaist in maintaining a positive
school climate

0 Allow victims a voice and occasionally some direct benefit by recommending the type of
community service performed

implementation

Successful community service programs require a true partnership. Offenders in a school community can
enhance efforts of the community by providing meaningful contributions. Examples of community service
include; programs that beautify a community's environment such as cleanup efforts 0r graffiti removal
Truly restorative community service offers crime victims the opportunity to prowde input into the types of
community service they would like to see the offender perform, including activities that directly benefit the
victim or a charity or project of the victim's choice.

Peer Juries
(Also called Youth. Teen and Student Courts)

Peer Juries are programs in which y0uth work together with youthful offenders. victims and the
community which is most often the school setting. to repair harm, build competencies and help to create
safer schools and/or communities. Youth Courts typically are set up in different configurations resembling
courts, while peer juries often resemble BARJ models of Peacemaking Circles or Community Panels
They usually deal with minor delinquent and other problem behaviors,

Most programs require youth to admit guilt or accept responsibility prior to partiCipation When the
program or disposition is completed. charges or consequences are typically dismissed Agencies
operating and administering youth court programs include juvenile courts. Juvenile probation departments.
law enforcement. private nonprofit organizations, and schools.

GOals
The goals of peer juries are to:

0 Determine a fair and restorative sentence or disposition
Supervise the disposition and monitor the outcome

Implementation

Successful peer juries consist of students who are trained in restorative justice practices. including circles.
conferencing and community panels. Students who partiCIpate in peer jury sessions as victims. offenders
or community members should be encouraged to participate as volunteers on subsequent panels

55

July 27, 2011

Restorative Group Conferencing
(Also called Family Group Conferencing or Accountability Conferencing)

Restorative group conferencing involves the community of people m0st affected by the offense -- the
victim and the offender; and the family. friends and key supporters of both in deCIding the resolution of
an incident. These affected parties are brought together by a trained facilitator to discuss how they and
others have been harmed by the offense and how that harm might be repaired. To partiCipate. the
offender must admit to the offense Participation by all involved is voluntary The facilitator contacts the
victim and offender to explain the process and invnes them to the conference; the facilitator also asks
them to identify key members of their support systems, who will be invited to partimpate as well

The conference typically begins with the offender describing the inCident. followed by each parliCipant
describing the impact of the incident on his or her life, it is preferable to allow the victim to start the
discussion, if they wish. Through these narrations. the offender is laced With the human impact of the
behavior on the victim. on those close to the and on the offender?s own family and friends. The
victim has the opportunity to express feelings and ask questions about the incident After a thorough
discussion of the impact of the behavior on those present. the VlClIm is aSKed to identify deSired Outcomes
from the conference, and thus help to shape the obligations that be placed on the offender. All
participants may contribute to the problem-solving process of determining how the offender might best
repair the harm he or she has caused The session ends with partiCipants signing an agreement outlining
their expectatiOns and commitments.

Goals
The goals of restorative group conferencing include:

0 Provide an opportunity for the victim to be directly involved in the discussiOn of the offense and in
decisions regarding appropriate sanctions to be placed on the offender

0 increase the offender?s awareness of the human impact of his or her behavior and provide an
opportunity to take full responsibility for it

Engage the collective responsibility of the offender's Supporl system for making amends and
shaping the offender's future behavior

0 Allow both offender and victim to reconnect to key community support Systems

Implementation

in implementing any restorative conferencmg program. the facuitators. who may be students or school
personnel. must be trained in conferencing preparation techniques It IS critically important that the
facilitator do everything possible to ensure that neither the victims nor offenders are harmed in any way
Additionally. the victim?s participation must be completely voluntary. as ShOuid the parIICipation of the
offender. Whenever possible. the victim should be given choices concerning deCiSions such as when and
where the conferencing session will take place. who Will be present, who vvill speak first. etc The
facilitator should conduct in person. pre-conferencing both parties and make follow-up
contacts. including the monitoring of any agreement reached.

Victim Impact Panels

Victim impact panels provide a forum for victims to tell a group of offenders ab0ut the impact of the
offense on their lives and on the lives of their families. friends. and neighbors. Panels typically involve
three or four victim speakers. each of whom spends about 15 minutes telling their story In a
nonjudgmental. non-blaming manner. The offenders of the victim presenters are not present While some
time is usually dedicated to questions and answers, the purpose of the panel is for the victims to speak,
rather than for the victims and offenders to engage in a dialogue.

Goals
The goals of victim impact panels are to:

Help offenders understand the impact of their offenses on victims and communities

Provide victims with a structured, positive outlet to share their personal experiences and to
educate offenders, and others ab0ut the phySicaI. emotional. and Manual consequences of
offenses

- Build a partnership among victim servrce providers and community agencies that can raise the
individual and community awareness of the short- and long-term impacts of crime

implementation

Many criminal and iuvenile justice agencies have institutionalized victim impact panels as a sentencmg
option. Victim service organizations either implement the program for the ocurt. or work in collaboration
with justice perSOnnel to conduct panels. Whatever the structure. victim service agencies are usually best
prepared to perform the critically important role of screening victims to ensure they are sufficiently healed
from their victimization experience not to be re-traumatized by participating in the panel Other
implementation tasks are to prepare the victims fer participation. moderate the panels. gather participant
feedback information. and provide records of participants and program actiwties to the sentencing
authority.

Victim Offender Conferencing
(Also called Victim-Offender Mediation. or Victim-Offender Dialogue)

Victim offender mediation is a process that provides interested Victims an opportunity to meet their
offender, in a safe and structured setting, and engage in a mediated discussion of the offense With the
assistance of a trained mediator. the victim is able to tell the offender about the offense's physical.
emotional; and financial impact; to receive answers to lingering questions about the offense and the
offender; and to be directly involved in developing a restitution plan for the offender to pay back his or her
financial debt

This process is different from mediation as it is practiced in civil or commercial disputes. since the
involved parties are not "disputants" nor of similar status - with One an admitted offender and the other the
victim. Also. the process is not primarily focused upon reaching a settlement. although most do.
in fact. result in a signed restitution agreement. Because of these fundamental differences With standard
mediation practices, seme programs call the process a victim offender "dialogue." "meeting," or
"conference."

Goals
The goals of victim offender mediation include.

- Support the healing process of victims by providing a safe and controlled setting for them to meet
and speak with the offender on a strictly voluntary bacis

0 Allow the offender to learn about the impact of the offense on the victim and to take direct
responsibility for their behavior

0 Provide an opportunity for the victim and offender to develop a mutually acceptable plan that
addresses the harm caused by the offense

implementation

in implementing any victim offender mediation program. it is critically important to maintain sensutivity to
the needs of the victim. First and foremost. the mediatOr must do everything possible to ensure that the
victim Will not be harmed in any way. Additionally. the victim?s participation must be completely voluntary.
as should the participation of the offender. The victim should also be given chomes. Whenever possible,
concerning decisions Such as when and where the mediation session Will take place. who vvill be present,
who will speak first, etc. Cases should be carefully screened regarding the readiness of both victim and
offender to participate. The mediator should conduct in person. pre-mediatton sessions With both parties
and make follow-up contacts. including the monitoring of any agreement reached

evacuation chair in order to exit the building, including the following: an individual who is non-
ambulatory and uses a wheelchair, an individual who is unable to ambulate independently. an
individual who is unable to ambulate independently on the stairs or uneven surfaces. an individual
who requires guided physical assistance. Or a student who requires assistance due to mental or
senSOry deficits. Two types of evacuation chairs were purchased in order to meet the individual
needs of the students. Evacuation chair covers. wall brackets, and wall hooks and covers also
were purchased to ensure this important life-safety equipment is protected and mounted near a
stairway in order to have the evacuation chairs available in emergency situations. The purchases
