administrative law officer, upon issuing a final determination of liability, may require a code violator to
post with the County a compliance bond or, as appropriate, to consent to the granting and recording of a
lien against titled property. Bonds and liens shall be approved by the County comptroller and legal
counsel as to form and amount. Whenever it is necessary for the County to make repairs or otherwise
expend funds relating to a code violation for which a bond was posted, or whenever fines or costs remain
unpaid after a code violator has exhausted or failed to exhaust judicial review procedures, the
administrative law officer may, after giving the parties notice and opportunity to be heard, issue an order

Receives notice and an opportunity to be heard under the Code; and

(2)

Knowingly fails to comply with an order issued by an administrative law officer under
this article, including any requirement of a subpoena.

Each day that the violation occurs shall be considered a separate and distinct offense.
(b)
Defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to this section that a court of competent
jurisdiction stayed the order issued by the administrative law officer prior to the effective date of the
order.
(c)

Prohibited defenses. It is not a defense to this section that a person:

(1)

Came into compliance or attempted to come into compliance with the order after the date
the order by its terms required compliance; or

(2)

Sought judicial review of the order but failed to obtain a stay of the order prior to the date
the order by its terms required compliance.

liability that is not forfeited by operation of law may be reclaimed by the lawful owner provided that all
penalties and fees have been paid. The procedures for the reclamation shall be within the discretion of the
department head of the County department, agency, board or commission charged with maintaining
custody of the property. After the expiration of time during which judicial review of the final
determination of liability may be sought or 35 days after the final determination of no liability, unless
stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, any property not so reclaimed may be disposed of by the
County department, agency, board or commission charged with maintaining custody of the property as

27

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
Sec. 2-917.

Review under the Administrative Review Law.

Any final decision by the department of administrative hearings that a code violation does or
does not exist shall constitute a final determination for purposes of judicial review and shall be subject to
review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law, except as otherwise may be provided by law for
decisions issued prior to the effective date of this Ordinance.
Sec. 2-918.

Sanctions; transfer or conveyance of property.

(a)
The order to correct a code violation and the sanctions imposed by the County against a
respondent property owner as the result of a finding of a code violation shall attach to the property,
subject to the interests of all lien holders of record, as well as to the owner of the property, so that the
owner cannot avoid the finding of a code violation against the owner by conveying or transferring the
property to another. Any subsequent transferee or owner of property takes the property subject to the
findings, decision, and order of a hearing officer under this Article if a notice consisting of a copy of the
order to correct a code violation and imposing any sanctions and costs, if applicable, and a description of
the real estate affected that is sufficient to identify the real estate has been filed in the office of the
Recorder of Deeds by the County prior to the transfer or conveyance to the subsequent transferee or
owner.
(b)
Nothing in this section shall prevent the County from enforcing or seeking to enforce any
order of an administrative law officer in any manner which is in accordance with applicable law.
Sec. 2-919.

Collection of unpaid fines or other sanctions.

(a)
Any fine or other sanction or costs imposed, or any part of any fine or other sanction or
costs imposed, remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of or failure to exhaust procedures for judicial
review under the Administrative Review Law is a debt due and owed to the County and, as such, may be
collected in accordance with applicable law. Any subsequent owner or transferee of property takes subject
to this debt if a notice has been filed.
(b)
After expiration of the period within which judicial review under the Administrative
Review Law may be sought for a final determination of the Code violation, the County may commence a
proceeding in the circuit court of Cook County for purposes of obtaining a judgment on the hearing
officer's findings, decision, and order. Nothing in this Section prevents a county from consolidating
multiple findings, decisions, and orders against a person or property in such a proceeding.
(c)
Upon commencement of the action, the County shall file a certified copy of the findings,
decision, and order, which shall be accompanied by a certification that recites facts sufficient to show that
the findings, decision, and order were issued and the applicable County ordinance. Service of the
summons and a copy of the petition may be by any method provided by Section 2-203 of the Code of
Civil Procedure or by certified mail, return receipt requested, provided that the total amount of fines or
other sanctions and costs imposed by the findings, decision, and order does not exceed the amount
authorized by ordinance.
(d)
If the court is satisfied that the findings, decision, and order were entered properly within
the provisions of the applicable county ordinance and that the respondent had an opportunity for a hearing
and for judicial review:

28

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
(1)

The court shall render judgment in favor of the County and against the respondent for the
amount indicated in the findings, decision, and order plus court costs. The judgment has
the same effect and may be enforced in the same manner as other judgments for the
recovery of money.

(2)

The court may issue other orders or injunctions, or both, requested by the County to
enforce the order of the hearing officer or to correct a Code violation.

Sec. 2-920.

Except as otherwise provided by law, interest on any debt due and owing shall accrue at the rate
set for interest upon judgments.
Sec. 2-921.

Fines payable to the department of revenue.

All fines and other monies paid to the County in accordance with this article shall be remitted to
the department of revenue.
Sec. 2-922.

Petition to set aside default order.

(a)
An administrative law officer may set aside any order entered by default and set a new
hearing date, upon a petition filed within 21 days after the issuance of the order of default, if the
administrative law officer determines that the petitioner’s failure to appear at the hearing was for good
cause or, at any time, if the petitioner establishes that the petitioner was not provided with proper service
of process. If the petition is granted, the administrative law officer shall proceed with a new hearing on
the underlying matter as soon as practical.
(b)
If any order is set aside under this section, the administrative law officer shall have
authority to enter an order extinguishing any lien which has been recorded for any debt due and owing as
a result of the vacated default order and directing the County to refund any fines and/or penalties paid
pursuant to the vacated order.
Sec. 2-923.

Petition by County department for relief from a final order of liability entered in
error.

(a)
After an order of liability becomes final, the County department, agency, board or
commission which initiated or prosecuted an administrative adjudication before the department of
administrative hearings may file a written petition for relief from a final order of liability entered in error
with the department of administrative hearings.
(b)
The written petition must be filed and signed by the department, agency, board or
commission head of the initiating or prosecuting department, agency, board or commission and must set
forth facts alleging that the order of liability:
(1)

Was entered in error;

(2)

Is unsupported by the record;

(3)

Is inconsistent with applicable provisions of the Code; and

29

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
(4)

Should be vacated to avoid a miscarriage of justice. The authority to file and sign a
petition under this section is expressly reserved to the department, agency, board or
commission head and may not be delegated to other department, agency, board or
commission officials or personnel.

(c)
Upon the filing of a written petition by a department, agency, board or commission head,
the director of administrative hearings shall schedule a hearing on the petition. The scope of the hearing
shall be limited to the merits of the petition and shall not be expanded to constitute a re-litigation of the
underlying notice of violation.
(d)
If a petition is granted, the final order of liability shall be vacated. If an order is vacated
under this section, the administrative law officer shall have authority to enter an order extinguishing any
lien which has been recorded for any debt due and owing as a result of the vacated order and directing the
County to refund any fines and/or penalties paid pursuant to the vacated order.
Sec. 2-924.

Election of remedies.

In no case may the department of administrative hearings conduct an administrative adjudication
proceeding for an alleged violation of the County Code where the requested remedy is a punishment of
imprisonment; provided, however, where a violation of the code is punishable by fines and other penalties
in addition to imprisonment, the County may elect to institute an action with the department of
administrative hearings and thereby waive any imprisonment for the code violation. Nothing in this
article, however, shall preclude the County from seeking the remedy of imprisonment in a court of law,
including imprisonment for failure to comply with the order of an administrative law officer, pursuant to
Section 2-915 (relating to violations of orders).
Sec. 2-925.

Other provisions not limiting.

(a)
Notwithstanding any other provision of the County Code, all provisions of the code may
be enforced by instituting an administrative adjudication proceeding with the department of
administrative hearings as provided in this article.
(b)
Notwithstanding any other provision of the County Code, any enforcement action which
may be exercised by another department, agency, board or commission of the County may also be
exercised by the department of administrative hearings; provided, however, that the department shall not
have authority to revoke or suspend any County license.
Sec. 2-926.

Transition.

The departments, agencies, boards and commissions of County government, authorized by
ordinance, shall continue to conduct hearings according to law adopted prior to the effective date of this
ordinance until such time as they are notified by the Department of Administrative Hearings to forward
matters, for hearing, exclusively to the Department of Administrative Hearings. Upon notification, the
departments, agencies, boards and commissions will participate, exclusively, in accordance with hearings
as described by the provisions of this article.
Sec. 2-927.

General repeals.

All ordinances or parts of ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby repealed.

DIVISION 6. MINORITY-AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES
Subdivision I.

General Provisions

Sec. 34-275.

Short title.

This division shall be known and may be cited as the Cook County Minority- and
Women-Owned Business Enterprise Ordinance.
Sec. 34-276.

Purpose; policy and findings.

(a)
It is the public policy of the County to ensure the full and equitable participation of
minority and female owned businesses in the County's procurement process as both prime and
subcontractors.
(b)
The County is committed to a policy of preventing discrimination in the award of or
participation in County contracts and eliminating arbitrary barriers to full participation in such contracts
by all persons, regardless of race, sex, or ethnicity.
(c)
Minority and women's businesses have contributed significantly to the economic
development of the community, and played a similar role in increasing employment, including that of
minorities.
(d)
Various Federal, State and local legislative bodies and governmental agencies have
adopted affirmative action programs in order to eradicate the practice of racial, ethnic and sexual
discrimination in the award of public contracts.
(e)
The County has heretofore adopted a Minority Business Enterprise Ordinance to ensure
that minority and women's businesses are provided full and equal opportunity to participate in County
contracts.
(f)
The Supreme Court of the United States in City of Richmond v. Croson, 488 U.S. 469
(1989), has enunciated certain standards which are necessary to maintain effective affirmative action
programs in compliance with constitutional requirements.
(g)
The County is committed to implementing its affirmative action program in conformance
with the United States Supreme Court's decision in City of Richmond v. Croson.
(h)
In furtherance of this commitment, the Cook County Board directed the County staff and
its outside consultants to conduct an investigation into the scope of any discrimination in the award of and
participation in County contracts as well as in the metropolitan Chicago economy, the extent to which
such discrimination or the effects thereof has denied and continues to deny minority and women's
business enterprises equal opportunity to participate in County contracts and to recommend the
appropriate affirmative action steps to be taken to eliminate any such discrimination and its continuing
effects.
(i)
Pursuant to the County Board's direction, the County staff and its outside consultants
conducted such an investigation.

37

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
(j)
The County Board, having reviewed the report of the County's staff and its outside
consultants and having conducted public hearings and received the testimony of witnesses, makes the
following findings:

Sec. 34-277.

(1)

Minority and women's businesses continue to be awarded prime contracts and
subcontracts in dollar amounts that are disproportionately lower than the
availability of such businesses willing and able to perform County contracts.

(2)

The County's procurement practices in the past have contributed to the above
identified underutilization of minority and women's businesses on County
contracts.

(3)

Minority and women's businesses continue to be disadvantaged by
discriminatory practices in the local construction industry and economy when
competing for County contracts and in seeking subcontracting opportunities on
such contracts.

(4)

The County was a passive participant in the discriminatory practices of
businesses which discriminate against minority and women's businesses by
entering into contracts with such businesses.

(5)

Despite its good faith efforts and implementation of previous affirmative action
programs, minority and women's businesses remain at a competitive
disadvantage in competing for County contracts and subcontracts.

(6)

Race and gender neutral measures or affirmative action programs without
numerical goals have not and are not likely to eliminate the competitive
disadvantage of minority and women's businesses in participating in County
contracts due to discrimination in the local economy.

(7)

The numerical goals for the participation of minority and women's businesses in
County contracts are commensurate with the availability of minority and
women's businesses willing and able to perform County work.

43

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008

(b)

(2)

The Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent shall evaluate the
applicability of the Minority Business Enterprise and Women's Business
Enterprise goals to a specific contract. Where the Contract Compliance
Administrator Purchasing Agent, in consultation with the Purchasing Agent and
the user Departments, determines that the established goals are not appropriate
for a specific contract because of its particular requirements, the Contract
Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent shall set an appropriate goal for the
contract, based upon the availability of Protected Class Enterprises which are
capable of providing the goods and/or services required by the particular
contract, the past level of Protected Class Enterprise participation in similar
contracts, the specifications of the contract and any other criteria adopted by the
Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent.

(3)

The applicable goals for a specific contract shall be designated in the contract
specifications.

Contractor responsibility and requirements.
(1)

As a precondition to selection, each contractor shall submit with its bid a
completed and signed utilization plan which lists the names, addresses and
contact persons of businesses intended to be used as Protected Class Enterprises
on the contract, the type and scope of work or service each business will perform
and the dollar amount to be allocated to each Protected Class Enterprise. Such
listing shall not be duplicative (e.g., two or more entities each listed as
performing 100 percent of the same work or service). Within three business days
following submission of bids, a bidder shall submit its letters of intent to
Protected Class Enterprises listed on its utilization plan, provided that no
substitutions shall be permitted prior to bid award. Each contractor's utilization
plan shall commit to Protected Class Enterprise participation equal to or greater
than each of the applicable Protected Class Enterprise goals, unless the contractor
requests a partial or total waiver of the requirement that it file a utilization plan or
achieve a particular goal for Protected Class Enterprise participation by
submitting with the filing of its bid a signed waiver request form.

(2)

Notwithstanding its compliance with any other requirement of County ordinances
and contract specifications, no bidder or offer shall be awarded an eligible
contract unless the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent has
approved its utilization plan or granted a waiver on the contract. Such utilization
plan shall be designed to meet the applicable Minority Business Enterprise and
Women's Business Enterprise goals set for such project and shall be incorporated
into the contract.

44

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
(3)

A contractor may achieve the applicable Protected Class Enterprise goals by its
status as a Protected Class Enterprise or by joint venture with one or more
Protected Class Enterprises or by subcontracting a portion of the work to one or
more Protected Class Enterprises or by purchase of materials or services from
one or more Protected Class Enterprises or by the indirect participation of
Protected Class Enterprises in other aspects of the contractor's business such as
through a Mentor/Protégé agreement as provided herein (in accordance with
applicable guidelines and provided that such Protected Class Enterprise indirect
participation may not be credited toward goal attainment on more than one
contract subject to this article) or by any combination of the above, subject to the
following guidelines:
a.

Joint ventures. Where a contractor engages in a joint venture to satisfy
its affirmative action commitment, the Contract Compliance
Administrator Purchasing Agent shall review the profits and losses,
initial capital investment, actual participation of the joint venture partners
in the performance of the contract, and other pertinent factors to
determine the amount of credit to be granted for the joint venture toward
attainment of the applicable Minority Business Enterprise and Women's
Business Enterprise goals. The Contract Compliance Administrator
Purchasing Agent may review all records pertaining to joint venture
agreements before or after the award of a contract in order to assess
compliance with this article. A contractor shall receive credit towards
achievement of the applicable goals in proportion to the percentage of
the contract to be performed by the Protected Class Enterprise, provided
that the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent may deny
or limit Protected Class Enterprise credit to a contractor where the
Protected Class Enterprise joint venture partner is found not to be
performing a commercially useful function or not to have duties,
responsibilities, management control or risk with respect to the joint
venture commensurate with or in proportion to its joint venture
ownership.

b.

Subcontracts. A contractor may count toward its Protected Class
Enterprise goals only expenditures to Protected Class Enterprises that
perform a commercially useful function in the performance of a contract
for work actually performed or materials supplied by the Protected Class
Enterprise. To determine whether a Protected Class Enterprise is
performing a commercially useful function, the Contract Compliance
Administrator Purchasing Agent may evaluate the amount of work
subcontracted, industry practices, whether the Protected Class Enterprise
has the skill and experience to perform the work for which it is being
utilized and other relevant factors. Consistent with normal industry
practices, a Protected Class Enterprise subcontractor may enter into
second tier subcontracts. However, if a Protected Class Enterprise
contractor or subcontractor subcontracts a significantly greater portion of
the work of the contract than would be expected on the basis of normal
industry practices, the Minority Business Enterprise or Women's
Business Enterprise shall be presumed not to be performing a
commercially useful function.

45

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
c.

Manufacturers and suppliers. Where a contractor utilizes one or more
suppliers to achieve its Protected Class Enterprise goals, such Protected
Class Enterprise supplier participation may be 100 percent credited
toward goal attainment where the Protected Class Enterprise supplier
manufactures the goods supplied or where such Protected Class
Enterprise supplier owns or operates a store, warehouse or other
establishment (and related distribution equipment) in which it maintains,
consistent with industry standards, an inventory of the materials or
supplies required for performance of the contract for sale in the normal
course of business. The participation of a Protected Class Enterprise
supplier who acts as a broker (i.e., who performs no manufacturing or
warehousing) shall be credited toward the applicable Protected Class
Enterprise goals at a rate equal to ten percent of the payments to such
Protected Class Enterprise broker.

d.

Protected Class Enterprise prime contractors or joint venturers. A
Minority Business Enterprise or Women's Business Enterprise contractor
may count its own participation toward the achievement of the
applicable Minority Business Enterprise or Women's Business Enterprise
goal, respectively, but such a contractor will be required to meet all other
applicable goals by joint ventures, subcontracting or purchase of
materials or services. Where a contractor is a business owned and
controlled by minority women ("M/WBE") or where the contractor
utilizes a M/WBE in a joint venture, as a subcontractor or a supplier, the
contractor may count the M/WBE participation either toward the
achievement of its Minority Business Enterprise or Women's Business
Enterprise goal but not both.

e.

Mentor/protégé agreements. Where a contractor enters into a written
agreement ("mentor/protégé" agreement) with a Protected Class
Enterprise to improve or develop certain aspects of the business of the
Protected Class Enterprise, such an agreement may be evaluated by the
Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent to assess
appropriate credit toward the Protected Class Enterprise goals of the

separate and independent business entities under the agreement. The

Review of bid or offer.
(1)

The Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent shall review each bid
or offer to determine if the contractor has included in its submission a completed
and signed utilization plan which meets the Protected Class Enterprise goals for
the contract, and approve or reject the plan.

and/or Women's Business Enterprises by name, scope of work and dollar
value of work to meet the applicable goals for the contract; or

A contractor seeking a total or partial waiver shall, in accordance with guidelines
issued by the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent, be required
to submit evidence of its good faith efforts to achieve the applicable Protected
Class Enterprise goals and in support of its reasons for seeking a waiver.
Performance of all the actions set out in Subsection (c)(3) of this section by the
contractor shall create a rebuttable assumption that the contractor has made good
faith efforts to meet the applicable Protected Class Enterprise goals. The
determination of the adequacy of a contractor's good faith efforts will be
evaluated on the basis of the contractor's actions as of the date of the bid opening.

(5)

The Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent may grant the waiver
request of a contractor based upon the following criteria:
a.

Sufficient qualified Protected Class Enterprises capable of providing the
goods or services required by the contract are unavailable despite the
good faith efforts of the contractor;

b.

The specifications of and the reasonable and necessary requirements for
performing the contract make it impossible or economically infeasible to
divide the contract into sufficiently small tasks or quantities to enable the
contractor to utilize Protected Class Enterprises in accordance with the
applicable utilization goals;

c.

The price quoted by any potential Protected Class Enterprise source of
goods or services is more than ten percent above competitive levels; and

d.

Any other factor determined to be relevant by the Contract Compliance
Administrator.

(6)

Where a partial waiver is granted, the Contract Compliance Administrator
Purchasing Agent shall specify the amount of the applicable goal.

(7)

Where the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent determines that
a contractor has not made a good faith effort to meet the applicable goals and/or
comply with the provisions herein, including, but not limited to, failing to timely
submit the required letters of intent or other information request and/or has not
otherwise met the requirements for a total or partial waiver, the Purchasing Agent
may declare the contractor nonresponsive and reject the bid and reject any waiver
request which may have been filed.

(8)

Where the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent determines that
the utilization plan submitted by a contractor is false or fraudulent, the
Purchasing Agent shall reject the bid or, if such a determination is made after the
bid award, the contract may be forfeited and canceled.

(d)

(e)

Review of contract performance.
(1)

The Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent shall review the
contractor's efforts during the performance of the contract to achieve its Protected
Class Enterprise commitments as stated in its utilization plan. If the contractor
meets or exceeds its stated goals, it shall be presumed to be in compliance.
Where the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent finds that the
contractor has failed to achieve its stated goals or otherwise has failed to comply
with the requirements of the division, including failure to provide any
documentation required by the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing
Agent, has not satisfactorily demonstrated good faith efforts, and/or has deviated
without authorization from the compliance related portions of the contract as
originally approved, the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent
shall report findings to the Contract Compliance Committee.

(2)

The Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent may establish such
requirements for periodic contractor reporting on the fulfillment of its goals and
its utilization of Protected Class Enterprises as the Contract Compliance
Administrator Purchasing Agent determines appropriate and necessary for
effective enforcement of this division. A contractor also shall be required to
provide the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent any additional
requested compliance documentation within 14 days of such request.

(3)

If the Contract Compliance Committee determines that the contractor has failed
to comply with its contractual commitments or any portion of this division, the
Contract Compliance Committee will notify the contractor of such
noncompliance and may take any of the following actions:
a.

Instruct the Comptroller to withhold 50 percent of the current progress
payment due the prime contractor.

b.

Withhold up to 100 percent of further progress payments until the
contractor demonstrates that it is in compliance with the requirements of
this division.

c.

Debar the contractor from future bids or offers until the contractor
demonstrates that it is in compliance with the requirements of this
division.

(f)
Protected Class Enterprise bid and target market programs. To address more
specifically the barriers to Protected Class Enterprise participation as prime contractors in County work,
the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent may direct the Purchasing Agent to institute
the following special Protected Class Enterprise bidding provisions, following determination of the
appropriateness of such provisions.
(1)

In connection with the award of a contract subject to competitive bidding on
which a Protected Class Enterprise has bid and where the Protected Class
Enterprise meets the following criteria:

50

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008

(2)

a.

It is bidding on the item in question for the first time; and

b.

It never has successfully bid on a Cook County purchasing contract, the
Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent may, at the
opening of the bids on the item, compare the Protected Class Enterprise
bid with the lowest bid, and, if the Protected Class Enterprise's bid is
closely competitive as defined by guidelines to be established by the
Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent with that of
lowest actual bids, direct the Purchasing Agent to declare the Protected
Class Enterprise the successful bidder. A Protected Class Enterprise may
use this procedure only once to become the successful bidder on any
particular item. Thereafter, the Protected Class Enterprise must be totally
competitive in terms of price to be the successful bidder.

The Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent shall develop and
coordinate a target market program as follows:
a.

The Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent shall review
the availability of Protected Class Enterprises providing various goods
and services and shall identify for inclusion in a potential program for
bidding among Protected Class Enterprise firms certain commodity areas
with sufficient Protected Class Enterprise availability to ensure that the
County receives a competitive price. The Contract Compliance
Administrator Purchasing Agent shall report his/her findings and
recommendations to the Contract Compliance Committee;

b.

Upon a determination by the Contract Compliance Committee that such a
program is advisable for any particular commodity procurement, the
Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent will institute the
following procedures:
1.

The Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent will
notify the Purchasing Agent of identification of those commodity
codes appropriate for a target market program;

2.

To the extent practicable, the Purchasing Agent, with the aid of
the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent, shall
divide procurement in the designated commodity areas into
economically feasible sizes to facilitate bids or offers from
Protected Class Enterprises and shall designate contracts to be
offered under the target market program;

3.

The Purchasing Agent shall offer Protected Class Enterprises the
opportunity to bid on such contracts in a limited competition;

4.

All standard County rules for bidding will then become effective
and, provided that at least three Protected Class Enterprises bid
or make an offer on the contract, the lowest responsive and
responsible bidder among the Protected Class Enterprise firms
will receive the contract;

51

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
5.

c.

In the event less than three Protected Class Enterprises bid or
make an offer on the contract or if there is no responsive bid or
offer received from a responsible Protected Class Enterprise, the
Purchasing Agent shall rebid the contract not subject to the target
market program.

Participation in the target market program shall be limited to Minority
Business Enterprises, Women's Business Enterprises and joint ventures
consisting exclusively of Minority Business Enterprises, Women's
Business Enterprises or both. The Protected Class Enterprise contractor
on a target market contract may subcontract up to 50 percent of the dollar
value of the target market contract to subcontractors who are not
Minority Business Enterprises or Women's Business Enterprises.

(g)
Fifty percent Protected Class Enterprises required for informal bid solicitations. All
buyers shall solicit 50 percent PCEs in their informal bid solicitations for materials under $10,000.00,
which are not bid by formal advertising.
(h)
Buyers to use Protected Class Enterprises in requisitions. All buyers will make every
effort to use Protected Class Enterprises whenever possible in their requisitions for materials under
$10,000.00, which are not bid.
(i)
Division of large contracts to facilitate offers from Protected Class Enterprises. With
respect to large contracts for which subcontracting possibilities are impracticable, all buyers will, to the
extent practicable, divide such contracts into economically feasible sizes to facilitate bids or offers from
Protected Class Enterprises.
(j)
Technical assistance. The contractor is bound by all the requirements, terms, and
conditions of this article. Subsequent to the acceptance of an awarded contract, there will be no waiver of
the requirements, terms and conditions. The County Board, through its Contract Compliance Committee
and the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent, will make technical assistance in meeting
the terms and conditions of this article available to all interested bidders.
(k)

Finance; measures for reduction of cash flow problems of protected class contractors.
(1)

As needed, the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent shall assist
Protected Class Enterprises with training seminars in the technical aspects of
preparing a bid for a County contract.

(2)

All prime contractors shall be urged to follow the County's example by making
prompt and timely payments to Protected Class Enterprise subcontractors
working on Cook County projects. The timeliness of such payments shall be
monitored by the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent on a
regular basis, and an investigation shall be made of every complaint or charge of
excessive delay in payment. Reports of these investigations shall be made to the
Contract Compliance Committee and to the County Comptroller.

52

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
(3)

If at any time during the progress of the work, the contractor shall fail or neglect
to pay a Protected Class Enterprise subcontractor for any labor performed,
furnished, or tools, machinery, appliances, fuels, provisions or supplies of any
sort or kind used or consumed upon, in or on account of the work for ten days
after payment for same shall become due, then the County shall have the power
and authority to pay such indebtedness, and the amount so paid shall be retained
out of the money due or to become due the contractor. The County Comptroller
may refuse to make the payment hereinafter specified to the extent of such
indebtedness, until satisfactory evidence in writing has been furnished that the
indebtedness has been discharged. In any such case, the Purchasing Agent is
hereby authorized and empowered by the contractor to ascertain the amount due
or owing from the contractor to any laborer or laborers, or to any person or
persons, or corporation, for labor, equipment, material, tools, machinery,
appliances, provisions, fuels, or supplies of any sort or kind consumed upon, in
or on account of the work covered by this contract in such manner and upon such
proofs as may be deemed sufficient.

(4)

The County Board shall encourage major prime contractors to make available to
Protected Class Enterprise subcontractors working on their projects their sources
of financial assistance.

(l)
Contract award considerations. Where the lowest responsive contractor submits a
bid/offer which exceeds by ten percent or more the bid/offer of the lowest PCE nonresponsive contractor
["PCE nonresponsive" for purposes of this subsection means nonresponsive pursuant to Subsection (c)(2)
of this section, but otherwise responsive to the contract specifications], the County shall have the right to
reject all bids/offers and rebid or request further offers.
Sec. 34-282.

Professionals and consulting services and sole source agreements.

All Department heads who may employ the professional services of accountants, attorneys,
physicians, dentists, statisticians, data analysts, engineers, and other such personnel or who require goods
or services procured through sole source agreements shall implement this article and compliance
programs in a "best effort" manner. In lieu of the requirements set forth in Section 34-281(b), all
providers of such professional services or goods or services are to be notified that:
(1)

In the case of term contracts (annually or for more than six months), they are to maximize
the use of Protected Class Enterprises or individuals as subconsultants or subcontractors.

(2)

In the case of contracts instituted on an as-needed basis or lasting less than six months,
they are to submit to the County affirmative action plans and goals and maximize the
number of women and minority professionals in their firm who participate in various
County projects.

(3)

In both of the above cases the internal affirmative action plans and goals of the providers
shall be submitted to the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent and shall
be reviewed against the provider's actual affirmative action achievements and shall
become a part of the provider's protected class compliance review; this twice yearly
review by the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent shall become a
factor in the County's continued use of the services of providers.

53

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
(4)

Sec. 34-283.

The County sets a "best efforts" goal of 35 percent Protected Class Enterprise
participation for the total professional services and consulting services utilized by the
County. The County must be able to call upon those professionals whose particular
training and experience most closely fit our needs. The County shall endeavor to increase
utilization of protected class firms. Because use of such services is not programmed or
predictable, a "best effort" standard shall be used for attainment of the goal amounts.
Other Federal and State regulations.

Nothing in this division shall be interpreted to diminish or supplant equal employment
opportunity requirements contained in Federal or State grant funded contracts.
Sec. 34-284.

Preference to residents of County.

In addition to the goals established pursuant to Section 34-280, there is established as a goal that
on any contract approved by the County Board there will be utilization of at least 50 percent bona fide
County residents and 30 percent minorities in each trade for each project awarded by the County and in
the aggregated workforce in each project five percent will be females.
Sec. 34-285.

Reporting and review.

The County Board directs the Contract Compliance Administrator to report to the County Board
on an annual basis with respect to the following:
(1)

The level of Protected Class Enterprise participation achieved in each year in County
contracts subject to this division;

(2)

The then current estimated availability of Protected Class Enterprises to perform County
contracts;

(3)

An evaluation of the effectiveness of the article in ensuring full and equitable
participation by Protected Class Enterprises in County contracts and in mitigating the
competitive disadvantage suffered by Minority Business Enterprises and Women's
Business Enterprises due to the present effects of discrimination in the local economy and
award public contracts;

(4)

An assessment of the continuing need for utilization goals for specific types of goods and
services used in County contracts;

(5)

Identification of any enforcement problems; and

(6)

Any recommendations with respect to improving the County's effectiveness in remedying
the effects of discrimination against Minority Business Enterprises and Women's
Business Enterprises and/or discontinuing or modifying any affirmative action
requirements in those cases where Minority Business Enterprises and Women's Business
Enterprises no longer are disadvantaged by the effects of discrimination in their
participation in County contracts.

Sec. 34-286.

Title.

This subdivision shall be known as the "Minority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprise
Construction Interim Ordinance" and may be cited as such.
Sec. 34-287.

Recitals.

The President and the Board of Commissioners of the County of Cook find that all of the recitals
contained in the preambles to Ordinance No. 06-O-48 are full, true and correct and do incorporate them
into this subdivision by this reference.
Sec. 34-288.

Findings of discrimination.

The President and the Board of Commissioners of the County of Cook, after considering (i)
evidence presented at trial in Builders Association of Greater Chicago v. City of Chicago, 298 F.Supp.2d
725 (N.D. Ill. 2003) and Northern Contracting, Inc. v. Illinois Department of Transportation, 2005 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 19868 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 8, 2005); (ii) County statistical evidence of continuing discrimination
against Blacks, Hispanics, Asians and women in the County's contracting awards; (iii) the Report title,
"Review of Compelling Evidence of Discrimination Against Minority- and Women-Owned Business
Enterprise in the Chicago Area Construction Industry and Recommendations for Narrowly Tailored
Remedies for Cook County, Illinois;" as well as (iv) anecdotal evidence of discrimination against
minorities and women in the County's construction marketplace; and (v) receiving and considering
written reports, adopts the following findings as a strong basis in evidence supporting a narrowly tailored,
remedial affirmative action program in County construction contracting:
(a)
The County of Cook seeks to provide a level playing field and equal access for all prime
contractors and subcontractors to participate in County construction contracting opportunities;
(b)
Since the County's affirmative action program as it relates to construction projects was
declared unconstitutional in 2000, the County has witnessed a drastic reduction in M/WBE construction
prime contract and subcontract participation;
(c)
The County has engaged in committee hearings in which the County has heard anecdotal
evidence of discrimination in the construction industry, has commissioned a study on the levels of
M/WBE participation in County contracts, has reviewed the report prepared indicating evidence of
discrimination in County construction contracts and has considered the evidence in relevant case law;
(d)
In the absence of M/WBE participation goals the County has witnessed a drastic decline
in M/WBE participation in its construction contract below the availability of such firms and thus would
be a passive participant in a discriminatory marketplace without the use of such M/WBE goals;
(e)

The County has a compelling interest in preventing discrimination; and

(f)
The County desires to reaffirm its commitment to full and fair opportunities for all firms
to participate in its construction contracts.

contracts. The County is committed to a policy of preventing discrimination in the award of or
participation in construction contracts and has recommended appropriate affirmative action steps to be
taken to eliminate any such discrimination.
Sec. 34-290.

Applicability.

This subdivision shall apply to all construction contracts funded in whole or in part by County
funds, regardless of the sources of other funds; provided that any contract with respect to which a goal for
Minority-Owned Business Enterprise or Women-Owned Business Enterprise participation is inconsistent

Program eligibility.

(a)
Only businesses that meet the criteria for certification as a MBE or WBE may participate
in the Program. The applicant has the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence.
(b)
Only a firm owned by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person(s) may be
certified as a MBE or WBE.
(1)

The firm's ownership by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person
must be real, substantial, and continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of
the firm as reflected in ownership documents. The owner(s) must enjoy the
customary incidents of ownership and share in the risks and profits
commensurate with that ownership interest.

(2)

The contributions of capital or Expertise by the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) to acquire the ownership interest must be real and
substantial. If Expertise is relied upon as part of a Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner's contribution to acquire ownership, the Expertise must be
of the requisite quality generally recognized in a specialized field, in areas
critical to the firm's operations, indispensable to the firm's potential success,
specific to the type of work the firm performs and documented in the firm's
records. The individual whose Expertise is relied upon must have a
commensurate financial investment in the firm.

61

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
(c)
Only a firm that is managed and controlled by a Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged person(s) may be certified as a MBE or WBE.
(1)

A firm must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions that limit the
customary discretion of the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s).
There can be no restrictions through corporate charter provisions, by-law
provisions, contracts or any other formal or informal devices that prevent the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s), without the cooperation or
vote of any non-Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person, from making
any business decision of the firm, including the making of obligations or the
dispersing of funds.

(2)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the power
to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the firm and to
make day-to-day as well as long-term decisions on management, policy,
operations and work.

(3)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) may delegate various
areas of the management or daily operations of the firm to persons who are not
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged. Such delegations of authority must be
revocable, and the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must
retain the power to hire and fire any such person. The Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) must actually exercise control over the firm's operations,
work, management and policy.

(4)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have an overall
understanding of, and managerial and technical competence, experience and
Expertise, directly related to the firm's operations and work. The Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have the ability to intelligently and
critically evaluate information presented by other participants in the firm's
activities and to make independent decisions concerning the firm's daily
operations, work, management, and policymaking.

(5)

If federal, state and/or local laws, regulations or statutes require the owner(s) to
have a particular license or other credential to own and/or control a certain type
of firm, then the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must
possess the required license or credential. If state law, County ordinance or other
law regulations or statute does not require that the owner posses the license or
credential, that the owner(s) lacks such license or credential is a factor, but is not
dispositive, in determining whether the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the firm.

(6)

A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside
employment or other business interests that conflict with the management of the
firm or prevent the owner from devoting sufficient time and attention to the
affairs of the firm to manage and control its day to day activities.

(d)
Only an independent firm may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An independent firm is
one whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another firm. Recognition of an applicant as
a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is
independent and non-Affiliated. In determining whether an applicant is an independent business, the
Director will:

62

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
(1)

Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Firms in such areas as personnel,
facilities, equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.

(2)

Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and nonCertified Firms or persons associated with non-Certified Firms compromise the
applicant's independence.

(3)

Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Firms to determine
whether a pattern of exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Firm
compromises the applicant's independence.

(4)

Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and nonCertified Firms with normal industry practice.

(e)
An applicant shall be certified only for specific types of work in which the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and Expertise to manage and control the firm's
operations and work.
(f)
The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or WBEs and
non-Certified Firms.
(g)
In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the Director by rule may accept formal
certifications by other entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if the Director determines that
the certification standards of such entities are comparable to those of the County.
(h)
The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the
Office of Contract Compliance the Purchasing Agent. Failure of the firm to seek recertification by filing
the necessary documentation with the Director as provided by rule may result in decertification.
(i)
It is the responsibility of the Certified Firm to notify the Director of any change in its
circumstances affecting its continued eligibility for the Program. Failure to do so may result in the firm's
decertification.
(j)

The Director shall decertify a firm that does not continuously meet the eligibility criteria.

(k)
Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by the
County. The challenged firm shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be
maintained.
(l)
A firm that has been denied certification or recertification or has been decertified may
protest the denial or decertification as provided by rule.
(m)
A firm found to be ineligible may not apply for certification for six (6) months after the
effective date of the final decision.
(n)
A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for certification or a Certified
Firm as provided by rule. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the individual challenging the
eligibility of an applicant for certification or a certified form. The burden of proof shall rest with the
complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The director shall be the final
arbiter of all challenges. The presumption that the challenged firm is eligible shall remain in effect until
the County renders a final decision.

63

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
Sec. 34-296.

Annual aspirational goals.

The Annual Aspirational Goals for the utilization of MBEs and WBEs on County construction
contracts and subcontracts shall be 24 percent for MBEs and four percent for WBEs.
Sec. 34-297.

Project specific goals.

The Director, in consultation with the User Department shall establish Project Specific Goals for
construction Contracts based upon the availability of at least three MBEs and three WBEs to perform the
anticipated subcontracting functions of the project and the County's utilization of MBEs and WBEs to
date.
Sec. 34-298.

Counting MBE and WBE participation.

(a)
The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the MBEs or WBEs
own forces shall be counted, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the MBE or WBE
for the work of the contract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the MBE or WBE (except
supplies and equipment the MBE or WBE purchases or leases from the prime Contractor or the prime
Contractor's Affiliate).
(b)
The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a MBE or WBE for providing a
bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing
bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of a contract, shall be counted, provided the
fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(c)
When a MBE or WBE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of the
total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the Joint
Venture's contract that is performed by the MBE or WBE with its own forces and for which it is
separately at risk, shall be counted.
(d)
Only expenditures to a MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function
shall be counted. To determine whether a MBE or WBE is performing a Commercially Useful Function,
the County will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the
MBE or WBE is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing
and other relevant factors. To perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be
responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining
quality and quantity, ordering the material, installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself.
A MBE or WBE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra
participant in the contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or
WBE participation. If a MBE or WBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would
be expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful
Function. When a MBE or WBE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the
Certified Firm may present evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e)
One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from a MBE or
WBE Manufacturer or Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of the fees or transportation
charges for the delivery of materials or supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the
payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and are commensurate with fees customarily
charged for similar services.

64

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
(f)
If a firm ceases to be a certified during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of
work performed under a contract with that firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted.
(g)
In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of a MBE or
WBE shall not be counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-299.

Contract pre-award compliance procedures.

(a)
For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all
subcontractors from which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have
been established, its achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan
shall be due at the time the bid proposal is due.
(b)
Any agreement between a Contractor and a MBE or WBE in which the Contractor
requires that the MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c)
Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the Director will
determine whether the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). In making this
determination, the Director will consider, at a minimum, the Contractor's efforts to:
(1)

Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid
meetings, advertising and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs
certified in the scopes of work of the contract. The Contractor shall provide
interested MBEs and WBEs with timely, adequate information about the plans,
specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow MBEs and WBEs to
respond to the solicitation. The Contractor must follow up initial solicitations
with interested MBEs and WBEs.

(2)

Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to
increase the likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This
includes, where appropriate, breaking out contract work items into economically
feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBE participation, even when the
Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own
forces. It is the Contractor's responsibility to make a portion of the work
available to MBEs and WBEs and to select those portions of the work or material
needs consistent with the availability MBEs and WBEs to facilitate their
participation.

(3)

Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such
negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and
WBEs that were contacted; a description of the information provided regarding
the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and why
agreements could not be reached with MBEs and WBEs. The Contractor may not
reject MBEs and WBEs as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a
thorough investigation of their capabilities. That there may be some additional
costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEs is not in itself sufficient
reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as
such costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the
work of a contract with its own organization does not relieve it of the
responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all subcontractable scopes of work.

65

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
(4)

Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of
credit, or insurance as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where
appropriate.

(5)

Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary
equipment, supplies, materials, or related assistance or services, where
appropriate.

(6)

Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance the Purchasing Agent,
available minority/women community organizations, minority/women
contractors' groups, government sponsored minority/women business assistance
offices and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the
recruitment and placement of MBEs and WBEs.

(e)
In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of
other Contractors in meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the
apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be
reasonably questioned whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor
could have met the Project Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet
the Project Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBE participation obtained by
other Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.
(f)
A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the work, materials,
equipment or services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE and the agreed upon dollar value
shall be due at the time of bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(g)
The Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the scope of
work and the letters of intent from MBEs and WBEs. The Director may request clarification in writing of
items listed in the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the opportunity to
augment listed participation or Good Faith Efforts.
(h)
If the Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project Specific
Goals have been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User Department, the
Director and User Department shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent.
(i)
If the Director finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the
Director shall communicate this finding to the User Department and recommend that the bid/proposal be
rejected. A Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest procedures.
Sec. 34-300.

Contract administration procedures.

(a)
Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the Project
Specific Goals become covenants of performance by the Contractors in favor of the County.
(b)
The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the performance
of the contract, and detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment
submitted to the County or as otherwise directed by the County. The Director and the User Department
shall monitor subcontractor participation during the course of the contract. The County shall have full and
timely access to the Contractor's books and records, including without limitation payroll records, tax
returns and records and books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its commitment
to MBE and WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion of the
contract. This provision shall be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision allowing
inspection of the Contractor's records by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.

66

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
(c)
The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEs
named in the Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the Director, Purchasing Agent and the
User Department. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this subdivision and a
breach of contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause termination of
the executed contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the Contractor to contract
penalties or other sanctions.
(1)

All requests for changes or substitutions of a MBE or WBE Subcontractor(s)
named in the Utilization Plan shall be made to the Director, Purchasing Agent
and the User Department in writing, and shall clearly and fully set forth the basis
for the request. A Contractor shall not substitute a MBE or WBE subcontractor
or perform the work designated for a MBE or WBE subcontractor with its own
forces unless and until the Director, Purchasing Agent and the User Department
approve such substitution in writing. A Contractor shall not allow a substituted
subcontractor to begin work until both the Director, Purchasing Agent and the
User Department have approved the substitution.

(2)

The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably
should have been known by either party before the submission of the Utilization
Plan. Bid shopping is prohibited. The Contractor must negotiate with the MBE or
WBE subcontractor to resolve the problem. Where there has been a mistake or
disagreement about the scope of work, the MBE or WBE can be substituted only
where an agreement cannot be reached for a reasonable price for the correct
scope of work.

(3)

Substitutions of the subcontractor shall be permitted only on the following bases:
(i)

Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed.

(ii)

Failure of performance.

(iii)

Financial incapacity.

(iv)

Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price.

(v)

Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a
solicitation where agreement upon a reasonable price cannot be reached.

(vi)

Failure of the subcontractor to meet insurance, licensing or bonding
requirements; or

(vii)

The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal.

(4)

The County's final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed substitution,
and the basis of any denial, shall be communicated to the parties in writing by the
Director.

(5)

Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the
satisfaction of the County, the Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to fulfill
the Utilization Plan. The Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of
Contract Compliance the Purchasing Agent in obtaining a new MBE or WBE. If
the Project Specific Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have been
made, the Contractor may substitute with a non-Certified Firm.

67

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
(6)

If the County requires the substitution of a MBE or WBE subcontractor listed in
the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall undertake Good Faith Efforts to fulfill
the Utilization Plan. The Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of
Contract Compliance the Purchasing Agent in obtaining a new MBE or WBE
subcontractor. If the Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have been
made, the Contractor may substitute with a non-Certified Firm.

(d)
If a Contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not previously
disclosed in the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of the Director to modify the
Utilization Plan and must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure that MBES and WBEs have a fair
opportunity to bid on the new scope of work.
(e)
Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User Department at the time
they arise, to establish the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the MBE or WBE
goal.
(f)
Prior to contract closeout, the Director shall evaluate the Contractor's fulfillment of the
contracted goals, taking into account all approved substitutions, terminations and changes to the contract's
scope of work. If the County determines that Good Faith Efforts to meet the MBE or WBE commitments
were not made, or that fraudulent misrepresentations have been made, or any other breach of the contract
or violation of this subdivision, a remedy or sanction may be imposed, as provided in the contract.
Sec. 34-301.
(a)

Sanctions and penalties.
The following violations of this subdivision may result in a breach of contract:
(1)

Providing false or misleading information to the County in connection with
submission of a bid, responses to requests for qualifications or proposals, Good
Faith Efforts documentation, post-award compliance, or other Program
operations.

(2)

Committing any other violations of this subdivision.

(b)
A Contractor or subcontractor is subject to withholding of payments under the contract,
termination of the contract for breach, contract penalties, or being barred or deemed non-responsive in
future County solicitations and contracts as determined by the County's Purchasing Ordinance, if it is
found to have:
(1)

Provided false or misleading information in connection with an application for
certification or recertification or colluded with others to do so;

(2)

Provided false or misleading information in connection with the submission of a
bid or proposal or documentation of Good Faith Efforts, post-award compliance,
or other Program operations or colluded with others to do so;

(3)

Failed in bad faith to fulfill Project Specific Goals, thereby materially breaching
the contract; or

(4)

Failed to comply in good faith with substantive provisions of this subdivision.

68

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
Sec. 34-302.

Interim program review and sunset.

(a)
The President and the Board of Commissioners shall receive quarterly and annual reports
from the Director detailing the County's performance under the Interim Program.
(b)
The President and the Board of Commissioners will review these reports, including the
Annual Participation Goals and the County's progress towards meeting those Goals and eliminating
discrimination in its contracting activities and marketplace.
(c)
Commencing on this Chapter's effective date, the County will retain qualified experts to
develop evidence to assist the County in evaluating whether it has a continuing compelling interest in
remedying discrimination against MBEs and WBEs in its construction marketplace, and the permissible
scope of any narrowly tailored remedies.
(d)
On or before the sunset date of this Chapter, the County shall review the results of this
evidence gathering, to determine whether it has a compelling interest in continuing narrowly tailored
remedies to redress discrimination against MBEs or WBEs so that the County will not function as a
passive participant in a discriminatory marketplace.
(e)
Sec. 34-303.

This subdivision shall sunset on or before December 31, 2008.
Effective date.

This subdivision shall be effective upon 90 days after passage.
DIVISION 9. RE-ENTRY EMPLOYMENT/BID INCENTIVE
Sec. 34-351.

Re-entry employment committee.

(a)
The re-entry employment committee will work with nonprofits to find suitable former
offenders to be candidates to work with private companies on county contracts. The re-entry employment
committee will contain seven members consisting of:
(1)

A representative of the Cook County Bureau of Human Resources;

(2)

A representative of the Cook County Office of Capital Planning and Policy;

(3)

A representative of the President's Office of Employment Training;

69

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
(b)
The County shall work with nonprofit organizations, approved by the Board of
Commissioners, whose missions are to help formerly incarcerated individuals re-enter their communities
and reduce recidivism. These nonprofits will work with the President's Office of Employment and
Training to create pools of former offenders who can enroll in courses in State certified programs to learn
trades, thereby enabling the Cook County Re-entry Employment Committee to recommend these former
offenders to potential vendors seeking contracts with a value of $100,000.00, for employment on the
contracted project. Contractors will not be required to use former offenders recommended by the Cook
County Re-entry Employment Committee, but will receive bid incentives if they choose to do so. The
trades in which former offenders can be trained include, but are not limited to, all construction trades.
Sec. 34-352.

Bid incentive.

(a)
For any contracts advertised for bid after the effective date of this Ordinance having an
estimated contract value of $100,000.00 or more, and where not otherwise prohibited by federal, state or
local law, the Purchasing Agent shall allocate to any qualified bidder the following bid incentive for
utilization of Former Offenders in performance of the total hours performed under contract.
TABLE INSET:
Total Labor Hours
Performed by
Former Offenders
5--10 %
11--15 %

Bid Incentive
1/2 % of bid price
1 % of bid price

(b)
The bid incentive shall be calculated and applied in accordance with the provisions of
Section 34-353. The bid incentive is used only to calculate an amount to be used in evaluating the bid.
The bid incentive does not affect the contract price.
(c)
For all construction projects with an estimated contract value of $100,000.00 or more,
advertised after the effective date of this Ordinance, the Purchasing Agent shall include the bid incentive
provision in all such advertisements.
(d)
Bidders wishing to utilize former offenders in their contract may request that the Re-entry
Employment Committee provide them a list of candidates from which to choose former offenders for
inclusion as a part of their bid. If the bidder already employs former offenders or wishes to get potential
candidates on their own, they may do so and include them in their bid with proof that the former offenders
of their choosing have completed a certified training program in the trade that they will be performing.
Any bids that include former offenders who were not recommended by the Re-entry Employment
Committee must be reviewed and approved by the Committee to be eligible for bid incentives.
(e)

All contractors using former offenders will submit a utilization plan with their bid.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 3, 2008
Sec. 34-353.

Earned credits.

(a)
Upon the completion of a contract subject to this section, a contractor may apply to the
Purchasing Agent and/or the Director of the Office of Contract Compliance for earned credits if the
contractor met or exceeded his or her Former Offender utilization goals established in the contract. If the
Purchasing Agent and/or the Director of the Office of Contract Compliance determines that the contractor
has successfully met his or her Former Offender utilization goals, the Purchasing Agent shall issue an
Earned Credit Certificate that evidences the amount of earned credits allocated to the contractor. The
contractor may apply the earned credits as the bid incentive for any future construction project contract
bid of equal or greater dollar value.
(b)
The Earned Credit Certificate is valid for three years from the date of issuance and shall
not be applied towards any future contract bid after the expiration of that period.
Sec. 34-354.

Contractor's records.

(a)
The contractor shall maintain accurate and detailed books and records necessary to
monitor compliance with this section and shall submit such reports as required by the Office of
Purchasing, the Office of Contract Compliance, or the Using Department.
(b)
Full access to the contractor's and subcontractors' records shall be granted to the Office of
Purchasing Agent, the Director of the Office of Contract Compliance, the Using Department, or any duly
authorized representative thereof. The contractor and subcontractors shall maintain all relevant records for

fulfilled appropriately and that vendors meet all of the requirements of the Procurement and Contracts

WHEREAS, in 1956, Mr. Powell broke ranks with the Democrats, backing Dwight D. Eisenhower for

The quantities as shown on the contract documents were estimated for bidding purposes only. This
change represents the difference between the estimated quantities and actual field quantities of work
performed with more larger than smaller patches required due to more extensive deterioration of existing
pavement since the planning stage, less sub-base granular material, Type B (6 Inch) where jobsite
pavement grindings were used below the shoulder widening and many existing drainage culverts required
to be replaced instead of cleaned due to their poor conditions.
New item for hot mix asphalt binder course, IL-19.0, N50 was added in lieu of polymerized leveling
binder, (machine method), IL-4.75, N50 which was deemed inappropriate.
I respectfully recommend approval by your Honorable Body.
