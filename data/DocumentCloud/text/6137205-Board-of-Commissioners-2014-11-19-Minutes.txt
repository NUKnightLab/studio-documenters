PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION OPPOSING EXPANSION OF FEDERAL
NON-NAVIGABLE WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES

JURISDICTION

OVER

WHEREAS, Cook County includes numerous navigable waters, including the Chicago River, Calumet
River, Des Plaines River and the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal; and
WHEREAS, we recognize the critical importance of protecting the quality of surface water resources for
the protection of health, public safety, economic security, and the environment of the region; and
WHEREAS, we support reasonable public investments and work practices that ensure adequate protection
of water resources in the area; and
WHEREAS, the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the United States Environmental Protection
Agency on April 21, 2014 proposed in the Federal Register what is described as a clarification of the legal
definition of the term “Waters of the United States”; and
WHEREAS, the proposed rule provides that tributaries, ponds, drainage ditches, ephemeral streams, and
surface depressions which are non-navigable and only carry or hold water on an intermittent basis, are
subject to the full range of federal oversight and regulation of the United States Environmental Protection

Page 33 of 510

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

November 19, 2014

Agency and United States Army Corps of Engineers as though they were year-round naturally flowing
streams and waters (Part 328-Definitions §328.3); and
WHEREAS, in two prior attempts to expand federal jurisdictional waters, Solid Waste Agency of Northern
Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2011 and Rapanos v. United States, 2006, the United States
Supreme Court reaffirmed the Clean Water Act’s limit on federal jurisdiction at “navigable”; and
WHEREAS, the expansion of federal control over local activities within normally dry ditches could
significantly impact routine maintenance and repair of County infrastructure, including the installation of
signs and culverts, removal of storm debris, cleaning of ditches, mowing, and chemical treatments to
remove unsightly vegetation along roads; and
WHEREAS, the proposed rule would be an unfunded federal mandate and could significantly increase the
cost to the County and its citizens without any additional compensation; and
WHEREAS, the proposed rule would require expensive, time-consuming federal permits in order to
develop private or government property near bodies of water, not just those which are navigable; and
WHEREAS, the proposed rule would give federal agencies de-facto zoning authority and thus would
override the zoning authority granted to the County by the State of Illinois, and
WHEREAS, the urgency and seriousness of the proposed rule cannot be overstated.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners hereby urge
the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to
withdraw the proposed rule of April 21, 2014; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that on behalf of the Board of Commissioners, the Secretary to the Board
shall prepare and deliver a suitable copy of this Resolution to the Administrator of the United States
Environmental Protection Agency, the Commanding General of the United States Army Corps of
Engineers, United States Senators Dick Durbin and Mark Kirk, and each Member of the Cook County
Congressional delegation.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SPACE STANDARDS ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 2, ADMINISTRATION,
Article XII, Asset Management, Division 1, Sections 2-1000 through 2-1025, is hereby enacted as follows:
Chapter 2, ADMINISTRATION, Article 12, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SPACE STANDARDS
Sec. 2-1000. Legislative findings and purpose.
(a) Section 5/5 of the Counties Code (55 ILCS 5/5-1106) provides that “it shall be the duty of the county
board "to provide proper rooms and offices for the accommodation of the county board, State's attorney,
county clerk, county treasurer, recorder and sheriff . . . .
(b) In fulfilling that obligation, the County of Cook owns or occupies over 19 million square feet of real
estate assets.
(c) The County expends millions of dollars each year to operate those real estate assets.
(d) In addition to operating costs, hundreds of millions of dollars in deferred maintenance and capital needs
will be required to continue to operate County real estate, which will require constant capital expenditures
over many years.
(e) Efficient use of the County’s real estate assets could save the County millions of dollars in operating
and capital costs by facilitating consolidation of space into fewer facilities and reducing space needs for
many users.
(f) Efficient use of the County’s real estate assets requires a centralized and consistent approach, with
participation by various agencies and departments having knowledge and responsibilities bearing on the
use and maintenance of real estate, and cooperation among using departments and agencies in modernizing
space use.
(g) In order to promote efficient use of real estate assets, in 2011 the Real Estate Management Division,
the Office of Capital Planning and Policy, the Department of Facilities Management, the Budget and
Management Services Department, and the Bureau of Administration, under the authority of President Toni
Preckwinkle, created the Space Allocation Committee, charged which instituting processes and procedures
for departments and agencies requesting additional space or reconfiguration to existing space.

Page 55 of 510

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

November 19, 2014

(h) The Space Allocation Committee has implemented a process for allocating real estate assets, and has
begun reallocating unused or underutilized space, with significant cooperation from many departments and
elected officials.
(i) In 2012, the County undertook a Real Estate Asset Strategic Realignment Plan project (the REASRP)
which has assessed both the physical condition and the space utilization of County real estate assets.
(j) The REASRP recommends re-structuring the management of real estate assets by combining the
departments of Capital Planning, Facilities Management and Real Estate into one group, under the
leadership of an Asset Manager.
(k) The REASRP has revealed that administrative and other space is often underutilized, based upon
modern office standards, whereas other agencies and departments operate in cramped and therefore
inefficient space which hampers the delivery of public services.
(l) The REASRP has developed Office Standards and procedures for applying those standards, which, if
fully implemented, could reduce administrative occupancy by over 300,000 square feet, as well as data on
employee counts and uses of space which will enable the Space Allocation Committee to analyze space
needs and promote fair and efficient use.
(m) The data generated by the REASRP requires continuous updating in order to support efficient space
allocations, which can only be accomplished through cooperation and open exchange of information
regarding space use between the Space Allocation Committee and Elected Officials.
(n) The purpose of this article is to:
(1) Establish an Asset Management Steering Committee in order to achieve the goals of the REASRP and
implement its recommendations, to provide for participation by Elected Officials and to foster cooperation
in furthering the goals of the REASRP;
(2) Formally adopt the Office Standards; and
(3) Empower the Space Allocation Committee to apply and enforce the Office Standards, to develop and
enforce Furniture and Fixture Standards, to continue the process of space allocation, and to develop
additional standards and procedures to further the goals of the REASRP.
Sec. 2-1001. Establishment of the Asset Management Steering Committee
(a) The County Board hereby establishes an Asset Management Steering Committee (AMSC).
(b) The AMSC will fall under the auspices of the Asset Manager.
(c) The AMSC shall consist of representatives from each of the following Cook County agencies and

Sec. 2-1003. Authority of Space Allocation Committee
(a) The County Board hereby establishes the Space Allocation Committee (SAC) as previously authorized
by the President.
(b) SAC shall serve under the auspices of and report to the President.
(c) SAC shall consist of representatives from the County departments designated by the President of the
Cook County Board of Commissioners, and shall include the Asset Management Group and its constituent

(d) No Elected Official, Bureau Chief, Department Head or other County employee or official shall have
the authority to assign, allocate, or change the use of space in any County facility or in or on any
County-owned or occupied real estate other than by participating in the process established and
administered by the Space Allocation Committee.
(e) SAC has the authority to make and deny allocations of space, changes to space use, renovations,
reductions of space, and all other changes affecting the use of real estate assets; to develop and implement

Page 58 of 510

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

standards for space use, apply such standards to space requests and existing uses, investigate existing space
uses and re-allocate space that is determined to be underutilized, prioritize space needs, develop and
implement policies and procedures regarding the use and allocation of real estate assets, approve and deny
furniture procurements not in accordance with the Furniture and Finishes Standards, and take other actions
as necessary to optimize the County’s use and expenditures for its real estate assets. SAC will report to
AMSC on progress in the space allocation process, on issues requiring policy decisions, and on progress
in consolidation and efficient asset management.
(f) All Elected Officials, Bureau Chiefs, department heads and other County employees or officials for
whom the County provides real estate in which to conduct County business, will be required to cooperate
with the SAC space allocation process in making any alterations, improvements, reconfiguration or other
changes to space or to use of space, expanding or reducing occupancy of space, relocating staff within or
between facilities, reallocating existing space among departments of the using agency, and procurement of
furniture, regardless of source of funding.
(g) Due to the cost of operating and maintaining real estate assets, all Elected Officials, Bureau Chiefs,
department heads and other County officials or employees for whom the County provides real estate will
notify the SAC of any vacated space in order that such space can be re-purposed.
(h) Upon request, Elected Officials, Bureau Chiefs, department heads and other County officials will
provide SAC with updated information as to the number of staff at any location, and other information
regarding space use as may be necessary to carry out the responsibilities of the SAC.
Sec. 2-1004. Standards
(a) The Office Space Standards recommended in the Real Estate Asset Strategic Realignment Plan, and
incorporated in this Ordinance by this reference, are hereby adopted as a policy of Cook County. SAC shall
apply the Office Space Standards for all administrative and office space, with adaptation to specific uses
being within the discretion of SAC.
(b) It is recognized that fully implementing the Office Space Standards requires capital investment, and
will occur over a number of years. Therefore, SAC will endeavor to adhere to the Office Space Standards
as much as practicable in all requests for space and reconfiguration, while balancing the costs to achieve
the goals with other factors such as the length of time the space will be occupied, the eventual plan for the
facility in which it is located and similar factors.
(c) The implementation of the Office Space Standards depends in large part on procurement of appropriate
sizes and configurations of modular and other office furniture, fixtures and certain office equipment such
as printers and similar devices that impact space use (Furniture and Fixtures). In addition, in order to
provide flexibility in re-purposing of space, fairness and a consistent and productive office environment, it
is important to apply standards to the design and allocation of Furniture and Fixtures. Therefore, SAC is
further charged with the development of furniture, fixtures, equipment and finishes standards (Furniture
and Finishes Standards), and theapplication of such standards. The Chief Procurement Officer shall provide
to SAC copies of all procurement requests involving Furniture and Fixtures and using departments shall

Page 59 of 510

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

November 19, 2014

cooperate with SAC in conforming purchases to the Furniture and Finishes Standards. Orders for items
covered by the Furniture and Finishes Standards will not be placed without concurrence from the SAC
Chair.
(d) The implementation of the Office Space Standards is also impacted by the use and adoption of
technology, such as printing and multifunctional devices, broadband availability, and network connectivity.
Therefore, the Bureau of Technology will collaborate with SAC to promote efficient use of technology to
minimize space use, and to adopt standards and procedures for the distribution and use of such technology
so as to improve the efficiency of space utilization. As technology is adopted, and as space use and
standards evolve, the Bureau of Technology will cooperate with SAC to review the Office Space Standards
from time to time and adopt modifications as appropriate to enhance space utilization and cost
effectiveness.
(e) The provision of adequate conference rooms and maximizing use of conference rooms are critical
elements in the efficient use of space. Therefore, SAC is further charged with developing procedures for
sharing and scheduling of conference facilities accommodating more than 10 individuals.
Sec. 2-1005. Procedures
SAC shall develop procedures for efficient use of space and for submitting, evaluating and deciding upon
requests for space, requests for changes, procurement and installation of furniture, and other actions
regarding or impacting space use, space efficiency, and improvements.

(k) The Real Estate Asset Strategic Realignment Plan (REASRP) has revealed that administrative and
other space is often underutilized, based upon modern office standards, whereas other agencies and
departments operate in cramped and therefore inefficient space which hampers the delivery of public
services.
(l) The Real Estate Asset Strategic Realignment Plan (REASRP) has developed Office Standards and
procedures for applying those standards, which, if fully implemented, could reduce administrative
occupancy by over 300,000 square feet, as well as data on employee counts and uses of space which will
enable the Space Allocation Committee (SAC) to analyze space needs and promote fair and efficient use.
(m) The data generated by the Real Estate Asset Strategic Realignment Plan (REASRP) requires
continuous updating in order to support efficient space allocations, which can only be accomplished through
cooperation and open exchange of information regarding space use between the Space Allocation
Committee (SAC) and Elected Officials.
(n) The purpose of this Article is to:
(1) Establish an Asset Management Steering Committee (AMSC) in order to achieve the goals of
the Real Estate Asset Strategic Realignment Plan (REASRP) and implement its
recommendations, to provide for participation by Elected Officials and to foster cooperation in
furthering the goals of the Real Estate Asset Strategic Realignment Plan (REASRP);
(2) Formally adopt the Office Standards; and
(3) Empower the Space Allocation Committee (SAC) to apply and enforce the Office Standards,
to develop and enforce Furniture and Fixture Standards, to continue the process of space
allocation, and to develop additional standards and procedures to further the goals of the Real
Estate Asset Strategic Realignment Plan (REASRP).
Sec. 2-1001. Establishment of the Asset Management Steering Committee.
(a) The County Board hereby establishes an Asset Management Steering Committee (AMSC).
(b) The Asset Management Steering Committee (AMSC) will fall under the auspices of the Asset
Manager.
(c) The Asset Management Steering Committee (AMSC) shall consist of representatives from each of
the following Cook County agencies and Elected
Officials:
(1) the Office of the President;
(2) the Bureau of Finance, including the Department of Budget and Management Services;

(e) Space Allocation Committee (SAC) has the authority to make and deny allocations of space,
changes to space use, renovations, reductions of space, and all other changes affecting the use of real estate
assets; to develop and implement standards for space use, apply such standards to space requests and
existing uses, investigate existing space uses and re-allocate space that is determined to be underutilized,

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

November 19, 2014

notify the Space Allocation Committee (SAC) of any vacated space in order that such space can be repurposed.
(h) Upon request, Elected Officials, Bureau Chiefs, department heads and other County officials will
provide Space Allocation Committee (SAC) with updated information as to the number of staff at any
location, and other information regarding space use as may be necessary to carry out the responsibilities of
the Space Allocation Committee (SAC).
Sec. 2-1004. Standards.
(a) The Office Space Standards recommended in the Real Estate Asset Strategic Realignment Plan
(REASRP), and incorporated in this Ordinance by this reference, are hereby adopted as a policy of Cook
County. Space Allocation Committee (SAC) shall apply the Office Space Standards for all
administrative and office space, with adaptation to specific uses being within the discretion of Space
Allocation Committee (SAC).
(b) It is recognized that fully implementing the Office Space Standards requires capital investment,
and will occur over a number of years. Therefore, Space Allocation Committee (SAC) will endeavor to
adhere to the Office Space Standards as much as practicable in all requests for space and reconfiguration,
while balancing the costs to achieve the goals with other factors such as the length of time the space will
be occupied, the eventual plan for the facility in which it is located and similar factors.
(c) The implementation of the Office Space Standards depends in large part on procurement of
appropriate sizes and configurations of modular and other office furniture, fixtures and certain office
equipment such as printers and similar devices that impact space use (Furniture and Fixtures). In addition,
in order to provide flexibility in re-purposing of space, fairness and a consistent and productive office
environment, it is important to apply standards to the design and allocation of Furniture and Fixtures.
Therefore, Space Allocation Committee (SAC) is further charged with the development of furniture,
fixtures, equipment and finishes standards (Furniture and Finishes Standards), and the application of such
standards. The Chief Procurement Officer shall provide to Space Allocation Committee (SAC) copies of
all procurement requests involving Furniture and Fixtures and using departments shall cooperate with
Space Allocation Committee (SAC) in conforming purchases to the Furniture and Finishes Standards.
Orders for items covered by the Furniture and Finishes Standards will not be placed without concurrence
from the Space Allocation Committee (SAC) Chair.
(d) The implementation of the Office Space Standards is also impacted by the use and adoption of
technology, such as printing and multifunctional devices, broadband availability and network connectivity.
Therefore, the Bureau of Technology will collaborate with Space Allocation Committee (SAC) to promote
efficient use of technology to minimize space use, and to adopt standards and procedures for the distribution
and use of such technology so as to improve the efficiency of space utilization. As technology is adopted,
and as space use and standards evolve, the Bureau of Technology will cooperate with Space Allocation
Committee (SAC) to review the Office Space Standards from time to time and adopt modifications as
appropriate to enhance space utilization and cost effectiveness.
(e) The provision of adequate conference rooms and maximizing use of conference rooms are critical
elements in the efficient use of space. Therefore, Space Allocation Committee (SAC) is further charged

with developing procedures for sharing and scheduling of conference facilities accommodating more than
10 individuals.
Sec. 2-1005. Procedures.

property, the appropriate authorities shall be encouraged to explore all efforts for restitution
as a condition of pre-booking diversion.

i.

Complete a detailed incident report.

(2) Post-booking diversion. This category of diversion may be sought by the State's Attorney for
mentally ill and/or substance abuse detainees/arrestees who are detained for crimes that constitute
Class A misdemeanors and Class 4 felonies and which are nonviolent. The State's Attorney may
seek a pre-arraignment investigation which may include, but need not be limited to, assessment
by a mental health and substance abuse service provider to determine whether the suspect is
eligible for diversion. If a diversion plan is agreed upon by all parties involved, it may include a
requirement that the diverted detainee adhere to an individualized treatment and service plan
developed by an appropriate clinician, provision for restitution with respect to injuries or property
damage caused by the diverted detainee and y identify a case manager who shall monitor the

speedy trials for those detainees who have been diagnosed by the appropriate clinicians as being
mentally ill having a mental illness or with substance abuse disorders. If a detainee has been
diagnosed as being mentally ill having a mental illness or diagnosed with substance abuse
disorders and is held over for trial the detainee shall have immediate access to the appropriate
treatment services. The case should be referred to the appropriate specialty courts for a speedy
trial. This category of diversion is subject to the approval of the court.
(4) Post-adjudication diversion.
a.

This category of diversion is for persons adjudicated guilty of an offense by the courts. In
cases where a person has also been found, by a licensed clinician, as being mentally ill
having a mental illness and suffering with substance abuse and it has been agreed upon on
by the courts that a diversion plan may be developed, that person shall be eligible for

immediate treatment.
b.

misdemeanor courts within the jurisdiction of the District 4, Maywood Courthouse of the
Circuit Court of Cook County and the Mental Health Court. In appropriate cases as ordered
by the court, a diversion plan may be developed as a condition of a defendant's probation
or supervision. The court may consider assignment of a case manager to monitor the
defendant's compliance with the diversion plan and may require notification of the
arresting law enforcement agency or other parties prior to the defendant's release from
custody or discharge from hospitalization for mental health or substance abuse treatment.

(c) Resumption of prosecution. Failure to comply with the diversion plan shall subject the diverted

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
URGING THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO FORM A TASK FORCE TO RESEARCH,
DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE LEGISLATION FOR LEGALIZING AND REGULATING
CANNABIS USE FOR ADULTS IN ILLINOIS
WHEREAS, in 2000, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) attempted to restate the goals
of the “War on Drugs”: “to educate and enable America's youth to reject illegal drugs as well as alcohol
and tobacco; to increase the safety of America's citizens by substantially reducing drug-related crime and
violence; to reduce health and social costs to the public of illegal drugs use; to shield America's air, land,
and sea frontiers from the drug threat; and to break foreign and domestic drug sources of supply”; and
WHEREAS, in reality, most scholars agree that despite spending more than $1 trillion dollars over the last
40 years on the “War on Drugs”, we have succeeded in none of these goals; and
WHEREAS, despite the efforts of the War on Drugs, the health and social costs of drugs increase every
year, and drug users are at heightened risk of death, illness and overdose, as the drugs available on the
black market are generally less safe. Drugs are no less available than before, our borders are not secure,
and treatment is not available to the vast majority of people who need it; and
WHEREAS, in 2010, the Obama Administration’s inaugural National Drug Control Strategy charted a
new course in our efforts to reduce illicit drug use and its consequences in the United States by calling for
drug policy reform rooted in scientific research on addiction, evidence-based prevention programs,
increased access to treatment, a historic emphasis on recovery, and criminal justice reform; and
WHEREAS, the 2013 ONDCP strategy consists of the following goals: “prevent drug use before it ever
begins through education; expand access to treatment for Americans struggling with addiction; reform our
criminal justice system to break the cycle of drug use, crime, and incarceration while protecting public
safety; support Americans in recovery by lifting the stigma associated with those suffering or in recovery
from substance abuse disorders”; and

WHEREAS, between 2001 and 2010, there were over 8 million marijuana arrests in the United States,
88% of which were for possession. Marijuana arrests have increased between 2001 and 2010 and now
account for over half (52%) of all drug arrests in the United States, and marijuana possession arrests
account for nearly half (46%) of all drug arrests; and
WHEREAS, most arrests for marijuana possession do not lead to trials or prison terms. Instead, a large
number of these arrests are plea-bargained, continued without a finding, dismissed, or otherwise handled
in a manner that makes poor use of limited criminal justice system resources; and
WHEREAS, the criminalization of marijuana use disproportionately harms young people and people of
color, sponsors massive levels of violence and corruption, and fails to curb youth access; and
WHEREAS, on average, an African-American is 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana
possession than a Caucasian, even though African Americans and Caucasians use marijuana at similar
rates. In the states with the worst disparities, African-Americans were on average over six times more
likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than Caucasians. In the worst offending counties across the
country, African Americans were 10, 15, even 30 times more likely to be arrested than Caucasians in the
same county. Such racial disparities in marijuana possession arrests exist in all regions of the country, in
counties large and small, urban and rural, wealthy and poor, and with large and small African American
populations; and
WHEREAS, there have been 1 million arrests for misdemeanor marijuana possession in the State of
Illinois from 1975 to 2009 and Illinois ranked sixth in the nation in per-capita marijuana arrest rates in
2007, representing 58 percent of all drug arrests in the state; and
WHEREAS, mirroring national trends, throughout Illinois, non-whites are arrested at a higher rate than
whites relative to their representation in the general population. Arrest data from 2007 indicated that
disproportionality in drug arrests occurred in 62 of the 102 counties in Illinois, including urban, suburban,
and rural areas and that most of the disproportionality in Illinois drug laws was related to drug possession
charges, which accounted for nearly 75 percent of felony drug arrests across the state; and
WHEREAS, despite the fact that the City of Chicago decriminalized small amounts of marijuana
possession 2 years ago and the number of arrests for marijuana possession have dropped to their lowest
level in 12 years, police continue to make an average of 44 arrests a day for misdemeanor possession -more
than for any other offense - and 78 percent of those arrested since August 2012 for carrying small amounts
of pot were African American, 17 percent were Hispanic, and just 4 percent were Caucasian; and
WHEREAS, marijuana-related arrests in every Cook County municipality, including Chicago, result in
staggering costs to County government by virtue of the necessary involvement of the county jail, Sheriff’s
department, State’s Attorney, Clerk of the Court, judiciary, and often times, the Public Defender, annually
costing Cook County taxpayers tens of millions of dollars; and
WHEREAS, for the last several years, while Chicago police have made approximately 23,000 arrests a
year for marijuana possession, an astounding 97 percent of charges involving 2.5 grams or less were
dismissed between 2006 and 2010, creating nothing more than an unnecessary arrest record for some
20,000 individuals; and

WHEREAS, arresting people for cannabis possession does nothing to reduce its use, rather it can often
create barriers to living a normal life by negatively impacting public housing and student financial aid
eligibility, employment opportunities, child custody determinations, and immigration status, even if as is
almost always the case, the charges are dismissed; and
WHEREAS, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP), a nonprofit organization made up of current
and former members of the law enforcement and criminal justice communities, is speaking out about the
failures of our existing drug policies and how they continue to fail to effectively address the problems of
drug abuse, especially among juveniles, the problems of addiction, and the problems of crime caused by
the existence of a criminal black market in drugs; and
WHEREAS, LEAP’S stated vision is to have a system of legalization and regulation which will end the
violence, better protect human rights, safeguard our children, reduce crime and disease, treat drug abusers
as patients, reduce addiction, use tax dollars more efficiently, and restore the public’s respect and trust in
law enforcement; and
WHEREAS, noted neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta has stated that marijuana was classified as a Schedule
1 substance, despite evidence that it was not as addictive as alcohol or tobacco; and
WHEREAS, existing evidence from other states and countries show there is no indication that
decriminalization of marijuana leads to a measurable increase in its use; and on the effects of marijuana
decriminalization on marijuana use provides no indication that decriminalization leads to a measurable
increase in marijuana use; and
WHEREAS, a 2005 report by Harvard University Professor of Economics, Dr. Jeffrey Miron, entitled
“TheBudgetary Implications of Marijuana Prohibition” has been endorsed by more than 530 distinguished
economists, who signed an open letter to then President George W. Bush, The United States Congress, and
Governors and State Legislatures across the country calling for “an open and honest debate about marijuana
prohibition,” and stated, “We believe such a debate will favor a regime in which marijuana is legal but
taxed and regulated like other goods.” Chief among the endorsing economists were three Nobel Laureates
in economics: Dr. Milton Friedman of the Hoover Institute, Dr. George Akerlof of the University of
California at Berkeley, and Dr. Vernon Smith of George Mason University; and
WHEREAS, approximately $8.7 billion in savings would result from legalization of marijuana at the
national level; and
WHEREAS, the citizens of Colorado and Washington, both States having previously legalized the use of
medical marijuana, voted in favor of ballot referendums in 2012 to legalize and regulate the use of
recreational marijuana for adults over the age of 21, which were subsequently enacted in 2013; and
WHEREAS, Colorado State's Joint Budget Committee expects to collect approximately $184 million in
tax revenue from recreational marijuana in the first 18 months of legalized sale, and projects tax revenue
of about $610 million when looking at both recreational and medical marijuana sales for that same time
period. Washington state budget officials estimate the state will reap about $134 million in tax revenue
generated by marijuana sales in the 2015-2017 biennium; and
WHEREAS, Illinois is facing severe budget and financial constraints and lawmakers face the undesirable

choice of deciding between increased taxes or substantial service cuts, creating an intelligent, practical
framework of cannabis legalization, regulation and taxation can help address a myriad of problems such as
improved health and public safety, reduced criminal justice and jail costs, law enforcement efficacy, black
market drug displacement as well as increased revenue for education and treatment protocols.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does herby
urge the Illinois General Assembly to form a task force to research, develop and introduce legislation to
legalize and regulate cannabis use in Illinois for adults; and

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
COB #310246
AMENDMENT TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS ORDINANCE
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance Amendment sponsored by Larry Suffredin, County
Commissioner.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance Amendment:
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 2 Administration, Section
2-911 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 2-911. Administrative hearings.
(a) Any administrative adjudication proceeding conducted by the department of administrative
hearings shall afford the parties an opportunity for a hearing before an administrative law officer.
(b) An attorney who appears on behalf of any person shall file with the administrative law officer a
written appearance on a form provided by the department of administrative hearings for such purpose.
(c) In no event shall the case for the County be presented by an employee of the department of
administrative hearings; provided, however, that documentary evidence, including the notice of violation,
which has been prepared by another department, agency, board or commission of the County, may be
presented at the hearing by the administrative law officer.
(d) The administrative law officer may grant continuances only upon a finding of good cause.
(e) All testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation.
(f) The administrative law officer may issue subpoenas to secure the attendance and testimony of
relevant witnesses and the production of relevant documents. Issuance of subpoenas shall be subject to the
restrictions contained in Section 2-913 (relating to subpoenas).
(g) Subject to subsection (j) of this section, the administrative law officer may permit witnesses to
submit their testimony by affidavit or by telephone.
(h) The formal and technical rules of evidence shall not apply in the conduct of the hearing. Evidence,
including hearsay, may be admitted only if it is of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent
persons in the conduct of their affairs.
(i) No violation may be established except upon proof by a preponderance of the evidence; provided,
however, that a violation notice, or a copy thereof, issued and signed in accordance with Section 2-910

Page 152 of 510

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

November 19, 2014

(relating to notice) shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the facts specified therein.
(j) Upon the timely request of any party to the proceeding, any person, who the administrative law
officer determines may reasonably be expected to provide testimony which is material and which does not
constitute a needless presentation of cumulative evidence, shall be made available for cross-examination
prior to a final determination of liability.
(k) The record of all hearings before an administrative law officer shall include: (i) a record of the
testimony presented at the hearing, which may be made by tape recording or other appropriate means; (ii)
all documents presented at the hearing; (iii) a copy of the notice of violation or notice of hearing; and (iv)
a copy of the findings and decision of the administrative law officer.
(l) Upon conclusion of a hearing, the administrative law officer shall issue a final determination of
liability, or no liability, or supervision. Upon issuing a final determination of liability the administrative
law officer may: (i) impose penalties and/or fines that are consistent with applicable provisions of the
County Code or a department's official fine schedule; (ii) issue orders that are consistent with applicable
provisions of the County Code; and/or (iii) assess costs reasonably related to instituting the administrative
adjudication proceeding; provided, however, that in no event shall the administrative law officer have the
authority to impose a penalty of imprisonment or, except in cases to enforce the collection of any tax
imposed and collected by the County, this limitation shall not apply, impose a fine in excess of that
authorized by the Code, exclusive of costs
of enforcement.
(m) In the issuance of a final determination of liability, an administrative law officer shall inform the
respondent of his or her right to seek judicial review of the final determination.
(n) Where the respondent stipulates to facts supporting the charge in the citation and agrees to pay
the
fines, penalties, and costs provided by law, the hearing officer may defer both (i) further proceedings and
(ii) entry of a finding of liability, and enter an order for supervision of the respondent where the hearing
officer, after considering the circumstances of the offense, and the history, character and condition of the
offender, is of the opinion that:
(1) The offender is not likely to commit further ordinance violations,
(2) The defendant and the public would be best served if the defendant were not have a record of
liability, and
(3) In the best interests of justice an order of supervision is more appropriate than a finding of
liability,
permitted under this Code.
(o) As a condition of supervision the hearing officer shall enter an order setting a period of time, not
to exceed six months, for the respondent to pay the fines, penalties, and costs provided by law. Upon
payment of the fines, penalties, and costs, the citation shall be dismissed with a finding of no liability. If
the respondent fails to make the payment, within the period set out in the order, a finding of liability shall
be entered against the respondent based on the respondent’s stipulation. Upon the finding of liability, fines,
penalties, and costs provided by law shall be assessed against the respondent.

Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Joan Patricia Murphy and Peter N. Silvestri, County
Commissioners.
WHEREAS, all Illinois municipalities provide direct frontline services to their citizens; and
WHEREAS, these services have an immediate and fundamental reality to those citizens who depend on
local police and fire protection, water and sewer service, snow removal, roads and traffic safety; and

WHEREAS, local citizens pay income taxes to the State for both the State budget and local municipal
budgets and the revenue is collected by the State; and
WHEREAS, since the inception of the State income tax in 1969, municipalities have received, relied upon
andprovided services with those revenues to their local taxpaying citizens; and
WHEREAS, the fiscal reality is that municipalities have already experienced less income tax revenues
from the State; and
WHEREAS, the recent income tax increase provided new revenues all of which went to the State
budget - noneof the increase was received by cities - costing over $2.7 billion in future lost revenues; and
WHEREAS, the State, through its Legislature and Governor, is contemplating further reductions to

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

municipal revenues; and
WHEREAS, one proposal under discussion would take an additional $300,000,000.00 of State-collected
income tax from cities and counties, which would reduce their revenues by $23.40 per capita on top of the
$19.02 that has already been lost during the recession, totaling an estimated $42.42 in lost revenue per
resident in FY 2012.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners strongly
opposesfurther reduction in state collected revenues and demands that the General Assembly and Governor
take no further action to financially ruin municipalities; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary to the Cook County Board of Commissioners delivers
asuitable copy of this Resolution to Governor Quinn and all members of the Illinois General Assembly.

AMENDMENT TO THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL TO THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF
COMMISSIONERS (PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT).
Submitting a Proposed
Ordinance Amendment sponsored by John A. Fritchey and Larry Suffredin, County
Commissioners.
WHEREAS, during the FY2011 Budget deliberations, an amendment was introduced and approved by the
Cook County Board to create two Legislative Counsel positions and one Administrative Support position;
and
WHEREAS, the impetus for creating these positions was to assist the Board of Commissioners in creating,
analyzing and when called upon, to opine on legislation created by a single or multiple members intended

branch and of any other elected official, including the Office of the State’s Attorney, in order to avoid a
conflict of interest when reviewing or opining on legislation as well as to function on behalf of and
exclusively in the best interest of the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, although the three Legislative Counsel positions created during the FY2011 were reduced to
one during the FY2012 budget, the underlying need for the Legislative Counsel function persists; and
WHEREAS, despite the remaining Legislative Counsel position being fully funded, it has yet to be filled;
and
WHEREAS, it is also prudent to establish the qualifications, mission and duties of said Legislative
Counsel.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter

WHEREAS, the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners, in recommending and
approving the
annual appropriation bill, has invested in many programs to protect the general public and reduce the jail
population at the Cook County Jail (“Jail”); and
WHEREAS, one of the programs the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners has invested
in is an aggressive Electronic Monitoring program which provides for a lower-cost alternative to housing
detainees at the Jail, provides a mechanism to reduce overcrowding at the Jail and allows certain detainees
to be monitored in a non-correctional setting; and
WHEREAS, the Jail continues to see an increase in the jail population and the Jail had an increase in the
average daily detainee population in 2012 from the average in 2011; and
WHEREAS, the cost per day of holding one individual in the Jail is significant and there should be an
enhanced emphasis in placing applicable detainees in an Electronic Monitoring program; and
WHEREAS, placing detainees on Electronic Monitoring in a qualifying residence is a cost-effective
alternativeto incarceration in the Jail; and
WHEREAS, Electronic Monitoring allows qualifying participants to continue to work, go to school, attend
religious services, and maintain family or community ties; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office operates an electronic monitoring program that can
cost-effectively and safely monitor over fifteen hundred participants at any given time; and
WHEREAS, Illinois statutes expressly permits the use of Electronic Monitoring initiated by Judges or the
Sheriff under certain specific circumstances; and

WHEREAS, since November 2012, the number of individuals using Electronic Monitoring has declined;
and
WHEREAS, the average daily number of participants on the Electronic Monitoring has decreased by over
four hundred since November 2012; and
WHEREAS, failure to use Electronic Monitoring programs to its greatest extent leads to additional costs
for the County, increases the jail population and prevents qualifying participants from maintaining family
and community ties; and
WHEREAS, the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners through the Justice Advisory
Councilshould work with the new General Assembly, the Chief Judge, the State’s Attorney, the Public
Defender and the Sheriff to review existing Electronic Monitoring laws and propose amendments to current
legislation that will continue to protect the public but also allow for a broader use of Electronic Monitoring
as a viable and safe alternative to incarceration in the Jail; and

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

November 19, 2014

WHEREAS, recommendations to modify and amend the existing Illinois laws to clarify and expand the
use of Electronic Monitoring as a viable and safe alternative to incarceration should be reviewed by the
President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, expanded use of Electronic Monitoring will reduce the Jail population, reduce the daily
expenditures of the Jail and will allow the President, Cook County Board of Commissioners, the County
and the Cook County Sheriff to reach substantial compliance under the Department of Justice Agreed
Order.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners encourages the use of electronic monitoring in Cook County as a tool to address crowding
at the Cook County Jail and to allow qualifying participants to be monitored in an approved residential
setting; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners
encourages the Justice Advisory Council and the County public safety officials to come together to explore
how to enhance the use of electronic monitoring and other effective means of reducing the population of
the jail; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a committee comprised of representatives from the Justice Advisory
Council, Chief Judges Office, Sheriff’s Office, State’s Attorney’s Office, Public Defender’s Office and
other appropriate agencies and departments meet to develop and implement these programs; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the committee report back to the President and the Cook County
Board of Commissioners at the first board meeting in May of 2013 and September of 2013 on its progress,
initiatives and activities to account for an enhanced use of Electronic Monitoring.

ISSUING A MORATORIUM ON FELONY PROSTITUTION CHARGES IN COOK COUNTY
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Toni Preckwinkle, President and Bridget Gainer, County
Commissioner; Co-sponsored by Earlean Collins, John P. Daley, John A. Fritchey, Jesus G. Garcia, Joan
Patricia Murphy, Edwin Reyes, Timothy O. Schneider, Deborah Sims, Robert B. Steele and Larry
Suffredin, County Commissioners.
WHEREAS, Illinois, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri and Texas are the only eight
(8) states in the Country to have a felony sentencing option for prostitution offenses; and
WHEREAS, of these eight (8) states, Illinois has the harshest sentencing option in the Country requiring
only one (1) prior prostitution conviction before a felony charge option is available for subsequent offenses;
and
WHEREAS, as noted by End Demand Illinois, the Department of Corrections reported 127 felony
prostitutionadmissions for 2012, costing the state $2,011,680.00. Pretrial detention for those facing felony
prostitution charges costs Cook County Department of Corrections between $5.3 to $9.5 million annually;
and
WHEREAS, felony convictions make the transition out of the sex trade to the legitimate economy more
difficult because those with felony convictions can be rejected from jobs, denied work authorization, denied
housing and can even be evicted from their homes for having a felony conviction; and
WHEREAS, rather than continuing to treat prostitution as a crime, we must shift our resources and focus
to the pimps and johns who exploit them.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the State’s Attorney, the President and the members of
the
Cook County Board of Commissioners urge the General Assembly to pass legislation that will permanently
remove the felony prostitution charge option from Illinois State Statute; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the State’s Attorney, the President and members of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners issue a moratorium on felony prostitution charges in Cook County.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
COB #323962
EVIDENCE-BASED COOK COUNTY BAIL SYSTEM REFORM
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by John A. Fritchey, County Commissioner.
EVIDENCE-BASED COOK COUNTY BAIL SYSTEM REFORM
WHEREAS, The Cook County Jail is on the verge of capacity and there exist serious and legitimate
concernsthat it will exceed capacity this summer; and
WHEREAS, in such an event, the County faces the threat of being ordered to build another jail at a cost
of tens of millions of taxpayer dollars on an unneeded facility; and
WHEREAS, our jail overcrowding situation is the consequence of a failing pretrial justice system; and
WHEREAS, while nationally, 60% of inmates in local jails are pre-trial detainees, pre-trial detainees
account for 90% of the inmates in Cook County Jail; and

WHEREAS, approximately 70% of incarcerated pre-trial detainees are being held pursuant to charges for
non-violent offenses; and
WHEREAS, in 2011, 79% of Cook County defendants were either ordered to pay financial bond to secure
release pending trial or held without bond, 13% were ordered released subject to electronic monitoring and
only 8% were released pursuant to an I-bond; which allows defendants to be released upon a signature but
still subjects them to payment of the full bond amount if they fail to make a required court appearance; and
WHEREAS, by contrast, New York City releases approximately 70% of their felony pre-trial defendants
on personal recognizance, and Washington, D.C. releases over 80% of their felony pre-trial defendants on
personal recognizance, yet both cities have high court appearance rates and low re-arrest rates; and
WHEREAS, when properly administered, bail is designed to be a function of risk to society or flight risk,
not simply a means test of ability to pay; and
WHEREAS, the overreliance on monetary bail, and the inability of many detainees is among the primary
drivers of the level and growth in our jail population; and
WHEREAS, an overreliance on monetary bail additionally means that those too poor to pay remain in jail
regardless of their risk level or presumed innocence; and
WHEREAS, pre-trial detainees are more likely to be convicted of a felony, receive a sentence of
incarceration, and be sentenced longer than those released while awaiting trial; and
WHEREAS, pre-trial detention inherently hinders defendants from tending to their families, holding

Page 184 of 510

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

November 19, 2014

employment or otherwise participating in society, instead subjecting than to unnecessary immersion in
prison culture; and
WHEREAS, the growing use of validated risk assessments create less need for money bail as people can
be rated according to potential risk and released appropriately; and
WHEREAS, a Pew Center on the States study showed that 84 percent of surveyed American voters
believed that community-based programs could be better used instead of relying on incarceration for people
convicted of low-level, non-violent offenses; and
WHEREAS, according to the Justice Policy Institute, “evidence suggests that up to 25% more people
could be safely released from U.S. jails while awaiting trial if the proper procedures are put in place,
including valid risk assessments and appropriate community supervision”; and
WHEREAS, in fiscal year 2012, the Cook County Board of Commissioners appropriated over $236
million dollars to its Department of Corrections, an increase of more than $10 million dollars from 2011
and an increase of over $57 million dollars since 2002; and
WHEREAS, a 25% reduction in the average daily jail population would save Cook County taxpayers
millions of dollars annually; and
WHEREAS, the adoption of evidence-based assessment of risk in setting pre-trial conditions of bail,
coupled with the expansion of pre-trial defendant interviews can substantially reduce the rate of pre-trial
detentions without impairing the judicial process or threatening public safety.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urges the
Cook County judiciary to work with other official stakeholders to design and implement a revised bail
structure reflective of the true purpose and safeguards of bail, aimed toward a goal of lowering jail
admissions by 25% over the next twelve months.

SECTION 1

Sponsored by: JOHN A. FRITCHEY, County Commissioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING FOR A COOK COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PUBLIC HEARING
WHEREAS, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), nearly 60 million Americans
experience a mental health condition every year; regardless of race, age, religion or economic status, mental
illness impacts the lives of at least one in four adults and 1 in 10 children across the United States; and
WHEREAS, deinstitutionalization, the name given to the policy of moving severely mentally ill people
out of large state institutions and then closing part or all of those institutions began in 1955 with the
widespread introduction of chlorpromazine, commonly known as Thorazine, the first effective
antipsychotic medication, and received a major impetus 10 years later with the enactment of federal
Medicaid and Medicare; and
WHEREAS, deinstitutionalization has inadvertently helped create the mental illness crisis by discharging

Page 335 of 510

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

November 19, 2014

people from public psychiatric hospitals without ensuring that they received the medication and
rehabilitation services necessary for them to live successfully in the community; and
WHEREAS, this policy further exacerbated the situation as once the public psychiatric beds had been
closed, they were not available for people who later became mentally ill, a situation that continues to this
day; and
WHEREAS, in addition, over the past decade, states have cut billions from their mental health budgets,
shuttering clinics across the country including here in Illinois and Cook County; resulting in thousands of
mentally ill people funneling in and out of the nation's jails that are ill-equipped to handle them, effectively
criminalizing mental illness; and
WHEREAS, according to the most recent national study conducted by the Justice Department's Bureau of
Justice Statistics in 2006, more than half of all prison and jail inmates, including 56 percent of state
prisoners, 45 percent of federal prisoners and 64 percent of local jail inmates, were found to have a mental
health problem; and
WHEREAS, jail and prison are particularly bad places for the mentally ill as men and women with
behavioral disorders and mental illness end up in stressful prison environments and many are put in
seclusion for long stretches of time that further exacerbate their conditions; and
WHEREAS, according to a 2010 study by the National Sheriffs’ Association and the Treatment Advocacy
Center, nationwide more than three times as many mentally ill people are housed in prisons and jails as in
hospitals; and
WHEREAS, in Cook County, it is estimated that up to 30% of inmates being held in the county jail have
a mental illness on a given day, making the jail Illinois’ and one of the nation’s largest mental health
facilities; and
WHEREAS, it costs $143 per day to house an inmate at the Cook County jail that number jumps to
upwards of $200 and sometimes far more for an inmate with a mental illness, due to the costs of medication
and the extra supervision and care that are required to support them; and
WHEREAS, their cases clog the courts with largely minor offenses that in turn lengthens the jail time for
everyone. The average length of stay is now eight days longer than it was just a few years ago, costing
county taxpayers $10 million more every year, which doesn’t include the associated court costs putting a
strain on the entire criminal justice system in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, treating the mentally ill in health clinics costs a fraction of what it costs to house them in the
county detention center, not to mention the human aspect of housing the mentally ill in a jail setting, where
they are often preyed upon while incarcerated, or disciplined because of trouble following rules, and are
much more likely than other prisoners, for example, to be injured in a fight; and
WHEREAS, the advent of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and resulting County Care program along with
State Medicaid has given the County a tool to potentially change the makeup of the jail population, decrease
the burden on local taxpayers, and ensure that the most vulnerable patients have access to coordinated
health-care coverage; and

Page 336 of 510

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

November 19, 2014

WHEREAS, at present up to 9,000 people who have been incarcerated at the County Jail have signed up
for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Health and Hospitals System plays an important role in providing care for
the mentally ill at the jail by administering Cermak Hospital, but also can play an important role in the
community at large along with its network of health-care providers and community-based organizations to
service the mentally ill population in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, it is essential that this government understands the nature, scope and costs associated with
the mental health crisis facing our county in order to make informed decisions to better respond to said
crisis while making efficient use of our limited resources;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby
request a public hearing be held to bring together key stakeholders in order to fully understand the status
of mental health in Cook County and its associated costs.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
FOR THE LEVY OF TAXES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2015
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners and the Committee on Finance of the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County, Illinois, have considered the subject of the Annual Tax Levy for the Fiscal
Year A.D., 2015, and the several sums necessary to be levied to meet the needs and requirements of the
County of Cook for said fiscal year, and have recommended that this Ordinance for the Levy of Taxes be
adopted; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, Illinois, approved, passed, and adopted the
Annual Appropriation Bill of the County of Cook, for its Fiscal Year 2015, which said Appropriation Bill
is hereinafter set forth and which contains a Revenue Estimate that includes an allocation of the Fiscal Year
2015 Tax Levy by Fund; and
WHEREAS, Cook County and its taxpayers have benefited from Tax Increment Financing Districts (TIFs)
by having the increment generated during the life of the TIFs invest in the specific area generating the
increment; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board passed a Resolution on November 15, 2011 outlining that it is the
policy of Cook County to recapture any property taxes at the termination of a TIF; and
WHEREAS, within the County of Cook, certain real-estate parcels are from time to time identified on the

County real-estate tax rolls as new properties, insofar as they were developed or substantially improved or
are the subject of tax incentives that expired since the most recent assessment of real-estate taxes, the value
of which has not heretofore been recaptured; and
WHEREAS, the interests of County taxpayers and the County itself are better served if the taxes on the
additional value of said new properties is recaptured.
THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED AND ORDERED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF
COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS, that pursuant to its home rule powers, $720,483,542.00 as a base levy
amount, plus a TIF value recapture sum of $9,166,938.00, an expiring incentives sum of $518,931.00, and
a new-property value recapture sum of $11,388,997.00, which aggregate amount of these sums is to be
collected from the Annual Tax Levy for the Fiscal Year A.D. 2015 of the County of Cook for the Corporate

Summary: The Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO) is requesting authorization to amend a
contract with MCPC, Inc. for refurbished toner cartridge supplies. On 2/1/2012, the Board of
Commissioners approved OCPO’s request for a Comparable Procurement pursuant to Section 34-140 of

under this contract can save the County an average of 30% on the purchase of toner cartridges. This
contract is for a time extension only, if approved, it would allow OCPO to prepare and issue an RFP in FY
2015 for a new contract.

Contract Number(s): N/A
Summary: The City of Chicago offers a service whereby, upon receipt of a list of all license plates
owned by or registered to Cook County, the City’s Department of Revenue will provide Cook County a
monthly consolidated notice via e-mail. This notice will contain all parking, compliance, and automated
traffic violations for all vehicles on the plate list on or about the 25th of every month.
Enrolling in the fleet noticing program, and having such a list, will enhance the County’s ability to ensure
citations are contested and/or paid by employees in a timely manner. Per ordinance, employees
are
responsible for the payment of any violations incurred while operating a county vehicle.
However, before the county can enroll in the noticing program, the County must pay all past due and
owing violations issued to county owned vehicles prior to October 9, 2014. The total amount due and
owing to the City for County violations inclusive of fees and penalties, is $82,730.
However, through
negotiation, the City has agreed to forego associated fees and penalties and accept the base value of the
violations, which is $41,640.
The Bureau of Administration is working with all County departments to identify the employees who
failed to pay his/her traffic violations and to collect reimbursement for these violations. Upon approval,
the Bureau of Administration will use the notice from the City to have all violations reassigned in the
name of the responsible employee so that the County can avoid a similar situation in the future.

JOB ORDER CONTRACT
Department:

Office of Capital Planning and Policy

Summary: The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, as authorized by the Cook County Chief
Procurement Officer, plans to participate in the Cook County’s Job Order Contract (JOC) program to
complete the four (4) capital projects listed below. JOC is a quantity based procurement process that
allows facility owners to complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and construction projects with a
single, competitively bid contract. The JOC process generally involves first selecting a pool of potential
contractors through a competitive procurement process, and then identifying projects for such selected
contractors.
The County has already completed a JOC competitive procurement process, and it has created the pool of
general contractors to perform certain projects generally associated with maintenance, repairs, replacement
and routine work.
The JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group. The Gordian Group
maintains an area price book, which captures the prices for specific construction work items within this
region. JOC contractors bid against the prices included in the price book. The cost, therefore, of any
work performed by the contractor is a contractor markup form the price book. The Gordian Group will
manage the JOC process and will verify that all proposals and work are compliant with the terms and
conditions outlined in the JOC contract with the County.
The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, proposes to assigns the projects listed below to the Gordian
Group to share with participating JOC contractors.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

November 19, 2014

Grantee: County of Cook
Grantor: Illinois Clean Energy Community Foundation
Request: Authorization to accept grant
Purpose: Solar Thermal Installation
Grant Amount: $63,936.00
Grant Period: 5/1/2013 - 7/31/2014
Fiscal Impact: N/A
Accounts: N/A
Concurrences: The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal
impact on Cook County, if any.
Summary: A grant in the amount of $63,936 was awarded to County of Cook to install a solar thermal
system at the Vocational Rehabilitation Impact Center (aka Bootcamp) at the Department of Corrections
(DOC) Complex. The renewable energy project is part of a campus wide energy efficiency improvement
project via energy savings performance contract between Cook County Office of Capital Planning and
NORESCO at the Department of Corrections 26th and California Street Complex. The grant funds were
used to install sixteen (16) A.E.T solar collectors (640 sq. ft.) and associated equipment and offset part of
the need for natural gas. The funds allowed the County to decrease the 51 year payback to a more
reasonable 19 years and own its second renewable energy project. The solar hot water system
supplemented the other energy conservation measures implemented to achieve a 20% reduction in annual
utility use campus wide. The solar panels were installed and commissioned on July 3, and the remaining
associated equipment (fencing, meter) and close out was completed 7/17/2014. Training of facility
engineers was completed on 8/21/2014.

CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT

Presented by: DOROTHY BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
PROPOSED PAYMENT APPROVAL
Department(s): Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County
Action: Approval of payment
Payee: Digby’s Detective & Security Agency, Chicago, Illinois
Good(s) or Service(s): Unarmed Security Guard Services
Fiscal Impact: $7,140.00
Accounts: 529-660
Contract Number(s): 10-53-199
Summary: The Clerk of the Circuit Court is requesting to make final payment to Digby’s Detective &
Security Agency for unarmed security guard services performed under Contract #10-53-199. The vendor
provided security for two Clerk of the Circuit Court facilities, under two separate bid contracts, during
the time the contracted services were being performed. Due to a payment being erroneously processed
against one of the two contracts a shortage in available funds was created under the other Contract
#10-53-199. Although both Clerk’s Office contracts have ended, the pending payment still needs to be
made for the services that were rendered.

PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Department: Cook County Clerk
Request: Transfer funds between printing accounts in the Elections Department
Reason: Costs of training manuals and polling place materials exceeded budgeted amount in Internal
Printing account
From Account(s): 524-240, $118,331.00
To Account(s): 524-241, $118,331.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $118,331.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
10/14/2014. The balance on that date was $19,859.00 and 30 days prior the balance in the account was
$45,324.85
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The source account is used for External printing (240). The increased effort to use the Cook County
Print Shop has reduced the load on this account and shifted it to the Internal Printing Account (241)
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Projects which were to be completed by outside vendors using the External printing budget were instead
completed internally by the Cook County Print Shop. Therefore, the resulting surplus in the source
account (241) is directly related to the deficit in the transfer account (241).

A motion was made by Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Sims, that this
Transfer of Funds be approved. The motion carried by the following vote:
Aye:

services for inmates and a determination if any savings were achieved; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Chief Judge, Sheriff, State’s Attorney, Public Defender, Clerk
of the Circuit Court, Justice Advisory Council and President of the Cook County Board shall file with the
President and the County Board a report which provides an accounting of all actions taken to reduce the

ENSURING THE MAXIMUM COLLECTION OF REVENUE FROM INSURERS
AT THE COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITAL SYSTEM

WHEREAS, the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) provides care for patients regardless
of their ability to pay; and
WHEREAS, the Affordable Care Act has dramatically altered the mix of patients served by Cook County
Health and Hospital System (CCHHS). Just over one year ago, most patients served by Cook County
Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) were uninsured while today more than half have some form of health
insurance including patients with private commercial insurance purchased through the Affordable Care Act;
and
WHEREAS, despite these strides, health care continues to create financial uncertainty for individuals on
the lower end of the income scale. Despite the improved access to insurance, the high deductibles
associated with many commercial insurance plans sold under the Affordable Care Act marketplaces mean
that many individuals remain just one health emergency away from significant financial challenges; and

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

WHEREAS, this uncertainty is compounded because many individuals, despite federal subsidies to help
pay monthly premium costs, can only afford to pay for commercial insurance plans that expose them to
significant costs to meet the deductibles; and
WHEREAS, even caps contained in the Affordable Care Act on out-of-pocket costs do not fully bridge the
cap between what patients may owe and what they can afford; and
WHEREAS, typically, insurance companies will not begin to compensate health care providers, like Cook
County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS), for the provision of care until a patient has paid their
deductible; and
WHEREAS, it would be in the County’s best interests to maximize the payments received from health care
insurance companies.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Budget Director and the Chief
Executive Officer of the Cook County Health and Hospital System shall review the legal and financial
feasibility of a program to loan, otherwise pay, or assist in paying, deductible costs for patients who are
unable to afford them and who have received healthcare costing in excess of 200% of the deductible in
order to allow CCHHS to realize increased revenue from insurance companies for care provided.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a recommendation regarding implementation of such a program
shall be made to the Cook County Board of Commissioners no later than March 1, 2014.
