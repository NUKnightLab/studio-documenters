Exhibit A
Proposed Stone Soap Redevelopment
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

B. Basis of Eligibility (Section 13 (2)01) and Section 2 

The Property is considered ?eligible property? as de?ned by Act 381, Section 2 because
the Property was previously utilized for industrial, commercial and residential purposes;
it is located within the City of Detroit, a quali?ed local governmental unit under Act
381; and the Property is determined to be a ?facility? as de?ned by Act 381 and a ?site?
under Part 213.

The Property is an open Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) site with one gasoline
release (C-0016-10) reported in January 2010 based on the in-place closure of one 1,000-
gallon and one 2,500-gallon gasoline USTs in the southeastern portion of the subject
building.

Additionally, based on current and previous site investigation activities contaminant
concentrations identi?ed in soil and groundwater on the Property indicate exceedances of
the Part 201/213 Residential and Nonresidential Drinking Water Protection/Drinking
Water Groundwater Surface Water Interface Protection/Groundwater Surface
Water Interface Soil Volatilization to Indoor Air Inhalation (SVII) and Direct
Contact (DC) cleanup criteria/Risked Based Screening Levels 

Groundwater analytical results identi?ed concentrations of various metals collected from
the Property above the Part 201/213 Residential and Nonresidential DW and GSI cleanup


A concentration of carbon tetrachloride was identi?ed above the Part 201 Residential and
Nonresidential DWP cleanup criteria. Concentrations of 1,2-dichloropropane were
identi?ed above the Part 201 Residential and Nonresidential DWP cleanup criteria.
Concentrations of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) were identi?ed in the soil samples above the
Part 201 Residential and Nonresidential DWP and/or GSIP cleanup criteria.
Concentrations of trichloroethylene (TCE) were identi?ed in the soil samples above the
Part 201 Residential and Nonresidential DWP, GSIP, and/or SVII cleanup criteria.
Concentrations of mercury were identi?ed in the soil samples above the Part 201
Residential and Nonresidential DWP and/or GSIP cleanup criteria.

Therefore, based on the soil and groundwater concentrations and the open LUST status,
the Property is considered a facility under Part 201 and a site under Part 213.

C. Summary of Eligible Activities and Description chusts [Section 13 (2)04)an

that term is de?ned below). Any long-term monitoring or operation and maintenance
activities or obligations that may be required will be performed in compliance with the
terms of this Plan and any documents prepared pursuant to this Plan.

The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment

conditions encountered on the Property. The actual cost of those eligible activities
encompassed by this Plan that will qualify for reimbursement from tax increment revenues
of the DBRA from the Property shall be governed by the terms of the Reimbursement
Agreement. No costs of eligible activities will be quali?ed for reimbursement except to
the extent permitted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Reimbursement
Agreement and Act 381. The Reimbursement Agreement and this Plan will dictate the
total cost of eligible activities subject to payment or reimbursement, provided that the total
cost of eligible activities subject to payment or reimbursement under the Reimbursement
Agreement shall not exceed the estimated costs set forth in Attachment E. As long as the
total costs are not exceeded, line item costs of eligible activities may be adjusted after the

Project Description

Stone Soap Development
1450, 1460, and 1490 Franklin Street

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Development Team and Company Synopsis

Banyan Investments, LLC (Banyan) is the project developer (?Developer?) and proposed
owner of the Property. Banyan is a local property development and management firm
that restores, renovates and manages real estate in and around Detroit. The group
focuses on single family homes, multi-units, and mixed-use buildings in target areas of
the city. Banyan is guided by a simple philosophy that good ethics is good business and
its success is founded on the belief that we will ?do well by doing good.?

Since inception, Banyan has grown a rich portfolio of properties in various parts of
Greater Detroit, several of which are in historic districts of the city such as the Boston-
Edison area, the Historic Indian Village and West Village. These properties speak of a
bygone era and reflect Detroit's former grandeur. Banyan seeks to identify and acquire
properties that enable the delivery of their mission and intends to ensure each property
is carefully restored.

Banyan is led by Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Aamir Farooqi, a Chartered Accountant
(CPA) and a Member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England Wales.
Before starting Banyan Investments, Aamir spent 25 years with Cargill, Incorporated in
the United States, South America, Europe and Asia. Cargill, Inc. (headquartered in
Minneapolis, Minnesota) is one ofthe world's largest corporations involved in agriculture
and global food and commodities.

The development team has selected O?Brien Construction Company, Inc. as the General
Contractor and VolumeOne Design Studio as the architect.

Project Synopsis

The Developer intends to complete a partial
rehabilitation and redevelopment of the
Property which is composed of three adjoining
three and four-story buildings. Located in
Detroit's Rivertown neighborhood east of
downtown, the three buildings have been
vacant for approximately twenty years.
Previous uses include a variety of residential,
industrial, and retail purposes, most notably
Stone Soap Company, Inc. from which the
Development gained its name.

 

The western building (1450 Franklin Street) was constructed between 1884 and 1897.
The central building (1460 Franklin Street) totals 32,644 square feet and was constructed
in approximately 1907. The eastern building (1490 Franklin Street) totals approximately
40,992 square feet and was constructed between 1927 and 1929.

Attachment 
Page 1

The project entails the demolition of the two eastern
buildings (1460 and 1490 Franklin Street) and
renovation and expansion of the third building (1450
Franklin Street). When completed, the multistory
building will function as residential and commercial
space, totaling approximately 132,000 square feet.
The addition features a slopping, wedge-like roof,
connecting the eight-story section to the original,
four-story 1450 Franklin building. The Stone Soap
Development will feature commercial spaces on the 
first and second floors of the existing building, which include a theater, wine bar, market,
and office space. The total office, commercial, and theater space will occupy
approximately 23,000 square feet. The theater space is anticipated to house
Shakespeare in Detroit. Approximately 48 residential units are proposed to occupy floors
3 through 8, totaling approximately 58,000 square feet. The apartment units will be
reserved as affordable units at 80% Area Median Income (AMI).

 

In addition, floors one and two will be partially
utilized as an internal parking structure to serve
residents. Other residential facilities include a
gym, pool, rooftop gardens, storage, and bike
stations.

The redesign of the Stone Soap Development
strategically balances the juxtaposition of old and
new. The original building?s remaining brick facade
and large exterior windows will be restored and
replaced to withhold historical accuracy. The contemporary L-shaped addition will be
minimalistic and industrial, sporting a galvanized metal panel facade. Floor to ceiling
windows will be installed to mimic the original architecture, creating a unifying and
contemporary composition.

 

Upon completion, this project will bring a vacant
and underutilized property back to productive use,
addressing the growing demand for residential and
commercial space within Rivertown and will further
catalyze economic development in the area.

Project Investment Estimates

 

 

Capital Cost Total Cost

Acquisition Cost 725,000
Renovation/Rehabilitation 31,000,000
Soft Costs 6,675,000
Total Capital Costs 38,400,000

Additional Financing Incentives Associated with the Redevelopment

Substantial investment is necessary to rehabilitate the existing building. In efforts to
grow this project into a viable, long-term redevelopment, the Developer will also apply
for secured a Michigan Community Revitalization Program (CRP) loan, Neighborhood
Enterprise Zone (NEZ) tax abatements, and a Public Act 255 Commercial
Redevelopment Act Tax Abatement for the project.

Cost/Benefit Analysis

The proposed project will help meet demand for commercial and housing stock in
Detroit?s Rivertown neighborhood. The Stone Soap redevelopment is part of the city?s
larger East Riverfront framework plan, designed to return the riverfront back to the
citizens of Detroit. The development works under the East Riverfront area plan,
transforming a former blighted, industrial Property into a contemporary multiuse building.
Investment such as the Stone Soap Development will help create an integrated and
vibrant waterfront for all Detroiters.

The additional commercial and residential housing within the City will contribute to new
income tax for Detroit as a result of the creation of private investment. The project will
provide a retail and entertainment destination and increase the density of the Rivertown
neighborhood to further catalyze economic development in the surrounding area. Local
businesses in the area will benefit from an influx of new jobs into the area and an
increase in spinoff consumer spending.

On a short-term basis, approximately 200?250 construction jobs will be created during
the estimated two?year construction period. On a long-term basis the proposed
redevelopment associated with the project will create approximately 2 full time equivalent
(FTE) jobs directly by the developer. It is estimated that future tenants will create an
additional 10 FTE jobs. The development team will solicit bidders and garner
opportunities to employ Detroit residents and Detroit-based businesses.

The increase in tenant-based jobs within the building will increase City collected income
tax at a 1.2% rate for non-residents and 2.4% rate for Detroiters.

Over time, successful redevelopment will have a significant impact on the Rivertown
neighborhood

RE: Letter of Support for the 1450 Franklin Road Mixed Use Development

Dear Mr. Vosburg:

The Detroit Riverfront Conservancy (DRFC) would like to express our full support for this
mixed use development here on the east riverfront. The DRFC has been working
diligently to develop public space along the riverfront to bring people to this natural
resource. Through our efforts we have seen the private investment in this area flourish 
our 2013 Economic Impact Study identified $1 billion of investment to this area.

The mixed use development being proposed by Banyan Investments will be another
illustration of economic investment that will uplift and improve the visitor experience
here in Rivertown. This is the kind of real estate and economic developments that will
enhance this district and provide much needed amenities and services.

We are committed to building, operating, programming and maintaining the Detroit
RiverWalk so that all feel welcome.

If you need any additional information, please feel free to contact me.

Baseline Environmental Assessment of the Industrial Warehouse Property
Located at 1450-1490 Franklin Street, Detroit, Michigan

PM Environmental, lnc. Project No. 01-10433-0-0002; February 7, 2019

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND DISCUSSION

PM Environmental, Inc. (PM) has completed 3 Baseline Environmental Assessment (BEA) forthe
Industrial Warehouse Property (Parcel IDs #07000027, #07000026, and #07000025) located at
1450-1490 Franklin Street in Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan (hereafter referred to as the
?subject property") in accordance with Section 20126(1)(c) of Part 201, Environmental
Remediation, and Section 21323a(1)(b)(i) of Part 213, Leaking Underground Storage Tanks, of
the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (NREPA), PA 451 of 1994, as
amended.

The subject property consists of three parcels of land totaling 0.66 acres and is located on the
southwest corner of the Franklin Street and Riopelle Street intersection in Detroit, Wayne County,
Michigan (Figure 1). The subject property is developed with three connected buildings between
three and four-stories with a partial basement containing a total of 64,145 square feet that is
currently unoccupied with no current business operations. The western portion of the subject
building (1450 Franklin Street) contains four stories and a full basement totaling 26,737 square
feet. The fourth floor was inaccessible due to unsafe conditions (floor/roof collapse). The central
portion of the subject building (1460 Franklin Street) contains two stories and a partial crawl space
totaling 12,724 square feet. No access point to the crawl space was observed; therefore, PM
could not access that portion of the subject building. The eastern portion of the subject building
(1490 Franklin Street) contains three stories totaling 24,684 square feet and is slab on grade.
Portions of the building slab appear to have been removed, resulting in exposed soil.

In general, interior finish materials include wood floors, painted and unpainted brick walls, poured
concrete floors, walls, and ceilings, concrete block walls, plaster walls and ceilings, wood deck
ceilings, and one?foot by one-foot glue-on ceiling tiles. The observed materials were in generally
poor condition. The concrete floors were in fair condition, with residual staining, but no significant
cracking, pitting, or damage observed.

Asphalt and concrete pavement are present throughout the remainder of the subject property.

Standard and other historical sources document that the subject property was developed prior to
1884 with ten dwellings and several detached garages. All former dwellings, except two located
in the central portion, were demolished between 1884 and 1897, when a northwestern building,
northeastern building, additional dwelling, and western portion of the current building were
constructed. The remaining dwellings and former northeastern building were demolished between
1897 and 1922, when an additional western building was constructed as an addition to the
previously identified northeastern building and another building was constructed in the eastern
portion of the property. The concrete pad in the southwestern portion was constructed in 1922.
The eastern building and a portion of the northern addition to the western building were
demolished between 1922 and 1927, when an addition was constructed to the eastern portion of
the current building tojoin the three buildings into one. A third story was constructed to the eastern
portion in 1929. The northwestern building was demolished between 1950 and 1952. Historical
occupants consisted of residential tenants priorto 1884 until 1922; storefront operations in at least
1897; blacksmith operations in 1897; Detroit Screw Works and exterior steel storage in 1922;
various chemical and dye storage, warehouse, mixing, and production operations; and Stone
Soap Co. consisting of liquid and powder soap manufacturing operations from approximately
1972 to 1997.

Parcel le: 07000027, 07000026, and 07000025

PM Environmental, Inc. Project No. 01-10433-0-0002; February 7, 2019

The subject property is an open Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) site with one
gasoline release (C-0016-10) reported in January 2010 based on the in-place closure of one
1,000?gallon and one 2,500?gallon gasoline USTs in the southeastern portion of the subject
building. The responsible part is identified as Former Stone Soap Co., and LUST closure activities
have not been conducted.

1.1 Owner/Operator Information
Banyan Investments, LLC purchased the subject property on January 2, 2019.
1.2 Intended Use of the Subject Property

Banyan Investments, LLC intends to redevelop the subject property for mixed residential and
general commercial use.

The subject property is currently zoned SD-4 Special Development District/Riverfront Mixed Use.
The intended use and zoning are consistent with a mixed ResidentiallNonresidential property use.

Municipal water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, natural gas, electrical, and telecommunications
utilities and connected to or are available to the subject property. No water wells are present on
the property.

1.3 Summary of All Appropriate Inquiry Phase Environmental Site Assessment

PM performed a Phase Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) for the subject property dated
January 25, 2019, in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice 1527-13
the Standard?). A copy of the Phase I ESA, including photographs of the subject
property, is included in Appendix A.

PM's January 2019 Phase I ESA identified the following onsite recognized environmental
conditions (RECs):

- The subject property is an open LUST site with one release (C-0016-10) reported in 2010.
Additionally, historical operations at the subject property consisting of chemical mixing and
soap factory operations with known bulk chemical storage. Previous site assessment
activities completed between 1997 and 2013 to assess the release and historical
operations document that soil and groundwater contamination exist on-site above the
current Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) Part 201 generic cleanup
criteria and Part 213 Risk Based Screening Levels Based on these analytical
results and its open LUST status, the subject property meets the definition of a ?site? and
would also be classified as a ?facility?, in accordance with Part 201 and Part 213.
Additionally, based on the concentrations of contaminants identified, the potential for
vapor intrusion exists at the subject property.

a PM recommends the further assessment of the previously reported release 
located south of the subject property, identified during 2013 previous site assessments.
Although the previously identified suspect underground storage tanks (USTs) and known
release were not located within the subject property boundaries; the suspect USTs were

likely installed associated with historical operations on the subject property. The potential
exists for contamination from the known release to also exist on the subject property.

- PM observed four sumps throughout the subject building. The westernmost basement
sump was adequately assessed during previous site investigations; however, the
remaining three were not assessed during the previous site assessment since they were
not observed (likely due to interior limitations such as storage). The structural integrity of
the three sumps is unknown, and based on the age ofthe subject building (at least 90 and
up to 135 years), the potential exists for failure of the systems cracks, leaks) to have
occurred over time. The historical waste management practices associated with the
sumps and former high risk operations (discussed above) are unknown and may be a
source of subsurface contamination.

No adjoining and/or nearby RECs were identified.
1.3.1 Phase I ESA Exceptions or Deletions

During the completion of the January 2019 Phase I ESA, there were no exceptions or deletions
from the Federal All Appropriate Inquiry Rule under 40 CFR 312, or the ASTM Standard. To the
best of PMS knowledge, no special terms or conditions applied to the preparation of the Phase I
ESA.

1.3.2 Phase I ESA Data Gaps

PM did not identify any significant data gaps during the completion of the January 2019 Phase I
ESA.

1.4 Summary of Previous Site Investigations

Phase I ESA and Phase II ESA and Atweii, 1997)

At the time of the 1997 site investigations, the subject property was occupied by Stone Soap Co.
(liquid and powder soap manufacturing company). The 1997 Phase I ESA identified RECs
associated with the following:

Suspect asbestos containing materials 
Current and potential orphan 

Onsite aboveground storage tank and
Current and former high risk operations.

Suspect ACMs are not considered RECs, but considerations, and therefore are not
discussed further in site investigation summaries discussed in this report.

AH conducted a subsurface investigation to assess the above RECs, as well as a suspect
gasoline UST and two onsite drains. Site investigation activities consisted of the advancement of
nine soil borings (SB-1 through B1, BZ, and F1), the installation of two temporary
groundwater monitoring wells (TW1 and TW2), and the collection of soil and groundwater samples
for laboratory analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons
(PNAs), and Michigan 10 Metals (arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury,
selenium, silver, zinc). No geophysical survey was conducted to verify the presence of orphan
USTs.

Soil analytical results identified concentrations of (DCE),
tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and/or trichloroethylene (TCE) in the soil sample collected from 88-6
(8.0 feet below ground surface [bgs]) above the Part 201 Residential and Nonresidential Drinking
Water Protection (DWP) cleanup criteria. Concentrations of fluoranthene, naphthalene, and
phenanthrene were identified in the soil sample collected from F1 (3.0 feet bgs) above the Part
201 Groundwater Surface Water Interface Protection (GSIP) cleanup criteria. Concentrations of
arsenic were identified in the soil samples collected from 88-3 (7.0 feet bgs), 88-4 (7.0 feet bgs),
B1 (4.0 feet bgs), and B2 (4.0 feet bgs) above the Part 201 Residential and Nonresidential DWP,
GSIP, and/or Residential Direct Contact (DC) cleanup criteria, but below the Nonresidential DC
cleanup criteria. Concentrations of total chromium were identified in the soil samples collected
from SB-6 (8.0 feet bgs) and 82 (4.0 feet bgs) above the Part 201 GSIP cleanup criteria.
Concentrations of selenium were identified in each of the soil samples collected from the subject
property above the Part 201 GSIP cleanup criteria. No other concentrations of target analytes
were identified in the soil samples collected from the subject property above laboratory method
detection limits (MDLs), Statewide Default Background Levels applicable to metals only),
and/or the most restrictive Part 201 Residential cleanup criteria.

The cis-1,2-DCE, PCE, and TCE concentrations identified in soil may be indicative of a vapor
intrusion condition.

Concentrations of fluorene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and were identified
in the groundwater sample collected from TW2 above the Part 201 Groundwater Surface Water
Interface (GSI) cleanup criteria. Concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, total chromium, copper,
lead, and zinc were identified in the groundwater sample collected from TW2 above the Part 201
Residential and Nonresidential Drinking Water (DW) and/or GSI cleanup criteria. No other
concentrations of target analytes were identified in the groundwater samples collected from the
subject property above laboratory MDLs and/or the most restrictive Part 201 Residential cleanup
criteria.

Based on the limited, perched, discontinuous nature of groundwater encountered, lack of potable
water wells at the subject property, and lack of surface water bodies at the subject property, AH
concluded that the groundwater ingestion and drinking water pathways were not complete. Based
upon this information, AH determined the subject property did not meet the definition of a ?facility?
as defined by Part 201.

Phase LESA, Phase ll ESA, and BEAs (ESAT and El, 2006-2008i

At the time of the site investigations conducted between 2006 and 2008, the subject property was
occupied by the current building, which was vacant. The 2006 Phase I ESA identified the following
RECs:

0 Former and historical long term high risk operations;
a Current and potential orphan and
0 General hazardous material storage and an onsite AST.

Subsequent site investigation activities included the completion of a geophysical survey using
GPR, advancement of six soil borings (881 through 886), installation of two temporary
groundwater monitoring wells and GW-2), and collection of soil and groundwater samples
for laboratory analysis of gasoline VOCs, PNAs, cadmium, chromium, and lead. All of the soil
borings were advanced south of the subject building. Review of reasonably ascertainable
information indicated that site investigation activities were conducted on a south adjoining
easement parcel and not the subject property parcel. Additionally, a 2009 survey documented
that the subject property consists of the subject building footprint and small area between the
subject building and west adjoining building (Figure 2).

Three anomalies consistent with orphan USTs were identified south of the subject building.

Soil analytical results identified concentrations of various gasoline range VOCs in the soil sample
collected from 884 (90?100 feet bgs) above the Part 201/213 Residential and Nonresidential
DWP cleanup No other concentrations of target analytes were identified in the soil
samples collected from the subject property above laboratory MDLs, (applicable to metals
only), and/or the most restrictive Part 201/213 Residential cleanup 

Concentrations of benzene and were identified in the groundwater sample
collected from GW-2 above the Part 201/213 Residential and Nonresidential DW and/or GSI

GSI cleanup and Water Solubility screening levels. Concentrations of cadmium,
chromium, and lead were identified in each of the groundwater samples collected from the subject

Based on these analytical results, BEAs were submitted on behalf of various previous owners in
2007 (BEA ID: 3530) and 2008 (BEA ID: 4069). Additionally, based on these analytical results,
the MDEQ assigned the subject property a facility ID (50005619) and reported a release (C-0127-
07); however, this release and facility status are not identified in the regulatory database reviewed
as part of the January 2019 Phase I ESA, and are not listed on the MDEQ LUST database. Based
upon this information, the assessments conducted south of the subject property should not be
considered associated with the subject property.

Phase ESA and BEA (PM, 20051-2010}

At the time of the 2009 Phase I ESA, the subject property was occupied by the current building,
which was vacant. PM identified multiple RECs associated with the following:

0 Unknown historical heat source;

0 Historical and former high risk onsite operations associated with Eaton Chemical, Detroit

Screw Works, and Stone Soap Co., including the storage, use, and/or mixing of various

oils, acids, chemicals, and dyes;

Multiple potential orphan 

Onsite 

Onsite floor drains and sumps with unknown historical waste management practices;

Suspect former pits;

Elevator shafts and associated leaking;

- Long term high risk operation at the northwest adjoining property (1424?1461 Franklin
Street);

- Open LUST status and documented contamination at the southeast adjoining property (no
current address), with contamination not delineated towards the subject property; and

- Former long term high risk operations at the west adjoining property (1440 Franklin
Street).

Subsequent site investigation activities completed in December 2009 and January 2010 included
the completion of a geophysical survey using GPR, advancement of 16 soil borings though
83-16), and collection of 16 soil samples for laboratory analysis of VOCs, PNAs, 
biphenyls (PCBs), and Michigan 10 Metals, or some combination thereof. Groundwater was not
encountered to a depth of 20.0 feet (maximum depth explored). The 2009/2010 soil boring
locations and analytical results are depicted on Figure 3A. January 2010 laboratory
analytical reports are available on file with the MDEQ.

PM encountered debris piles, miscellaneous storage, elevator shafts, and a crawl space as
limitations during the GPR survey in December 2009. Two anomalies consistent with orphan
USTs were identified in the southeastern portion of the subject building. No other anomalies
consistent with orphan USTs were identified. In January 2010, PM oversaw site investigation
activities that consisted of the exposure of the top of the anomalies discussed above, which
confirmed the presence of two orphan USTs. Due to their location, it was determined that the
USTs, consisting of one 1,000-gallon and 1 one 2,500-gallon gasoline USTs, would have to be

closed in place (Figure 2). The USTs were opened and approximately 1,250 gallons of gasoline
and/or water were removed from the USTs, which was transported offsite by a licensed waste
hauler. The USTs were then cleaned and filled with concrete.

The onsite AST was determined to be empty.

Soil analytical results identified concentrations of various petroleum and/or chlorinated VOCs in
the soil samples collected from 88-1 (3.0-4.0 feet bgs), 88-2 (1 .0-2.0 feet bgs), 88-4 (1 0-20 feet
bgs), SB-5 (2.0?3.0 feet bgs), (7.0-8.0 feet bgs), (4.0?5.0 feet bgs), (2.0-3.0 feet

phenanthrene, naphthalene, and were identified in the soil samples
collected from 88-6 (7.0?8.0 feet bgs), SB-9 (2.0-3.0 feet bgs), SB-15 (7.0-8.0 feet bgs), and/or
SB-16 (8.0-9.0 feet bgs) above the Part 201/213 GSIP cleanup Concentrations of
mercury, selenium, and/or zinc were identified in the soil samples collected from SB-1 (3.0?4.0
feet bgs), SB-2 (1.0?2.0 feet bgs), and/or 88-4 (1 0-20 feet bgs) above the Part 201 Residential
and Nonresidential DWP and GSIP cleanup criteria. No other concentrations of target analytes
were identified in the soil samples collected from the subject property above laboratory MDLs,
(metals) and/or the most restrictive Part 201/213 Residential cleanup 

Based on these analytical results, a release was reported to the MDEQ on January 25, 2010 (C-
0016-10). Additionally, a BEA was submitted on behalf of the former owner (BEA ID: 4415).
Closure is not currently being pursued.

Phase I ESA, GPR. and Phase II ESA (ETC. 2013)

At the time of the 2013 Phase I ESA, the subject property was occupied by the current building,
which was vacant at that time. The 2013 Phase I ESA RECs associated with the following:

Potential orphan 

Open LUST status;

Historical long term high risk operations; and
Documented facility status.

Subsequent site investigations included the completion of a geophysical survey using
electromagnetic induction (EM), advancement of nine soil borings through and HA-1
through installation of two temporary monitoring wells (GP-1 and GP-2), and collection of
nine soil samples and two groundwater samples for laboratory analysis of VOCs, semi-volatile
organic compounds (SVOCs), and Michigan 10 Metals, or some combination thereof.

Four anomalies potentially indicative of orphan USTs were identified south of the subject building.
However, additional investigation was recommended to verify the source of the anomalies, which
were potentially identified as buried rail road tracks or utility lines/vaults.

Soil analytical results identified concentrations of various petroleum and chlorinated VOCs in the
soil samples collected from (5.0 feet bgs), GP-2 (3.0 feet bgs), (3.0 feet bgs), HA-2
(3.0 feet bgs), HA-3 (3.0 feet bgs), and HA-4 (3.0 feet bgs) above the Part 201/213 Residential

Groundwater analytical results identified concentrations of various metals in both of the
groundwater samples collected from the subject property above the Part 201/213 Residential and
Nonresidential DW and GSI cleanup 

The soil and groundwater sample locations and analytical results are depicted on Figure 2
Phase II Boring Locations and listed in Soil Sample Results table included in Appendix
B.

Based on these analytical results, ETC recommended additional investigation of the anomalies
identified south ofthe subject building, and completion of a BEA and Due Care Plan.

1.5 Summary of Current Site Investigation

On January 14, and 15, 2019, PM completed a subsurface investigation at the subject property
that consisted of the advancement of seven soil borings through 88?23) to a maximum
depth of 10.0 feet bgs, the installation of seven temporary sub-slab soil gas sampling points 
1 through and the collection of 14 soil samples and seven soil gas samples for laboratory
analysis of VOCs, PNAs, PCBs, cadmium, chromium, lead and mercury, or some combination
thereof. It should be noted that the crawl space in the central portion of the subject building was
inaccessible and, therefore, PM could not investigate the sump in that area.

Groundwater was not encountered to the maximum explored depth of 10.0 feet bgs; therefore, no
groundwater samples were collected for laboratory analysis.

Figures 38 and 4 depict the soil borings and soil gas sample locations advanced by PM. Boring
logs, which depict site?specific geology, PID readings, and soil and soil gas sample intervals are
included within Appendix C.

The table below summarizes the site investigation activities including total boring depth, sample

1.5.1 Subsurface Investigations Techniques and QAIQC Procedures

The soil borings were advanced to the desired depth using a hand auger equipped with a stainless
steel bucket. Soil sampling was performed for soil classification, verification of subsurface
geologic conditions, and for investigating the potential and/or extent of soil and/or groundwater
contamination at the subject property. Soil samples were generally collected on a continuous
basis using a hand auger equipped with a stainless?steel bucket.

During drilling operations, the drilling equipment was cleaned to minimize the possibility of cross
contamination. These procedures included cleaning equipment with a phosphate free solution
Alconox?) and rinsing with distilled water after each sample collection. Drilling and sampling
equipment was also cleaned in this manner prior to initiating field activities.

Soils collected from discrete sample intervals were screened using a photoionization detector
(PID) to determine if VOCs were present. Soil from specific depths was placed in plastic bags,
sealed, and allowed to volatilize. The headspace within each bag was then monitored with the
PID. The PID is able to detect trace levels of organic compounds in the air space within the plastic
bag. The PID utilizes a 10.6 electron volts (eV) lamp. Soil samples were collected from the soil
borings based upon the highest PID reading, visual/olfactory evidence of impact, a change in
geology, and/or surficial soil.

The soil samples for VOC analysis were preserved with methanol in accordance with United
States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Method 5035 modified. The soil samples were
placed in appropriately labeled containers with Teflon? lined lids and/or sanitized glass jars,

placed in an ice-packed cooler, and transported under chain of custody procedures for laboratory
analysis within applicable holding times to Merit Laboratories, Inc. in East Lansing, Michigan.

The soil gas samples were collected in one liter sample canister supplied by the laboratory using
dynamic flux chamber methods in accordance with the May 2013 MDEQ Guidance Document for
the Vapor Intrusion Pathway. Prior to collecting the soil gas samples, the sampling apparatus
was determined to be leak free utilizing the flux chamber which encompassed the sample tubing
and associated connections as well as the sampling point. The chamber was charged with helium
prior to purging the sampling point of a maximum of three volumes. A helium detector was then
applied to the sampling line to ensure no leaks had occurred. The sample canister was regulated
with a flow rate of 200 ml/minute, which was pre-set at the laboratory. The soil gas samples were
collected in appropriately labeled canisters and then transported under chain of custody
procedures for laboratory analysis within applicable holding times.

Upon completion ofthe investigation, the soil borings were abandoned by removing the temporary
soil gas sample materials, placing the soil cuttings back into the borehole, filling the void with
bentonite chips, hydrating the chips, resurfacing and returning the area to its pre-drilling condition.

1.6 Geology and Hydrogeology

Based on review of PMS 2019 soil boring logs, the site-specific geology generally consists of
sand, clayey sand, or sandy clay to between 1.0 and 4.5 feet bgs, underlain by clay to a depth of
at least 10.0 feet bgs, the maximum depth explored. Groundwater was not encountered by PM
to a depth of 10.0 feet bgs, the maximum depth explored.

The geology encountered by PM in 2019 is generally consistent with previous site investigations
completed in 2010 and 2013, which encountered sand and clay to approximately 3.0 feet bgs,
underlain by clay to a depth of at least 20.0 feet bgs, the maximum depth explored. Groundwater
was not encountered to 20.0 feet in 2010; however, limited, perched, and discontinuous
groundwater was reportedly encountered in shallow intervals in 2013.

The 2019 soil boring logs are included in Appendix C, which consist of site specific geology, PID
readings, soil gas sampling point diagrams, and sample intervals.

2.0 Location of Contaminated Media on the Subject Property

PM compared the soil groundwater analytical results from site investigation activities with the
MDEQ Part 201 Generic Cleanup Criteria dated December 30, 2013 entitled ?Cleanup Criteria
Requirements for Response Activity", in accordance with Section 20120a(1) using the Residential
and Nonresidential cleanup 

PM compared soil gas analytical results to the USEPA Vapor Intrusion Screening Levels 
calculated using the November 2018 VISL calculator.

The 2019 soil and soil gas analytical results are presented in Tables 1 and 2 and on Figures 38
and 4. The complete January 2019 laboratory analytical reports are included in Appendix D.

2.1 Summary of January 2019 Analytical Results
2.1.1 Soil Analytical Results
The 2019 soil analytical results are summarized in Table 1 and on Figure BB.

A concentration of carbon tetrachloride was identified in the soil sample collected from 88-18
(30?40 feet bgs) above the Part 201 Residential and Nonresidential DWP cleanup criteria.
Concentrations of 1,2?dichloropropane were identified in the soil samples collected from SB-19

Other Incentives

The Developer is seeking additional incentives, which will include local and/or state approval of a
Commercial Facilities Exemption PA 255 Tax Abatement and Neighborhood Enterprise Zone PA 147 Tax
Abatement.

Attached for the CAC's review and approval were three (3) resolutions: 1.) a resolution supporting the Plan
in the event the Committee does not deem it necessary to conduct a CAC public hearing and 2.) a resolution
authorizing a public hearing in the project area and 3.) a resolution authorizing a public hearing in the project
area and to appoint up to two special CAC members. The public hearing may be held jointly with any public
hearing conducted by the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority.

Mr. Farooqi provided information on his background as a developer and his prior project in the City of
Detroit, and more information on this project including that it was an RFP through the City of Detroit, the
Developer worked with the Planning and Development Department on the design of the development since
the Property is in a prominent location, the Property has existing structures and space is limited to include
green features but there will be greenery on the rooftop of the development, the project will have stormwater
infrastructure, there will be high-efficiency appliances and mechanical systems, the limited residential
properties around the Property, the cooperation between the Developer and the Riverfront Business
Association and the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy, and the Shakespeare in Detroit theater to be included
in the development.

Mr. Razo asked how much of the existing structures will be demolished for the development. Mr. Farooqi
stated that two of the three structures will be demolished and the third will be partially deconstructed, that
none of the existing structures are designated as historic or in a historic district, and that some work will
need to be done to stabilize the structures in preparation for the winter months.

Mr. Cheeks asked how the Developer will try to mitigate the challenges of going over budget or the
construction period taking longer than expected. Mr. Farooqi stated that there were unique challenges with
his last project, St. Charles, and that O?Brien Construction has provided an estimate for a construction
period of 20 months and he is confident that the project will be completed in that timeframe and that he has
a good idea on the costs for the project.

Mr. Razo asked what the main reason was for the cost overruns and extension in construction period for
the St. Charles project. Mr. Farooqi stated that St. Charles was a historic renovation and it was important
to preserve the historic look and feel of the building and that during the course of construction there was a
change in the contractor.

Mr. Rawls asked for the estimated costs of the condominium units for the project. Mr. Farooqi stated that
the estimated cost for the condominium units is $480 per square foot.

Mr. Rawls asked how many seats will be in the proposed theater. Mr. Farooqi stated that there will be
approximately 120 seats in the theater.

Mr. Rawls called for a motion recommending approval of the Brownfield Plan for Stone Soap.

Mr. Cheeks motioned to recommend approval of the Brownfield Plan for Stone Soap without a CAC
public hearing and without appointing special members. Mr. Blocker seconded the motion. DBRA-
CAC Resolution Code 19-09?218?01, recommending approval of the Brownfield Plan for Stone
Soap was unanimously approved.

PDH Development Group LLC, the project developer (?Developer?), is acquiring the
Property from the City of Detroit. The project is a mixed-use residential and commercial
development. It is currently anticipated construction will begin in the Spring of 2020 and
eligible activities will be completed within 36 months. The project description provided
herein is a summary of the proposed development at the Property at the time of the adoption
of the Plan. The actual development may vary from the project description provided
herein, without necessitating an amendment to this Plan, so long as such variations arise as
a result of changes in market and/or financing conditions affecting the project and/or are
related to the addition or immaterial removal of amenities to the project. Any material
changes, as determined by DBRA in its sole discretion, to the project description are
subject to the approval of the DBRA staff and shall be consistent with the overall nature of
the proposed development, its proposed public purpose, and the purposes of Act 381.

Attachment provides a description of the project to be completed at the Property (the
??Project?) and Attachment includes letters of support for the Project.

B. Basis of Eligibilitv (Section 13 and Section 2 

The Property is considered ?eligible property? as defined by Act 381, Section 2, because
it was previously utilized for a commercial purpose and/or public purpose; it is
located within the City of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and
it is a facility under Part 201 due to the presence of arsenic, benzo(a)pyrene,
and in soil and fill.

C. Summarv of Eligible Activities and Description of Costs (Section 13 

The ?eligible activities? that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
?eligible activities? as defined by Section 2 of Act 381 because they include baseline
environmental assessment activities, department specific activities, additional response

activities, site preparation, infrastructure improvements, development and preparation of a
brown?eld plan and work plan, brown?eld plan implementation and interest.

A summary of the eligible activities and the estimated cost of each eligible activity intended
to be paid for with Tax Increment Revenues from the Property are shown in the table
attached hereto as Attachment E. The eligible activities include response activities to
properly manage contaminated soils on the Property; geotechnical evaluations; removal
and replacement of ?ll material; construction of an enclosed parking level with
approximately 149 parking spaces; storm water management features; and improvements
in the rights of way of adjacent streets. The eligible activities described in Attachment 
are not exhaustive. Subject to the approval of DBRA staff in writing, additional eligible
activities may be carried out at the PrOperty, without requiring an amendment to this Plan,
so long as such eligible activities are permitted by Act 381 and the performance of such
eligible activities does not exceed the total costs stated in Attachment E.

Eligible activities began in 2018 with environmental response activities including Phase I
and later Phase II and baseline environmental assessment activities; however, in no event
shall the commencement of eligible activities begin later than eighteen months after the
date the governing body approves this Plan, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by
DBRA. All eligible activities will be completed within four (4) years of the date the
governing body approves this Plan; provided however, any long-term monitoring or
operation and maintenance activities or obligations that may be required will be performed
in compliance with the terms of this Plan and any documents prepared pursuant to this
Plan.

The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities and interest
thereon as described below. Activities may commence prior to the adoption of this Plan
and be reimbursable to the full extent permitted by Act 381. Tax increment revenue
generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse the cost of
the eligible activities completed on the Property pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement
Agreement to be executed by the DBRA and the Developer after approval of this Plan (the
?Reimbursement Agreement?), to the extent permitted by Act 381. In the event this Plan
contemplates the capture of tax increment revenue derived from ?taxes levied for school
operating purposes? (as de?ned by Section 2(uu) of Act 381 and hereinafter referred to as
?School Taxes?), the Developer acknowledges and agrees that obligation to
reimburse the Developer for the cost of eligible activities with tax increment revenue
derived from Local Taxes, or Speci?c Taxes that are considered Local Taxes, (as these
capitalized terms are de?ned by Act 381) is contingent upon: the Developer receiving
at least the initial applicable work plan approvals by the Michigan Strategic Fund (MSF)
and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), as may
be required pursuant to Act 381, within 180 days after the date this Plan is approved by the
governing body, or such other date as the DBRA may agree to in writing; or (ii) the
Developer providing the DBRA with evidence, satisfactory to DBRA, that the Developer
has the ?nancial means to complete the project without the capture of, and subsequent
reimbursement with, the contemplated School Taxes.

321433012

Exhibit A
Midtown West
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

The costs listed in Attachment are estimated costs and may increase or decrease
depending upon the nature and extent of environmental contamination and other unknown
conditions encountered on the Property. The actual cost of those eligible activities
encompassed by this Plan that will qualify for reimbursement from tax increment revenues
of the DBRA from the Property shall be governed by the terms of the Reimbursement
Agreement. No costs of eligible activities will be quali?ed for reimbursement except to
the extent permitted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Reimbursement
Agreement and Act 381. The Reimbursement Agreement and this Plan will dictate the
total cost of eligible activities subject to payment or reimbursement, provided that the total
cost of eligible activities subject to payment or reimbursement under the Reimbursement
Agreement shall not exceed the estimated costs set forth in Attachment B. As long as the
total costs are not exceeded, line item costs of eligible activities may be adjusted after the
date this Plan is approved by the governing body, to the extent the adjustments do not
violate the terms of the approved EGLE or MSF work plan.

Exhibit A
Midtown West
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

During the CBO process, PDH Development Group negotiated deeper affordability with the
NAC. The CBO process called for 10% of units to be affordable below 80% of AMI with a
variety of income levels down to 40% of AMI.

PDH intends to ?nance the development in conjunction with MSHDA. As such PDH will be
providing deeper affordability than was committed to during the CBO process. PDH will
provide 20% of the units affordable below 50% of AMI with levels down to 40% of AMI as
agreed to with the NAC. Affordable units will be mixed throughout the building and will be
provided in each of the unit types (Studio 3BR).

The building will also include amenities for the residents, including an over 35,000 second floor
landscaped roof deck, and lounges.

The Storm water management system will comply with the Detroit City Council Ordinance and
building code. The system is anticipated to feature sub slab piping capable of detaining a 10
year storm which will be slowly released using a controlled ?ow to the city sewer.

Total investment on Parcel 1 is expected to be over $55,000,000. An estimated seventy-?ve
(75) construction jobs are expected for the Property. Approximately three (3) permanent jobs
are expected to be created at the Property plus an unknown number of commercial/retail jobs
will be created by commercial/retail tenants. Approximately 175 households are expected to
live at the Property.

The Developer has applied or will apply for a property tax abatement under the Neighborhood
Enterprise Zone Act and may apply for a property tax abatement with respect to the commercial
component of the Property under the Commercial Redevelopment Act (PA 255 of 1978). If
approved, the abatements will reduce the property tax obligations of the Property for the periods
applicable under the applicable abatement certi?cates, thereby reducing the amount of tax
increment revenues available pursuant to this Plan.

RE: Midtown West Parcel 1 Development - Letter of Support

Ms. Pavelko

On behalf of Midtown Detroit, Inc. (MDI), I would like to express our support for the proposed mixed-use
development of the Midtown West Development.

The Midtown West Parcel 1 Development will develop a vacant parcel into a 175-unit residential rental
property with ground floor retail. This project will incorporate a mix of affordability for households
earning less than 80% of the area median income. The addition of the new units will provide needed
housing options to an area facing 98% occupancy, and the newly created ground ?oor neighborhood retail
will help anchor the western end of MIdtown?s Selden corridor while providing continued economic
opportunities for Detroiters.

MDI understands that the developer has established a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone and is pursuing
Brown?eld Tax Increment Reimbursements as part of the overall financing structure for the project. The
Brown?eld TIF will provide a valuable financial bene?t to support the financial viability of the project,
which will be a much needed bene?t to the surrounding neighborhood.

Committee took the following action:

On a motion by Mr. Blocker, seconded by Mr. Razo, DBRA-CAC Resolution Code 19-09-02-144,
approving the August 28, 2019 CAC minutes, as presented, was unanimously approved.

Brownfield Plan for Midtown West
Mr. Vosburg introduced the Brownfield Plan for Midtown West to the CAC members present.

Proiect Introduction
PDH Development Group LLC is the project developer (the "Developer") for the Plan which entails the

construction of a five-story mixed?use development on the Property. The redevelopment is planned to
consist of approximately 7,000 square feet of first floor commercial-use with an estimated 175 residential
units on the floors above including approximately 8 studios, 125 one-bedroom units, 38 two-bedroom units,
and 4 three-bedroom units, and an estimated 149 enclosed parking spaces on the ground level. As a result
of the Community Benefits Ordinance (CBO) process, approximately 10% of the residential units will be
available below 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI) with a variety of income levels down to 40% of AMI.
The building will also include amenities for the residents, including an over 35,000 square foot landscaped
roof deck on the second floor, gym, and lounges. The Property is presently vacant with no structures.

The total investment is estimated to be $55 million. The Developer is requesting $4,251,029.00 in TIF
reimbursement.

There will be 208-265 temporary construction jobs and 4 FTE jobs. The 4 FTEjobs will be related to property
management.

neighborhood of Detroit and is bounded by Selden Street to the north, the proposed Fourth Avenue to the
east, the proposed Tuscola Avenue to the south, and the John C. Lodge Service Drive to the west.

Basis of Eligibility

The Property is considered ?eligible property? as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because it was previously
utilized for a commercial purpose and/or public purpose; it is located within the City of Detroit, a qualified
local governmental unit under Act 381; and it is a facility under Part 201 due to the presence of arsenic,
benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)flouranthene and in soil and fill.

Eliqible Activities and Proiected Costs

The "eligible activities" that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered ?eligible activities"
as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include baseline environmental assessment activities,
department specific activities, additional response activities, site preparation, infrastructure improvements,
development and preparation of a brownfield plan and work plan, brownfield plan implementation. The
eligible activities and budgeted costs are intended as part of the development of the Property and will be

financed solely by the Developer. The Authority is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and
will incur no debt. The eligible activities are estimated to commence within 18 months of approval of the
Plan and be completed within 4 years.

Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture

The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment revenue generated
by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse the cost of the eligible activities
completed on the Property after approval of this Plan pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement
with the DBRA.

Abatement.

Attached for the CAC's review and approval were three (3) resolutions: 1.) a resolution supporting the Plan
in the event the Committee does not deem it necessary to conduct a CAC public hearing and 2.) a resolution
authorizing a public hearing in the project area and 3.) a resolution authorizing a public hearing in the project
area and to appoint up to two special CAC members. The public hearing may be held jointly with any public
hearing conducted by the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority.

Mr. Procida provided more information on the project including the size and location of the Property, the
plans to extend 4th Street and Tuscola Street and to construction of a one-acre park, the phases for the
project including the planned condominium units which are not part of the Plan, the architect for the project,
Daniel Libeskind, and his experience including his past teaching at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, there
will be three residential entrances for the development and the parking will be located on the first floor of
the development with an outdoor courtyard above on the second floor of the project, and that there will be
20% (or 37) of the residential units available at 40% and 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI).

Mr. Razo asked for clarification on the location of the parking. Mr. Procida stated that the parking is located
in the interior of the development on the first floor.

Mr. Cheeks asked how much the condominium units will be available for. Mr. Procida stated that the one-
bedroom condominium units will be available for approximately $400,000.

Mr. Procida stated that the City of Detroit will begin construction on the roads in September 2019 and will
finish the road construction in the spring and the Developer will start construction on the condominium units
in the fall of 2019 and will begin construction on the rental residential units in the spring of 2020.

Mr. Blocker asked if there is a requirement for selling a certain number of the condominium units. Mr.
Procida stated that there will not be any condominium units available for presale and that the sale of the
condominium units will be available after construction has been started.

Ms. Sagovac asked if there have been any tenants identified for the retail space in the development. Mr.
Procida stated that there have not been any tenants identi?ed for the retail space in the development, but
the retail spaces will likely be neighborhood-based such as a convenience store or food service and the
developer may work with the Motor City Match program to identify potential tenants.

Mr. Razo asked why the rooftop space in the development will not have any amenities. Mr. Procida stated
that the interior courtyard is a significant size and will provide enough outdoor space for the residents.

Mr. Rawls asked if there will be any stormwater management features in the development. Mr. Procida
stated that there will be underground retention for stormwater as part of the development.

Mr. Rawls asked what material the facade will be made of. Mr. Procida stated that the facade will most
likely be made of EIFS which provides exterior walls with an insulated, water-resistant, finished surface.

Mr. Rawls called for a motion recommending approval of the Brownfield Plan for Midtown West.

Mr. Razo motioned to recommend approval of the Brownfield Plan for Midtown West without a CAC
public hearing and without appointing special members. Ms. Sagovac seconded the motion. DBRA-
CAC Resolution Code 19-09-276-01, recommending approval of the Brownfield Plan for Midtown
West was unanimously approved.

the City of Detroit Brown?eld RedeveIOpment Authority (the pursuant to
Michigan Public Act 381 of 1996, as amended (?Act 381?).

The primary purpose of this Brown?eld Plan (?Plan?) is to promote the redevelopment of
and private investment in certain ?brown?eld? properties within the City. Inclusion of
property within this Plan will facilitate ?nancing of environmental response and other
eligible activities at eligible properties, and will also provide tax incentives to eligible
taxpayers willing to invest in revitalization of eligible sites, commonly referred to as
?brown?elds.? By facilitating redevelopment of brown?eld properties, this Plan is
intended to promote economic growth for the bene?t of the residents of the City and all
taxing units located within and bene?ted by the DBRA.

This Plan is intended to apply to the eligible property identi?ed in this Plan and, if tax
increment revenues are proposed to be captured from that eligible property, to identify and
authorize the eligible activities to be funded by such tax increment revenues.

This Plan is intended to be a living document, which may be modi?ed or amended in
accordance with the requirements of Act 381, as necessary to achieve the purposes of Act
381. A subsequent change to the identi?cation or designation of the developer after the
approval of this Plan by the governing body shall not necessitate an amendment to the Plan,
affect the application of this Plan to the eligible property or impair the rights available to
DBRA under this Plan. The applicable sections of Act 381 are noted throughout the Plan
for reference purposes.

This Plan describes the project to be completed (see Attachment C) and contains all of the
information required by Section 13(2) of Act 381.

?eligible activities? as de?ned by Section 2 of Act 381, because they include
Predevelopment Activities, Due Care Compliance Activities, Response Activities,
Demolition, Lead and Asbestos Abatement, Site Preparation, Public and Private
Infrastructure Improvements, and the preparation and implementation of a brown?eld plan
and Act 381 work plan.

A summary of the eligible activities and the estimated cost of each eligible activity intended
to be paid for with Tax Increment Revenues from the Property are shown in the table
attached hereto as Attachment E. The eligible activities described in Attachment are not
exhaustive. Subject to the approval of DBRA staff in writing, additional eligible activities
may be carried out at the Property, without requiring an amendment to this Plan, so long
as such eligible activities are permitted by Act 381 and the performance of such eligible
activities does not exceed the total costs stated in Attachment E.

Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the DBRA, all eligible activities shall commence
within eighteen (18) months after the date the governing body approves this Plan and be
completed within three (3) years after approval of the Michigan Strategic Fund (MSF) work

that term is de?ned below). Long-term monitoring or operation and maintenance activities
or obligations that may be required will be performed in compliance with the terms of this
Plan and any documents prepared pursuant to this Plan.

The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment
revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse
the cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property pursuant to the terms of a
Reimbursement Agreement to be executed by the DBRA and the Developer after approval
of this Plan (the ?Reimbursement Agreement?), to the extent permitted by Act 381. In the
event this Plan contemplates the capture of tax increment revenue derived from ?taxes
levied for school operating purposes? (as de?ned by Section 2(uu) of Act 381 and
hereinafter referred to as ?School Taxes?), the Developer acknowledges and agrees that
obligation to reimburse the Developer for the cost of eligible activities with tax
increment revenue derived from Local Taxes, 0r Speci?c Taxes that are considered Local
Taxes, (as these capitalized terms are de?ned by Act 381) is contingent upon: the

EGLE, as may be required pursuant to Act 381, or (ii) the Developer providing the DBRA
with evidence, satisfactory to DBRA, that the Developer has the ?nancial means to
complete the project without the capture of, and subsequent reimbursement with, the
contemplated School Taxes.

The costs listed in Attachment are estimated costs and may increase or decrease
depending on the nature and extent of environmental contamination and other unknown
conditions encountered on the Property. The actual cost of those eligible activities
encompassed by this Plan that will qualify for reimbursement from tax increment revenues
of the DBRA from the Property shall be governed by the terms of the Reimbursement

the extent permitted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Reimbursement
Agreement and Act 381. The Reimbursement Agreement and this Plan will dictate the
total cost of eligible activities subject to payment or reimbursement, provided that the total
cost of eligible activities subject to payment or reimbursement under the Reimbursement
Agreement shall not exceed the estimated costs set forth in Attachment E. As long as the
total costs are not exceeded, line item costs of eligible activities may be adjusted after the
date this Plan is approved by the governing body, to the extent the adjustments do not

resolution approving this Plan.

E. Plan of Financing (Section Maximum AIILUIH of Indebtedness {Section
13?2Hen

The eligible activities are to be ?nanced solely by the Developer. The DBRA will
reimburse the Developer for the cost of approved eligible activities, but only from tax
increment revenues generated from the Property. No advances have been or shall be made
by the City or the DBRA for the costs of eligible activities under this Plan.

All reimbursements authorized under this Plan shall be governed by the Reimbursement
Agreement. The inclusion of eligible activities and estimates of costs to be reimbursed in
this Plan are intended to authorize the DBRA to fund such reimbursements and does not
obligate the DBRA or the City to fund any reimbursement or to enter into the
Reimbursement Agreement providing for the reimbursement of any costs for which tax
increment revenues may be captured under this Plan, or which are permitted to be
reimbursed under this Plan. The amount and source of any tax increment revenues that
will be used for purposes authorized by this Plan, and the terms and conditions for such
use and upon any reimbursement of the expenses permitted by this Plan, will be provided
solely under the Reimbursement Agreement contemplated by this Plan.

Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Developer, the DBRA, and the State of Michigan, the
DBRA shall not incur any note or bonded indebtedness to ?nance the purposes of this Plan.

Interest shall be paid under this Plan as provided in the Reimbursement Agreement,
provided that to the extent that the MSF or EGLE does not approve the payment of interest
on an eligible activity with school taxes, interest shall not accrue or be paid under this Plan
with respect to the cost of such eligible activity. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the
Developer, the DBRA, and the State of Michigan, the DBRA may approve interest on the
local portion of the reimbursement to the extent that the projected internal rate of return to
the Developer does not exceed twenty as more speci?cally stated in the
Reimbursement Agreement.

The Developer has applied or will apply for a property tax abatement under the Obsolete
Property Rehabilitation Act, PA 146 of 2000, as amended, (OPRA). If approved, the
approved OPRA will reduce the property tax obligations of the Property for the period
applicable under the abatement certi?cate, thereby reducing the amount of tax increment
revenues available pursuant to this Plan.

Exhibit A
Mosaic Eastern Market
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

Reimbursements under the Reimbursement Agreement shall not exceed the cost of Eligible
Activities permitted under this Plan.

F. Duration of Plan (Section

revenues for the eligible property is estimated in accordance with the TIF table described
in Exhibit F. In no event, however, shall this Plan extend beyond the maximum term
allowed by Section 13(2)(f) of Act 381 for the duration of this Plan.

Furthermore, this Plan, or any subsequent amendment thereto, may be abolished or
terminated in accordance with Section 14(8) of Act 381 in the event of any of the following:

amendment thereto) shall not be abolished or terminated until the principal and interest on
bonds, if any, issued under Section 17 of Act 381 and all other obligations to which the tax
increment revenues are pledged have been paid or funds suf?cient to make the payment
have been identi?ed or segregated.

G. Effective Date of Inclusion in Brown?eld Plan
The Property will become a part of this Plan on the date this Plan is approved by the
governing body.

H. of Individuals on Eligible Property [Section

Project Description

Project Description Mosaic Eastern Market Redevelopment

Project Developer: Riopelle Market Development LP

Project Location: 3500 Riopelle Street, Detroit

Capital Investment: ~$24,128,542

Eligible Activities: ~$4,472,620 (Department Specific Activities,

Demolition, Asbestos Hazardous Material
Abatement, Site Preparation, Infrastructure
Improvements, 15% Contingency on
aforementioned activity costs and Preparation of a
Brown?eld Plan and Act 381 Work Plan)

Type of Eligible Property: ?Facility? under Part 201

Project Overview: The Mosaic Eastern Market project is an adaptive commercial
mixed?use collective that will contain Eastern Market Corporation?s
accelerator/commissary facility for food entrepreneurs, along with an eclectic mix of food
and creative related business tenants. Riopelle Market Development LP was awarded the
opportunity to develop the Property through a City of Detroit Request For Proposals
process and is working hand-in-hand with the City of Detroit and the Eastern Market
Corporation to redevelop the property in a manner that is cohesive with the existing
culture of the Eastern Market District.

The existing a 105,544-square foot building on the site will be completely renovated. The
2,000-square foot building will be demolished and the vacant area surrounding it will be
converted to a parking lot, which will accommodate 370 on-site parking stalls. The
renovated building will be known as the Mosaic Eastern Market which will feature an
estimated 66,910 square feet of flexible commercial/office space, 12,235 square feet of
food accelerator space, 16,680 square feet of restaurant space, and 16,977 square feet of
common area and special event space. Mosaic Eastern Market will also be an example of
green energy generation with the installation of an approximately 3,355-pane1, 1,107-
kilowatt solar array on the roof. Green, low-impact-design urban stormwater management
systems (such as pervious pavers or bioswales) are also being contemplated for the
project.

The redevelopment will revive this long-vacant property and support the culture of
Eastern Market. The completed project is also expected to create an estimated 450 new
full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs.

The Project also anticipates local and state approval of an Obsolete Property
Rehabilitation Act (OPRA) Tax Abatement and an Act 381 Work Plan.

Re: Mosaic Project
Dear Mr. Vosburg,

Eastern Market Partnership strongly supports the Mosaic Project in the Eastern Market District.
located at Project. Located at 3500 Riopelle this long dormant abandoned ?facility can
become another gem in the cluster of Eastern Market Development. The brownfield
redevelopment tax increment financing incentive will assist with the redevelopment of the site
and building, which in turn will help continue the revitalization of the Eastern Market District.

This project will enable another 105,000 square feet of commercial development in an area with
high demand for space. Included in the project is a 15,000 square foot food accelerator which
will enable 8-10 emerging food companies to scale up their operations.

Once again please know that the Eastern Market Partnership stands in full support of this
project and looks forward to being part of the neighborhood rebirth.

Fae: Mosaic at Eastern Market
Dear Mr. Vosburg,

On behalf of Amore Da Roma, we support Mosaic at Eastern Market project located on Riopelle
in Eastern Market. The Brownfield Redevelopment tax increment financing incentive will assist
with the redevelopment of the site and building, which in turn, will revitalize Eastern Market.

The site of the above referenced project is located next-.door to us and has been empty for
decades. it's been a danger to our employees as well as our customers and an eyesore with
graffiti and gang signs. It is our beliefthat this project will stimulate additional housing in the
area along with new businesses and commercial activity.

Amore Da Roma is in full support of this project and looks forward to being part of the
neighborhood rebirth.

Sincerely,
AMORE Da ROMA

1. The plan for hiring Detroiters

The project will use Executive Order requirements as the basis for all trade contacts in terms of local
participation. Riopelle Market Development, LP will work with local workforce development programs
and will participate in Council President Jones? Skilled Trades Taskforce to optimize the use of Detroit-
based subcontractors. The general contractor selected for the job is LS Brinker, a Detroit-based
contractor with headquarters on Michigan Avenue in Detroit.

2. Detailed description of the jobs available

The proposed redevelopment includes 66,910 square feet of flexible commercial/office space, 12,235
square feet of food accelerator space, 16,680 square feet of restaurant space, 16,977 square feet of
common area and special event space. The types ofjobs that will be available will largely depend on the
tenants, but may include: office personnel, restaurant servers, hosts and hostesses, chefs, bartenders,
restaurant management positions, custodial staff, food processing specialists, distillery and/or brewery
operators and production line staff. Average wages for new hires may range from SlO/hour to SIS/hour
or for salary positions, from $35,000 to $45,000.

3. New Detroit residents

The project will create new commercial and retail attractions in the Eastern Market District drawing
more residents to the neighborhood as well as supporting other recent redevelopments in Eastern
Market. However, the project itself will not provide any additional residential space.

4. Community outreach for hiring

Riopelle Market Development LP will work with local workforce development programs and local
consulting groups to increase opportunities for Detroit residents in order to meet Executive Order 2014-
5 and 2016-1 requirements.

6. Construction schedule

The project is anticipating a spring 2020 start date, pending approvals of the various economic
incentives by the administering agencies.

Proiects
Brownfield Plan for Mosaic Eastern Market

Mr. Vosburg introduced the Brownfield Plan for Mosaic Eastern Market to the CAC members present.

Proiect Introduction
Riopelle Market Development LP is the project developer (the "Developer") for the Plan which entails the

renovation of the existing 105,544 square foot building into an adaptive mixed-use collective that will contain
Eastern Market Corporation?s accelerator/commissary facility for food entrepreneurs, along with an eclectic
mix of food and creative related business tenants. The existing 2,000 square foot building will be
demolished and the vacant area surrounding it will be converted into a parking lot, which will accommodate
approximately 370 onsite parking spaces. The renovated building will be known as Mosaic Eastern Market
and will feature approximately 66,910 square feet of flexible commercial/office space, approximately 12,235
square feet of food accelerator space, approximately 16,680 square feet of restaurant space, and
approximately 16,977 square feet of green energy generation with the installation of an estimated 3,355
panel solar array on the roof.

The total investment is estimated to be $22 million. The Developer is requesting $6,059,937.00 in 
reimbursement.

There will be 260 temporary construction jobs and 450 FTE jobs. The 450 FTE job will largely depend on
the tenants, but may include: office personnel, restaurant staff, custodial staff, food processing specialists,
distillery and/or brewery operators and production line staff.

that due to the amount of impervious surface on the Property there will be retention and detention systems,
including cisterns with pipes that will collect water from the roof of the building and release water back into
the City water system and there will also be a biofiltration system which will enable some water collected
to be used for the operation of the building.
