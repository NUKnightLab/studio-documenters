$2 BILLION DOLLAR NATIONAL ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN
TO EMPLOY OVER 1 MILLION LOW-INCOME YOUTHS
YEAR ROUND AND IN THE SUMMER
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII, Section 6(a)
of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and perform any function
pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. economy is experiencing the worst slow down in the past 30 years and is facing a
severe recession; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. economy has shed more than 1 million payroll jobs in the 10 months of 2008 and
now has on average 2.8 million more unemployed persons than one year ago; and
WHEREAS, at 33% this was the worst summer teen (16 to 19) employment rate in post-World War II
history, and this national employment crisis is crippling the teen job market, with Black and Latino youth
the hardest hit groups; and
WHEREAS, in the summer of 2008, more than 2 million low-income youth were out of work and on the
streets; and
WHEREAS, in October 2008, 68% of teens were jobless and there were 500,000 fewer teens employed
than October 2007 and the nation’s teen employment rate fell by three percentage points over the past 12
months; and
WHEREAS, youth, particularly Black and Hispanic youth, are living in a “Depression” with very high
jobless rates , 80% of Black youth and 75% of Hispanic youth across the country; and
WHEREAS, President Bush, President-elect Obama and Congress are now proposing a very large
stimulus package to restart the U.S. economy; and
WHEREAS, from 1964 until 2000, there was a separate summer youth employment program for over
750,000 low-income youth and these jobs were often the first jobs for low-income youth, giving them a
chance to work and gain experience to later find a job on their own; and
WHEREAS, the summer youth employment program was eliminated when the youth employment and
training program was revamped in 2000; and
WHEREAS, teen employment has a variety of long-term benefits for youth as well as the short-term
improvement in their earnings and income, and the more teens work when they are 16 and 17 the more
likely they are to work when they are 18 and 19 and so forth; and
WHEREAS, the most beneficial youth employment programs are those programs that focus on
combining education and productive work within the youth’s neighborhood. Teens would earn money
while they are producing meaningful work, and they will spend this money immediately providing a
direct economic stimulus to the U.S. economy.
