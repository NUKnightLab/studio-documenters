RE:

Monthly Update

Board Members,
Spring has definitely sprung and we continue to move METRO forward and keep Summit County
moving. The team is in the middle of some exciting projects, such as a mobile fare option we will
test this summer and the implementation of and training for our new planning and scheduling
software package. We are also bringing you the beginnings of three projects from our 2019
Capital Budget which include the renovation of the north bus storage barn, demolition of the
former Akron Auto Wrecking site, and reconstruction of the Independence Turnaround, which will
provide a safer and more aesthetic waiting area for the hundreds of passengers who use the
numerous routes that service this facility on a daily basis. We will be recognizing four of our team
members for various accomplishments and hearing from a couple of our team members who
attended the APTA Mobility Conference in Louisville, KY last week. It has been a pleasure to
begin to meet with each of you individually and receive your insight on the service you provide to
us as a board member and your ideas for the future of METRO RTA. I look forward to meeting
with more of you as we continue to schedule these meetings. I appreciate each of you taking
time out of your busy schedules to do this.
As a side note, our METRO softball team is now 3-1 and playing well as a team on the ballfield
also. There are wins happening all over the place for this group as we continue to put our best
foot forward in everything we do!

Yours in accessible transportation,

Dawn Distler

RECOGNITION
None
APPROVAL OF MINUTES
Mr. DeJournett asked for a motion to approve the Minutes of the March 26, 2019 meeting.
Ms. Greene made a motion for approval, seconded by Ms. Licata. The minutes were
unanimously approved by the Board.
FINANCE & AUDIT COMMITTEE
Mr. Fernandez reported that the Finance Committee met. Revenues are down somewhat, but
so are expenses. Triennial review has been closed out and there are no more deficiencies.
The 2018 audit is going well. No resolutions were presented.
PLANNING / MARKETING / RAIL COMMITTEE
The Planning / Marketing / Rail Committee met. Updates were given by Ms. Shea and Ms.
Becker. The committee discussed a 5-10 year Strategic Plan, Driving METRO Forward with
a revised/phased approach, and a Mobile Ticketing pilot program. Marketing reported on the
rebranding of departments at METRO that will be happening, and also the addition of
signage. No actions were requested.

6

 THE APD GROUP
Mr. Hunter reported that the APD Group (Asset Protection and Development) met. They
discussed some notes from OPTA, best practices, a shadow program for new hires, Risk Pool
statistics, HR Days in March, a redo of Fair Labor Standards exempt/non-exempt status, and
a thorough report was made to the committee from Mr. Wyatt about accident reporting and
tracking.
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND SERVICE PERFORMANCE COMMITTEE
The Committee met. For Paratransit, Ms. Miller reported that an annual Title 3 audit by
Direction Home resulted in no deficiencies and no findings. For Maintenance, Mr.
Hampshire reported that an impressive 8,500 miles between road calls had been reached
during the past month, and was the first time in 3 years that the number was well above 8,000
miles. Operations reported that unscheduled overtime was down 60%, and was finally on a
downward trend. Ms. McCall explained that with the full budgeted number of operators
having been hired, there were enough people to do the work, and therefore the need for
overtime was reduced.
GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE
Mr. Spring reported that the Governance Committee did meet. The Board Bylaws were
reviewed and revised and will be presented next month. One recommendation is that board
meetings be held every other month, with committee meetings also alternating, so that there
would be 6 of each in a given year. The goal of the revisions was for the bylaws to reflect
current committees and practices. It was also suggested that there be an attendance policy for
board members. A slate of officers was nominated, with the President continuing to be Mr.
DeJournett, and the Vice President continuing to be Mr. Fernandez. The election having not
taken place in March, it was recommended by the committee that a vote occur that day. Mr.
Spring made a motion that Mr. DeJournett continue as Board President, and that Mr.
Fernandez continue as Board Vice President, and he opened the floor for any other
nominations. There being no other nominations, Ms. Greene moved that the nominations be
closed, and that motion was seconded by Mr. Kremer. The Board voted unanimously in
favor to continue the current Board President and Vice President.
OFFICERS’ REPORT
President:
Mr. DeJournett thanked the staff for hosting the Minority Health Fair, noting that it was a
successful event. He received positive comments both from vendors and from attendees.
The response was so good, in fact, that there was discussion of having the event held every
year at the RKP Transit Center. The Board was reminded of the availability of the
conferences for them to attend, and that those plans need to be made promptly.
Executive Director:
Ms. Distler was pleased to see the restructuring of the Board Committees and the improved
communication that has resulted between the Leadership Team and Board members. She
also noted that the state of Ohio passed its budget, which includes funding for public
transportation for the next couple of years. METRO’s involvement with state legislators
increased and we were better represented. Some were brought here to Akron, while others
received a visit in Columbus. Ms. Distler noted that this is a completely non-partisan issue,
7

 and something that is not political, but is for the greater good of the community. Ultimately,
the desire is for there to be a dedicated funding source for public transit in Ohio. Ms. Distler
indicated that she has been able to explain that METRO does not have an overflow of
financial resources to utilize, and that the funds that do exist are already allocated to various
needs. She referenced our need to work with our committees to establish KPI’s, to make sure
that resources are being used in the best possible way. We are seeking out grants and
relationships that will bring funding into METRO so that we can increase and grow. If we do
not grow, we will not have a successful transit system. And if we don’t have a successful
transit system, we don’t have a successful city.
Ms. Distler reported that another Official-ly On Board event took place in Barberton with
Mayor Judge. They looked over how the new influx of business coming to Rolling Acres can
be tied in with our transit offerings. Mayor Judge was supportive of the efforts of METRO
and excited for what the future holds for Barberton.
OTHER BUSINESS
None
EXECUTIVE SESSION:
None
ADJOURNMENT
There being no other business to come before the Board, Mr. Spring made a motion to
adjourn, seconded by Mr. Derrig. The motion to adjourn was unanimously approved, and the
meeting adjourned at 9:33 a.m.
CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE
Pursuant to Section III, Article 3.2 of the Rules & Regulations of the METRO Regional
Transit Authority, METRO has complied with the Notice and Notification to the public and
news media.

 APRIL 2019 OPERATIONS REPORT
The training hours for the month of April totaled 2,288. The training consisted of New Hire Training, Refresher Training,
Line-Service training, Specialty Training, and mandatory training per the Preventable Accident Policy.
SAFETY IS METRO’s No. 1 priority and the responsibility of all employees, especially when operating a METRO vehicle
and/or your personal vehicle. In an effort to raise safety awareness, a process has been established to ensure all
employees are adhering to posted speed limits, traffic signals, and traffic signs while on the road and/or on METRO
properties, including employee parking lots.
“Observations from the Road” is a courtesy form that will be issued to employees when a safety violation is documented.
These forms will also be used to recognize a good deed – whether you were seen assisting a passenger or holding the
door for a fellow employee. METRO’s Manager of Safety, Quentin Wyatt, road supervisors, and the Leadership Team will
have access to distribute these forms.
METRO is committed to improving the safety of all employees, as well as reducing injuries and preventable accidents.
METRO’s safety efforts shall be ongoing and focus on continuous improvement. This initiative began on April 1, 2019.
Sunday, April 7, 2019 was the start of the Spring Sign-Up. The sign up ends June 1, 2019. There were no significant
changes to the routes or schedules.
Members from the Operations Department assisted Planning with the proof reading of the public schedules for the
upcoming Summer Sign-Up. This collaboration will hopefully eliminate possible errors on the public timetable.

APRIL 2019 CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PARATRANSIT REPORT
PARATRANSIT PASSENGERS: 23,885 passengers were transported in April. There was a slight uptick in Department of
Job and Family Services NET passengers transported during the month.
ANNULLED RUNS: We were able to operate at nearly full strength during the 22 weekdays in April with only three runs
annulled. By comparison, in April 2018 we operated with 66 runs annulled during the 21 weekdays in the month.
CARE CENTER CALL NUMBERS: 31,787 calls were handled by our group. Line-service information calls accounted for
10,796 of those calls and 20,991 calls were for paratransit reservations and cancellations.
APPLICATIONS: A total of 172 applications were processed during the month. Year-to-date over 600 applications have
been received and reviewed. Application turnaround time is generally within two days from receipt of application to
information being given to applicant. That’s an outstanding response time, putting passengers first and helping them ride
the appropriate METRO service.
COURTESY CALLS: We are trying a different approach with Courtesy Calls for our new passengers to aid us in seeing the
service from their perspective. We will be collecting data, as well as sharing information, so that we can update our
approach to keep information fresh, free flowing and relevant.
TRAINING, MOBILITY, ELIGIBILITY AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT: Thirty-six wheelchair weight and inspections and
advocacy trainings took place in April. A few from Customer Service traveled to OPTA for classes and NTI trainings. Our
group also visited senior buildings, such as Fowler II, Center Towers, Williams Tower, and Kiwanis Towers. Amongst our
group we also met with or attended the following meetings or events: City of Akron Senior Citizens Commission, Summit
County Senior Services G6 meetings, East Akron Neighborhood Development Emergency Taskforce meeting, Read To Me
Day, Akron Recreation Bureau Staff Training, State of the County Health Report, Direction Home Coordinated Intake
Workgroup, Firestone High School Schedule Reading & Trip Planning, Steering Committee for Senior Summit, DJFS Title XX
meeting, Minority Health Fair at RKPTC, Summit County Children Services Staff Training, International Institute, DJFS
NET meeting, Area Wide Council Meeting for Direction Home, DJFS Staff Training at main building and Job Center.
