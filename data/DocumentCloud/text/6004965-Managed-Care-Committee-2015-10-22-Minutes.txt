Report on CountyCare Health Plan (Attachment #1)
A. Metrics
B. Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Survey Results
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided an overview of the Report on the CountyCare
Health Plan; the Report included metrics and a deep dive discussion on the CAHPS Survey results. The
Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the information on Slide 10 regarding Medicaid cancellations, Chairman Lerner
posed a question – at what point is someone at risk of losing access to medical care due to cancellation of
coverage and will really fall through the gap?
As the Committee discussed cancellations due to
redetermination, Chairman Lerner noted that any gains that a person has made in their own health care
improvement could be lost as a result of losing this coverage.
With regard to the metric for HIV patient medications filled at the CCHHS pharmacy and the metric to shift
to 90-day prescriptions (Slide 15), Mr. Glass stated that one of the barriers that has been identified relates to
the inability to fill a 90-day prescription for medications at the CORE Center pharmacy; this was due to some
restrictions and cost control limits that prohibited the ability to get 90-day scripts in place. He has been told
that the restrictions and limits have been lifted this month, so the administration hopes to see an increase in
those metrics.

III.

Report on CountyCare Health Plan (continued)
Director Richardson-Lowry inquired whether any comparisons are run with other competitors on risk
management of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) adult membership category. Mr. Glass responded that the
data is not publicly available. The State has made a single program that covers both Family Health Plan
(FHP) and ACA adults, but they do not separately break out the data. He indicated that he can request data at
the health plan level and see if they can provide it.
In response to a question from Director Wiese regarding alcohol-related diagnoses, Mr. Glass stated that, by
far, those total the highest number of visits to emergency departments (EDs) by CountyCare members. He
noted that CountyCare’s clinical team has set a single utilization management objective to reduce ED visits;
they are in the process of building that plan. Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and
Strategy, stated that the administration has a workgroup assembled to focus on behavioral health. The
administration had set aside in the budget about $10 million over and above what would normally be spent to
start trying to address the issue. One project to address behavioral health issues that is coming to fruition is
the community triage center; this is a pilot project expected to open early next year to provide prevention and
diversion services for individuals who are at risk of arrest due to behavioral health conditions. It will operate
24 hours per day/7 days per week/365 days per year. It will have staff there who can make an evaluation of
the person and make a warm hand-off in the community where they live.
During the discussion of Slide 27, Director Wiese inquired regarding the survey responses to the question
relating to “getting needed care,” and asked whether access to care is a problem nationally. On a similar
subject, she referenced an earlier request she had made for data on the time to next appointment. Mr. Elwell
stated that he expects to have the data to respond to Director Wiese’s earlier request in time for the next
Board Meeting. Additionally, he stated that the survey question relates to the member’s perception of
getting the care needed. Chairman Lerner was not aware of any recent studies released regarding issues with
access to care for Medicaid patients; he asked staff to be on the lookout for any studies that might relate to
that subject. Mr. Glass noted that two (2) main drivers relating to that question were: 1) timeliness of care,
relating to their own doctor; and 2) specialty care. Additionally, he clarified that these survey responses are
not specifically relating to CCHHS as the provider; this survey was completed by CountyCare members and
could be referring to any part of CountyCare’s network.
During the discussion of Slides 30 and 31, Mr. Glass stated that the contract with the State requires
CountyCare to obtain National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) accreditation within two (2) years
of becoming a health plan; therefore, July 2017 is the target time period for accreditation. The process for
accreditation allows CountyCare to use its CAHPS results, as well as its Healthcare Effectiveness Data
Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures, as part of the accreditation process. Staff are in the process of
developing the job description for a position to head up the function relating to accreditation.

NCQA posts Health Insurance Plan
Rankings on 5-point scale, using
0.5 increments (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, etc.)
CAHPS survey calculates results on
a 3-point scale (1.0-3.0)
For comparison, converted
CountyCare’s 3-point scores to a 5point scale assuming equal
proportion
– E.g. Score 2.4/3 = 0.81*5 = 4.0; or

(EAC) meetings as focus group sessions to
obtain more depth of information
• Identify performance improvement
interventions and establish CAHPS targets
