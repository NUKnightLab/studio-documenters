DIRECTOR’S REPORT
Sales and Marketing Update
Northstar Vice President of Technology and Operations Jay Rivara reported the past two
years have been record years for sales, boosted by sales of instant tickets and the $1.6
billion Powerball jackpot in January 2016. There was a dip in sales during the time prizes
over $600 could not be paid. Internet sales are up because of the strong Powerball sales and
Mega Millions jackpots. Pick 3 and Pick 4 subscription sales are growing at a slow pace.
Northstar Chief Operating Officer and Vice President of Finance Michelle Tomao reported
that since March 2014, Northstar has used 360-degree advertising campaigns, which
includes TV, radio, and out-of-home marketing elements. The focus of recent campaigns
has been to re-establish the brand. The latest campaigns - Luck is Everywhere, Jumbo
Bucks, and Loteria – have been extremely successful. Two new games (Ultimate
Crossword, $25; Wheel of Fortune, $5) have been launched to boost instant ticket sales.
Specialty tickets Carolyn Adams Ticket for the Cure and Veterans Cash will relaunch in
October and November, respectively.

Finance Update
Lottery Chief Financial Officer Mark Lewis explained that, by law, the Lottery is obligated
to make transfers into the Common School Fund at a specified rate. This rate is based off
the amount of money transferred in 2009 and adjusted for inflation each year. In Fiscal
Year 2014, the Lottery transferred more than $668 million, more than $678 million in
Fiscal Year 2015, and more than $691 million in Fiscal Year 2016. The projection for
Fiscal Year 2017, after the adjustment for inflation, is $705,625,000. To date, the Lottery
has transferred more than $19 billion for kindergarten through 12th-grade public education.
The Lottery also has transferred more than $41 million to several special causes through
the sale of specialty scratch-off tickets. Lewis also explained the State Lottery Fund is a
cash account and not a part of the Illinois Fund Group. It is not invested and there is no
required daily balance. When the Lottery is aware of any large jackpots or large claims, it
does hold on to and obligate money specifically for those payouts. In Quarter 4 of Fiscal
Year 2016, $312 million in revenue was swept from retailer accounts.
Private Manager Update
Acting Director McDevitt shared that a Request for Proposal was posted in July, soliciting
bids for a new private manager. On August 18, 2016, a mandatory conference was held for
potential bidders for the new manager contract, as well as major subcontracts. The Lottery
has created a strict prohibition against the private manager also being a major supplier.
Subcontractor responses are due at the end of September. Private Manager responses are
due at the end of October. There will be a period of evaluation of the bids followed by a
period of negotiation.
