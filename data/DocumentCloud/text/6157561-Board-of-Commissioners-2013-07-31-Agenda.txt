This Request Package contains one (1) Property Index Number (PIN). The Property is located at 3415
Maple Avenue, Brookfield, Illinois 60513. The Property is improved with a single-story commercial
structure which formerly housed a bowling alley and tavern. In 2011, the Village initiated a demolition
action against the Property for numerous building code violations and safety concerns. The Property has
been vacant and unoccupied since approximately August 17, 2011. The Village seeks to acquire the
Property and hold the Property for redevelopment pending a future proposal by a commercial developer.
By allowing the Village to obtain this parcel through the Cook County No-Cash Bid Program, the Village
will benefit from the removal of a dangerous structure and the improvement of its tax base by future
commercial development of the property. If the Village is successful in acquiring the Property through the
No-Cash Bid Program, it will file for tax exempt status and will maintain the property as tax exempt until
such time as it is conveyed to a third party for development. The Village represents that there currently
exists no Third Party Request by a developer, organization, or other private party which would result in
the Village‟s conveyance of a certificate of purchase for, or perfected tax deed to, the Property to such
developer, organization, or private party.

Parcels for Forest Preserve purposes. PIN 06-17-404-025-0000, consisting of approximately 7 acres of
vacant land in unincorporated Cook County, would provide a linkage between the Poplar Creek Preserve
and the recently acquired Rolling Knolls Country Club. PIN 31-05-100-018-0000, consisting of
approximately 1.5 acres of vacant land in unincorporated Cook County, is an in-holding parcel,
surrounded by forest Preserve on three (3) sides, and would bolster, as well as provide a buffer to, the
District‟s adjacent land holdings. The District will file for tax exempt status on the Parcels as the District
intends on utilizing the properties for forest preserve purposes. There is no Third Party Request associated
with the Parcels.

This Request Package contains one (1) Property Index Number (PIN). The PIN that is the subject of this
application (Volume 188: 19-07-201-025-0000) is an unimproved triangular lot located in a
manufacturing zoning district at 6800 West 51st Street in the southeast section of the Village. The parcel
is located just south of the Glenn Yard railroad tracks. There are no structures on the property. Because of
its unique shape and location, there has been little or no interest in private development of the lot. It is the
Village's desire to obtain title to this property through the County's No Cash Bid Program for future
expansion of municipal services to serve the southeast section of the Village. The municipal services
would include the construction of a police and fire station and a water pump for the reservoir serving the
Village. In the event this application is approved it is the Village's intent to file the necessary documents
required to obtain a tax-exempt status for the property. It is the Village's intention to retain the PIN for
municipal use. Please be advised that the Village does not have any agreement to convey the perfected tax
deed for the property to any developer, organization or other private party. The Village also has not
entered into any negotiations with any developer, organization, or other entity pertaining to this property.
The Village is not acting on behalf of any third party requestor.

The total number of Property Index Numbers (PINs) requested in this package is six (6). These PINs are
adjacent to each other and were formerly occupied by a single multi-family residential building. The
building was burnt down and the property is currently vacant, except for remaining parking in the rear.
The properties are surrounded to the north and south by multi-family residential buildings grouped into
similar lot configurations. Such buildings are densely occupied and in need of revitalization. Properties to
the east are single-family residential and to the west are multi-family residential. These properties have
been identified by the Village as ones that could provide benefit to the surrounding properties through
shared parking, a play lot, community garden, or community building. It is found that a public use will
provide more benefit than an additional multi-family structure at this location. Consolidation of the
parcels and ownership of the property will also help to ensure unified redevelopment of the site. Such use
may work cooperatively with that of the Hanover Township Astor Avenue Community Center, located
several properties north on Astor Avenue. The Village will file for tax exempt status as the Village will
hold the property and maintain the status until either the Village develops the property or it is conveyed to
another party for development and operation. The Village does not have a Third Party Request for this
property.

On September 19, 1995 at its Regular Board Meeting No. 741 the Hoffman Estates Park District Board
passed its Ordinance No. 299, titled “An Ordinance Annexing Certain Territory To the Hoffman Estates
Park District,” incorporating territory in unincorporated Cook County including the above parcel having
Cook County‟s Property Index Number (PIN) 06-04-208-025-0000. Ordinance No. 299 was recorded as
Document No. 97241272 with the Cook County Recorder of Deeds on April 7, 1997. This request
package contains one (1) PIN. This property is a narrow strip of vacant land that sits on the eastern side of
the Bridlewood development and extends generally north and south between the rear of the homes facing
west and the Canadian National Railway Company‟s right-of-way and tracks. The requested parcel is
presently unused except that the Village of Hoffman Estates has recorded permanent and temporary
Grants of Easement for water and sanitary sewer (Document Nos. 92963380 and 91363571,
respectively). It is the Park District‟s intention that this parcel will be developed as a multi-purpose path
in cooperation with the Village of Hoffman Estates and the Forest Preserve District of Cook County
pursuant to the funding Grant awarded to the Village of Hoffman Estates under the 2012 Illinois
Transportation Enhancement Program. At the present time the Village of Hoffman Estates does maintain
a gravel pathway over the parcel, as well as the water and sanitary sewer lines below ground. Importantly,
on May29, 2013, the Cook County Board of Commissioners approved an Intergovernmental Agreement
with the Village of Hoffman Estates for a Noise Abatement Program that provides funding
(reimbursement) through the Canadian National Railway for affected residences that abut the Canadian
National Railway for noise mitigation improvements that are needed due to the increased rail traffic. This
Agreement includes the Bridlewood subdivision that is under the jurisdiction of Cook County, although
not within the corporate limits of the Village of Hoffman Estates. At the direction of the Hoffman Estates
Park District, the PIN will be retained for use as the multi-purpose path by the Requestor, the Village of

by facsimile or electronic filing.

(5)

Return fee. The Return Fee is charged to funeral homes that pick up bodies from the
Medical Examiner‟s Office and then request to return them to the Office after
determining that the family has no funds for burial. This cost would include the cost of
the burial shell and the burial cost.

(6)

Death certificate amendment fee. Fee is charged if the amendment is made later than one
year of the person‟s death (due to a return by Funeral Home). The Office of the Medical
Examiner is charged by the Illinois Department of Vital Records for amendments made
to a death certificate after one year of the death.

(7)

Storage fee. This fee covers the bodies returned (by the Ffuneral Hhomes) to the Office
of the Medical Examiner for storage while families secure funds for burial services and
bodies brought to the Medical Examiner‟s Office from hospice, nursing homes, and
hospitals for cases not falling under Medical Examiner jurisdiction as defined in Sec, 38118. This "storage fee" would replace the "return fee" if a funeral home returns a body
and picks it up again within ten days. If the body is not picked up within ten days, the
body will be held and buried by the County according to the standard operating
procedures of the Medical Examiner. This "storage fee" discourages the use of the Office
of the Medical Examiner as a storage location by funeral homes and also encourages the
funeral directors to verify that families have funds for burial prior to removing a body
from the Office of the Medical Examiner. The ability to accept cases for storage will be
at the discretion of the Medical Examiner and will depend on the current and anticipated
morgue census. This “storage fee” discourages the use of the Office of the Medical
Examiner as a storage location for non-Medical Examiner cases or cases that have been
discharged from the Medical Examiner‟s Office to funeral homes and encourages funeral
directors to verify that families have funds for burial prior to removing a body from the
Office of the Medical Examiner. In the cases of funeral homes, this “storage fee" would
replace the "return fee" if a funeral home returns a body and picks it up again within ten
days. If the body is not picked up within ten days, the body will be held and buried by the
County according to the standard operating procedures of the Medical Examiner.

WHEREAS, the Cook County Medical Examiner‟s Office is charged with oversight to ensure the
integrity of any final dispositions of indigent Cook County decedents buried at County expense; and
WHEREAS, currently indigent Cook County decedents under the jurisdiction of the Medical Examiner‟s
Office are being buried in one section of Homewood Memorial Gardens Cemetery; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Medical Examiner Advisory Committee has advised the Board of
Commissioners that the current burial site at Homewood Memorial Gardens Cemetery is unmarked and

requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to increase by $1,228,020.00 and extend for
one (1) year, Contract No. 09-41-276 with Sentinel Technologies, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, for services
related to the staffing and management of Cook County's Wide Area Network (WAN).

$4,489,636.44

If approved, this request will extend the Sentinel contract by one (1) year, during which time
the County will complete its joint City-County Request for Proposal (RFP) for replacement
services. Currently, the City-County RFP evaluation committee is deliberating upon
submitted proposals; and it aims to have a replacement vendor selected by early Fall 2013.
Extending this contract for one (1) year will give the County sufficient time to: (a) select a
replacement vendor, (b) negotiate a contract with the vendor, and (c) transition services
between Sentinel and the replacement vendor. During such time, the contract extension will
allow the County to maintain Wide Area Network (WAN) on-going administration and
trouble-shooting services, project staffing and management, tier one help desk and tier two
escalation services, network performance and security analyses, and firewall administration.
This one-year extension also specifically requires the vendor to deliver transition-out services
and documentation in order to minimize disruption to County Information Technology (IT)
services.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1,228,020.00 (FY 2013: $307,005.00; and FY 2014: $921,015.00). Contract
period: September 1, 2013 through August 31, 2014. (490-441 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2014 funds.

PROPOSED CONTRACT AMENDMENT
ITEM #75
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 27, 2013 from
LYDIA MURRAY, Chief Information Officer
and
SHANNON E. ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to amend Contract No. 12-90-022 with
Phoenix Business Solutions, LLC, Alsip, Illinois, for County-wide telephone equipment and supplies.
This amendment request would: (1) correct the contract term previously submitted to this Board to
properly be a two-year term, (2) increase the contract from $263,598.00 to $563,598.00, an amount
appropriate for a two-year term, and (3) amend the contract to properly include items meeting County
needs.
Reason:

In mid-2012 and after a competitive procurement, the County awarded this contract for the
County's purchase of telephone equipment and other telecommunication supplies. While the
Invitation to Bid advertised a two-year term and the contract term was two years, the item
submitted to this Board incorrectly stated that the contract term was one year. The estimates
used to determine the contract amount also improperly used this one-year-term assumption.
Bureau of Technology (BOT) now seeks approval to correct the contract term and amount to
properly reflect the County's needs over two (2) years. Further, BOT seeks to add a small
number of telecommunication devices that are available to purchase under the contract to also
meet the County's needs.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $300,000.00 (FY 2013: $93,000.00; and FY 2014: $207,000.00). Contract
period: August 1, 2012 through July 31, 2014. (490-333 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2014 funds.

Under this proposed extension, The Chicago Community Trust (CCT) will continue to
coordinate and administer community outreach services for the program. These services
educate families facing foreclosure on their legal rights and the benefits of connecting with
the Circuit Court‟s no-cost Mortgage Foreclosure Mediation Program. CCT‟s services
include one-on-one visits, neighborhood meetings, and the distribution of informational
brochures in those Cook County communities hardest hit by the mortgage foreclosure crisis.
CCT does not receive an administration fee for their services. Over the past 12 months ended
February 28, 2013, CCT‟s representatives visited more than 19,000 homes and participated in
164 community meetings and events throughout Cook County. As of March 31, 2013, there
were 75,533 mortgage foreclosures pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County.
The Chicago Community Trust was originally selected to manage the program‟s community
outreach services in March 2010 with the initiation of the program. A request for proposals
(RFP) process was conducted that year, but due to on-going and significant program
enhancements and developments, the RFP did not yield satisfactory results. A new RFP is
now in review with the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer. This extension will provide
services while the RFP is completed.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $234,800.00. Contract extension: August 1, 2013, through November 30, 2013.

PROPOSED CONTRACT
ITEM #86
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 17, 2013 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
and
SHANNON E. ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a contract with Aunt
Martha's Youth Service Center, Inc. (Aunt Martha‟s), Olympia Fields, Illinois, for the Juvenile Probation
and Court Services Department‟s Evening Reporting Centers Program and pre-trial services.
Reason:

Aunt Martha's is recommended based upon a Request for Proposal (RFP) No.13-23001. Aunt Martha's was the only vendor to respond to the RFP.
The Evening Reporting Centers Program combines community-based alternative detention
sites with electronic monitoring. Judges order selected, nonviolent minors, both male and
female, who would otherwise qualify for detention in the Cook County Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center (JTDC) to one of six Centers. Approximately 40 percent of the minors
subject to probation pretrial supervision are ordered to the program for up to 21 days. The
Centers provide minors with highly structured and well supervised group activities during
high risk periods. The program's goal is to reduce the likelihood of re-arrest and to allow
minors to continue to attend school and remain at home. Juveniles are supervised five days
per week from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. in five Chicago locations and one suburban location. Staff
members offer minors educational activities, recreational programming and life
development workshops. Center staff also teach social/life skills to reinforce pro-social
behaviors and provide tutoring support for school work. The centers provide transportation
for the minors to and from home. In calendar 2012, more than 1,850 minors were admitted,
for a total of more than 15,100 center service days.
In addition to the Evening Reporting Centers Program, the contract provides for pretrial
services for youth, ages 10-18, who have pending juvenile charges. Directed by judicial
order, pretrial services are provided seven days a week and include group therapy, home
visitation, curfew and school attendance monitoring, and referrals to services in the
community. Services are coordinated by two full-time Aunt Martha‟s case managers, who
conduct thorough assessments of the adolescent and family situations and develop
responsive case plans. On average, approximately 60 juveniles every day participate in the
program from 21 to 30 days.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $5,192,166.00 (FY 2013: $574,776.00; FY 2014: $1,724,320.00; FY 2015:
$1,730,720.00; and FY 2016: $1,162,350.00). Contract period: August 1, 2013 through July 31, 2016.
(326-298 Account).
Approval of this item would commit funds for Fiscal Years 2014, 2015 and 2016.

SOCIAL SERVICE DEPARTMENT
PROPOSED GRANT AWARD RENEWAL
ITEM #87
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 9, 2013 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization to renew a grant in the amount of $28,065.00 from the Illinois Department of
Human Services to provide court-ordered counseling services to domestic violence offenders who have
been found guilty of misdemeanor domestic violence offenses against an intimate partner and are under
the supervision of the Social Service Department, Circuit Court of Cook County.
The Social Service Department's Domestic Violence Program complies with the standards for abuser
treatment as set forth in the Illinois Protocol for Domestic Abuse Batterers Programs. Established in 1979,
the program operates in Chicago and all five (5) suburban municipal districts. Specially trained probation
staff provide supervision, group intervention, and requisite abuser treatment to offenders. By integrating
the authority and sanctions of the court with state-of-the-art abuser treatment intervention in a court-based
setting, the department attends to victim safety, maximizes the impact of treatment, and works within the
judicial process to hold offenders accountable for their abusive behavior.
The authorization to accept the previous grant was given on September 10, 2012 by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners in the amount of $5,796.00. On May 29, 2013, the County Board approved a
supplemental award increasing the overall grant amount to $34,776.00.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award: $28,065.00. Funding period: July 1, 2013 through June
30, 2014.
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook

EARL L. DUNLAP, Transitional Administrator, Juvenile Temporary Detention Center
and
SHANNON E. ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to increase by $18,311,640.91 and extend for
four (4) years, Contract No. 10-41-68 with The Isaac Ray Center, Chicago, Illinois, for mental health
services for residents of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC).

Increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$16,319,621.00
18,311,640.91
$34,631,261.91

Pursuant to Clause 5(f) of the Agreed Order appointing a Transitional Administrator, Doe v.
Cook County, Case No. 99 C 3945, the Office of the Transitional Administrator, in its
authority as established in the Court Order entered on August 14, 2007, has selected Isaac Ray
Center (IRC) to provide mental health services to residents of the JTDC. Currently, IRC
provides mental health services to the JTDC in a manner that is consistent with the National
Commission on Correction Health Care (NCCHC), the American Correctional Association
(ACA) and the requirements set forth in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) approved by
the Federal District Court in the case of Doe v. Cook County, Case No. 99 C 3945, and in the
extension of the Memorandum of Agreement through the Modified Implementation Plan
(MIP). Because of the existing relationship that IRC currently has with the JTDC, the Office
of the Transitional Administrator, in its authority, has chosen to retain Isaac Ray Center as its
mental health services provider for JTDC residents. This decision was made in an effort to
avoid any disruption in mental health services to the JTDC residents. The expiration date of
the current contract is November 30, 2013.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $18,311,640.91 (FY 2014: $4,381,893.30; FY 2015: $4,509,990.10; FY 2016:

125,796.00

68,139.50
62,898.00
$623,738.50

DDW & Associates/REB Storage Systems International was selected from two (2) vendor
bids received through the open market bid process. The contract for the rental of shelving was
approved by the County Board on February 4, 2009. The vendor designed, installed and
anchored the shelving to the 89th Street warehouse floor. The temporary storage shelving
system was needed by the Clerk of the Circuit Court to maintain a total of 3,072 pallets of
court documents until space was made available at the new Cicero Record Center.
The extension period and increase is needed to allow adequate time for any construction
delays, the relocation of all court documents, supplies and equipment from 1120 East 89th
Street to the new warehouse location. Additionally, so that the contract can be properly
terminated time is needed for the break-down and removal of the shelving from the warehouse
premises. Until the construction of the new warehouse is completed and relocation of the
records, we believe that it is more cost effective and efficient to retain the expertise and
services of the current vendor. This extension period is not to exceed six months (with a
monthly cost of $10,483.00 per month), or total cost of $62,898.00.
If the current contract were to be rebid, the County would incur additional costs for the
reconstruction of shelving, reloading of pallets, and incur possible increases in labor costs
needed for staff to search for the location of pallets/documents during the reconstruction.
Additionally, the Clerk of the Circuit Court would experience delays in the retrieval and
delivery of court documents during the reconstruction of the shelving. The expiration date of
the current contract is August 31, 2013.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $62,898.00. Contract extension: September 1, 2013 through February 28,
2014. (529-660 Account).
