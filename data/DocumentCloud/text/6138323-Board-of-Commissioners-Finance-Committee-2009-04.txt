Sec. 74-70. Class 8a Designation / Assessment Class
Class 8a.
Real estate that is used primarily for commercial purposes as an
auto dealership, wherein the business and commerce of selling and leasing new
automobiles is an ongoing commercial enterprise, which real estate would qualify for a
class 8 designation pursuant to Sec. 74-62 thru Sec. 74-64, except for the fact that the
qualifying use of the property prior to application for the incentive does not comply with
the definition of abandoned property provided for in Sec.74-62(b), can receive a
designation as a class 8a property so long as the applicant can show that it has complied
with all of the requirements necessary to receive a class 8 designation per Sec. 74-62 thru
Sec. 74-64, except for meeting the definition of abandonment provided for in Sec. 7462(b), but only when the Cook County Board of Commissioners provides a resolution or
ordinance in support of such designation absent abandonment.
(1)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a
resolution or ordinance in support of class 8a designation absent
abandonment when:
a. applicant provides objective and credible evidence including,
but not limited to, an economic impact study that demonstrates
to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners
that the ongoing commercial enterprise is not economically
viable and as such it will cease operations within sixty-days of
the submission of an eligibility application for class 8a
designation to the Cook County Assessor, and thereafter the
property will become vacant and unused for an extended period
of time of at least twenty-four months; and
c. applicant provides objective and credible evidence including,
but not limited to, an economic impact study that demonstrates
to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners
that designation as a class 8a property will allow the commercial
enterprise to be economically viable and thereby continue its
operations so that the commercial enterprise can continue to
occupy and fully utilize the real estate for an extended period of
time.

(2)

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a. a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that class 8a designation of the property is
necessary for the ongoing commercial enterprise to continue its
operations and that without such designation the commercial
enterprise would not be economically viable causing the
property to become vacant and unused; and
b. a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it
supports and consents to the designation of the property as a
class 8a property absent an abandonment requirement; and
b. a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it
supports and consents to the application made to the Cook
County Assessor requesting designation as a class 8a property
absent an abandonment requirement.

of this section, the municipality in which the real estate is located
must provide to the Cook County Assessor a resolution or ordinance
that contains the following:
a. a finding by the municipality that it has determined that class 8a
designation of the property is necessary for the ongoing
commercial enterprise to continue its operations and that
without such designation the commercial enterprise would not
be economically viable causing the property to become vacant
and unused; and
b. a statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to
the action by the Cook County Board of Commissioners to
support designation of the property as a class 8a property.
c. a statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to

eligibility application must be made to the Cook County Assessor.

(6)

Upon receipt of a completed eligibility application and all required
municipal and county ordinances and resolutions, including those
referenced in this section, the property will qualify for the class 8a
designation provided the Cook County Assessor determines that the
real estate which is the subject of the application for a class 8a
designation would qualify for designation as a class 8 property but for
the inability to comply with the definition of abandonment pursuant to
Sec.74-62(b). If the Cook County Assessor makes such a
determination the property shall be classified as a class 8a property
pursuant to this section.

(7)

The Cook County Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this
section to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under class
8a.

(8)

Upon receipt of an eligibility application for a class 8a designation, the

designation for any year prior to the assessment year for which an
application for the designation is made to the Cook County Assessor.
