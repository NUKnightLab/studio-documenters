(Item 1)
The CHA’s workforce is its most valuable asset and it must possess the skills to meet the important needs
of the agency and the residents they serve. In determining the need for professional development, CHA
evaluated its existing training resources, skill needed for current and potential positions and the cost
effectiveness of training options. CHA has been utilizing City Colleges of Chicago (CCC) to provide
public housing resident education for several years. At this time the Administrative Office would like to
expand CHA’s existing partnership with CCC to provide a customized, affordable and high-quality
training option to CHA employees through the Workforce Academy at CHA. The Workforce Academy at
the City Colleges of Chicago is dedicated to helping clients to become more competitive, efficient, and
innovative by providing their workforce with the skills they need to succeed. The program offers
customized, affordable, high-quality training to businesses and non-profits across a variety of industries.
1

 Instructors are experts in their subject area and will offer training on-site at CHA. Each year CHA will
assess the needed skills and professional development training and work with City Colleges to meet those
needs. Accordingly, the resolution for Item No. 1 approves an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with
City Colleges of Chicago for a 1 year base term from June 15, 2016 through June 15, 2017 to provide
Professional Development Training, in the not-to-exceed amounts of: $52,000 for a one (1) year base
term; $57,000 for the first one (1) year option term; $63,000 for the second one (1) year option term;
$69,000 for the third one (1) year option term; and $76,000 for the fourth one (1) year option term, for an

CHA issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) in February 2016, to solicit vendors to provide services in the
following two separate categories: pre-purchase and post-purchase homeownership counseling services,
and legal assistance, to support participants of the CHA’s Choose to Own Program. CHA solicited 182
firms, 385 Section 3 Business Concerns, and notified 31 “assist” agencies. The RFP was advertised in area
newspapers, the CHA website and in the CHA Supplier Portal. CHA received proposals from four
respondents and all proposals were deemed responsive. Based on the recommendation of the Evaluation
Committee, the resolution for Item 3 approves the award of contracts to Latin United Community
Housing Association (LUCHA), Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago and Spanish Coalition for
Housing for a not-to-exceed amount of $54,219 per contract for a two-year base term and for a not-toexceed amount of $27,110 per Contract for each of three (3) one-year option periods, exercisable at the
discretion of the Chief Executive Officer to provide pre and post homeownership training and counseling
services for CHA Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) tenants and public housing residents. Additionally, the
resolution authorizes a contract award to Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law (DBA
The Law Project) for a not-to-exceed amount of $66,920 for a two-year base term and for a not-to-exceed
amount of $33,460 for each of three (3) one-year option period, exercisable at the discretion of the Chief
Executive Officer to provide legal counseling services for CHA’s HCV tenants and public housing
residents. The Choose to Own (CTO) program allows HCV tenants and public housing residents to own

monthly mortgage for participants for up to 15 years (up to 30-years for elderly or people with
disabilities). Participants may utilize the voucher subsidy toward their mortgage. The Choose to Own
program includes pre and post purchase homeownership counseling services to help participants navigate
the home buying process, receive referrals to lenders, and legal services to help with the home closing and
post purchase legal process, including estate planning services.

 RESOLUTION NO. 2016-CHA-62
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated June 21, 2016 entitled “Recommendation to award contracts for
Homeownership Counseling Services”.

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
award contracts to Latin United Community Housing Association, Neighborhood
Housing Services of Chicago and Spanish Coalition for Housing for a not-to-exceed
amount of $54,219 per Contract for a two-year base term and for a not-to-exceed

of $66,920 for a two-year base term and for a not-to-exceed amount of $33,460 for
each of three (3) one-year option period, exercisable at the discretion of the Chief
Executive Officer or his designee to provide legal counseling services for CHA
Housing Choice Voucher tenants and public housing residents.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE/ Section 3 hiring and insurance requirements.

(Item 4)
In January 2016, Resident Services received Board approval to execute a contract with Hill FoodService
Consulting to provide 90 annual training slots for the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) and 38
annual training slots for the Golden Diners Program (GDP). The original contract budget included a wage
of $10.00 per hour for CHA residents working in the Summer Food Service Program or Golden Diners
Program. Executive Order 2014-1 requires CHA and its for-profit contractors to pay covered employees a
minimum of $13.00 per hour, therefore CHA desires to increase the wages for these positions to $13.00
per hour. While the Executive Order does allow for an exemption for governmental subsidized transitional
employment programs, CHA is recommending this increase, as the employees are working on-site at CHA
developments and Golden Diners positions are longer-term subsidized positions. Accordingly, the
resolution for Item 4 amends Contract No. 11720 with Hill FoodService Consulting in an increased
compensation amount not-to-exceed $736,244.00 to increase wages for Summer Food and Golden Diners
participant, FICA increases and administrative related expenses.
RESOLUTION NO. 2016-CHA-63
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated June 21, 2016 entitled “RECOMMENDATION TO AMEND
CONTRACT WITH HILL FOODSERVICE CONSULTING”.

 THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
amend Contract no. 11720 with Hill FoodService Consulting, with increased
compensation in an amount not-to-exceed $736,244.00, resulting in revised total
compensation amount not-to-exceed $4,009,963.00 for the two-year base term of
Contract no. 11720.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE/ Section 3 hiring and insurance requirements.

(Item 5)
The resolution for Item 5 approves amendment of the 2016 Funding Agreement with the Central Advisory
Council (CAC) in an amount not-to-exceed $219,371.00. The modified aggregate not-to-exceed amount is
$1,336,206.00. A Funding Agreement between CHA and the CAC is required by HUD for funding
provided by a housing authority for a duly elected resident council. In January 2016, the Board of
Commissioners approved CHA to enter into a Funding Agreement with the Central Advisory Council. In
June 2016, CHA and CAC completed a procurement for a Contractor to conduct and manage the 2016
Local Advisory Council and Central Advisory Council elections that are scheduled to take place in
September 2016. Based on this competitive procurement, an additional $216,371 is required to amend the
2016 Funding Agreement in order to support the 2016 LAC/CAC Elections.
RESOLUTION NO. 2016-CHA-64
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the

 Matthew Brewer, Chairman of the Real Estate Operations Development committee, then presented his
report. Per Commissioner Brewer, the Real Estate Operations Development Committee held its monthly
meeting earlier today. Commissioner Brewer chaired the meeting and the following committee members

On behalf of the Real Estate Operations Development committee, Commissioner Brewer presented an
Omnibus Motion for approval of Items 6 through 13.
(Item 6)
CHA and HUD signed the original MTW Agreement on February 6, 2000 which allowed CHA to
implement the original Plan for Transformation. CHA’s Amended and Restated MTW Agreement with
HUD was fully executed on June 26, 2008 which extended CHA’s participation in the MTW
Demonstration Program through FY2018. Pursuant to Section 239 of Title II, Division L of the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, and by letter dated April 4, 2016, HUD extended the CHA’s current
MTW Agreement until the end of 2028, and modified the agreement to include the prohibition of statutory
offsets of four months of operating expenses reserve balance, subject to any future acts of Congress, and
provide for remaining availability, subject to statutory offset, of reserve balances exceeding such four
months of operating expenses. The Letter also acknowledges that, under The Act, the MTW Agreement
may be further modified by the mutual agreement of HUD and the CHA. Accordingly, the resolution for
Item 6 accepts and authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to sign and submit an acceptance of the
extension of the Amended and Restated MTW Agreement through the end of 2028 to HUD.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2016-CHA-65
the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated June 21, 2016
requesting approval of the extension of the Amended and Restated MTW
Agreement between HUD and CHA;

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby accepts and authorizes the Chief Executive
Officer to sign and submit an acceptance of the extension of the Amended and
Restated MTW Agreement through the end of 2028 to HUD.

(Item 7)
The resolution for Item 7 approves the Intergovernmental Agreements with the Metropolitan Water
Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRDGC) for Stormwater Retention and Reuse at CHA
properties. Collaborating with the MWRDGC to implement green infrastructure systems on CHA
properties will allow the CHA to use rainwater as a resource, reduce the use of potable water for
irrigation, as well as assist in the overall reduction of combined sewer overflows across the city, which can
lead to basement flooding or other property damage. At present, the CHA and MWRDGC have been
working on a conceptual project for stormwater management at Dearborn Homes that will involve
improvements to an existing storage tank on the property that will decrease water usage, provide filtered
stormwater for on-site irrigation, and provide relief to the area’s sewer systems. In addition to the
proposed project at Dearborn Homes, the CHA is seeking to enter into a Master Intergovernmental
Agreement (Master IGA) with the MWRDGC. The proposed Master IGA is intended to generally govern
6

 relations between the CHA and the MWRDGC in connection with any additional stormwater management
projects that may be undertaken by the MWRDGC at CHA properties at no or minimal cost to the CHA.
The parties understand and agree that the MWRDGC is not entitled to implement, nor is the CHA
obligated to approve, any stormwater management projects solely by entering into a Master IGA.
RESOLUTION NO. 2016-CHA-66
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated June 21, 2016 entitled “Authorization to: 1) Enter into an
Intergovernmental Agreement with the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of
Greater Chicago (MWRDGC) for Stormwater Retention and Reuse at Dearborn
Homes 2) Enter into additional Intergovernmental Agreements with the MWRDGC
and 3) Execute and deliver such other documents and perform such actions as may be
necessary or appropriate to implement the foregoing;”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE CHICAGO
HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to:
1) Enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement with the Metropolitan Water
Reclamation District of Greater Chicago for Stormwater Retention and Reuse at
Dearborn Homes 2) Enter into a Master Intergovernmental Agreement with the
MWRDGC or, alternatively, additional project-specific intergovernmental agreements
for stormwater retention and reuse and 3) execute and deliver such other documents
and perform such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the
foregoing.

(Item 8)
The CHA issued an Invitation for Bid in April 2016 for the demolition of Altgeld/Murray Homes Blocks
15 and 16. Bids were evaluated based on the lowest lump sum base bid amount offered and the ability to
meet contracting compliance requirements. A total of 5 respondents were received before the due date. Of
those, Brandenburg Industrial Services Company offered the lowest lump sum base bid. Accordingly, the
resolution for Item 8 approves the award of a contract to Brandenburg Industrial Service Company, in an
amount not-to-exceed $1,378,000, to demolish Blocks 15 and 16 at the Philip Murray Homes. Blocks 15
and 16 are comprised of 182 units in 25 two-story buildings. Block 15 has been vacant since 2003 and
Block 16 has been vacant since 2009. These buildings are in an advanced state of deterioration of both the
building exterior and interior structural systems. Mechanical equipment is non-functional and utility
pipes, conduits, wiring and fixtures are broken, missing or in poor condition. The extensive water damage
throughout has caused various masonry problems and these buildings would require mold remediation.
The advanced deterioration of these buildings would require gut rehabilitations as well as modifications
for current building code and ADA compliance. CHA received HUD approval to proceed with the
demolition of Blocks 15 and 16 in April 2016. The project’s scope of work includes the complete
structural demolition of 25 two-story vacant residential buildings and includes the removal of the
foundation and all associated site work. The Project is anticipated to be completed in 4 months
RESOLUTION NO. 2016-CHA-67
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated June 21, 2016 entitled “Recommendation to Award a Contract for
the Demolition of Blocks 15 and 16 at the Philip Murray Homes”.
7

 THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
award a contract to Brandenburg Industrial Service Company to demolish Blocks 15
and 16 at the Philip Murray Homes in an amount not-to-exceed $1,378,000.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE/ Section 3 hiring and insurance requirements.

(Item 9)
For the past four years, the CHA has utilized the environmental remediation services of Tecnica
Environmental Services, Inc. for environmental abatement work for capital construction and maintenance
projects. The contract for Tecnica Environmental Services, Inc. expires in November 2016. Tecnica has
been awarded four task orders under this contract and has exhausted the base contract’s funds. CHA Board
of Commissioner approval is required to add an additional contract value to be used for future task order
work from the period from June to November 6, 2016. Before the expiration of the current Option Year,
the contracts for environmental remediation services will be solicited. In order to continue issuing
environmental remediation task orders expeditiously, CHA is proposing to add additional capacity with an
amendment of $300,000 to Tecnica’s contract for future work. Since Eason Environmental Services, Inc.
voluntarily dropped out of the program, $573,092.00 of the original contract value allocated to them
remains available out of the $2,000,000 originally authorized by the Board. $300,000 of this amount will
be reallocated to the Tecnica contract, so no additional funds are required for the program. Accordingly,
the resolution for Item 9 approves Amendment No. 3 to Contract 11165 with Tecnica Environmental
Services, Inc. to increase the not-to-exceed contract value by $300,000.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2016-CHA-68

amount not-to-exceed of $966,666.00.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s

developer to secure other development and construction financing. Once all financing is secured, the full
development plan will be submitted to the CHA Board prior to execution of an Agreement to Enter into a
Housing Assistance Payment Contract (AHAP). Initial contract rents will be determined by market
comparables and fair market rents applicable at the time the HAP contract is executed. All rent

completion of rehab. For those units, at turnover, the developer will accept applicants from CHA’s wait
lists. All other units will accept referrals from CHA wait lists at initial lease-up. The total estimated
development budget for the Marshall is $27,278,157 or $303,091 per unit. CHA is not providing any

Board Letter dated June 21, 2016 entitled “Recommendation to execute a preliminary
commitment letter for The Marshall Hotel for Property Rental Assistance.”

(Item 12)
CHA issued a Request For Qualification to solicit Pre-Qualified Development Teams to engage in the
acquisition, development and management of mixed-income developments and family units in
Opportunity and General Areas. The Pre-Qualified Development Program permits the CHA to receive
proposals from an established group of developers in two ways: the CHA can issue an Opportunity Notice
to all participants in the program requesting proposals from development teams for a specific property or
development teams can submit proposals at any time for CHA-owned properties of five acres or less.
Upon receipt of a proposal, the CHA issues an Opportunity Notice to all other program participants
requiring any additional proposals to be submitted within 30 days. Three Corners Development submitted
a proposal to the CHA for the property located at 6418 North Sheridan Road in March 2016. CHA issued
a Notice of Opportunity to all pre-qualified development teams and received an additional proposal from
one other developer. Both proposals were evaluated and based upon Three Corners Development’s
intention to bring a national commercial retail anchor to the site that would maximize the commercial
space and significantly benefit the residents and community, Three Corners Development is the
recommended pre-qualified developer for the property located at 6418 North Sheridan Road. The CHA is
looking to build its portfolio of mixed-income and mixed-use developments that provide additional public
housing units together with national and regional retail that provide products with affordable price points
to further enhance the quality of life for residents in this area. The CHA has determined that the
redevelopment of this site’s adjacent community center and parking lot to include new CHA units and
strong retail tenants would be beneficial to the Authority, the residents and the community. Accordingly,
the resolution for Item 12 authorizes the approval of a pre-qualified development team, Three Corners
Development, and enter into negotiations for a Development Agreement for the property located at 6418
North Sheridan Road
RESOLUTION NO. 2016-CHA-71
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
approve a pre-qualified development team, Three Corners Development, and enter
into negotiations for a development agreement for 6418 North Sheridan Road.

(Item 13)
In January 2010, a Request for Qualifications was issued for a master planning developer and property
management for Julia C. Lathrop Homes (Lathrop). In October 2010, the CHA Board approved the
selection of Lathrop Community Partners, LLC, an Illinois limited liability company as the master
development team. The first phase of Lathrop Redevelopment is composed of two sub-phases, Phase 1A
and Phase 1B. Phase 1A is the subject phase of this board item. The resolution for Item 13 authorizes the
CEO to commit CHA funds not to exceed $75,000,000 for redevelopment and remediation activities for
Lathrop Phase 1A; submit a Project-Based Voucher (PBV) Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD)
Financing Plan to HUD and enter into a RAD Conversion Commitment for Lathrop Phase 1A; execute a
PBV RAD Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Contract for 151 units and execute such other documents
as may be required for the financing and operation of Lathrop Phase 1A; convey the Lathrop Phase 1A
buildings by deed and ground lease the land; and execute and deliver such other documents and perform
such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the foregoing. The overall revitalization
plan for historic Lathrop includes a multi-phased, mixed-income, mixed-use development that will be
conducted over three on-site phases and will consist of 1,116 total residential units and approximately
50,000 square feet of commercial space. Phase 1A will include the development of 413 total units
(including 151 CHA, 101 affordable and 161 market rate units), which includes the historic preservation
of 15 existing buildings, demolition of one non-residential building and one new construction mid-rise,
mixed-use building on the north-west corner of Clybourn Avenue and Diversey Parkway. The scope of
work includes unit reconfiguration, meeting accessibility requirements, and the replacement/refurbishment
of all major systems. Site improvements include installation of the northern portion of river walk along the
Chicago River for recreational use and improvement of the “Great Lawn” and other proposed public park
spaces. This rehabilitation/new construction activity is expected to be completed within approximately 24
