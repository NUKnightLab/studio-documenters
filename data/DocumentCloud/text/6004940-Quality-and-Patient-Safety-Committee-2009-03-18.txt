Letter from America

Animsmimt Tmtirwas cut short as the plane began its
descent into Chicago. My mood was plummeting; I was
weighed down by guilt about my carbon footprint, and I
vowed tojoin Greenpeace on my return. I was travelling
to speakat grand rounds at Cook County Hospital. And
with the United 
able, my chosen topic was, ?Should the US nationalise
its health care??I regretted my passing resemblance
to Lenin- With my usual overcon?dence faltering and
against my tradition, I was going to hide in the dark-
ness of a PowerPoint presentation. I wasn't going to say
what the US should do, for if any country can sort out a
problem it is the innovative and free thinking Americans.
Billboards advertised drugs as we drove from the airport.
I wondered why, in a country that had suit'ered tens of
thousands of cardiovascular events from the promotion
of rofecoxib Winn}, the government didn't regulate to
protect patients from this naked greed.

But Cook Country was different a state funded public
hospital serving Chicago?s melting pot of the deprived,
and a United Nations ofdoctors whose sense ofservice to
their community made me feel inadequate. They didn?t
need to be told what the problems were. And it is unfair
to best
for all acutely ill citizens. But, regrettably, it provides not
the greatest good for the greatest number but the least

good for the least number. There is too little health care
for the nearly 46 million citizens without insurance, and
this number is rising daily in the economic downturn.

Most other people are afflicted with too much health
care. They seem to be just raw material for corporate
medicine, exposed to questionable screening and prayed
on by cynical marketing that generates disproportionate
fear so as to sell unnecessary drugs and expensive
investigations. Those in power have been duped into
believing that health is more about immediacy and
choice than quality. Private medical professionals must
be in denial about the harm they are doing. Medical
insurance companies and big pharma use political
lobbying to pervert the course of medical justice. And
commisn'oning bias means a lack of research to demon-
strate the obvious and enormous collateral damage of
this obscene gluttony of medicine.

So as I wandered past the downtown beggars and
observed the global obesity?the indictment of unhap-
piness was plain. The inconvenient truth is that US
sickness is no longer medical but social. This truly won-
derful country is in consumerism. I don?t
offer solutions, but I know a place to start looking: Cool:
County.
