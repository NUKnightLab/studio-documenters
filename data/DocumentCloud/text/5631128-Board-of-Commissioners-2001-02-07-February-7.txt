The Chairperson then recessed the portion of the Special Board Meeting and Commissioner
Earnest Gates, Chairperson of the Operations and Audit Committee, called the Committee
meeting to order.
Jan Laskey, Acting Chief of Development, presented the Committee with a chronological
summation of activities leading to the working group's recommendations. Per Ms. Laskey, a
Request for Qualification (RFQ) was issued by the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) and The
Habitat Company for the redevelopment of sites at Stateway, Taylor A & B and Rockwell
Gardens. Responses to the RFQ were received and evaluated by a working group that was
formed for each site. Members of each working group included 2 LAC officers, representatives
from the Department of Housing and Planning, Gautreaux plaintiff's counsel, Habitat and CHA
staff. The Stateway Working Group also included two (2) community representatives: one from
the White Sox organization and the Mid-South Planning Group.

3

 According to Ms. Laskey, the selection process was conducted by CHA in a multi-tiered manner
that began with the issuance of the RFQ. The selection criteria in the RFQ were the basis for the
Working Group's recommendation. The primary criteria related to the development and
management of mixed income residential property, including experience with the development
process from initial site planning through construction, experience in successful use of multiple
sources of financing, and experience in securing and sustaining high quality property
management. Also considered were the development teamsâ€™ capacity to create resident and
community participation, capacity to create resident owned businesses and other MBE/WBE,
capacity to create meaningful employment opportunities for residents and business approach to
the redevelopment process. First, the Working Groups initially evaluated the written responses
to identify the finalists to interview. Second, the Working Group held extensive interviews,
including question and answer sessions, with the finalists. Ms. Laskey concluded her
presentation by advising the Committee that the recommendation of Stateway Associates Team
for Stateway, Brinshore-Michael's Development Team for Taylor and East Lake for Rockwell
reflects the judgment of the Working Group members based on the interviews, questions and
extensive review of each finalist development team.
Commissioner Mooney then recused himself from discussing and voting on Item 1 related to
Stateway Associates.
Dick Shields, Project Executive for the Stateway Associates and principal of MESA
Developments, then introduced members of his team. Team members gave a synopsis of their
particular field as it related to the overall master developer plan. Mr. Shield then presented the
Committee with an overview of the team's expertise, experience, capabilities and approach as
master developers for the Stateway development. A discussion on social services and needs
assessment then followed. The Committee then voted to recommend Stateway Associates as
master developers for Stateway Gardens.
Rich Shortino, President of Brinshore Development, then introduced his partner, David Brint,
and Sinclair Cooper, Vice-President of Michael Development. Per Mr. Shortino, the assembled
development team for the Robert Taylor project originated by a three-prong approach as follows:
expertise for applying and obtaining HOPE VI funds from HUD, demonstrated ability in
property management and a team that reflects understanding of local markets and capacity to
implement and undertake the development. Team members then expounded on the variety of
services to be provided and their individual level of participation through out the project.
The Committee then devoted considerable discussion to the following issues: delivery of social
services to both current and post-transition residents once development has begun, role of
Chicago Urban League, responsibility and exposure of developer, CHA's investment and fair
return, pre-development and post Hope VI cost, project deliverables and benchmarks, contract
terms for pre-development stage, and recruitment process in local community to expand pool of
minority businesses.
While the Committee was impressed with the strength of the team's plan for physical
redevelopment, several concerns lingered with regards to the delivery of social services,
exposure of developer, CHA's fair return and terms of CHA's participation in the predevelopment stage. The consensus of the Committee was to defer the recommendation of
Brinshore-Michael as master developer for Robert Taylor for further discussion at the Operations
Committee meeting scheduled for 2:00 p.m. on Wednesday, February 14, 2001. The Committee
also requested a presentation by Brinshore-Michael's staff who was directly responsible for the
social services portion of the plan.
Eileen Rhodes, Operations Manager of East Lake Management, then presented members of the
East Lake development team. Per Ms. Rhodes, since 1997, East Lake has been the property
manager for Rockwell Gardens and has thereby developed a strong and supportive relationship
with the resident leadership and residents of Rockwell. According to Ms. Rhodes, East Lake is a
full service real estate company with 15 years of experience in all aspects of real estate
development, construction and property management. Ms. Rhodes informed the Committee that
East Lake was the first company to develop mixed-income developments through out Chicago

4

 using HUD's 236 Program and have been committed to the promotion of mixed-income housing
for over 20 years. East Lake's involvement in creating the Rockwell 1997 Strategic Plan, per Ms.
Rhodes, created an opportunity to deal with significant issues such as relocation, demolition,
economic development and community involvement thereby facilitating the process of
developing the Hope VI Plan. Members of East Lake's development team then elaborated on
their respective services and expertise to be provided in the overall development plan.
An extensive question and answer session then followed. One of the principal concerns of the
Committee is East Lake's capability to undertake the project; the Committee pointed out that no
experience was noted on resumes for the overall master development or social services capacity.
CHA staff was also requested to provide the Committee with an assessment on East Lake's
performance as property managers for Rockwell. East Lake was also requested to provide the
Committee with additional information with regards to delivery of social services and
development of CCS portion of HOPE VI application. The Committee then unanimously voted
to defer recommendation for further discussion at the Operations Committee meeting scheduled
for Wednesday, February 14, 2001.
The Committee then discussed the remaining Item No. 4 and the following list summarizes
Committee's actions accordingly:
Item 1 - Recommended for full Board approval on 2/20/01: Approval of Working
Group's recommendation for Master Developer at Stateway . Recommended
Awardee: Stateway Associates, a joint venture of MESA Development LLC,
The Davis Group, Walsh Construction and Kimball Hill Homes. (Commissioner
Mooney recused himself from discussing and voting on this item)
Item 2 - Tabled for further discussion at Operations Committee Meeting of 2/14/01:
Recommendation for Master Developer at Robert Taylor "A" and "B".
Recommended Awardee: Brinshore-Michael.
Item 3 - Tabled for further discussion at Operations Committee Meeting of 2/14/01:
Recommendation for Master Developer at Rockwell. Recommended Awardee:

Item 4 - Approved: Recommendation to approve Intergovernmental Agreement with the

There being no further business to come before the Operation & Audit Committee, upon motion
made, seconded and carried the portion of the Operations meeting was adjourned.
The Chairperson reconvened the Special Board Meeting and reiterated the above actions
approved by the Operations Committee.
The Chairperson then introduced a motion for the approval of Item 4.
Item 4
The resolution for Item 4, requests approval of an Intergovernmental Agreement with the City of
Chicago's Department of Planning (DPD) for the creation of Land Use Surveys for the State
street Corridor and Rockwell Gardens Community. The purpose of the Intergovernmental
Agreement is to memorialize the understanding between CHA and DPD for its commitment to
assist the CHA with needed planning services required for the 2001 Hope VI Revitalization
Grant application submitted. The Hope VI applications must receive recommendation from the
City because of the opportunity provided for redevelopment of surrounding communities. The
Hope VI applications require the CHA to create Land Use Surveys for the State Street Corridor
with a boundary of 22nd Street on the North, 55th Street on the South, Martin Luther King Drive
on the East and the Dan Ryan Expressway on the West and Rockwell Gardens with a boundary
of Lake Street on the North, Eisenhower Expressway on the South, Western Avenue on the East
and Kedzie Avenue on the West. The Land Use Surveys will provide the CHA and City with
information on current land uses and proposed future private and public land uses. It is

5

 anticipated that the CHA will receive a grant from a third party charitable foundation within the
next few months, which will be used to off set a portion of the costs.
