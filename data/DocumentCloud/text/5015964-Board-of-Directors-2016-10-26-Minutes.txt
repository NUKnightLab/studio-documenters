NEW 

PUBLIC COMMENT

Mr. Lewand cailed for public comment and stated that two minutes wouid be given.
Mr. John Lauve of Holiy, Michigan stated the foiiowing:

?ilitch is in violation of his contract for the arena. It is quite ciear he is obligated to provide
50,000 tickets to low?income kids but instead the City of Utica Fire Department gets them,
a senior center gets them, the Marine Corps League gets them, the University Heaith
Service gets them, the University of Michigan Sports Business Association business
students get them, the City of Southfield eideriy get them and the people of Toronto get
them. So he is in vioiation of the contract. That is the way he works and you have an
obligation to enforce the contract and you can do that white they?re in violation through
arbitration, but if you don't have the time or ability or desire to do something about it, it
needs to be resolved in a way that requires him to obey the contract that he signed. He is
doing all this fancy footwork. i don?t know what the status is of the Wayne State University
sale, what the price has been, what the arrangements have been. is it now going to go on
the tax roiis or stay off the tax rolls? What is the status of these out buiidings? These
things should be resolved instead of just giving him a free pass and don?t worry about it. I
have a copy of the 2015 annual report and the City was out $8 million, the schooi district
$8 million, Wayne $1 million. And then it iists here, number of jobs created, oh wow, 
So we are really working on jobs. That is what the annuai report states. 80 this is not
doing the job that needs to be done. Giving them these tax?free properties at no cost, it is
off the chart for the city that needs the income. You gave more money to liitch's stadium
than they gave to the pensioners in the grand bargain. That is the kind of thing that is going
on. We need schoois. We're not going to get schoois".

Mr. Lewand advised Mr. Lauve that his time was up and thanked him for his comments.
ADJOURNMENT

With there being no other business to be brought before the Board, Mr. Lewand adjourned the
meeting at 3:55 pm.
