 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
September 2, 2010
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on August 5, at 1:30 p.m. The meeting was held at 33
N. LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

Ben Weese
John Baird
Ernest Wong

Staff:

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Historic Preservation Division, Department
of Zoning and Land Use Planning
Dijana Cuvalo
Cynthia Roubik
Beth Johnson
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

5052 S. Ellis
(Kenwood District – 4th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed rehabilitation and conversion of single-family home into two
condominium units, including exterior and interior alterations to the
building and a coach house

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
Main House:
1. Although the second-floor addition on the west porch of the south
façade was added early in the history of the house (c. 1910), given its
condition, the quality of its original design, and that this area was
originally an open deck, the enclosed porch may be removed as
proposed and returned to its original appearance;
2. The drawings should be revised to clarify which portions of the west
porch structure on the south and west façades are proposed to be
rebuilt, and these areas are to be confirmed and agreed to by Historic
Preservation staff based on their levels of deterioration prior to permit
application submission. The existing wood columns are to be retained
in-place, stripped, and painted, as proposed;
3. The deteriorated 3’-0”-tall wood balustrades on the first floor porches
may be rebuilt in wood to be 3’-6”-tall in order to meet railing code
requirements. However, the 2’-0”-tall wood balustrades on the
second-floor, which also need to be rebuilt due to deterioration, should

not be rebuilt at a taller height to meet code, as this would greatly
change the scale, appearance, and character of these features. Historic
Preservation staff shall work with the applicant on the appropriate
modifications to meet code requirements, such as incorporating a taller
new glass or simple open metal railing behind the balustrade;
The existing brick from the deteriorated knee walls, to be
reconstructed, shall be salvaged as much as possible and reused to
rebuild the walls. If the majority of the brick is unsalvageable, the
new walls shall be rebuilt in its current footprint and dimensions using
new brick to match the historic brick as closely as possible. Any new
brick and mortar shall match the existing brick in color, size, profile,
and texture;
Enlarged, dimensioned elevations of the porch elements, balustrades,
and knee walls shall be included in the permit plans;
Samples of the new brick, stone, and mortar shall be submitted to
Historic Preservation staff for review and approval prior to order and
installation;
The existing metal cladding over the eaves shall be removed to
investigate the condition of the original eaves. Should the original
building materials remain, the eaves shall be repaired; or, if beyond
repair, replaced in-kind to match the original design, dimensions, and
profiles. Details shall be submitted with the permit plans;
Proposed window and terrace door details; attachment details and
enlarged sections for the two new canopies; and paint stripping and
cleaning product specifications shall be submitted with the permit
drawings;
A building section through the new elevator and the elevator cut-sheets
and specifications shall be included in the permit plans to confirm that
the historic roofline at this location will not be altered;

Coach House:
10. The salvaged columns and millwork from the front elevation shall be
reinstalled on the coach house in their original locations. Should
Historic Preservation staff confirm that any of these elements are
deteriorated beyond repair, they may be replicated to match the
historic design, dimensions, appearance, and profiles;
11. The height of the new balustrade at the top of the coach house shall be
2’-0”-tall (as this area is not meant to be habitable) to match the
historic height of the balustrades on the second-floor of the house; and,
12. Cut sheets for the garage doors shall be submitted with the permit
application.

2.

5040 S. Greenwood
(Kenwood District – 4th Ward)

 Proposal:

Proposed alterations to the east façade of a historic coach house to create a
new opening for an 18-ft-wide garage door.

Action:

The Committee voted unanimously that, given that the size and location of
the existing garage doors limits the use of and access into the existing
coach house, and that the coach house is minimally visible from the public
right-of-way, the project with the following conditions would not have an
adverse effect on the significant historical and architectural features of the
landmark district and conditionally approved the project, subject to these
conditions and Historic Preservation staff review and approval:
1. As proposed, the two historic garage doors on the south façade and
its decorative corbelled lintel shall be retained in-place;
2. The face brick to be removed from the east façade to accommodate
the new garage door opening shall be salvaged and reused as
needed to infill areas surrounding the new garage door. The
existing east elevation drawing shall indicate the area of proposed
demolition, and the proposed east elevation drawing shall indicate
the areas where the replacement brick will need to be toothed in.
New mortar shall match the historic mortar in color, composition,
and joint profile; and,
3. Details of the decorative masonry surround for the new garage
door and cut sheets for the new 18’-0”-wide garage door, which
should be simple in design and incorporate recessed paneling, prior
to submitting for the permit application. The design of the door
should be further studied in consultation with staff as was
discussed at the PRC meeting.

3.

331 W. Menomonee
(Old Town Triangle District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed 1-story rear addition with rooftop deck and pergola projecting
6’-4” into the west side yard of an existing 2-story wood-frame cottage.

Action:

The Committee voted (2-1, John Baird against) that, given the relative size
of the addition, its location at the back of the home, and that it is partially
obscured by an existing 1-story addition, the project with the following
condition would not have an adverse effect on the significant historical
and architectural features of the landmark district and conditionally
approved the project subject to this condition, to be reviewed and
approved by Historic Preservation staff:

 1. The applicant shall further study the cladding of the rear addition (for
the portion facing the street) and propose an alternative to fiber-cement
panels.
The Committee was also assured by the applicant that the second floor
deck area, which projects into the west side yard, shall remain open and
unobstructed by plantings or other elements as depicted in the submitted
elevations.

4.

465 W. Cermak
(Cermak Road Bridge District – 25th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed adaptive reuse of 5-story, masonry, industrial loft building for
ground- and basement-level retail, three floors of hotel with 200 rooms,
and a large restaurant including ballroom space on the top (fifth) floor.
Exterior work includes a proposed roof-top addition to accommodate an
increased ceiling height for the ballroom, masonry repair, window and
storefront replacement, removal of fire escapes, a new skylight, and a new
curb-cut for hotel drop-off along Grove Street.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed, the existing historic water tank and its supporting
masonry base shall remain and be repaired as part of the project;
2. As part of the façade work, the masonry is to be repaired and repointed
as necessary, and the two existing fire escapes are proposed to be
removed. New mortar shall match the historic mortar in color, profile,
and composition. Any masonry cleaning method and product shall be
reviewed and approved by Historic Preservation staff as part of a
permit application prior to any work undertaken;
3. Existing and proposed window and storefront details, color, and finish
shall be included in the permit application plans;
4. In consideration of the significant depth of the sidewalk along Grove
Street, that this area is along the eastern edge of the landmark district
boundary, and that the street is not in its historic configuration (facing
away from the heart of the district), the curb-cut for the hotel drop-off
is approved as proposed;
5. The roof-top addition’s roofing and cladding materials shall be a dark
color in a non-reflective finish. Samples shall be reviewed and
approved by Historic Preservation staff prior to order and installation;
6. Any future canopy for a building entrance, signage, and exterior
lighting shall be reviewed and approved prior to order and installation.
Attachment details, fixture cut sheets, and material color/finishes shall
be included as part of a permit application; and,
7. Prior to any interior demolition of the building’s structural components

 for the hotel atrium space, a report by a licensed structural engineer,
which shall include any necessary recommendations for protection and
sequencing to ensure the stability of the building during and after
construction, shall be submitted to Historic Preservation staff for
review and approval.
