Funding Source: Original Contract – ERP Capital Projects Fund (General Fund)
Jeanelle Greene, Department of Information Technology and Jack Rhyne, Project Manager, InFor,
presented. Dale Miller indicated his support for this request to keep the Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) project on schedule and asked if another change order related to financial components has been
negotiated with InFor; asked about the anticipated timeline to reach an agreement for that change order;
and asked when the next “go live” date will be.

 Nan Baker asked what is being implemented through these change orders and what would be delayed if
these change orders did not get approved; asked if shifting funds will diminish other funding needed to
qualify for the workforce management training; asked where the funding for the workforce management
training is coming from; asked if there is any concern of running out of funds because the training piece
was larger than expected and asked whether the IPA workshop is related to this training and why this
contract ends in 2021 when completion is anticipated to occur sooner.
Dennis Kennedy asked how payment on these change orders will occur in connection with the agreedupon installment payment schedule presented to County Council last November, and if they will occur
outside of that payment schedule and be invoiced separately. Mr. Kennedy clarified that these change
orders are not $0 impact and that the County will be paying for these change orders; and asked if the
original payment schedule included these payments.
Ms. Baker also asked for clarification on the use of the 99 Fund and how much remains in that fund; and
asked if there are other funds similar to the 99 Fund.
Mr. Miller asked for confirmation that the 99 Fund is basically a contingency fund and asked what happens
to unused funds.
Kahlil Seren asked what was the process by which the amount for the 99 Fund was determined and how
much of the fund is expected to be used.
Dale Miller motioned to approve the item; Michael Dever seconded. Item BC2019-466 was unanimously
approved.
The following item was amended to remove the verbiage County-owned.
BC2019-467
Department of Public Safety and Justice Services, recommending an award on RQ45476 to Remotec Inc.

6/16/2020.
Funding Source: General Fund
Mary Beth Vaughn, Department of Public Safety and Justice Services, presented. Nan Baker asked why
the General Fund is being used rather than grant, State or Federal funds; and asked who will be receiving
training. Michael Dever asked where the Andros F6A robots will be housed. Dennis Kennedy motioned to
approve the item; Michael Dever seconded. Item BC2019-467 was unanimously approved as amended.

provide free tax preparation assistance to low and moderate-Income individuals and families for the
period 7/1/2019 – 6/30/2020.
Funding Source: Temporary Assistance to Needy Families Fund
Robert Math, Cuyahoga Job and Family Services, presented. Nan Baker asked for clarification on the sole
source process. Lenora Lockett explained that the sole source process is based on specific needs of the
department and a process including a public posting to solicit responses to services being sought; stated
that the vendor must provide a sole source affidavit stating that no other vendor can provide services.
Ms. Lockett also acknowledged that the market can change at any time, which is why the process must
be conducted every time a new contract is required. Ms. Baker recommended that a process should be
followed next time to determine whether this service is still considered sole source. Dale Miller asked if
funding, either directly or indirectly, is for staff expenses or more for direct services. Dennis Kennedy
commented that the cost increased from the prior year’s contracts since this vendor was identified as a
sole source provider. Kahlil Seren asked for clarification regarding the Earned Income Tax Credit serving
as an entry point for financial education and asset development, as stated in briefing materials and asked
if there is any follow up with clients on how the funds are used. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the
item; Michael Dever seconded. Item BC2019-468 was unanimously approved as amended.
BC2019-469

Funding Source: 50% Special Revenue Fund – (Certified Professional Training) and 50% Commissary Funds
Tanisha Gates and Sergeant O’Conner, Sheriff’s Department, presented. Kahlil Seren said he does not
want to contribute to a situation where staff are being trained to react in circumstances where their
response could have negative consequences, that may not be necessary and asked if real world scenarios
are used as a guide when selecting immersive training methods, which may not be wholly healthy to the
community. Michael Dever asked where the simulator will be housed. Dennis Kennedy motioned to
approve the item; Michael Dever seconded. Item BC2019-471 was unanimously approved.

The following item was amended to include the scope expansion.
BC2019-472

Funding Source: Commissary Funds
Brandy Carney, Department of Public Safety and Justice Services, presented. Dale Miller asked how many
non-law enforcement employees are at the Sheriff’s Department. Dennis Kennedy asked for clarification
on the eligible use of Commissary Funds for this amendment. Nan Baker asked if the additional site visit
has taken place and if this will be the final visit. Dale Miller commented that while the American
Correctional Association site visits are beneficial, the County should rely on internal assessments and
asked what process is in place to gather information and communicate the state of the conditions at the
Jail to Sheriff’s officials; and stated that additional discussions on this matter, separate from this request,
will be necessary. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Michael Dever seconded. Item BC2019472 was unanimously approved as amended.
