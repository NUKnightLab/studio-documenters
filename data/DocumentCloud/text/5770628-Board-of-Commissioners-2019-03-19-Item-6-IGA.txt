 BACKGROUND
CHA’s Admissions and Occupancy Policy (“ACOP”) provides a Grievance Procedure for tenants
whose occupancy rights are terminated for various violations of HUD regulations. The
Grievance Procedure does not extend to Tenants terminated because of criminal violations.
Under the Grievance Procedure, a tenant’s grievance is initially heard by CHA’s Private Property
Manager on an informal basis. If the tenant is dissatisfied with the outcome, that tenant has
a right to file for a formal grievance hearing. Prior to 2004, attorneys in the Office of the
General Counsel acted as the administrative hearing officers to hear the tenants’ grievances
and adjudicated tenants’ formal grievances. CHA amended its Grievance Procedure in the late
part of 2003 requiring administrative hearings.
DoAH’s function is to provide administrative hearings for the City. Therefore, it was in a
unique position to assist the CHA with this particular governmental service, although the City
Council had to pass an ordinance in 2004 allowing DoAH to hold administrative hearings on
behalf of the CHA. This will be the fourth IGA with DoAH since 2004 and will allow the CHA
to continue its formal Grievance Procedure that was implemented in 2004, utilizing DoAH’s
administrative hearing officers. Specifically, the IGA continues to allow CHA residents to
participate in formal grievance hearings before independent hearing officers at DoAH’s offices.
The IGA utilizes DoAH’s existing administrative procedures to schedule and hold the hearings as
well as report the results to CHA and residents.
Under previous IGAs with DoAH, hearing officers have been trained regarding applicable HUD
regulations, federal statutes, and CHA policies and procedures, including but not limited to, the
CHA’s amended Resident’s Grievance Procedure and the CHA Leaseholder Housing Choice
and Relocation Rights Contract 10/1/99. The CHA forwards residents’ requests for formal
hearings to DoAH. DoAH appoints a hearing officer to adjudicate each case based on the
officers’ workload and availability. The hearing officer schedules and holds the formal hearing
within a specified timeframe and notifies the parties of the time and location for the hearing, as
outlined in the amended Grievance Procedure. If requested by the resident, DoAH provides
reasonable accommodations to persons with disabilities. This may include holding hearings in
an alternative location and/or providing all materials and notices in an accessible format. After
the hearing, the hearing officer prepares a decision and a written summary of the hearing
and sends it to the appropriate parties, also as outlined in the amended Grievance
Procedure.
The average cost of an administrative hearing through DoAH has been approximately $375 based
on five (5) hours for the hearing officer at $60.00 per hour plus a $75.00 filing fee for each case.
Over the past 5 years, CHA has averaged approximately 40 ‐ 60 formal grievance hearings with
DoAH per year.
