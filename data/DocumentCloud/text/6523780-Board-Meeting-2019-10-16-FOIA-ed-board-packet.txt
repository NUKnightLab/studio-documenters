compared to September 2018.

*The ILCC implemented a ?credit card payment? option for all online renewals on 08104I2016. Prior to 0810412016 the
only payment option our licensees had when renewing their liquor licenses online was the electronic debit option.
Now our licensees can pay with a credit card- credit cards that are accepted are: MasterCard, Discover. American
Express or Visa. We had received feedback from our licensees infoming us that one of the reasons they were not
utilizing the online renewal option was because they couldn't pay with a credit card. We began to research our
options and we worked with IDOR IT and the Treasurer's Of?ce to implement this new payment option for our
licensees.

During the month of September 2019 (09l01l2019-09i3012019) we had collected $244,200.00 in licensing renewal
fees that were paid by our licensees using the online credit card payment option compared to $231,225.00 thatwas
collected in September 2018. Note: Effective 0811512019 we converted to a new credit card payment vendor
"JetPay' for all of our Point of Sale credit card transactions. There is a convenience fee for all credit card transactions
that the credit card companies charge and under JetPay the fee for using a credit card is the greater of 2.3% or 
The fee will always be at least $1 except for transactions over $43.48 the fee will be 2.3 percent.

32234: LCC - H32675 - Distiller Pub license, Class 1IC ass 2 Distiller License. Warehouse Permit
HB2675- This bill seeks to provide craft distillers with parity with a Brewers (3C). Class 1 Brewers (3Y) and Class 2 Brewers
(3C). the bill will separate the "craft distiller" 3X license to a Class 1 Distiller and 'Class 2 craft distiller:. This bill also creates
a "distilling pub" license and a "craft distiller warehouse permit". Business rules are pending and will be attached to SQR in
the upcoming days.

New license classes will be:

3A- existing license already in place ?Distiller"- fee change will be- $5.000 (new license. mail in. or in person) $4.000- online
6Y license pre?x for a Class 1 Brewer- $75 (new license, mail in. or in person) $50- online

1X license pre?x for a Distiller Pub- $1.500(new license, mail in. or in person) $1 .200- online

We need to keep the license history for the 3X licenses which are now our craft distiller licenses but eventually those will be
phased out. The licensing structure will be similar license structure that is now in place for
Brewers- the distiller structure will be:

speci?c case these payments- the payment right now just posts- licensees cannot pay ?nes online right now.

23957: LCC - Enhancements to Online Brand Registration Procesleunctionality
We would like to make some changeslupdates to the online brand registration process- one enhancement would be to allow
multiple registrations in one entry- licensee can enter severai registrations in one entry instead of just doing one single
registration at one time submitting that entry and then going back in and entering another entry.

29699: LCC - Legal Indicator phone number change

We are needing the phone changed on the LCC Legal Indicator. Currently it has 312-814-2604. Must be changed to 312-

32331: LCC - Update Pre-Licensing Site Inspection Case doc

Due to the impending passage of H32675, the current Craft Distiller license will be split into class 1 craft distiller and class 2
craft distiller. The bill also creates the distilling pub As a result, we need to update the case doc and tab headers. While
updating the doc, we would like to add a couple of ?elds on a few of the tabs. have attached updated ?paper" versions of
the different "tabs." The form title should match the tab header title.

30974: LCC - Modify LCCG BB lette LOPMJ

Our current letter template has the signature of an employee that is no longer employed by We need to modify
that signature block and a few minor tweaks the letter.

We would like to make the signature block more generic to eliminate or greatly reduce the modi?cation of this letter when
personnel change. We would request that the title header of the letter ("Underage Compliance") be modi?ed to "Underage
Compliance Check - We would also request that the phrase in bold type in the ?rst paragraph refused to sell
alcoholic beverages to a minor be put in all caps. We are looking for ways to make it stand out to the licensee that they
successfully passed an underage compliance check.

28301: LCC - Summary of Inspection letter 

In an effort to go paperless with our inspections. we need to have an electronic method of noti?cation for our licensees. We
currently have an Option to export our closed cases to a Case Export"). That document would be a good start for
this letter. I have attached a clean version and a marked up version of that to this SQR.

In order to provide the licensee with a copy of the inspection report. we would like this letter to be generated and published
to their MyTax account. Then. MyTax would send them a noti?cation email that they have a Liquor Inspection available for
review. We would NOT want the inspection report sent directly to the email(s) on file; however. we would like the email to be
sent to all emails associated with the MyTax login(s) AND the email listed on the LCC contact in GenTax.

29824: LCC - Licensing Hold Indicator Customer Level

MEMORANDUM

TO: Chimaobi Enyia, Executive Director
FROM: Pam Paziotopoulos, General Counsel
DATE: October 7, 2019

SUBJECT: Legal Report

ACCOMPLISHMENTS

DISPOSITIONS:

During the month of September 2019, we disposed of 49 cases which had been assigned to our
legal division. This includes cases which had Pre-Disciplinary Conferences and Sale of Alcohol
to Minor hearings.

PRE-DISCIPLINARY CONFERENCES:
We held 8 pre-disciplinary conferences in September 2019. PDCs will be held in Chicago and
Spring?eld, October 29111 and 30th.

SALE OF ALCOHOL T0 MINORS:

We held a total of zero Sale of Alcohol to Minor Settlement Conferences during September
2019. SAMs will be held in Chicago and Spring?eld, October 29th and 30th. There are two cases
which require a hearing. We are waiting on the Commissioners regarding scheduling those cases.

LEGAL HANDBOOK:
We are in the process of ?nal formatting for our legal section of the handbook.

APPEALS:

We resolved two appeals cases during the month of September 2019. Additionally, we held the
?rst Appeals Status Hearing date. The Status Hearings were successful. We were able to
schedule two appeals for hearing in October (October 2, 2019 and October 16, 2019). We will
hold another status hearing on October 16, 2019. We hope to be able to schedule several more
hearings at that date.

LEGAL RESEARCH:

We continue to assist the Attorney General?s of?ce in the Lebamoff case.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:

We respond to an average of 20 technical assistance inquiries per day. These arrive via phone
call, e-mail, and the website. Depending on the nature of the inquiry we will provide the legal
information regarding the law including statutory citation. When possible, we will e-mail a
response. Many of these calls can take 10 minutes or more to resolve as they involve interpreting
law and facts. We also provide guidance to the Licensing Division regarding legal issues that
arise in this arena.

REFER TO LEGAL:

We have made signi?cant progress in resolving outstanding refer to legal cases. There are
currently 104 legal cases open. Of these cases, there are nine cases designated as high cases.
There are 94 designated as medium cases. The medium cases include 40 scheduled SAM cases
and 18 scheduled PDCs. Due to the low caseload of SAM and PDC cases, we pushed back
holding SAM settlement conferences and PDCs until October.

FOIA:

With our separation from the Department of Revenue, the Legal Division has been processing
and responding to Freedom of Information Act requests. During September 2019, we responded
to 18 FOIA requests.

PROBLEMS

We are short staffed. With additional staff we could resolve additional cases and begin the
process of converting the Trade Practice Protocols into Rules and dra?ing the appropriate
legislation to amend the Liquor Control Act.

PROPOSAL FOR DECISION

 

Appearances:

Louis Lee Auxier, appeared on behalf of the Illinois Department of Revenue; Owner Krunal Patel
appeared on behalf of the Licensee.

The matter was heard on October 3, 2019 in Spring?eld, Illinois. Following the submission of all
evidence, I ?nd that the Licensee has violated 235 ILCS of the Illinois Liquor Control Act and
recommend the revocation of the liquor license. In support thereof, the following ?Findings of Fact? and
?Conclusions of Law? are made.

Findings of Fact:
1. The Department of Revenue?s (Department) representative testi?ed that the Licensee failed to pay

Sales/Use Tax for the periods of May and June 2019 in the aggregate amount of $6,032.71.

Page 1 of 3

2. The Department?s testimony was corroborated by a ?Taxpayer Statement? admitted into evidence as
a business record kept in the normal course of the Department?s business. Department Exhibit 1.

3. Licensee did not dispute the charges contained in the Taxpayer Statement or Department?s testimony.

4. Licensee has had 87 insuf?cient funds payments and has been cited to appear for tax violations on three
previous occasions. The Licensee has also defaulted twice on a previous payment plan.

Conclusions of Law:
Section 6-3 of the Illinois Liquor Control Act states:

In addition to other grounds speci?ed in this Act, the State Commission or the local liquor
control commissioner, on complaint of the Department, shall re?ise the issuance or renewal of
a license, or suspend or revoke the license, of any person, for any of the following violations
of any tax Act administered by the Department:

Failure to make a tax return.

The ?ling of a fraudulent return.

Failure to pay all or part of any tax or penalty ?nally determined to be due.

Failure to keep books and records.

Failure to secure and display a certi?cate or sub-certi?cates of registration, if required.
Willful violation of any rule or regulation of the Department relating to the administration
and enforcement of tax liability.



Upon receiving notice from the Department that a violation of any of items 1 through 6 of
subsection have been corrected or otherwise resolved to the Department's satisfaction, the
Commission may vacate an Order of Revocation.

235 ILCS 5e"6-3.

Under the mandate of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, the Commission shall ?refuse the issuance
or renewal of a license, or suspend or revoke the license,? if a Licensee fails to pay ?any tax? or ?make a
tax return.? 235 ILCS 5f6-3 (emphasis added). On the basis of the testimony of the Department
representative which was corroborated by documentary evidence, the Licensee failed ?to pay all or part of
any tax or penalty ?nally determined to be due? by the Department. 235 ILCS The Licensee
did not offer evidence to contest the charges of the Department which leads me to conclude that the

Department did not err in the assessment of liability. The Licensee is found to have committed violations

of Section 6-3 of the Liquor Control Act.

Licensee has had 87 insuf?cient funds payments and has been cited to appear for tax violations on
three previous occasions. The Licensee has also defaulted twice on a previous payment plan.

For the reasons stated herein and under the authority of the Illinois Liquor Control Act, it is
recommended the license be REVOKED EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY. Should the Licensee come into
compliance after the service of this order, the Order of Revocation shall be vacated in accordance with 235
ILCS of the Act.
