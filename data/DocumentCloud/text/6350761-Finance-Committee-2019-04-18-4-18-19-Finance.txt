 III. Action Items
B.

Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)

The Committee discussed request number 1, which is a grant award for the Cook County Health Start Initiative.
This initiative aims to help eliminate health disparities in Cook County by providing case management support for
African American women aged 20-35 at risk for poor birth outcomes, along with their infants and father/partner
in the targeted project area. In response to a question regarding outcome measures, Ms. Reyes-Nash indicated
that she will provide a copy of the performance monitoring of the grant that is reported monthly to the Health
Resources and Services Administration at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Director
Richardson-Lowry stated that, while she supports the notion of the grant’s purpose, she cautioned that, as this is
the third largest county health system in the nation, with one of the largest populations in this affected area, the
grant funding is a small amount comparatively. Leveraging that funding will be a business imperative; she is
hoping to hear through strategic planning and other avenues how these and other resources will be leveraged. The
problem is clearly systemic, but this organization is in the best position, perhaps more than any other hospital
system in the City, to address this. She is looking for something bigger, broader, comprehensive and systemic,
that engages every aspect of this system.
Director Munar, seconded by Director Richardson-Lowry, moved the approval of
request numbers 1 through 18, subject to completion of review by Contract
Compliance, where appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

A. Strategic planning discussion (continued)

− Definitions
− CCH trends Net Capital Assets, Additions and Depreciation Expenses
− Cook County Real Estate Asset Strategic Alignment Plan (REASRP)
− Capital Assets Purchases FY2016 – 2018

− 2019 Credit Agencies Outlook and Common Themes
− FY2020 Capital Budget Planning Process
− FY2020-2022 Potential Funding Sources
Additional information was provided by Mr. Akpan regarding the financing of capital equipment through the
County’s capital plan. The County programs CCH needs into their bond issuance and, through the economies of
scale and engaging the bond industry as the County of Cook, CCH gets their financing rate within the 4-5% range.
That rate is definitely better than that using other financing vehicles. Irrespective of how the County funds CCH,
that debt ultimately comes to CCH books as a charge. Going forward, increasingly CCH uses its operational
dollars to buy capital equipment. Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, noted that CCH used to be the
beneficiary of a separate capital budget line approved by the County Board; it was given to CCH parallel to its
operating budget. That capital budget line in 2015, but it used to be a substantial source of funding.
Director Richardson-Lowry inquired regarding the outlook/comments referenced from the credit rating agency
Standard & Poor’s; she inquired whether their outlook ever deviated for not-for-profits. Mr. Akpan responded that
he will check and provide the response through the Chair.

 VI. Recommendations, Discussion / Information Item
A. Strategic planning discussion (continued)
Following the review and discussion of the information, Director Richardson-Lowry stated for the record that, as
Stroger Hospital has been perceived as the hub for the System, she is encouraging a little more substance and
detail to be built into this with respect to the plan, and more alignment from a strategic planning standpoint. From
an operational imperative standpoint, typically there are connecting points, and there is a series of cascades
associated with those connecting points; then it leads to what is happening with respect to how Stroger Hospital is
relating to nursing, clinical, and other areas. Additionally, as an operational imperative, there is always going to
be a financial impact, so that information should be included. Director Driscoll indicated that she is interested in
seeing information on how CCH is planning to grow its diagnostic services - how they will be designed, which
services will be chosen, and where they will be located.

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
This is a request to accept a new grant award for the Healthy Start Initiative, Eliminating Racial/Ethnic Disparities.

The Cook County Healthy Start Initiative (CCHSI) project aims to help eliminate perinatal health disparities in Cook
County by providing case management support for African American women aged 20-35 at risk for poor birth
outcomes, along with their infants and father/partners in the targeted project area, urban communities within Cook
County, Illinois. The program will work to identify and recruit African American women into early and adequate
prenatal care, reduce the percentage of low birth weight and preterm infants, and link participants to the network of

services they need.

By strengthening CCH's prenatal health delivery system and establishing a new model of comprehensive prenatal
health care services across points of entry, we aim to ameliorate the disparate outcomes for high-risk pregnant
African American women that result in maternal and infant mortality, low-birth weight, and pro-term births.

Re: 12?Month Purchase of Reinsurance for CountyCare Health Plan 

Since the inception of CountyCare, Cook County Health (CCH) has purchased reinsurance to
offset the risk of its high?cost members. initially, reinsurance was focused only on members who
received transplant services. Beginning in 2015, general stop-loss reinsurance was secured with a
threshold of $750,000 per member. Claims costs incurred in excess of that amount are reimbursed
to CCH. Coverage is priced on a PMPM basis by population type (eg. FHP, SPD, ACA Adults).

The CCH policy is issued under a County-wide insurance brokerage contract with Alliance
Insurance Services, managed by the County?s Of?ce of Risk Management.

CCH recommends entering a stop-loss policy coverage for twelve months, through December 31,
2019. Based on the bids submitted, and pricing and risk analysis, the recommended policy would
increase the per member reinsurance deductible from $750,000 to $1,000,000. Terms will include:

0 $1,000,000 per member deductible
. 90% reinsurance once deductible is met; $2 million maximum benefit

 

   

- Costs are calculated at 100% of Medicaid for non-CCH provi rsW?R? 
(comparable to standard Medicaid rates) for services provide at I

• Capital assets are defined by CCH as assets with initial, individual costs of $5,000 or more and with
estimated time benefit beyond one year.
• Depreciation is the allocation of the cost of a capital asset over the estimated useful life of each class of
assets. Estimated useful life is as follows;
• Land Improvements

5-25 years

• Buildings

20-40-years

• Building Improvements

capital projects through operating budgets.
• Capital budgeting aims to achieve a prudent balancing of legacy debt obligations, operating budget priorities ,
and debt service costs.

• In FY2019, the County proposed;
• $274.9M for Capital Improvement Program (CIP) - CCH debt funded portion $104.3M
• $84.9M for Transportation & Highways

 Environmental Scan of Market, Best Practices and Trends
2017 Credit Ratings Agencies Common Themes
• Emergence of non-traditional entrants looking to ‘disrupt’ healthcare delivery
• Payor mix shifts from commercial plans to government payors

• Continuing pressure on hospitals and health systems balance sheets with increasing bad debts, constrained
profitability, operating margin and operating cash flow
o Revenue growth will be constrained by low patient volume growth and higher bad debt as co-pays and deductibles rise
o Expense growth challenges and need for management focus on cost efficiency measures

• 340B risks and other drug price increases
• Political risks including challenges and/or administrative changes to Affordable Care Act
• Continuing mergers, acquisitions and consolidation activities
