 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
August 5, 2010
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on July 1, at 9:30 a.m. The meeting was held at 33 N.
LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

John Baird (attended and voted for items 7 and 8 only)
Phyllis Ellin
Edward Torrez
Ernest Wong

Staff:

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Historic Preservation Division, Department
of Zoning and Land Use Planning
Dijana Cuvalo
Cynthia Roubik
Beth Johnson
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

210 S. Canal
(Union Station – 2nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed repair of 8 historic entrance doors, and in-kind replacement of
80 historic entrance doors

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. Shop drawings for the replacement doors shall be reviewed and
approved by Historic Preservation staff prior to order and installation;
2. As proposed, the historic door push bars, decorative pulls, and
escutcheon plates will be refurbished and reinstalled to match the
historic condition;
3. The new doors shall have a wood- grain pattern and finish to match the
historic doors and the replacement hardware shall be finished to match
the historic bronze finish. Samples of new hardware finish and new
door grain/finish shall be submitted to Historic Preservation staff for
review and approval prior to order and installation; and,
4. Historic Preservation staff shall be contacted to review and approve a
mock up of the proposed assembly of restored and new hardware prior
to order and installation.

2.

417 S. Dearborn

 (Plymouth Building - Proposed Landmark – 2nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed masonry façade repairs including reconstructing the exterior
cladding on the top two floors of the Plymouth Court elevation, cast-iron
repairs, new windows, new storefronts, a new accessible Dearborn Street
(front) entry, a new mechanical penthouse, a 50% vegetative ‘green’ roof,
and other work.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
Exterior Facade Alterations:
1. As proposed, the existing 5”-tall step at the Dearborn Street front
entry may be eliminated and a ramp installed to accommodate a
more ADA-compliant entrance. No change is proposed to the
location of the entry doors; further recessing the doors beyond their
historic location and ornamental surround would potentially
adversely affect an important architectural feature and should be
avoided if at all possible;
2. The existing non-historic “Plymouth Building” pin lettering above
the main entrance on Dearborn Street may be removed, and the
existing terra-cotta transom shall be repaired or replaced with
glass- fiber-reinforced-concrete as needed;
3. The limestone headers above the windows at the 10th floor on the
west elevation may be removed, salvaged, stained to match the
existing terra cotta, and reinstalled in the same location. Historic
Preservation staff shall review and approve the stain product
information as part of the permit application;
4. The wood windows on the entire building will be replaced with
new aluminum windows. The exterior profiles of the new
windows shall, as possible, be modified to better match the historic
depth from the wood sash to the face of the glass. Enlarged
existing and proposed details of the typical window heads and sills,
as well as the vertical dividers for the Chicago-style windows shall
be reviewed and approved by the Historic Preservation staff with
the permit applications;
More Information:
5. Existing and proposed details of the storefront and entry doors
showing the relationship of the historic terra cotta and cast iron
framework to remain, and how the new elements will be
attached/inserted, shall be included in the permit plans for Historic
Preservation staff review and approval. The new aluminum entry
doors shall match the existing historic doors in size, shape, design,
and configuration;

 6. Masonry and cast- iron cleaning specifications and their Material
Safety Data Sheets shall be included in the permit application for
Historic Preservation review and approval;
7. The contractor shall provide a detailed description of the proposed
repair work to the 2-story cast iron portion of the façade, including
means and methods, for Historic Preservation staff review and
approval as part of the permit application. As proposed, the
missing portion of the cast- iron cornice on Plymouth Court may be
replaced to match the size and shape of the existing cornice, but
without replicating the decorative relief in-kind;
8. Any exterior lighting and signage details shall be reviewed and
approved by Historic Preservation staff prior to order and
installation; and,
Samples:
9. Cleaned samples of original terra cotta and proposed replacement

Proposal:

Proposed exterior and interior rehabilitation of the existing 13-story
building for multi- unit residential and related uses, including one-story
garage addition to the south of the building.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed, the project scope includes removal of the semi-circular
forecourt for excavation of a new basement parking area. The semicircular drive and landscaped forecourt is to be rebuilt in the same
location, and to the same grade and elevation; and the historic terracotta terrace walls, balustrade and cast- metal porte cochere are to be
retained in place and protected during construction. Additional details
and information shall be submitted for Historic Preservation staff
review and approval as part of the permit plans, including a report and
drawings by a licensed structural engineer addressing how the historic
features will be supported, braced and protected, in-situ, during the

facades of the building. The exterior profiles of the proposed
aluminum vertical mullions of these windows shall be modified to
more closely match, as possible, the profiles of the steel sash (i.e., as
shown, the 6” wide mullions have a “flat” exterior profile that shall be
modified to provide some depth and articulation to better match the
historic profiles). A complete set of final, revised window details shall
be reviewed and approved by the Historic Preservation staff with the
permit application;
5. As proposed, a new roof top deck and railings are to be in a location
and of a size to not be visible from the street. Historic Preservation

(Armitage-Halsted District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed removal of a non- historic staircase, front entry and masonry wall
and replacement with a new masonry and limestone straight-run stair and
new recessed entry with double-doors and a transom window.

Action:

542 W. Grant
(Mid-North District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed revision to previously-approved partial demolition and
reconstruction of portions of exterior walls of an existing building as part
of conversion into a single-family residence which triggers the “40%demolition” provisions and the review and approval of the City Council,
in accordance with Section 2-120-825 of the Municipal Code.v

Action:

The Committee voted unanimously:
a) Given the deteriorated conditions of the west exterior wall of the front
one-story portion of the building and the west and north ground floor
walls of the rear 3-story portion of the historic building, the proposed
demolition and reconstruction of these walls, subject to these
conditions of approval, conforms with the Commission’s standards
and criteria, including the criterion that “the work will replace the
significant historical or architectural feature where the original feature
is deteriorated beyond reasonable methods of repair, and the
replacement feature is in kind” pursuant to Article III, Section G3 of
the Commission’s Rules and Regulations;
b) The revision to the previously approved partial demolition and
reconstruction of the existing building triggers the “40%-demolition”
provisions and recommended that the Commission recommend to the
City Council approval of the project, in accordance with Section 2120-825 of the Municipal Code; and,
c) The revised project, with the following condition, therefore will not
constitute an adverse effect on the significant historical or architectural
features of the landmark district and conditionally approved the
project, subject to this condition and contingent upon the approval of
the City Council of the partial demolition:
1. The exterior (alley) side of the reconstructed wall shall be clad
in brick salvaged from the demolition of this wall to the extent
possible. Should additional brick be required, the new brick
shall be salvaged Chicago common brick matching the size,
color and texture of the existing brick.
The Permit Review Committee also directed the Historic Preservation
staff to further investigate and confirm that the west and north walls of the
rear 3-story portion of the building have been reconstructed in their
original and approved location.
The Permit Review Committee reported on the revised project at the

 regular meeting of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks that followed
and recommended approval to the full Commission. The Commission on
Chicago Landmarks conditionally approved permit application
#100349385, contingent upon the City Council approval of the proposed
partial demolition and the above-stated Condition C(1).
