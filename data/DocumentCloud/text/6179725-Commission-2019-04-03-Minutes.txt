3. 2019 February Minutes
This item was tabled as minutes were not available.
4. 2017 vs. 2018 Audit Review
Amy Pooley from The ACT Group presented the audit that has been prepared for the
City of Chicago. Unfortunately, page 5 was missing from the document. There is one
finding that some categories went over budget in 2018. We realized that Amy hadn’t
received the budget revision that the commission approved in December 2018. Sandi
will send it to her.
MOTION: (Wally/Irene) To approve the audit as presented once page 5 is added and
adjustments are made due to the budget revision. Unanimously approved.
5. 2019 Events Proposals / Budget
Glenwood Sunday Market and Glenwood Avenue Arts Festival presented proposals to
reinstate their sponsorships to 2017 levels. The conversation moved to the current
budget and snow removal. Commission requested a proposal from RPBA regarding
digital management.
MOTION: (Wally/Nick) To not renew the Cleanstreet contract for snow removal once it
expires in April 2019. Unanimously approved.
MOTION: (Wally/Al) To increase the sponsorship of the Glenwood Sunday Market from
$8,000 to $16,000 for 2019. Unanimously approved.
MOTION: (Wally/Nick) To increase the sponsorship of the Glenwood Avenue Arts
Festival from $5,000 to $10,000 for 2019. Unanimously approved.

7. Old Business
Al reiterated that the hourly amount being charged for time spent on the SSA my RPBA’s
Marketing & Events Manager is too high and should be more reflective of actual salary
& fringe. Sandi will create a proposal for the June meeting.
8. New Business
Pride North – Dorothy asked what we knew about Pride North being expanded to two
days. This was discussed briefly as well as the new Police Captain in the 24th District and
the new requirements for festivals, including vehicle proof barricades.
