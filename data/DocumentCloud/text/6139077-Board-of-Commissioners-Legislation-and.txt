CALLING UPON THE GOVERNOR TO VETO VIDEO POKER
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to
Article VII, Section 6 (a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may
exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and
affairs; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board recognizes the tremendous economic
challenges facing the State of Illinois and the nation, we also recognize that there
has to be revenue in order to meet essential challenges like capital development
and improvements in order to ensure the safety and welfare of the people we
represent; and
WHEREAS, we feel that the proposed revenue projection from video poker does
not provide a solid revenue stream for capital bonds proposed in the State
budget; and
WHEREAS, the proposed Video Poker Bill which does not fall under the purview
of regulations and monitoring of the Illinois Gaming Act raises serious questions
as to the fiscal impact upon local units of government to enforce any unlawful
acts or behavior rising out of the operation or customers utilization of such
gaming machines; and
