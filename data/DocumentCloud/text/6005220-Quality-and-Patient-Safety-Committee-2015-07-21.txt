Report from Chief Quality Officer

A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
Dr. Krishna Das, Chief Quality Officer, stated that there were no new updates to provide regarding regulatory and
accreditation matters. Staff continue their preparations for the full accreditation survey by The Joint Commission
(TJC) at Stroger Hospital; the survey will occur anytime between now and November.

B. Metrics (Attachment #1)
Dr. Das reviewed the presentation on Metrics. The Committee discussed the information.
With regard to the ongoing project that addresses Operating Room efficiencies, Director Lerner asked when the
team responsible for the project will be able to come to this Committee and make a presentation. Dr. Das
indicated that the plan is for this to be presented in September.
Board Chairman Hammock noted that there is a difference in the data between the Board summary page and the
other data; the numbers do not quite seem to track. Dr. Das stated that she will look into that question and
follow up with a response.

Report from Chief Quality Officer

B. Metrics (continued)
During the discussion of the data on Patient Satisfaction regarding cleanliness, Board Chairman Hammock
asked whether the administration has identified the particular aspects of cleanliness about which the patients are
commenting. Dr. Das responded that, of the three (3) questions relating to the hospital environment, there is
one (1) question regarding cleanliness. There have not been any specific locations identified, such as
bathrooms, hallways, or general areas; the administration reads the comments provided by patients, and it
involves all of the above. Director Lerner stated that, from his experience, it can be quite revealing and
insightful to periodically do a data dump of all the open ended comments and send them to the Board Members
for review; this could provide some ideas in response to the question on cleanliness.
C. Report – CORE Center / HIV Care (Attachment #2)
Dr. David Barker, Medical Director of the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center of Cook County, provided an
overview of the presentation, which included information on the following subjects: CORE Quality Plan; CORE
Patient Satisfaction Survey; CORE Return to Care Survey; CORE Outreach Efforts; Public Health Approach;
Comparisons of HIV Treatment Cascades; Screening Effectiveness in CCHHS; Maintaining Early Access at
CORE; Linkage to Care; Retained/Engaged in Care at CORE; Virologic Suppression Among those Engaged in
Care; 2014 CORE Performance Measures; CCHHS-Wide HIV Programs; and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis. The
Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the information regarding HIV testing at CCHHS, Dr. Barker noted that, in 2011, a
pop-up reminder rule about HIV testing was instituted in the electronic medical record. This led to a big
increase in testing in 2012 and 2013; however, in 2014, a substantial decline in testing was seen. In some cases,
the patient will refuse the test, or the staff is unable to get the patient’s consent (example: trauma cases). In
order to not test someone, one has to actively turn off the pop-up window. He noted that, at Stroger Hospital’s
Emergency Room, one-third of the patients have their blood tests ordered by the nurses at the front end, as a
protocol. The administration needs to work on getting the pop-up window to occur at that point, and also to get
it in all of the nurses’ protocol orders.
D. Report – Illinois Surgical Quality Improvement Collaborative (ISQIC) (Attachment #3)
Dr. Claudia Fegan, Executive Medical Director/Medical Director-Stroger, provided an introduction to the
subject. Dr. Mark A. Wille, Attending Physician (Urology) at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County,
provided an overview of the report on the Illinois Surgical Quality Improvement Collaborative (ISQIC).
Included in the presentation was information on the following subjects: Overview of ISQIC; Objective;
Hospitals Involved; Responsibilities of CCHHS; ISQIC Team; Key Features; Comparative Reports; Cost
Savings/ Return on Investment; Example of Successful Surgical Quality Collaboratives; Resources to Facilitate
Improvement; Funding; and Accomplishments to Date. The Committee reviewed and discussed the report.

 Public Health Approach
• CORE is by far largest single provider and CCHHS largest
system.
• Promote widespread routine testing for HIV in CCHHS
and partners – down to provider level?
• Maintain easy Access to HIV Clinics
• Outreach to newly diagnosed, linkage to care (affected
by change in CDPH model for Outreach vs. EIS)
• Evolution to Patient Centered Medical Home to
improve retention in Care
• Measure virologic suppression as community viral load
and provider specific outcome.
14

 WHO (proposed) Ambitious
approach for 2020 is 90/90/90
• 90% of people with HIV have been diagnosed
• 90% of those are in care
• 90% of those in care are suppressed
• In CCHHS we are at 86%+ dx’d (estimated)
• Of those 78% are engaged in Care
• Of those 86% are suppressed

 Screening Effectiveness in CCHHS
• Why did testing decline in 2014?
– Providers burned out on testing?
– Higher proportion of patients tested in past 2 years
(reaching saturation)?
• Lab based QA
– Total patients who had at least one blood test done in
2012 and 2014 per care venue within CCHHS (e.g. ER)
– %who had HIV test in prior 2 years (2010-2011 and 20122013)
– %who had test done this encounter
– %known to be HIV positive
• This mimics the logic of HIV Reminder Pop-up Rule

 Overall HIV testing (as a proportion
of patients) has increased
• Some areas (SHCC Inpatient, ACHN, SHCC ER)
are benefiting from prior testing with resulting
increases in overall fraction tested.
• SHCC ER, SHCC Inpt., and ACHN are increasing
testing though slowly.
• Some areas that have very high HIV
prevalence (PHCC ER, Cermak) are not testing
at adequate frequency and their performance
is worsening over time.
29

 There is room for improvement in
HIV Testing within CCHHS
• Clinical Departments should be required to set
targets within their areas.
– WHO target is 90%
– CDC target is 100%

• Consideration should be given to tracking the
fraction of patients tested down to the
individual attending level for OPPE.
– This is possible based on infrastructure built for
Meaningful Use of EMR.

Average waiting time for a new HIV Clinic appointment at CORE
has been <1 week over past 4 quarters
32

 Linkage to Care
• Denominator: patients who have first time confirmed
HIV+ tests anywhere in CCHHS prior 3 month period
• Numerator: of these, patients who had a visit (not
just an appointment) at a CCHHS site that provides
HIV primary care
• Measure added to CORE STAR Report for 2014
• FY2014 91% had at least 1 HIV clinic visit
• First 7 mo. FY2015 = 97%
• CORE lost 3 Outreach Workers due to CDPH
realignment of Outreach programs
34

 Retained/Engaged in Care at CORE
• Denominator: all patients who have any visit
at CORE in prior 12 months
• Numerator: of these, patients who had >2
visits at CORE >90 days apart (HRSA Defined)
– Measure added to CORE STAR Report for 2014

• For FY2014 77% of patients were
retained/engaged
• For first 7 mo. Of FY2015 = 78%
35

 Virologic Suppression
Among those Engaged in Care
• Denominator: all viral load (VL) measurements at
CORE during prior month from Engaged/Retained
patients
• Numerator: proportion of all VL that show
reasonable virologic control
• Corresponds to cascade measure, but may
underestimate success in patient getting labs but
skipping visits
• FY2014 86% of engaged pts. Suppressed
• First 7 mo. of FY2015 87% are suppressed
36

 Virologic Suppression
Community Viral Load
• Denominator: all viral load (VL)
measurements at CORE during prior month
• Numerator: proportion of all VL that show
reasonable virologic control
• Crude but powerful overall measure of
treatment efficacy (of those coming to care)
• FY2014 CVL suppression 86%
• First 7 mo. Of FY2015 = 88%
37

 Provider summaries
• 25 measures of process and outcome
• Assesses all patients who have PCP
relationship with that provider
• Given to each provider ~semi-annually
– With comparison column for similar providers
– With comparison column for all CORE providers

• Includes some Primary care measures –
e.g. HgBA1C

 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis - PrEP
• Giving a combination of two HIV medicines to
persons at high risk to prevent HIV infection
– Effective at preventing infection if med taken every day
– Risk of developing resistance if becomes infected
– Low risk of drug toxicity – but requires lab tests

• CDC Recommendations for PrEP in May 2014
• Is not Cost-Effective
– Limited budget for HIV meds – CORE / CCHHS will not bear
cost of meds – MAP or Insurance

• CORE opened PrEP clinic in April 2015
– Serving 40-50 patients mostly high risk MSM
42

 Thank you

Thanks to our patients for being surveyed, CCHHS providers for testing, Stephon
Effinger, Jennifer Catrambone, Art Moswin, for data; and Chet Kelly for data and a
