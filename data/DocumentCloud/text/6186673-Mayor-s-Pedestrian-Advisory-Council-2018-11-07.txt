Prioritizes Equity: HIV Transformation

Chicago has a real chance
at stopping the spread of
HIV once and for all.
- Mayor Rahm Emanuel

 Prioritizes Equity: Seed Grants
Place based funding to support
Healthy Chicago 2.0 initiatives in
communities that:
• Have high economic hardship
and/or
• Have low childhood
opportunity
Projects must be developed and driven by
a community plan. These plans are
created by residents, local communitybased organizations and other
stakeholders and outline strategies for
improving neighborhood conditions in
ways that are responsive to the
neighborhood’s unique character,
context and challenges.
