Report from Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
Dr. Krishna Das, Chief Quality Officer, provided a brief update on regulatory and accreditation matters. She stated
that the administration is finalizing its submission of final measures of success for Provident Hospital to The Joint
Commission (TJC), in response to the survey that took place in November. It will likely be sent to TJC this week;
a final accreditation decision should be received shortly after its submission.
Dr. Das stated that the System did receive Primary Care Medical Home (PCMH) accreditation from TJC as a result
of the single-site visit at the Prieto Clinic; progress is underway at all of the other System clinics to roll-out a
PCMH standards of care to prepare for the next Ambulatory accreditation.
Dr. Das stated that staff are actively engaged in preparations for the full accreditation survey by TJC at Stroger
Hospital; the survey will occur anytime between now and November.
Dr. Das noted that there was a visit to Cermak Health Services by representatives of the Department of Justice; this
subject will be discussed in closed session.

Report from Chief Quality Officer (continued)
B. Metrics (Attachment #1)
Dr. Das reviewed the presentation on Metrics. The Committee discussed the information.
With regard to the measures relating to Operating Room (OR) Efficiency, Dr. Das stated that the OR Committee
has been working on this issue for approximately three months; she anticipates further improvements as this
process continues. Peter Daniels, Chief Operating Officer of Hospital-Based Services, stated that he believes
that they will be done by later this summer, perhaps in July or August. Director Lerner requested that the
presentation communicating the results of their efforts be targeted for this Committee’s August meeting;
additionally, he requested that the report include Provident Hospital so that both institutions can be reviewed.
The Committee discussed potential reasons for the difference in immunization rates between Stroger and
Provident Hospitals. Dr. Das stated that, in general, the administration has found that a lot of nursing-specific
measures are better at Provident; this could be because of the size of the hospital and the availability of nursing
care. Chairman Gugenheim wondered if Provident Hospital is better staffed; she noted that it is important to
understand the difference. Director Marsh stated that this could be affected by the diversity of the patient
population. Her sense is that there is a more homogenous patient population at Provident; there may be some
cultural competency issues and challenges at Stroger that may be playing a role. Dr. Das stated that the issue
will be further explored.
During the discussion of the Patient Experience measures for Stroger Hospital, information was provided on the
staffing of Environmental Services. The senior leaders consist of directors and managers (less than ten
individuals), and are provided by a vendor, Sodexo; these senior leaders report to Mr. Daniels. The supervisors
and other staff are employees of CCHHS. The contract with Sodexo for the senior leaders covers all sites.
There is new leadership in this area, and they are extremely savvy about Press Ganey scores; they are imposing
several different interventions for improvement. Director Marsh requested that the Committee get feedback on
this subject in the future.
Also with regard to the Patient Experience measures, Director Lerner remarked that the data for
communications with the doctors and nurses are very good in both institutions, especially when one looks at
safety-net institutions. He stated that it is important to know what the doctors and nurses are doing to try to hit
the targets; he requested that, when the Committee has a deep dive on Patient Experience, that the review
include all of the measures, not just the measure relating to cleanliness.
C. Report – 2014 Stroke Program (Attachment #2)
Dr. Michael Kelly, Chairman of the Division of Neurology and Director of the Stroke Program at John H.
Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, presented the 2014 Stroke Program Report. Information presented in the
Report included the following subjects: Purpose, Scope and Goals of the Stroke Program; Stroger Stroke
Discharges – 2010-2014 by Subtype; 2014 Stroger Stroke Subtype Comparisons; Stroke Performance Measures
- % Adherence; 2014 Stroger In-Hospital Stroke Mortality; Utilization of tPA (alteplase) – 2014; Primary
Stroke Center Certification by TJC; Stroke Program 2014 Accomplishments and Challenges; and Stroke
Program 2015 Plans. The Committee discussed the information.

Report from Chief Quality Officer
C. Report – 2014 Stroke Program (continued)
During the discussion of the information, Director Lerner remarked that this Report is critically important; not
only is it dealing with the incidence of stroke within the Stroger population, but this is the kind of information
that needs to be collected for CountyCare patients, for this and other kinds of acute/chronic conditions that tend
to not only increase utilization and cost, but affect quality of life. This is an acute care presentation, and the
questions it raises for future discussions relate to the movement of patients from acute to post-acute care. It
would be interesting to follow on with this information to address the following questions: what is the
morbidity of the patients that came out of the Stroke Program; what is the relationship to a rehab unit or facility;
how many of the patients were discharged to the community versus another institution; and was the patient
readmitted? He noted that stroke patients are usually not readmitted for stroke; rather, they are usually
readmitted for something else, but the Committee can get into that. In terms of patient education, from his
experience, it is his understanding that if the acute care staff and post-acute staff work together to educate the
patients, they can get the patients back to a sense of mobility and contributing back to society. Dr. Kelly
indicated that this data can be collected and can be brought back to the Committee at some point in the future
for discussion.
In response to a question raised regarding post-acute providers, Dr. Kelly stated that that many of the patients
find their follow-up care within the primary care clinics of the System, as well as with the Division of
Neurology. Director Lerner surmised that some patients are also sent to skilled nursing facilities or other types
of facilities; a question to consider in the future is – to what specifications is the System holding those skilled
nursing facilities, in order to be part of this network and be focused on quality?
With regard to challenges relating to documentation that were referenced in the Report, Director Marsh inquired
whether a partnership can be forged with Information Technology to develop a type of required templating, so
that there are no opportunities for failure to document. Dr. Kelly responded affirmatively; he indicated that
there are several efforts underway to address this subject.
Director Lerner requested that, as the Committee moves forward, they think about the rest of the equation,
which is what happens to the patients after they leave the Stroke Program. What are the outcomes, what is the
functional status, is there measurement of their functional improvements, and how well are they contributing
back to society? Dr. Kelly stated that staff will put that data together. Director Marsh noted that another issue
to address relates to lowering the number of infarction patients who present to the hospital more than 4.5 hours
after the stroke occurs; that is the real problem, the fact that only 36 of 455 patients are getting to the hospital in
less than 4.5 hours. Additional education needs to be provided at community sites; patients need to be aware of
the signs of a stroke - facial droop, loss of arm control, slurred speech, etc. – and understand that the timing to
receive treatment is critical. Dr. Kelly noted that there is a network of stroke hospitals in the area that provide
education across the community; Stroger Hospital has been part of that network, but more needs to be done.
