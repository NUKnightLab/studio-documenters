consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
With regard to request number 14, the $2 million grant to the Suburban Primary Health Care Council for
funding of the Access to Care Program, Chairman Carvalho noted that during this year’s passage of the
FY2012 Budget, the County Board approved an amendment that provided an additional $1 million in grant
funds for the Access to Care Program; the additional $1 million was funded through other sources outside of
the System, so that amount is not included in this request that is before the Committee.

III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
The Committee discussed the subject of grants. Questions were raised regarding those Illinois Department of

needed if the System chooses to not re-apply for grant funding for the provision of services. Chairman
Carvalho stated that the subject of IDPH grants will be placed on the next Finance Committee Agenda for
discussion, under the category of New Business.
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Director Golden, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 17, under the Contracts and Procurement Items. THE MOTION

Report from System Interim Chief Financial Officer
Mr. Cookinham was unable to attend the meeting, so his report was deferred.
Dr. Raju provided an update on several matters. He stated that he recently appeared before the County Board
regarding the year-end revenue report; this report reflected a shortfall of over $169 million in expected patient revenue
collections. At that meeting, he responded that the reason for the shortfall was largely due to the System’s inability to
fully implement certain projects that were expected to be completely operational within a certain period of time, and
which would realize a certain amount of revenue. Additionally, he noted other issues that had impacted revenues;
these matters include the delay in the State’s Medicaid approval process, and physician billing that did not get
implemented in a timely fashion.
Dr. Raju noted that, although there was a revenue shortfall of $169 million, the System did not spend $50 million on
the expense side. He stated that physician billing is on-track now, and billing began as of December 1st; so far, over
$250,000 has been collected.
With regard to the backlog of pending Medicaid applications at the State, Dr. Raju stated that System management
has been meeting with representatives from the State nearly every two weeks for status updates on the pending
applications.
Dr. Raju stated that the Board will receive a presentation next week on the Section 1115 Waiver at their meeting on
January 27th. He noted that approval of the Waiver will help the System in two ways: 1) it will get the System ready
to give coordinated care; and 2) it will provide an infusion of cash.
With regard to revenue projections for FY2012, Dr. Raju stated that, in the first two months of FY2012, there is a
shortfall in Medicaid of $8 million. There is a drastic patient shift; Medicaid and Medicare are going down, and selfpay is going up. He stated that there may be one or two reasons for this; either the economy is forcing people to have
no insurance, or the uninsured are crowding the Medicaid patients out of the System. He stated that he will keep the
Committee and Board informed on the matter. Dr. Raju added that the System is expected to receive close to $40
million at the end of January or early February from the State, regarding retroactive adjustments.
Chairman Carvalho stated that the following subjects will be added to the February Finance Committee Meeting
Agenda, for review, updates and discussion, under the category of New Business:
New Business for February Finance Committee Meeting Agenda:
• IDPH Grants
• Update on CareLink Implementation
• Update on Revenue Cycle Initiatives
• Financial Dashboard
With regard to the subject of the IDPH grants, Director Golden stated that she would like to receive information on
whether the System has had to return grant money to IDPH that has not been spent.
Additionally, Chairman Carvalho stated that the reports and backup information should be received by the Committee
in writing and in advance of the meeting (preferably one week in advance, where possible).

 HERMAN BREWER, Bureau Chief, Bureau of Economic Development
I hereby transmit for your approval a request for the Office of Capital Planning and Policy, as authorized
by the Cook County Purchasing Agent, to participate in the City of Chicago (the "City") Job Order
Contract (JOC) program to complete the (11) eleven capital projects listed below (the "Projects"). JOC is
a quantity based procurement process that allows facility owners to complete a multitude of
repair/maintenance and construction projects with a single, competitively bid contract. The JOC process
generally involves first selecting a pool of potential contractors through a competitive procurement
process, and then identifying projects for such selected contractors.
The City has already completed a JOC competitive procurement process, and it has created the pool of
general contractors to perform certain projects generally associated with maintenance, repairs, and
routine work. Participating in, or "piggy backing" on the City's existing JOC contract would allow the
County to enjoy the myriad cost savings achieved through volume purchases.
The JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group. The Gordian Group
maintains an area price book, which captures the prices for specific construction work items within this
region. JOC contractors bid against the prices included in the price book. The

cost, therefore, of any work

performed by the contractor is a contractor markup from the price book. The Gordian Group would
receive a 5% administrative fee from Cook County based on the total project cost of the work.
I specifically request authorization for the Purchasing Agent, on behalf of the Office of Capital Planning
and Policy, to:

1. Enter into and execute an agreement with the Gordian Group on the same terms as, and actively
participate in, the City's JOC agreement for the coordination and administrative management of the Job
Order Contracting program;
2. Do all such acts and things and to execute all contracts necessary to complete the Projects using
vendors selected through the City's JOC program.

N/A
PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:
Two vendors were previously contracted to provide Spine Implants for CCHHS. Stryker Spine comprised 83% of
market share, and Depuy comprised of 17% market share. Both contracts were sourced as single feasible providers
and had various expiration dates.
NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
This contract will continue the purchase of implants used in spine cases. Additionally, this contract will also allow
CCHHS to purchase biologics at a lower cost through Stryker. The consolidation allows a greater price reduction
over the same type of implants used in prior agreements. The proposed growth strategy was reviewed by Value
Analysis in collaboration with the Division of Neurosurgery; both parties agreed to the proposed agreement. The goal
is to further move Stryker to 90% market share. This request will provide a new agreement with Stryker Spine to take
advantage of the newly proposed improved pricing over current and to include biologics that have additional cost
reduction over current vendor utilized.
FINANCIAL BENEFIT: [Prior Cost versus New Cost]
Savings Calculation: $332,724.90
Percent: 19%
The savings realized from this agreement will be $166K per year and pricing will be in the 1Oth percentile of GPO
member hospitals based on spend and line item pricing.

Re:

Amendment of Authorization Previously Granted Re: Item 33, July 22, 2011 meeting of the Finance
Committee:

Authorization was granted to enter into an amendment of Contract 09-25-060 (AmerisourceBergen Corp or ABC) to
participate in a rebate program wherein the Cook County Health and Hospitals System could elect to receive
equipment in lieu of a volume rebate from ABC, the CCHHS' pharmaceutical prime vendor. The specific equipment to
be secured is the FastPak EXP Packaging Equipment, which is manufactured Automed Technologies, Inc. dba
AmerisourceBergen Technology Group (ABTG), an affiliate of ABC and which packages and dispenses individually
labeled patient medications in "unit of use" packaging. In finalizing the transaction with ABC to secure the FastPak
EXP Packaging Equipment, it has been determined that CCHHS must transmit a letter directing ABC to pay $848,945
of rebate funds to ABTG and must also sign a separate contract with ABTG in order to properly effectuate the
transaction. It was previously believed that we could simply amend the ABC contract to provide for the purchase as
described in the prior request for authorization. It is requested that the Board approve the amendment of its prior
authorization to conform with the foregoing and to permit the Department of Supply Chain Management to finalize this
transaction.

Finance Committee Meeting Agenda of January 20, 2012
Item Ill( G) -Request for Approval of a new two year agreement with the Illinois Medical
District Commission.

Explanation: This Agreement will allow the CCHHS to utilize a parking lot owned by the IMDC
and situated on Damen Avenue near the CORE Center for an additional two years. This
continues an arrangement which began in early 2010 and has provided essential relief for
CCHHS employees requiring parking near Stroger Hospital. The new agreement is
substantially the same as the initial agreement: CCHHS pays the IMDC $18,000 per year for the
use of the lot. which payment is applied to a program called Cleanslate which hires individuals
to do landscaping around Fantus, Stroger and the Parking Lot. the IMDC is not charging
CCI=II=IS for the l:lse of the lot, bl:lt CCHHS is responsible for all maintenance and activities
associated with its use of the lot. In addition, since CCHHS installed a fence around the lot
during the initial period of the occupancy agreement, this agreement provides for CCHHS to
transfer ownership of the fence to IMDC at the end of this new agreement, in consideration of
the payment of $1,000 to CCHHS by IMDC.

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities and financial activities for the month ended November 30,
2011. This discussion focuses on the significant financial issues and major financial
activities during the current month. It should be read in conjunction with the
accompanying financial statements of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Collectively, these entities provide primary,
intermediate, acute, and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to
pay. The Bureau of Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy
activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2010 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners approved Vision 2015 Strategic Plan, which outlines, over five years,
restructuring CCHHS to deliver the best possible care for the vulnerable population of
Cook County within the constraints of dollar resources available to the health system.
This plan seeks to better allocate resources.

SUMMARY OF OPERATING AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
In October, 2011 the County successfully issued bonds, with part of the proceeds being
used for corporate purposes, and in November, 2011 $34.642M of the bond proceeds was
transferred to the Health fund balance.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
5
Page 42 of 73

 The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the twelve months with overall
revenue of $943,281 and overall expenses was $1,005,866.
Net Patient revenue for the twelve months was $641,348.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $10,825. Other revenue consists primarily of parking and cafeteria
revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable
General
Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of November decreased by 3 days of
revenue. There were 232 days of revenue (charges) outstanding at the end of November
and 235 days outstanding at the end of October.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered. Days of Revenue Outstanding is
measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Providing the collection agencies the necessary time to perform their collection
services; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Inpatient Accounts Receivable
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of November increased by
$1.052M as compared to the end of October. The level at the end of November was
higher than the end of the last fiscal year, but this is due to the increase in average daily
charge volume of the current fiscal year as compared to the average daily charge volume
of the prior year. The increase in average daily charge volume as compared to last year is
primarily due to:

Increased rates charged for room and services in Charge Description Master as of
January-2011; and

Page 43 of 73

 •

Improved charge capture.

The increase in this figure indicates fewer bills were processed than in the previous
month. The increase in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into a decrease
actual cash receipts, as Medicaid pays CCHHS claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays
CCHHS on the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts.

Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of November fell by $45.475M (or 12.4%). This
decline decreased CCHHS’ days in revenue outstanding. Almost all of this decline was
related to accounts that are managed on the three (3) legacy systems. $13.836M (or
30.4%) of this reduction in billed inpatient accounts relates charity care write-offs from
the new single platform. The new system was put in service on December 1, 2011.
The decrease in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into an increase in actual
cash receipts, as Medicaid pays on a per-diem and Medicare pays on the diagnosis,
regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care write-offs will
not result in cash collections.
There is still a significant quantity of billed inpatient accounts on the three older legacy
systems. At the end of November, Stroger still has 34.7% of the accounts outstanding that
were outstanding at the end of November 2010. The legacy accounts that are greater than
one year old make up 100.0% of the Stroger legacy accounts receivable. Stroger is the
largest of the three legacy accounts receivable balances, but the other facility legacy
systems combined have approximately 73.6% of the outstanding inpatient accounts over
a year old. The System will need to perform some file maintenance to remove these
accounts from the accounts receivable and place them with an agency if that is
appropriate. There may also be the need to correct errors that occurred in posting to the
accounts. The goal is to finalize the accounts on the older systems and stop using the
three older systems and save the cost associated with operating those systems.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts decreased by $7.808M by the end of
November, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts at the end of the previous
month. This decline increased the billed outpatient accounts.
The reduction in this figure indicates more bills were processed than in the previous
month. The decrease in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into a increase in
actual cash receipts due to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of November fell by $4.612M over
the balance at the end of October. Since $7.808M was moved from unbilled receivables
7
Page 44 of 73

 to billed receivables (therefore increasing the billed receivables balance), this net decline
in billed receivables is due to collection activities, including write-offs. Most of this
reduction occurred in the three (3) legacy platforms. There are plans to outsource the
follow up of outpatient accounts to a firm to help insure that the System is able to manage
these accounts effectively and convert the billed balances to cash as soon as is possible.
The decline in this figure indicates increased collection and write-off related activities
than in the previous month. The decrease in this figure does not translate dollar-fordollar into a increase in actual cash receipts due to Medicaid and Medicare’s
reimbursement configuration and charity care write-offs.
The legacy outpatient balances are similar to the legacy inpatient balances. 99% of the
legacy outpatient balances are over one year old. These accounts must be resolved and
either placed with an agency or correct the errors that have prevented the accounts from
being resolved. The goal for the outpatient legacy systems is to shut them down and save
the operating costs of those systems during fiscal year 2012.

Operating Expenses at the end of twelve months was $1,005.866M broken down as
follows:
Salaries and Wages - $498.612M
Benefits - $130.437M
Supplies - $118.360M
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $157.902M
Depreciation - $36.429M
Utilities - $10.601M
Insurance - $53.526M
Nonoperating Revenue was $291.109M. The largest portions of this are attributed to
sales tax in the amount of $131.183M and property tax in the amount of $78.950M.
Sales tax revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the
underlying sales transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois Sales Tax represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet
received from the state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales
transaction to the receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
8
Page 45 of 73

 This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are
comprised of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

 Notes:
1. The Payer Mix is based upon charges and determined by the patient's primary insurance.
2. The historical conversion rate of the eligibility vendor is 30%. Therefore, 30% of the accounts accepted
by the eligibility vendor are classified as "Medicaid-Pending". The remaining 70% of the accounts
accepted by the eligibility vendor are classified as "Self-Pay".
3. Normal newborn deliveries are not included in the Patient Day, the Admission, nor Average Length of Stay
calculations, as this data is part of the mother's data.
