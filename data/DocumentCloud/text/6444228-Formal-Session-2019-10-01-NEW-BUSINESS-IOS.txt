HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: THEODORE CHEATHAM, JR. vs CITY OF DETROIT
WATER AND SEWERAGE DEPARTMENT
FILE 14084 (PSB)

We have reviewed the above-captioned lawsuit, the facts and particulars of which are set
forth in a con?dential attorney-client privileged memorandum that is being separately hand
delivered to each member of your Honorable Body. From this review, it is our considered
opinion that a settlement in the amount of ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND FOUR
HUNDRED AND DOLLARS is in the best interests of the City
of Detroit.

We, therefore, request authorization to settle this matter in the amount of
ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND 
DOLLARS and that your Honorable Body authorize and direct the Finance
Director to issue a draft in that amount payable to Theodore Cheatham, Jr. and his attorney,
John P. Charters, to be delivered upon receipt of properly executed releases and order of
dismissal in Workers Compensation Claim #14084, approved by the Law Department.
