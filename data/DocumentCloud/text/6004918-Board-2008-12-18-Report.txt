Notes on I?plications of Federal An roval of Dis ro ortionate Share (DSH) Blinding and New Rates
Methodology for the Co% County Health Hospitals System

I After months of System close collaboration with the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family
Services, the approval by CMS on December 4?l of Illinois? Medicaid State Plan Amendment provides
for estimated (annualized) payments to of $86.5 million in state ?scal year 2008, and $92.5
million in state ?scal 2009;

0 Offsetting these gains are the negative effects of lower inpatient per diem payment rates due to the
simultaneous implementation of a new ?cost limited? Upper Payment Limit (UPL) methodology;

0 Assuming 5% Medicaid utilization growth, the System?s net improvement in revenues from these two
offsetting factors is estimated at $27 million in 

- The new rate structure is retroactive to July 1, 2008; Also, a likely retroactive (one-time) opportunity
exists for DSH eligibility prior to July 1;

0 Net per diem inpatient rates, excluding DSH, will change from a System global rate of $2,834 per day
to $1,457 (Stroger), $1,199 (Provident), and $1,014 (Oak Forest);

- Certain Medicaid ambulatory services reimbursement rates, for services such as high tech diagnostics,
observation stays, and outpatient surgeries will increase; For example, the least complex outpatient
surgical procedure at Stroger Hospital now will be reimbursed at $709 (net), whereas formerly the
payment was $390.

I The System and the County currently are advocating for increased DSH cap for Illinois, and for-
possible changes to the Medicaid Upper Payment limit for public, non-state hospitals; Both of these
currently are under discussion as part of an ?economic stimulus? package for consideration by
Congress.

Re: Request for Approval
Lease, Thornton Township High School District 205

Dear Mr. Carvalho:

It is respectfully requested that the attached lease be placed on the agenda of the Finance Committee of the Cook
County Health and Hospitals System Board. It is further requested that authorization be extended to the undersigned
to enter into the subject lease.

This lease provides for the use, at no cost to the County, of premises at the Thornton Township High School
approximately two times per month in order to conduct classes for teen parents pursuant to the Subsequent Pregnancy
Prevention Program. The Cook County Department of Public Health has entered into annual leases that have been
virtually identical to this document for a number of years. Authorization to enter into the most recent iteration of this
lease was previously obtained from the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

The Department has informed Mr. Raymond Muldoon, Director of Real Estate Management, of the proposed lease
and he has con?rmed that he has no objection to the arrangement. The lease contains provisions which impose
responsibility upon the County for liability resulting from the use of the premises and require that we submit
satisfactory evidence of insurance relative to our use of the premises. Upon securing the Finance Committee?s
authorization, we will request this documentation from the County?s Department of Risk Management.

Thank you for your consideration.

decrease the total number of orthopedic vendors and decrease the
cost of implants per case. We expect this endeavor to result in
price concessions of at least 40% from each vendor. The RFP 08-

reason, the contract was sent to Opentext but to my attention. It lingered
in their mail room for several months. When the error was determined, the
entire process needed to be redone because too much time had lapsed.
Now we ?nd that we DO NOT HAVE MAINTENANCE from this

dire need of a server upgrade in order to store their bills but we can not
upgrade the server until we pay the invoice. This is of critical importance.

Cook County Health Hosp
Reviewing the Mission

December 18, 2008

 

itals System:

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

89

  

Today?s Purpose

- Goal today is not to answer question about misSion
- Goal is to promote questions

- Issue of mission is really an issue of vision
What services are most important?
What services can be provided?
Who best provides those services?
--.- What is the overall set of funding arrangements?

 

 

 

 

9O

   

Current mission

To deliver integrated health services with dignity and 
respect regardless of a patient?s ability to pay; foster
partners hips with other health providers and
communi ities to enhance the health of the public; and
advocate for policies which promote and protect the

physical, mental and social well being of the people of
Cook County

Historically, the focus has been on serving as a the
ultimate ?safety net institution? and typically thought of as
providing extensive ?free" care.

91

 

Manifested in structural arrangements 

 

Existing set of services:

- A complex, acute care hospital and two community
hospitals, one with LTC and rehab services

- An HIV/AlDS/lnfectious Disease outpatient facility
A substantial correctional health service
- A number of primary care and specialty clinics

- The public health function for Cook County outside
Chicago?which actually has its own mission statement:-

The Cook County Department of Public Health
is committed to protecting and promoting
health and preventing illness, disability and premature
death among all the residents of suburban Cook
County.

92

  

Current budget is funded roughly:

- 28% patient fees
12% 
- 60% local tax structure"

Tax support comes in form of an allocation from
County Board based on estimates of expenses and
revenues.

Includes certain expenses borne directly by the
County, such as pension payments

 

And financing arrangements

93

  

Are these the arrangements for future?

There are many options:

- Could offer more, less or different services

- Could enlist different set of partners

- Could serve as catalyst for other restructurings
- Could have different financing structures

Separate document provides snapshots for a

number of other public systems. Although by no .

means exhaustive, it gives a sense of the Options
these systems have chosen to define themselves.

94

  

For instance. . ..

Philadelphia does not have a public hospital, but has a
clinic system and contracts with private hospitals for
inpatient and specialty outpatient care.

Boston Medical Center (a non-profit hospital) provides
those functions and partners with a robust network of
independent neighborhood health clinics, including
management of a very large managed care program.

In Denver, almost all of the revenue comes from
patients?in large part because of its partnership with
Colorado Medicaid.

In Atlanta, Grady-Hospital was changed from public
ownership to a non-profit board in the past year.

 

95

   
 

51:11:.

- Snapshot views always somewhat misleading?details
turn out to be crucial.

- Specifics are alwa ays cr ritica ally impacted by history,
particular circumstances and so forth. Can very rarely
be simply imported toa an other venue

- Circumstances faced in Cook County are particular and
will need a local solution.

Beware of anyone else?s model

96

But alternatives allow broaderthinking

 

- Existence of- different?4n some case very different-?
approaches allows consideration of a broader array of
options than would be the case if planning adopted
current as strongly limiting template

- Next steps are to determine:
How will priorities be set?
Who needs to be involved in setting priorities?
How will priorities by turned into actionable plan?

 

.. 
. 

97

  

Need realistic planning agenda

Process will require:
- Coordinated plan of articulating models and testing them
against financial models

- Coordinated plan of creative discussions with potential
partners?both service delivery and financing partners

- Plan for how much broader community involvement
necessary

Can be done with more or fewer resources, but activities

undertaken will depend on resources available. Broader
community involvement will be by far the most resource
intensive. Model development and discussions with partners
depends In part on the amount of Board guidance and
delegation.
