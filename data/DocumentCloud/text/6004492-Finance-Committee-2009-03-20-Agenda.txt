Real Estate Matter

Transmitting a Communication, dated March 9, 2009 from Raymond Muldoon, Director, Cook County Real Estate
Management Division,
Respectfully requesting approval of the attached Second Amendment to Lease between Amalgamated Bank of
Chicago Trust 5830 and Ralph Edgar, Beneficiary as (Landlord) and the County of Cook as (Tenant). The Cook
County Board of Commissioners approved the Original Lease for space used by the Cook County Department of
Public Health (CCDPH) as a public health service center at 52 W. 162nd Street, South Holland on February 3, 2004
and a First Amendment to Lease for additional space used as a public health dental center at 64 W. 162nd Street,
South Holland on February 15, 2005.
CCDPH has communicated to this Office that due to the Health & Hospitals System Board’s election to no longer
participate in the under-funded Illinois Department of Human Services case management grant program, the public
health service center at 52 W. 162nd Street, South Holland financially supported by this program will be closed as of
March 31, 2009.
Clients who had received these services at this location have already been transitioned to non-governmental
providers in the Southland area. Also, CCDPH staff at this location have already been relocated to other CCDPH
sites. However, clients that desire to access other CCDPH services can visit locations in the surrounding
communities of Harvey, Robbins, Ford Heights, and Markham as well as other Health & Hospitals System
locations.
The Second Amendment provides for certain changes to the Original Lease for the purpose of returning a portion of
the Premises to the Landlord. CCDPH will continue to use the remaining premises as a public health dental center
as corporate funds are available. Details are:
