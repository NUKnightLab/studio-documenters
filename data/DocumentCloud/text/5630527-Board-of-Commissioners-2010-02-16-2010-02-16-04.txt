GENERAL BACKGROUND
In 1996, the CHA reached a settlement in a class action lawsuit that charged the CHA and HUD
with discrimination against Latinos in Chicago’s public housing programs. The court found that
Latinos had been deprived of housing assistance caused by actions and inactions on the part of
the CHA and HUD. The settlement resulted in the Latino Consent Decree which, among other
requirements, required the CHA to have two site offices, staffed at all levels with bilingual
personnel, to assist individuals seeking information about or wishing to register for CHA

 programs. At that time one office had to be in the West Town, Humboldt Park, or Logan Square
area and the other office was to be in the Lower West Side (Pilsen) or South Lawndale (Little
Village) area. Though the 10-year agreement, Latino Consent Decree has been lifted for over 6
years, CHA has incorporated the strategies and experience developed over the years and in spirit
of the progress gained under the Latino Consent Decree and good-faith, the CHA continues to
take affirmative actions in the form of marketing, intake and outreach to the Latino community
for all its services and programs.
In light of this history, the CHA entered into Contract No. 9001 with the Spanish Coalition for
Housing pursuant to a competitive procurement. Responsibilities include providing bilingual
marketing, intake and outreach to the Latino community and community at large for CHA
programs and services at (2) satellite offices. The services that these (2) offices provide for CHA
are hosted in communities that have significant Latino populations in Chicago. The Spanish
Coalition for Housing will continue to provide marketing, intake and outreach activities to obtain
significant senior applications and family applications from the Latino community for CHA
programs during the contract period.
Over the past year, Spanish Coalition for Housing has provided the CHA with outstanding
service in Spanish and English to the Latino and greater community and has utilized its’
expertise, experience and know-with-all to assist over 1200 individuals and families with critical
services on behalf of the CHA. Spanish Coalition for Housing is willing to provide services for
the next contract term, March 1, 2010 through February 28, 2011, under the same terms and
conditions as provided in the Contract No. 9011.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to exercise the Contract’s one-year
option with Spanish Coalition for Housing for the period of March 1, 2010 to February 28, 2011
to operate the Latino Site Offices to conduct bilingual (Spanish) marketing, intake, outreach
activities to inform the community at large and Latino community about CHA’s housing
programs and opportunities in an amount not to exceed $501,045.00.
