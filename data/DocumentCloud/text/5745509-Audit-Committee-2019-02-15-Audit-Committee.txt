Re:

Discussion: FY 2020 & 2021 Biennial Budget and Five-Year Plan

Background: In accordance with service agreements with Great Lakes Water Authority
(GLWA) member partners, charges for the next fiscal year are annually presented at the
end of January each year. To accommodate that schedule, the budget process for the GLWA
begins early in the fiscal year.
Analysis: At the Audit Committee meeting on a December 21, 2018, staff presented a
discussion draft of the FY 2020 & 2021 Biennial Budget and Five-Year Plan. This draft
focused on a) overall strategy of key budget elements including system-wide service
charges and b) proposed operating group budgets.

Additional analysis was provided at the January 4, 2019 and January 19, 2019 Audit
Committee meetings. Since that date, staff has been updating the budget document with
November 2018 actual numbers (vs. October 2018) as well as working with The Foster
Group to obtain and reconcile late adjustments to accommodate charges decisions related
to certain Member Partner matters.
Forthcoming for today’s meeting, are the following.

1. Top ten budget category increases and decreases
2. Draft biennial budget resolution for review

Attached is a memo from The Foster Group re: Proposed FY 2020 Water Service Charges
“Other Impacts” Summary. While this analysis does not impact the budget directly, it will be
shared with Member Partners at next week’s Charges Work Group meeting to better explain the
link between budget priorities and water charges.
Proposed Action: Receive and file reports.

MEMORANDUM
Proposed FY 2020 Water Service Charges
“Other Impacts” Summary
To:

February 5, 2019

Nicolette Bateson

From: Bart Foster
The intent of this memorandum is to present and discuss the “other impacts” category
contained on the Water Charge Calculation Sheets distributed to GLWA Customers on January
24. Together with the accompanying exhibits, this discussion provides additional perspective
on the proposed water service charges for FY 2020.
Background
At the final FY 2020 charge rollout meeting on January 24, each Customer was presented with
a “Charge Calculation Sheet.” The exhibits were designed to set forth how the uniform cost of
service allocation and charge methodology produced specific proposed charges for each
Customer, and to identify how issues impacting the proposed charges impacted individual
Customers. The second page of those charge calculation sheets attempts to “unbundle” the
various elements impacting the proposed charges by comparing the results of the FY 2020 Cost
of Service Study with those from the FY 2019 study. The specific elements identified as
impacting the proposed FY 2020 charges were:
•
•
•

•
•

The original targeted 3.5% increase in the FY 2020 BUDGET request;
The allocated benefit of increased projected investment income;
The collective results of the Units of Service (“UoS”) study for Non-Master Metered
Customers;
o Separated by anticipated Phase 1 impacts and final Phase 2 impacts
The results of modified Customer demands emerging from the Contract Alignment
Process (“CAP”);
The final modifications to the FY 2020 BUDGET request.

All other variances between allocated FY 2020 cost of service and allocated FY 2019 cost of
service were attributed to “other impacts”. On the charge calculation sheets we described
“other impacts” as follows: “Other impacts are related to the FY 2020 Cost of Service Study,
and adjustments made to the FY 2019 charges after the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study was
Page 7

 Proposed FY 2020 Water Service Charges
“Other Impacts” Summary

February 5, 2019
Page 2

completed.” We further noted that this element was impacted by consolidation effects that
emerge when the other discretely identified elements are “re-bundled”.
The same approach described above has been applied in prior Cost of Service and Charge
studies, and the “other impacts” element is generally quite small in terms of the final results.
For the original FY 2020 Charge Calculation Sheets, the impact on specific Customers of this
element ranged from an approximate 2% reduction for some Customers to an approximate 2%
increase of allocated costs of service for others. Customers expressed an interest in further
understanding this element.
Further Unbundling of “Other Impacts”
We have conducted additional analysis designed to more discretely identify additional
elements that were identified as “other impacts” in the original presentation. Herewith a brief
introduction to those additional elements.
First, let’s discuss the adjustments made to the FY 2019 water service charges after the FY
2019 Cost of Service Study was completed, as noted above. These changes are introduced on
Exhibit Page 1. Column 1 shows the original revenue requirements allocated to Customers in
the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study, which total $330.8 million. That study produced the
original proposed water service charges for FY 2019, which were submitted for review in late
January 2018. The remaining Columns illustrate modifications made between that time and
final approval of the FY 2019 BUDGET and charges. The footnotes and annotations on the
exhibit adequately introduce the major changes and we’ll not elaborate herein, but rather
summarize:
•

•

•

As noted in Column 4, there were adjustments made to units of service, and to water
service charges, for specific Customers that had the effect of reducing the final
budgeted FY 2019 revenues. Had the FY 2019 Cost of Service study been recalculated
with these adjustments, charges to ALL Customers would have been modified.
As noted in Column 5, the final adjustments (reductions) to the FY 2019 BUDGET
were principally accommodated by a reduction in the operating expense budget, and
smaller increase in the capital budget. Since the allocation of these revenue
requirements is not uniform, had the FY 2019 Cost of Service study been recalculated
with these adjustments, charges to ALL Customers would have been modified.
The calculation of the impact of the above two elements are summarized as the
“Adjusted FY 20119 BUDGET Allocation” on the supplemental Charge Calculation
Sheets that we’ll introduce later.

Next, let’s introduce the impacts are related to the FY 2020 Cost of Service Study, and
specifically the results of the detailed cost pool analysis that are implemented with it. This
element was originally introduced in our presentation of the proposed charges on January 24.
Referring to slide 33 of that presentation:

Issues Impacting Proposed FY 2020
WATER Service Charges – Cost Pools
• FY 2020 Cost Allocation review increases portion of 
revenue requirements related to Transmission 
Mains
• Costs related to Transmission Mains are allocated 
to Customers based on their peak hour demand and 
distance factor
• Customers with relatively high peak hour demands 
and/or distance factors experience a slightly higher 
than average charge adjustment than Customers 
with relatively low peak hour demands and/or 
distance factors, all else being equal

This issue is further introduced starting on Exhibit Page 2, which compares the operating
budget by Cost Pool for the FY 2020 Cost of Service Study with that from the FY 2019 Cost
of Service Study. As a reminder, the major influence on the operating budget allocation for FY
2020 was the detailed review of activities in GLWA’s Centralized Services group. That review
is documented in our “FY 2020 Cost of Service Study and Service Charge Recommendations”
report and its accompanying exhibits. In general, significant efforts have been made to
specifically align major budgeted programs and contracts with appropriate utility and cost
pools. Items of note:
•
•
•
•

The overall water O&M budget reflects an increase of approximately $7.6 million from
that utilized for the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study.
Within the water budget, the increase is largely allocated to the Transmission Mains
Cost Pool, which are allocated to Customers based (in part) on distance.
Cost allocated to the Booster Stations Cost Pool experience a decrease. These costs are
allocated to Customer (in part) based on distance AND elevation.
Since these elements are allocated to Customers based on different units of service, the
impact of the refined budget allocation will impact Customers differently.

An example of this nuance is illustrated on Exhibit Page 3, which compares the effect of the
cost pool reallocation on two similar Customers. As noted in the units of service comparison
at the top of the page, these two Customers have similar profiles, other than the fact that
Customer B has a significantly higher elevation factor.
The exhibit illustrates how each Customer is impacted by the changes to the allocation to each
cost pool, and summarizes the total impact on Line 24 (and Line 30). The total impact on Line

Page 9

 Proposed FY 2020 Water Service Charges
“Other Impacts” Summary

February 5, 2019
Page 4

24 becomes the “Recognize FY 2020 Cost Pool Variance” element on the supplemental
Charge Calculation Sheets introduced below.
As noted on Line 32, almost 40% of Customer B’s allocated revenue requirement is related to
elements that include elevation as an allocation factor, compared to only 23% for Customer A.
Since the results of the Cost of Service Study lower the relative cost of elevation related
elements, Customer B experiences a decrease in that line item that offsets the increase in the
distance related element on Line 31. Customer A also is allocated reduced elevation related
elements, but the reduction is not enough to offset the increase in distance related elements.
The chart included as Exhibit Page 4 illustrates the calculated impact of the Cost Pool
modifications on every Customer, expressed as a percentage of its adjusted allocated FY 2019
Cost of Service.
Supplemental Charge Calculation Sheets for Customer A and Customer B are included as
Exhibit Page 5 and Exhibit Page 6, respectively. These exhibits are designed to illustrate the
further “unbundling” of the original other impacts figure from the Charge Calculation Sheets
previously submitted to Customers. We have prepared these supplemental calculation sheets
for each Customer and encourage that they be distributed as soon as possible.
The format of these sheets is similar in nature to the originals. We start with the original
“unadjusted” FY 2019 BUDGET allocation to each Customer, and then attempt to illustrate
how the various elements discussed herein impact that allocation. Lines 3 and 4 delineate the
“Adjusted FY 20119 BUDGET Allocation” originally introduced on Exhibit Page 1. Line 10
presents the impact on cost of service allocations of updating all of the master metered volume
projections from the original FY 2019 figures to the FY 2020 figures. The figure for each
Customer reflects the change in commodity related allocated costs of service that occur due to
projected changes in annual sales volumes. Customers with reduced sales volume projections
experience reduced allocated commodity costs, and vice versa. The impact is only related to
the first three “commodity” related cost pools.
The impacts of recognizing the FY 2020 Cost Pool Variances (introduced earlier) is shown on
Line 11 and the specific calculations of this amount are illustrated in the lengthy footnote (a)
of the exhibit. We have attributed remaining original “other impacts” from the original Charge
Calculation Sheets to a new, smaller “other impacts” amount on Line 12. This element now is
basically limited to the consolidation effects that emerge when the other discretely identified
elements are “re-bundled”.
We trust that this additional discussion and material is responsive to the request for more
information on the “other impacts” question. This material is intended to serve as an addendum
to the original Charge Calculation Sheets and the “FY 2020 Cost of Service Study and Service
Charge Recommendations” report and its accompanying exhibits.
We are prepared to present this material at the Water Charges Work Group meeting scheduled
for February 21 and to discuss this matter at your convenience.

Analysis of Highest & Lowest Variances
FY 2020 Requested Budget vs. FY 2018 Actuals
FY 2020 Requested Budget Compared to FY 2018 Actual Expenses
FY 2018 actual expenses represent the GLWA’s second full fiscal year of activity. One way to better
understand the proposed budget is by comparing it with the prior year actual. Below are explanations of the
top ten highest and lowest expense category variances based on those parameters (see attached schedule of
all variances). The explanations are in order as they appear on the status report.

Top Ten Categories with Highest Dollar Increase Variance from FY 2018 Actual to FY 2020 Budget
(note: the Top Eleven are presented since one item, “Unallocated Reserve” is not an expense.)

1. Salaries & Wages ($13 million) - The variance is due to the number of vacancies at June 30, 2018
versus the staffing plan for FY 2020. The table below provides an analytical analysis of the variance.

2. Contractual Operating Services ($8.6 million) - Contractual operating services are dependent on
several factors such as, delays in estimated start and end dates, environmental constraints, and other
unforeseen circumstances that can cause the expenses to fluctuate from fiscal year to fiscal year.
a. Tooles Contracting Group LLC: Contract WS-695C (Valve Exercising) began in June 2018
with a duration of 2 years (approximately $3.7 million contract. The majority of the expenses
will be captured in FY 2019 and FY 2020. The total amount of this contract is $3.7 million
(roughly $1.8 million per year).
b. Mobile Dredging & Piping: Contract CON-170 (Alum Sludge Hauling) which began during
FY 2018 and is currently underway and extends through FY 2021. The total amount of this
contract is $15.3 million (roughly $3.8 million per year).
c. Contractual Services for CSO Basins: After review of the individual CSO facilities
concerning their ages, it was identified that ongoing assessments and inspections were
required in order to continuously observe the conditions of the facilities. The need for these
ongoing services (basin annual cleaning, roof inspections, engineering services, electrical
services) increased the budget beginning in FY 2019. FY 2020 is approximately $2.7 million.

Analysis of Highest & Lowest Variances
FY 2020 Requested Budget vs. FY 2018 Actuals
3. Contractual Professional Services ($7.4 million) - Contractual professional services are on an asneeded basis and required for the improvement in capital program delivery for the GLWA.
a. Lakeshore Global Corporation: A portion of the professional services related to contract
CON-158 (Specialized Services) was transferred to Field Services Operations from Systems
Control which increased contractual professional services by $1.8 million.
b. CH2M Hill Engineers Inc.: Contract GLWA-CS-198 (Asset Management Planning Project)
began in October 2018. The total for this contract over a three-year period is $4.1 million.
The FY 2020 budgeted share for these different project tasks are: Strategic Asset
Management Plan (SAMP) $1.68 million; Wastewater Asset Management Plan (WAMP 2019)
$513k; Water Asset Management Plan (WAMP 2020) $515k; System Wide Programs to
Support AMPs $517k; Asset Management Advisory Services and Team Management $890k.
c. Capital Program Management: This is a new initiative for process, technology, and staff
development (approximate total of $3.2 million for FY 2020). Potential award of a contract in
February 2019 will also provide capital delivery support services.
4. Unallocated Reserve ($6.9 million) - A reasonable amount of unallocated reserve provides for
unforeseen expenditures and helps to ensure that adequate cash flow is available to meet the
expected cost of Operations & Maintenance. The nature of this category is that there would be $0
recorded to this as an expense. Instead a budget reallocation is used to decrease the Unallocated
Reserve and increase the cost center and category that will need to incur the actual expense.
5. Capital Outlay over $5k (O&M-NonCapitlzd) ($3.1 million) – This expense category is largely
comprised of Information Technology which includes software licensing services, fees for cloudbased solutions, hardware, software, project management, equipment upgrades, networking
applications and new technology.
a. DES Electric: Contract CON-167 (Low Voltage Wiring) is accommodating an increasing
demand for audio/video, data lines and telephones services. This increased demand poses a
challenge to not only maintain, but to continuously develop the communications
infrastructure which reflects an increase in budget for FY 2020 of $2 million.
6. Operating Supplies – Chemicals ($2.8 million) - Variable expenses such as chemicals fluctuate
with changes in production, treatment volume, consumption, pumping, customer growth or
infrastructure issues (pipe leaks). Water use declines in cold, wet weather which decreases chemical
use and increases in hot, dry seasons which increases chemical use.
a. Wastewater Secondary Process - The budget to actuals variance for chemicals is directly
attributable to the River Rouge Outfall (RRO). The diversion from the Detroit River Outfall
(DRO) to the River Rouge Outfall (RRO) began in January 2019. Therefore, the increase of
$1.2 million is related to the estimated usage of Sodium Bisulfite and Hypochlorite
subsequent to FY 2018.
b. Wastewater Primary Process – The budget to actuals variance for chemicals is attributable
to a higher demand for Ferric Chloride in the wastewater primary treatment process. The
increase of $728k is related to this higher usage.
7. Shared Services Reimbursement ($2.7 million) - The shared services reimbursement contra
expenses are related to and based on a department's direct deliverables to a list of shared services
arrangements. It is anticipated that the IT shared services agreement will be reduced in FY 2020.
Projected expenses are provided by the shared services team and can fluctuate from fiscal year to
fiscal year upon review with Detroit Water & Sewerage Department (subscriber).

Analysis of Highest & Lowest Variances
FY 2020 Requested Budget vs. FY 2018 Actuals

12. Key Changes (Top 10 decreases)
• Capital Program: Employee Benefits ($81k) - The capital program contra expenses are related
to and based on employees' direct deliverables to capital projects. It is not unexpected for capital
program expenses to fluctuate from fiscal year to fiscal year. Expense tracking for capital
program allocation has greatly improved as a result of a new time keeping application (BigTime).
This new application makes it easier for team members to report their time spent on direct
capital delivery.
o Water Engineering: Improved information was obtained from the new time keeping
application (BigTime) in order to provide a more accurate budgeted forecast for FY 2020
compared to the resources that were available for FY 2018.
• Property Taxes ($116k) - FY 2017 property taxes final installment posted in FY 2018 which
caused FY 2018's activity to increase by $128,804.87. The budget for FY 2020 is a true reflection
of the anticipated property taxes expense.
o Fighting Island – Property tax payment for Southwest Water Plant intake paid in two
installments yearly.
• Rentals-Buildings ($199k) – The reduction of $199k in comparison of the FY 2020 budget to FY
2018 actuals is a result of the scheduled move of the wastewater analytical laboratory from the
Michigan Center to the water resource recovery facility (WRRF).
o New Technology Development: Contract LA-1519 (Analytical Lab at Michigan Center)
rent for wastewater laboratories will end.
• Capital Outlay over $5k (O&M-Capitalized) ($411k) - A budget amendment is underway for
FY 2019 - FY 2024 to transfer the Capital Outlay budget over $5k for all affected cost centers to
Improvement & Extension (I&E). It was determined that all Capital Outlay over $5k should be
budgeted under the same funding source to ensure that tracking is accurate.
• Capital Outlay less than $5,000 ($548k) - A reduction in the purchase of computer related
hardware and software is anticipated for the upcoming fiscal year. Computer related hardware
and software requests are largely driven by the current level of full-time equivalents which is
reaching a steady state. These types of purchases generally occur on an as needed basis.
• Capital Program: Nonpersonnel ($1.8 million) - The capital program contra expenses are
related to and based on a department's direct deliverables to capital projects. It is not
unexpected for capital program expenses to fluctuate from fiscal year to fiscal year. Expense
tracking for capital program allocation has greatly improved as a result of a new time keeping
application (BigTime).
o Capital Improvement Planning - Improved information was obtained from the new
time keeping application (BigTime) in order to provide a more accurate budgeted
forecast for FY 2020 compared to the resources that were available for FY 2018.
• Capital Program: Salaries & Wages-Direct ($1.8 million) - The capital program contra
expenses are related to and based on employees' direct deliverables to capital projects. It is not
unexpected for capital program expenses to fluctuate from fiscal year to fiscal year. Expense
tracking for capital program allocation has greatly improved as a result of a new time keeping
application (BigTime). This new application makes it easier for team members to report their
time spent on direct capital delivery.

Analysis of Highest & Lowest Variances
FY 2020 Requested Budget vs. FY 2018 Actuals
Water Engineering ($848k): Improved information was obtained from the new time
keeping application (BigTime) in order to provide a more accurate budgeted forecast for
FY 2020 compared to what was available for FY 2018.
o Wastewater Engineering ($612k): Improved information was obtained from the new
time keeping application (BigTime) in order to provide a more accurate budgeted
forecast for FY 2020 compared to the resources that were available for FY 2018.
Legal ($2 million) - Legal contains the outside counsel for a wide range of matters including,
expert witnesses, environmental, labor, contract review, land matters, non-transactional bond
counsel, and other matters. Legal matters are on an as-needed basis and the expenses are
expected to vary from fiscal year to fiscal year.
o Legal matters (settlements and claims): Several legal matters were resolved and
ended in FY 2018 which resulted in a budget decrease of $2 million for FY 2020 in
comparison to FY 2018 actuals.
Damage Claims ($5.1 million) – Where appropriate, year-end adjustments of legal reserves for
settlements and claims is captured under damage claims. This is not an unexpected expense and
can fluctuate from fiscal year to fiscal year. Therefore, no budget has been designated for FY
2020.
Contractual Transition Services ($6.5 million) - Contractual transition services are steadily
decreasing as a result of staff vacancies, previously filled by individuals on a contractual basis,
transitioning to GLWA employees. The decrease in contractual transition services in some cost
centers is an offset to the increase in salaries & wages. Two specific examples are below.
o Systems Operations Control ($1.5 million):
 Lakeshore Global Corporation: Budget related to contract CON-158
(Specialized Services) was transferred to Contractual Professional Services which
decreased contractual transition services by $1.5 million. Contractors that will
never transition to GLWA employees are considered contractual professionals.
o Field Services Director ($1.2 million):
 Two cost centers (Field Service Director and Field Service Engineering) were
combined with Field Service Operations in FY 2019. The result of the merged cost
centers is a decrease in Contractual Transition Services which is reflected in the
FY 2020 requested budget ($1.2 million).

AGENDA ITEM #6B

Date: February 15, 2019
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager
Re:

Proposed FY 2020 Schedule of Water and Sewer Service Charges

Background: During its January 23, 2019 meeting, the Great Lakes Water Authority
(GLWA) Board of Directors was presented the proposed FY 2020 financial plans and
related schedule of water and sewer service charges. That presentation was the basis for
the proposed water and sewer service charges shared with the member partners at the
January 24, 2019 Charges Roll-out Meeting. Furthermore, those proposed charges were
also mailed to the Member Partners on January 25, 2019 with a Notice of Public Hearing
scheduled for February 27, 2019 at 2:00 p.m. The charges proposed on January 23, 2019
are the same being presented today.

Analysis: Final considerations related to the charges as we approach the public hearing on
February 27, 2019 are discussed below.
Proposed FY 2020 Water Charges

The proposed FY 2020 water service charges reflect the results of two GLWA and member
partner initiatives that were completed during 2018. The first is the Contract Alignment
Process (CAP), which aligned the scheduled reopener dates (starting in 2022) for 80 of the
82 of GLWA’s member partners on a water model contracts. The second is the Phase 2
update of the Units of Service Study (USS) for GLWA’s non-master metered customers as
prepared by Black and Veatch. The effect of both the CAP and USS Phase 2 results in the
reallocation of units of service among all GLWA water member partners. The average
wholesale water service charge will increase by 0.8 percent for FY 2020.

Also reflected in the proposed water service charges is a proposed change in account status
for certain GLWA sewer facilities that are currently served as retail customers of DWSD.
GLWA contends that these facilities are served by regional, not retail, system mains. This
proposal results in the corresponding removal of units of service to DWSD, which lowers
its allocated wholesale water revenue requirement by $1.4 million. The revenue to DWSD
from this service under the current retail service arrangement is estimated to be $3.5
million. Since the date that proposed charges were presented, DWSD gave had further
dialog related to the matter as well as a different venue to work through this matter.

Page 38

 Proposed FY 2020 Sewer Charges
The proposed FY 2020 sewer service charges reflect the revenue requirement impact of the
proposed amendment to the Oakland Macomb Interceptor Drain Drainage District
(“OMID”) service agreement. Under this proposal, OMID will provide all maintenance and
financing activities related to the Northeast Sewer Pump Station (“NESPS”). The average
wholesale sewer service charge will increase by 1.3percent for FY 2020.
The proposed sewer service charges also include the proposed change in account status for
the GLWA sewer facilities that are currently served as retail customers of DWSD (a
companion matter related to the retail water charges noted above). This change results in
the reduction of units of service to DWSD, which lowers its allocated wholesale sewer
revenue requirement by $782,300.
Impact of DWSD Retail Charges to GLWA

Two analysis are attached that quantify the difference for both entities related to the
impact of the GLWA proposal to address the water source at the WRRF. While the amounts
are moderately material to each party, potential option(s) exist if it appears that resolution
of this matter impacts timely adoption of budget and charges. If the parties decide that
arbitration is the preferred route to resolve this matter, for example, a common option is
for payments to be held in escrow until a third-party decision is made.
Budget Impact: The proposed FY 2020 Schedule of Water and Sewer Service Charges as
presented produces the necessary revenues to fund the proposed FY 2020 Water Budget
and Sewer Budget, respectively, based on the projections made in the FY 2020 Water and
Sewer Cost of Service Studies prepared by The Foster Group.

Proposed Action: Audit Committee recommends that the Great Lakes Water Authority
Board approve the proposed schedule of FY 2020 Water and Sewer Service Charges as
initially presented by GLWA at its Regular Meeting on February 27, 2019 subject to public
comment;
Or
Audit Committee recommends that the Great Lakes Water Authority Board approve the
proposed schedule of FY 2020 Water and Sewer Service Charges at its Regular Meeting on
February 27, 2019 subject to public comment with the provision that an alternative charge
for the retail system which holds the resolution of the water charges to the Water Resource
Recovery Facility be held in escrow subject to an expedient arbitration to resolve the
matter.

MOTION

Upon recommendation of Nicolette Bateson, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer, the Board

actions, which require a supermajority affirmative vote of at least five (5) members
of the Board, and the attached Resolution 2019-____ with an effective date of July 1,

1) FY 2020 wholesale water service schedule of charges;
2) FY 2020 wholesale sewer service schedule of charges;
3) FY 2020 City of Detroit allocated wholesale water revenue requirement of

4) FY 2020 City of Detroit allocated wholesale sewer revenue requirement of
$186,118,800 [$186,901,100], which is the net of $191,634,800 [$192,417,100]

Page 42

 6) FY 2020 City of Detroit allocated indirect sewer revenue requirement of
$38,073,300, in accordance with the Regional Water Supply System Lease; and
7) authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to take such other action as may be
necessary to accomplish the intent of this vote.

BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the water system and sewer system leases signed between the Great Lakes
Water Authority (GLWA/Authority) and the City of Detroit, the GLWA began operations of
the regional water supply and sewage disposal system on January 1, 2016. Consistent
with the terms of those leases, the Authority shall, for each fiscal year fix and approve
rates and charges to its customers in an amount that is expected to produce revenues
sufficient to satisfy the Authority revenue requirement. The attached, proposed schedule
of charges meets that requirement.
Leading up to this charge recommendation, staff presented the proposed FY 2020 and
2021 Biennial Budget and five-year financial plan for FY 2020 to 2024 to the Board at its
meeting on January 9, 2019 and an analysis of proposed water and sewer system
charges at its January 23, 2019 meeting. A Public Hearing was opened for the FY 2020
Water Service Charges and Sewer Service Charges on February 27, 2019.
JUSTIFICATION
Great Lakes Water Authority (“GLWA”) management and its consultant, The Foster
Group, developed a Schedule of Water Service Charges and Sewer Service Charges for
FY 2020 including the City of Detroit Revenue Requirement for the water and sewer
systems. These charges support the proposed FY 2020 water system revenue
requirements budget and the proposed FY 2020 sewer system revenue requirements,
respectively. The FY 2020 water and sewer revenue requirements reflect GLWA’s
commitment to not only work within, but perform beyond, the four percent revenue
requirement budget limitation outlined in the September 9, 2014 Memorandum of
Understanding that resulted in the establishment of the Great Lakes Water Authority. The
proposed wholesale customer charges and revenue requirements for the City of Detroit
are the result of significant customer engagement in the charge setting process to
evaluate the appropriate allocation of revenue requirements.
BUDGET IMPACT
The recommended FY 2020 Schedule of Water Service Charges and Sewer Service
Charges as presented produces the necessary revenues to fund the FY 2020 Water
System and Sewer System Budget.

Page 43

 COMMITTEE REVIEW
The Audit Committee has reviewed the FY 2020 financial plan, including charge setting
matters, at its meetings on January 4, 2019, January 18, 2019 and February 15, 2019.
SHARED SERVICES IMPACT
This item does not impact the Shared Services Agreement between the GLWA and the
City of Detroit.

From: Alicia Haskin, Management Professional – Intergovernmental Relations
Re:

Update: GLWA and DWSD Shared Services True-Up Status for FY 2017 and
Summary of Shared Services Billings and Payments

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) and the Detroit Water and
Sewerage Department (DWSD) are parties to a Shared Services Agreement (the
Agreement) dated December 1, 2015. This agreement provides the framework for shared
services for the efficient operation of both entities.

On a monthly basis, an invoice is prepared based on an agreed upon annual budget. While
the intent is for the monthly invoice to represent actual costs, the reality is that the timing
of certain vendor invoices and accumulation of internal charges requires a “true-up”
process. That being said, the intent is to condense the true-up timeline each fiscal year.
The Shared Service Agreement (Section 5.1) states that:

“Each invoice, whether for Services provided regularly or “as-needed,” shall itemize
the costs and charges by Services provided under each Service Delivery Schedule,
and shall provide sufficient detail to the Subscribing Party to identify the Services
performed and the basis for the charges. A Performing Party may only charge the
Service Costs for Services provided.”

In addition, the parties have come to realize that an exact itemization generates a level of
detailed analysis that is not cost-effective to produce. The data and experience garnered
from the first three years of the shared services program are leading to a more efficient
method of calculating costs while staying true to the intent of Section 5.1 above.

Analysis: For Fiscal Year 2017, Tables 1 (GLWA as service provider) and 2 (DWSD as
service provider) quantify the current amount billed for each Shared Service for the
FY2017 True-Up based upon DWSD’s and GLWA’s staff analyses. There are still ongoing
reviews and discussions regarding the true-up calculations provided by each party.

Page 53

 DWSD and GLWA Shared Services Teams are meeting every two weeks to bring the FY
2017 Shared Services True Up to a resolution.

True-up support for DoIT-001, DoIT-002 and DoIT-003 has not yet been received from City
of Detroit. The amounts reported in Table 2 are the annualized amounts paid in FY2016
for these Shared Services.

Summary of Shared Services Billings and Payments
Tables 3 (GLWA as Service Provider) and 4 (DWSD as Service Provider) below explain the
following Shared Services information from the beginning of the Shared Services
Agreement, January 1, 2016. The first table is for the Shared Services, GLWA is the
provider and billing DWSD for the services. The second table is for the Shared Services,
DWSD is the provider and billing GLWA for the services.
The Shared Service Agreement (Section 5.2) states that:

“Payments for Services shall be payable monthly. Unless other specified in a Service
Delivery Schedule, payment of each invoice shall be due no later than thirty (30)
days after the date of delivery of the Invoice…”.

The above provision was not followed for FY 2016 and into FY 2017 due to significant
efforts to implement the Shared Services agreement and related business processes and
operating protocols. Now that there is regular ongoing dialog, and a pattern as we enter
the fourth years of operations, two things need to occur. First, an amendment to the
budget and related monthly billing amount if and when it is evident that the budgeted
amount is too low or too high based on the past three years of operations. Second, a
payment exchange between the two parties for amounts billed or as may be amended
based on budget.

Re:

Quarterly Investment Report through December 31, 2018 (Unaudited)

Background: As stated in section 14 of the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) Investment
Policy, quarterly reporting shall be presented to provide a clear picture of the status of the current
GLWA investment portfolio. The attached report, prepared and presented by PFM Asset
Management LLC, summarizes portfolio information through December 31, 2018 (unaudited).
Analysis: The Quarterly Investment Report complies with the requirements of Public Act 20 of
1948, as amended and the GLWA Investment Policy. GLWA is investing its funds in a diversified
portfolio which includes bank deposits, money market funds, a local government investment pool,
U.S. Treasuries, Federal Agencies, and commercial paper. All securities in the portfolio are in
compliance with the GLWA investment policy. Key metrics are provided below with additional
commentary in the attached report.
•

•

Yield to Market at Cost compared to market index (current quarter compared to prior)
o As of December 31, 2018: 2.40% vs 2.26% (3-Month Treasury Index)
o As of September 30, 2018: 2.30% vs 2.02% (3-Month Treasury Index)

Portfolio Allocation in Cash/Money Market Securities (current quarter compared to prior)
o As of December 31, 2018: 39%
o As of September 30, 2018: 34%

As GLWA continues to implement process improvements and more clearly define cash flows, the
treasury group will work with PFM Asset Management LLC to identify strategies to maximize
investment returns while meeting GLWA standards for safety and liquidity.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

 Investment Performance Report – December 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Executive Summary

PORTFOLIO RECAP
 Safety – The overall portfolio is diversified amongst cash, bank deposits, U.S. Treasuries, Federal Agencies, commercial paper, SEC-registered
money market funds, and a local government investment pool. The total credit profile of the pool is strong with over 98% of the assets invested in
bank deposits or securities that are rated within the two highest short and long-term rating classifications as established by S&P.
 Liquidity – The Authority has continued to reduce its weighting to overnight funds, with only 39% of the total assets maturing overnight.
 Return – The overall yield increased to 2.40% as of December 31, 2018 versus 2.30% at September 30, 2018. The Authority earned $10,169,274 in
investment income for fiscal year-to-date on a book value basis. Based on the current interest rate environment, the investment income earned for
the previous quarter, and assuming that the Authority maintains the same investable balances for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are projecting
that the Authority will earn approximately $20.3 million in investment income for fiscal year 2019.
 Compliance – The aggregate portfolio is in compliance with the Authority’s investment policy and Michigan Public Act 20.

The accounts at Comerica Bank get an earnings credit to offset bank fees. The funds and earnings in the Retainage account are held on behalf of the contractors and do not belong to GLWA. The
funds and earnings in the Flint Security Deposit account are held on behalf of the City of Flint and do not belong to GLWA. Note that market values move inversely to interest rates, and the recent
rise in yields has led to the overall market value being less than the book value. In addition to the totals listed above, there also exists surety bonds in the amount of $322,809,258 as of 12/31/2018.

 Investment Performance Report – December 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Investment Strategy

GLWA INVESTMENT STRATEGY
 The portfolio is in compliance with the Authority’s investment policy.
 To date, the Authority has continued to invest its funds in a mixture of short and intermediate-term investments to ensure
sufficient liquidity. There was a slight increase in funds maturing overnight at the end of December to cover early January
obligations for debt and operations.
 The aggregate portfolio was yielding 2.40% at the end of December.*
– This compares to the 2.39% yield of the Bank of America / Merrill Lynch 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as of
12/31/2018, which is a comparable market indicator.
 The Authority continues to implement a disciplined investment plan to provide improved safety and diversification and putting
every dollar to work.
 For the third quarter of FY 2019, the Authority’s investment advisor will continue to actively manage specifically benchmarked
long-term portfolios with full discretion, subject to the Authority’s investment policy.
 The Authority will continue to work with its investment manager to identify strategies in this volatile market to maximize future
investment income while meeting the objectives of safety and liquidity.
 Assuming that the Authority maintains the same investable balances for FY 2019 and the interest rate environment remains in a
similar range, we conservatively expect to earn approximately $20.3 million in interest income in FY 2019.

* Current market yield as of December 31, 2018.

Market Overview and Outlook

ECONOMIC HIGHLIGHTS UPDATE
 December was not for the faint of heart as 2018 ended with surging volatility, worldwide equity sell-offs, U.S. Treasury
yield curve inversion, trade tensions, and a partial government shutdown. Surprisingly, for the moment, some calm
has returned, with the backdrop of “steady-as-she-goes” for the U.S. economy.
 The Federal Reserve is recalibrating its monetary policy. While the median consensus of Fed governors is for two
rate hikes in 2019, the market expectation is for none (as measured by Federal Funds futures). Fed Chair Jerome
Powell tempered expectations in a recent speech, expressing that the Fed is “prepared to adjust policy quickly and
flexibly” if necessary, and other Fed policy makers have joined in tempering expectations.

 After narrowing to 12-month lows in the third quarter of calendar year 2018, spreads on commercial paper issuers
rebounded in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2018. As a result, the Authority’s portfolios benefited from additional
allocations to these high-quality, short-term credit instruments at attractive yields.
 In December, the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted between two and five-year maturities for the first time since 2007.
Yields on maturities greater than two years rallied 25 to 30 basis points, while shorter-term yields were pinned to the
steady Federal Funds rate.
 The pace of Fed rate hikes was well-telegraphed throughout 2018, and the prospect of higher rates down the road
rewarded investors who maintained a short duration bias, such as GLWA. Now, the path of future rate hikes is less
clear. As a result, we will no longer be betting on interest rate increases by employing a short duration bias.
 Cash and money market securities produce the best returns of all sectors in 2018 and were the highest in a decade.
For calendar year 2019, supported by the 2.50% overnight Federal Funds rate, the sector is expected to produce
comparable returns.

 Investment Performance Report – December 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Portfolio Mix
Cash / Money Market vs. Investments
 The Authority's liquidity requirements fluctuate each month based on operational requirements, capital funding, and debt payments. Based on a review
of historical activity and refinement of cash flow projections, the Authority has set an average target of 45% cash/money market accounts and 55%
investments for the portfolio holdings. The 13-month average at December 2018 is close to the target.
 The chart below compares the monthly allocation of the portfolio holdings to the 13-month average and the target. The slight increase in the
cash/money market holdings for December of 2018 is related to increased liquidity to meet early January debt payments and operational requirements.

The accounts at Comerica Bank get an earnings credit to offset bank fees. The earnings in the accounts at First Independence Bank is credited to the contractors and not the Authority. The funds in
the Flint Security Deposit account are held on behalf of the City of Flint and the earnings do not belong to GLWA. YTM @ Cost is the expected return, based on the original cost, the annual interest
receipts, maturity value and the time period from purchase date to maturity, stated as a percentage, on an annualized basis. YTM @ Market is the rate of return, based on the current market value,
the annual interest receipts, maturity value and time period remaining until maturity, stated as a percentage, on an annualized basis.

 Investment Performance Report – December 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Demonstration of Yield to Maturity vs. Duration
As of December 31, 2018
 The comparison agencies included in the list below were selected based on type and/or other non-performance based criteria to show a broad
range of water entities/utilities. This peer group list does not represent an endorsement of any of the public agencies or their services. The types of
funds (e.g., bond proceeds, debt service, etc.) and duration of the overall portfolios listed below as well as the various differences in permitted
investments and allowable credit capacity in state statutes (i.e., the ability or non-ability to invest in long-term corporate credit) will have a direct
impact on the corresponding yields at market.
 The overall yield of the Authority’s aggregate portfolio compares favorably to those of other short-term indices (i.e., the S&P LGIP index and the 3month U.S. Treasury index).
 The Authority does not have a potential for a longer duration portfolio when compared to other similar water entities/utilities as the Authority’s
covenants limits and restricts its ability in managing assets to a longer-term strategy.

 Investment Performance Report – December 2018

Economic Growth Remains Solid in Third Quarter
•

U.S. economic activity continued to expand at a strong pace in the third quarter
– U.S. gross domestic product (“GDP”) grew at an annual rate of 3.4%, marking the strongest back-to-back quarters
since 2014
– Consumer spending, government spending, and the rebuilding of inventories, offsetting weak business investment,
and a drop in U.S exports, were positive contributors

•

However, the rise in third quarter growth may not be sustainable, as reflected in moderated future growth forecasts
– A widening trade deficit and slower housing market activity are expected headwinds

 Investment Performance Report – December 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Market Overview and Outlook

FIXED INCOME MARKET – ECONOMIC HIGHLIGHTS
 Economic conditions, which remain solid, were characterized by:
– U.S. GDP grew at 3.4% in the third quarter (following 4.2% growth in the second quarter; both figures are the highest
since the third quarter of 2014)
– Inflation continued to hover just shy of the Fed’s objective of 2.0%, as measured by the personal consumption
expenditures (“PCE”) core price index
– Wage growth continued its ascent, maintaining an upward trend and reinforcing the desired trajectory of inflation
– The labor market remained a tailwind for the economy as the U.S. unemployment rate remained near a 50-year low
amid robust job growth
– Investment-grade credit spreads generally widened to near three-year highs
– The Fed increased short-term rates by an additional 0.25% in December (the fourth hike of 2018)
– The pace of future Fed rate hikes is uncertain heading into the new year – while median Fed projections indicate two
rate hikes in 2019, market-based measures (i.e., Fed Funds futures) reflect market expectations for no hikes this
calendar year
– Consumer confidence, albeit still elevated, retraced from a two-decade high at year-end as markets digested Fed
speak, equity jitters, and the government’s partial shutdown
 U.S. Treasury yields reversed course during the quarter as maturities beyond one year declined by 30 – 40 basis points
(0.30% to 0.40%) as investors sought safe havens:
– The yield curve ended the quarter inverted as the 1-year Treasury (2.60%) out-yielded all tenors out to seven years
– Short-term Treasury Bill yields rose by 15 – 30 basis points
– The yield on the 2-year Treasury declined by 33 basis points to end the quarter at 2.49%
– The yield on the 10-year Treasury declined by 38 basis points to end the quarter at 2.68%

 Investment Performance Report – December 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Market Overview and Outlook

FIXED INCOME MARKET – ECONOMIC HIGHLIGHTS
 Investors gravitated toward lower-risk assets through the final months of 2018 as volatility surged, stocks lost their footing,
credit spreads widened, and the belly of the curve (maturities between one and five years) began trading at rates lower than
shorter and longer-term securities (maturities one year or less and maturities greater than five years); U.S. Treasury yields
reversed course during the quarter as maturities beyond one year declined by 30 – 40 basis points (0.30% to 0.40%)
 While the path of future Fed rate hikes is less clear than in recent years, the market expects future tightening (additional Fed
rate hikes) to be modest; further, political gridlock adds additional uncertainty
 The outlook for some of the major investment-grade fixed-income sectors are as follows:
– Federal Agency spreads (incremental yield) remain very narrow as most maturities offer less than five basis points
(0.05%) of incremental yield relative to U.S. Treasuries
– Short-term money market investors continue to reap the rewards of current monetary policy as the Fed Funds
effective rate now nears 2.50%; short-term commercial paper investments have since normalized following very
narrow yield differences at year-end, and once again provide an attractive, high-quality source of incremental income

 AGENDA ITEM #7C

Date: February 15, 2019
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager
Re:

Update: GLWA One Water Charge Methodology Initiatives

Background: GLWA continues to pursue strategies to ensure equitability and stability in
its wholesale water and sewer charge structure, while embracing the best available,
verifiable information to prepare recommended charges. In 2017, GLWA identified a
timeline for the related initiatives to plan for, and understand, how these strategies impact
member partner water and/or sewer charges. Table 1 - Charge Methodology Initiatives
is the most current version of that timeline which was shared with GLWA’s member
partners in May 2018.

Analysis: Since Table 1 - Charge Methodology Initiatives has been presented, GLWA has
completed the following water initiatives and the results of which were included in the
proposed FY 2020 water service charges.
1) The Contract Alignment Process (CAP); and

2) The Phase 2 of the Units of Service Study for GLWA’s non-master metered member
partners.

One of the key GLWA projects to be completed during calendar year 2019 is the
Wastewater Master Plan (WWMP). This project includes modeling and analysis of flows in
the sewage collection system and Combined Sewage Overflow (CSO) Facilities as well as
flows and treatment processes through the Water Resource Recovery Facility. Several flow
scenarios will be evaluated with the purposes of planning for future capacities and
developing updated short and long term CSO and wet weather operational plans.
Additionally, recommendations for improvement in treatment processes as well as
evaluation of long-term solids disposal and disinfection methods will be evaluated and
proposed. While this study is designed to establish the most efficient and effective overall
wastewater operating scenario, it will provide valuable information for the equitable
allocation of costs. The Wastewater Master Plan is scheduled to be completed in October
2019.

Page 116

 A topic related to wastewater that arose outside the WWMP, began with a June 7, 2017
Board Resolution related to peaking and the FY 2021 Charges (see attached Board
resolution). Peaking and other considerations are being evaluated by two work groups
through the Member Partner Outreach efforts: Charges Methodology Work Group and
Sewer Shares Work Group. As we work to strategically and efficiently align initiatives, a
timing question arises as to revisiting shares and methodology (with peaking as a new
concept) before completion of the Wastewater Master Plan (WWMP)– especially as it
relates to a regional perspective. Below is a high-level summary of the WWMP timing from
GLWA’s Planning Group for calendar year 2019. Much of the financial analysis requested
by the planning consultant is for May and June 2019 with a target completion date of
October 2019.
January - Complete investigation of existing systems
February - Complete models
March Formulate alternatives by water body
April Select regional alternatives
May Review water quality impacts of regional alternatives
June Review costs of regional alternatives
July Draft report submitted and continued discussion of alternatives and costs
August - Decisions on alternatives, discussion of cost allocations
September-Final Draft Report
October - Project Completion

Table 2- Charge Methodology Initiatives includes the proposed changes as a discussion
draft to the original Table 1 timelines for each initiative. The proposed updates are shown
in gray. Since the Wastewater Master Plan will include information that will be vital to the
next Sewer Shares update initiatives, we have extended the timelines in this draft. GLWA
will continue to meet with the wastewater member partners via the Sewer Shares
Workgroup and Sewer Charges Methodology Workgroup during 2019 to complete the
technical and financial evaluations that are necessary for the next Sewer Shares Update.
Based on the revised schedule, it is anticipated that the results of these initiatives will be
included in the future charges.

As a reminder as it relates to sewer SHARES which emerged from the 2013 Rate
Simplification, the initial “Rate Period” was three years (FY 2015, 2016, and 2017) and the
working understanding was that the second “Rate Period” was five years subject to
evaluation of first “Rate Period”. After changes were made related to strength of flow as a
result of the Member Partner Outreach/strength of flow report dated March 15, 2017 for
FY 2018, the second “Rate Period” was amended to be three years (FY 2018, 2019, and
2020) rather than five years.

Page 117

 Also included in Table 2 - Charge Methodology Initiatives are changes in the timeline for
several water initiatives. As GLWA gets closer to taking its Northeast Water Treatment
Plant offline as a treatment facility, we will be embarking on initiatives to evaluate possible
changes to the water charges model. This includes looking at alternate ways to allocate
pumping and transmission costs and reviewing the distance and elevation concepts. As
shown in Table 2 - Charge Methodology Initiatives, we may want to consider extending
those schedules into calendar year 2020, to accommodate the resources needed to
complete the Sewer Shares Update. Based on the revised schedule, it is anticipated that the
results of these initiatives would be included in future water charges.
GLWA management believes it is important to work with its member partners to deliver on
each of these initiatives and to do so in a manner that is consistent with having best
available information. It is also important to manage internal and external resources
effectively to deliver a quality outcome for all stakeholders. This may result in strategically
revising the timeline for the completion of certain projects in order to achieve these goals.

RE:

Resolution Regarding Consideration of Peaking in Sewer Share
Methodology

MOTION
As a part of its budget deliberations, the Board of Directors (Board) of the Great Lakes
Water Authority (GLWA) notes that the Budget reflects an adjustment to the weighting of
certain strength of flow factors in the methodology for determining sewer shares, that the
sewer shares and sewer shares factors will be next adjusted by the Board for Fiscal Year
2021, that GLWA is actively engaging its customers regarding the factors to be
considered as a part of any Fiscal Year 2021 adjustment, and that in addition to any other
factors suggested by customers for consideration in that process, the Board requests that
peaking be included in the factors considered as a part of the Fiscal Year 2021
determination of what, if any, adjustment should be made to sewer shares and sewer
share factors.

From: Nicolette N. Bateson, CPA
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer
Re:

Contractual Services and Initiatives Planning

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority’s (GLWA) began operations on January 1,
2016 with many of the financial related contractual services based on three-year terms for
those agreements.

Highlights/Analysis: The concurrent expiration and/or transition of key contracts places
risk in the progress of financial and process improvement matters, potential disruption in
member partner matters, and significant workload imbalances. For this reason, a plan for
overlapping contractual service terms, scopes, and initiatives has been drafted and is
attached for discussion with the Audit Committee. It is intended that a second draft of this
plan will be reviewed the Audit Committee in March 2019.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

Revenue and Expense Budget to Actual – Pro-rata Benchmark of 41.7%
Most revenue and
expense areas are within
5% of the pro-rata
benchmark.

Supplies & Other: Due to
timing of of one-time or
annual expenses.

Billable Shared Services:
Ongoing analysis has
supported a need to
decrease the budget for
Shared Services billings.
December budget amendments will address this variance.

Sewer O&M: A refined centralized administrative cost allocation analysis reduced expenses
(offset by an increase to Water O&M).

Capital Program Allocation: Ongoing analysis is in process to better understand the extent
of variance is due to non-capitalizable maintenance programs versus capitalizable projects.
Chemicals: Expected variance as usage does not follow a 1/12th monthly budget pattern.

The MBO Trust – Net Receipts table differs from the Trust Receipts and Disbursements section of this
Financial Report because the MBO Trust – Net Receipts table reflects the impact of a $6,527,200 adjustment
completed in December 2018 for the final bad debt lookback adjustment.

 Financial Report
Budget to Actual Analysis
for the Month Ended November 30, 2018

The Monthly Budget to Actual Analysis report includes the following three sections.

1. Revenue Requirement Budget Basis Analysis
2. Operations & Maintenance Budget – Major Budget Categories
3. Alignment of Operations & Maintenance Budget Priorities – Expense Variance Analysis

Revenue Requirement Budget Basis Analysis

GLWA’s annual revenue requirement represents a) the basis for calculating Member Partner charges
and b) the Master Bond Ordinance flow of funds. The budget basis is not the same as the full accrual
basis used for financial reporting although the revenues and operations and maintenance expense
are largely reported on an accrual basis. The primary deviation between the revenue requirement
basis to the financial reporting basis is the treatment of debt service, legacy pension obligations, and
lease related activities. The Revenue Requirement Basis is foundational to GLWA’s daily operations,
financial plan, and of most interest to key stakeholders.
Table 1A – Water Revenue Requirement Budget and Table 1B – Sewer Revenue Requirement
Budget presents a year-over-year budget to actual performance report. There have been no budget
amendments to date. The revenue requirement budget is accounted for in the operations and
maintenance fund for each system. Since this report is for November 2018, the pro-rata benchmark
is 41.7% (5 of 12 months of the fiscal year).
Items of key interest discussed below are highlighted in gold on Tables 1A (Water) and 1B (Sewer).

1. For both systems, FY 2019 revenues are at or above target and are consistent with the prior
year (FY 2018) at the same time. Detailed schedules related to revenues are provided in the
Wholesale Billings, Collections, and Receivables section of this financial report binder.
2. The operations and maintenance (O&M) expense for the water system is slightly above the
pro-rata benchmark for FY 2019 at 42.6%. Conversely the sewer system O&M expenses, at
34.2%, is less than the pro-rata benchmark. This variance between the funds is partly due to
a project in-process to refine centralized and administrative cost allocations. It is likely that
this will result in a budget amendment after the December 2018 month-end close.
3. The remaining revenue requirements for both systems are funded on a 1/12th basis each
month in accordance with the Master Bond Ordinance. The debt service amount shown on
the table is accounted for on that same basis. In October 2018, the GLWA had a successful
bond sale which will provide a positive budget variance for both systems. That amendment
will be reported with the second quarter budget amendments.
4. Overall total revenue requirements for both systems are in line with the benchmark.
5. For the sewer system, the FY 2019 year-to-date revenue requirements exceed revenues by
$11.6 million. This is a timing difference between revenues and revenue requirement (i.e.
expenses) which is expected to be reversed by mid-fiscal year.
6. Other revenues are one-time and unusual items that do not fit an established revenue
category. Both the water and sewer systems will vary from budget due to the nature of the
items recorded in this category, For example, in FY 2018 the variance reported for the sewer
system was due, in large part, to fire remediation insurance proceeds received.

 Budget to Actual Analysis
for the Month Ended November 30, 2018

Operations & Maintenance Budget – Major Budget Categories
The year-over-year benchmark ratio as of November 30, 2018, is 41.7% (five months). When
comparing FY 2019 to FY 2018 in Table 2 – Operations & Maintenance Budget – Major Budget
Categories, it would appear that the spending has increased. This is true in some instances; however,
the greater impact is that the Financial Reporting & Accounting Team has implemented a full accrual
basis for interim financial statements during the latter half of FY 2018. This variance anomaly will
decrease as we proceed through FY 2019.

In addition to the four major budget categories, an internal charge cost center for employee benefits
is shown in the table below. If the number is positive, it indicates that the internal cost allocation rate
charges to other cost centers is not sufficient. A negative number indicates a surplus in the internal
cost center. A moderate surplus is preferred as it provides a hedge for mid-year benefit program cost
adjustments (premiums adjust on January 1 each year) as well as managing risk as the program is
partially self-insured.
Table 2 – Operations & Maintenance Budget – Major Budget Categories

Alignment of Operations & Maintenance Budget Priorities – Expense
Variance Analysis
The purpose of Table 3 – Expense Variance Analysis is to evaluate whether the actual spend rate
within a natural cost category is in alignment with the budget. Given the effort to develop an accurate
budget, a variance is a red flag of a potential budget amendment or misalignment of priorities.

In total, the O&M expenses are at 37.5% which is reasonably close to the pro-rata benchmark of
41.7%. This positive variance equates to a dollar amount of $13.1 million. The expense category
commentary is provided below for items highlighted on Table 3.
Personnel Costs: The overall category is on target at 39.7% through November 2018.

Utilities: The overall category is slightly lower than the benchmark; coming in at 38.7%. Variances
in this category are not unexpected given the seasonality of the operations. In comparing FY 2019 to
FY 2018 the expenses appear more in line with the budget in FY 2019. This is due in large part to the
month-end closing process improvements implemented during the latter half of FY 2018.
All amounts are unaudited unless otherwise noted.

GLWA Audit Committee February 15, 2019

 Budget to Actual Analysis
for the Month Ended November 30, 2018

Chemicals: This category is lower than the benchmark; coming in at 34.5% through November 2018.
This variance is not unexpected as usage varies throughout the year. Staff is working on
enhancements to future monthly financial reports to correlate spending with operational metrics.

Supplies & Other: This category is lower than the benchmark; coming in at 28.1% through November
2018. An internal review is underway to better understand the causes for this variance. Given the
nature of the items in this category are subject to one-time expenses that do not occur evenly
throughout the year, this variance is not a concern at this time.
Contractual Services: The overall category is on target at 40.2% through November 2018.

Capital Program Allocation: This category is lower than the benchmark; coming in at 34.3%
through November 2018. In July 2018, GLWA launched a time keeping software (including an app),
BigTime, to make it easier for team members to report their time spent on direct capital delivery.
New processes are currently being evaluated to better understand staff resource allocation when the
budget was developed versus how time is actually incurred – including time allocated to maintenance
programs versus capitalizable projects.

Shared Services: The shared services reimbursement is comprised of both labor (tracked via
BigTime) and expenses, such as annual fees for software licensing. Staff from both GLWA and DWSD
have been working together to evaluate and refine the budget for the shared services agreements.
Beginning with the December 2018 close, adjustments are being made to both the billings and
accounting accruals to bring them in line with the amended shared services budget. These
adjustments will be reflected on the December 2018 Budget to Actual Analysis report.

Audit Committee February 15, 2019

 Basic Financial Statements
for the Month Ended November 30, 2018

In general, the Statement of Net Position reflects a mature organization with no unexpected trends.
One item of note as of November 30, 2018 is that there is a decrease in cash and increase in
investments since June 30, 2018 (highlighted in gold on the table). These differences are due to the
November 30, 2018 and June 30, 2018 investments being reported at book value and market value,
respectively, and investments were converted to cash, at June 30, 2018, in preparation of the July 1,
2018 bond payments.

An ongoing challenge is the Net Position Deficit. The underlying causes took years to build (largely
heavy use of debt to finance capital asset investment versus a strategic blend of debt, state revolving
funds, and cash). The effect is reflected in GLWA’s high debt interest expense. The GLWA is regularly
updating the FY 2030 forecast which helps to provide a pathway to a positive Net Position.

Footnotes to Statement of Net Position
a. Cash and Investments include restricted amounts and are reported at book value. Investments
at June 30, 2018 are reported at market value.
b. Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds is shown at the gross level for sub-fund activity.
c. Other Assets primarily consists of the contractual obligation receivable from DWSD related to
reimbursement of bonded indebtedness for local system improvements.
d. Cash Held FBO Advance (for benefit of) DWSD and Cash Held FBO DWSD represents the net
difference between DWSD retail cash received from customers and net financial commitments as
outlined in the Master Bond Ordinance.
e. Deferred Inflow and Deferred Outflow relate to financing activity and GLWA’s share of the legacy
General Retirement System (GRS) pension obligation.
f. Liabilities - Short-term include accounts payable, retainage payable, and certain accrued
liabilities. Some items, such as compensated absences and worker’s compensation, are reviewed
periodically but are only adjusted on an interim basis if there is a material change.
g. Other Liabilities account for the cash receipts set aside for the Budget Stabilization Fund and the
Water Residential Assistance Program.
h. Liabilities – Long-term include bonds payable, lease payable, and legacy GRS pension liabilities.

i.

Net Position Deficit is defined by the accounting standards as the residual of all other elements
presented in a statement of financial position. It is the difference between (a) assets and
deferred outflows of resources and (b) liabilities and deferred inflows of resources. A net deficit
occurs when the liabilities and deferred inflows exceed assets and deferred outflows. GLWA’s
net deficit is largely driven by an increase in depreciation expense as a result of the increase in
the acquisition valuation approach for recording capital asset values in the opening Statement
of Net Position on January 1, 2016. Efforts are underway to evaluate the net operating effect
of this matter over the long term.

Construction Work in Progress Summary
for the Month Ended November 30, 2018

The Monthly Construction Work in Progress (CWIP) Summary includes the following.
1. Water System Construction Work in Progress costs incurred to date.
2. Sewer System Construction Work in Progress costs incurred to date.

Water System Construction Work in Progress

Water System CWIP Spend: Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) capital improvement projects
generally span two or more years due to size and complexity. Therefore, the GLWA Board of
Directors adopts a biennial budget that establishes allowable amounts for construction spending
during that period to support a five-year capital improvement plan (CIP). The CIP is a five-year,
rolling plan also reviewed and formally adopted by the GLWA Board of Directors.
As of November 2018, the Water system incurred nearly $28.3 million of construction costs to date.
This is 102.8% of the total fiscal year 2019 prorated, budgeted spend and a steady increase over the
prior period.

Note: These interim reports are prepared on a modified cash basis. Known expenses, where material in
nature, have been accrued.
Chart 1 – Construction Work in Progress Spend – Water outlines monthly CWIP
spending trends against a prorated, monthly budget amount. The prorated budget
amount is calculated by dividing the total fiscal year 2019 board-approved capital
improvement plan by twelve, equal months.

All amounts are unaudited unless otherwise noted.

DWSD Retail Sewer Billings and Collections

Retail billing basis: DWSD bills retail customers monthly. Customers are billed throughout the
month in cycles based on a meter reading schedule beginning with residential accounts and ending
with commercial and industrial customers.
Table 3 - DWSD Retail Sewer Billings shows the FY 2019 sewer billed revenue which
are provided by DWSD staff. As of November 30, 2018, the DWSD usage was at
103.05% of the budget and billed revenue was at 99.69% of budget.

DWSD Retail Sewer Collections: The collections represent payments made by DWSD retail
customers. These receipts are deposited directly into a lockbox with a trustee for administration of
the flow of funds defined by GLWA’s Master Bond Ordinance.
Table 4 – DWSD Retail Sewer Collections shows collections by month for the past 12
months compared to collections for the prior year as well as the calculated difference
between the periods.

Note: DWSD is working on the additional, billings to collections rolling average report
requested by the GLWA Audit Committee at the December 21, 2018 meeting. That will be
included in this report when made available by DWSD.

Note: Services are provided to the Detroit Water & Sewerage Department (DWSD) via a Water
and Sewer Services Agreement (WSSA). See the “Retail Revenues, Receivables, and Collections
Report” section of this monthly report.
Wholesale Water Billing Basis: Beginning with FY 2016, wholesale water charges were
restructured to create a more stable revenue stream by using a historical rolling average to
project customer volumes which accounts for 40% of the monthly charges and 60% of the
annual customer revenue requirement as a monthly fixed charge.
Table 1 - Wholesale Water Billings shows the FY 2019 water billed usage and
revenues. As of November 30, 2018, the billed usage was at 101.17% of budget
and billed revenue at 101.05% of budget. Billings and usage from the City of
Flint are included as they were assumed in the FY 2019 Budget.

Wholesale Water Collections: The collections represent payments made by wholesale
customers. These receipts are deposited directly into a lockbox with a trustee for
administration of the flow of funds defined by GLWA’s Master Bond Ordinance.
Table 2 - Wholesale Water Collections shows collections by month for the
past 12 months compared to collections for the prior year as well as the
calculated difference between the periods. Variability in collections in the
current year are associated with timing of the billing cycle. Bills for December,
February and August were posted later than usual due to holiday conflicts and
higher volumes of meter reads requiring review (associated with meter issues
and water main breaks). While at times unavoidable, the GLWA billing team
is identifying steps to prevent delays wherever possible.

All amounts are unaudited unless otherwise noted.

18

Note: Services are provided to the Detroit Water & Sewerage Department via a Water and
Sewer Services Agreement (WSSA). See the “Retail Revenues, Receivables, and Collections
Report” section of the monthly report.
Wholesale Sewer Billing Basis: Beginning in FY 2015, the “sewer rate simplification”
initiative was applied which provides for a stable revenue stream and predictability for our
member partners. Wholesale sewer customers are billed a fixed monthly fee based upon the
annual revenue requirement.
Table 3 - Wholesale Sewer Billings shows the FY 2019 sewer billed revenue.
Consistent with expectations as a result of sewer rate simplification, billed
revenue is at 100.00% of budget through November 30, 2018.

Wholesale Sewer Collections: The collections represent payments made by wholesale
customers. These receipts are deposited directly into a lockbox with a trustee for
administration of the flow of funds defined by GLWA’s Master Bond Ordinance.

Table 4 - Wholesale Sewer Collections shows collections by month for the past 12
months compared to collections for the prior year as well as the calculated difference
between the periods. Variability in collections in the current year are associated with
timing of the billing cycle.

The shift in wholesale sewer collection patterns is largely attributable to the timing
of payments received from one customer. Starting in February 2018, Wayne County’s
(Rouge Valley, NE Wayne and Wayne County #3) payments were received just after
the first of the calendar month for one invoice (showing no collection for the previous
month) and the subsequent invoice was paid in the same calendar month. This
pattern has continued through November 30, 2018. At no time during this period has
Wayne County been over 45 days delinquent in its sewer payments to GLWA. Given
the payment amount of $6.8 million, this produces noticeable swings in collection
volumes by month.
Note: Revenues reported in Table 1 below will differ from revenues reported on the
Budget to Actual and Basic Financial Reports because Table 1 reports actual revenues
billed, whereas the Budget to Actual and Basic Financial statements use accrual-based
accounting.

All amounts are unaudited unless otherwise noted.

The Monthly Trust Receipts & Disbursements Report includes the following.

1. GLWA Trust Receipts & Disbursements – Net Cash Flows and Receipts
2. DWSD Trust Receipts & Disbursements – Net Cash Flows and Receipts
3. Combined System Trust Receipts & Disbursements – Net Cash Flows

GLWA Trust Receipts & Disbursements

Net Cash Flows and Receipts Basis: The trusts established pursuant to the Master Bond Ordinance
(MBO) outline a flow of funds that governs the priority of the application of cash receipts from both
the regional wholesale (i.e. Great Lakes Water Authority or GLWA) and local retail (i.e. Detroit Water
& Sewerage Department or DWSD) activities which are further separated by the water system and
the sewage disposal system.
This report provides an ongoing status of the net cash flow of both organizations (GLWA and DWSD)
to fund their allocated share of Master Bond Ordinance requirements in accordance with the leases
for the regional systems. This report begins with the operational effective date of the GLWA on
January 1, 2016.
Table 1 – GLWA Net Cash Flows from Trust Receipts & Disbursements provides a
summary of cash receipt collections and required MBO transfers by fiscal year as well
as a total of all activity for GLWA since inception at January 1, 2016. Fiscal year 2019
reflects five months of activity to date.
Through November 30, 2018 the water fund cash receipts exceeded MBO
disbursements by 24% with a ratio of 13% since January 1, 2016. Through November
30, 2018, the sewer fund cash receipts exceeded MBO disbursements by 6% and by a
ratio of 4% since January 1, 2016.
Chart 1 – GLWA 12-Month Net Receipts – Water outlines monthly cash receipt trends
across two points of reference for the regional water system—current year and prior
year. The black line at the zero highlights the minimum goal for net receipts.

Chart 2 – GLWA 12-Month Net Receipts – Sewer outlines monthly cash receipt trends
across two points of reference for the regional sewer system—current year and prior
year. The black line at the zero highlights the minimum goal for net receipts.

This report provides an ongoing status of the net cash flow of both organizations (GLWA and DWSD)
to fund their allocated share of Master Bond Ordinance requirements in accordance with the leases
for the regional systems. This report begins with the operational effective date of the GLWA on
January 1, 2016.
Table 2 – DWSD Net Cash Flows from Trust Receipts & Disbursements provides a
summary of cash receipt collections and required MBO transfers by fiscal year as well
as a total of all activity for DWSD since inception at January 1, 2016. Fiscal year 2019
reflects five months of activity to date.
Through November 30, 2018 the local water fund cash receipts exceeded MBO
disbursements by 5% with a historical ratio of cash receipts exceeding MBO
disbursements at 4% since January 1, 2016.

Through November 30, 2018, the local sewer fund cash receipts fell short of MBO
disbursements by -5% with a historic shortfall of -7% since January 1, 2016. DWSD
has proposed a long-term plan to address this structural shortfall. The Reconciliation
Committee also monitors this balance as part of its quarterly meetings.

Note: In December 2018, GLWA recorded a $6.5 million sewer lookback adjustment for
DWSD related to the April 2018 MOU. This eliminates the DWSD sewer shortfall reported
through November 30, 2018.
