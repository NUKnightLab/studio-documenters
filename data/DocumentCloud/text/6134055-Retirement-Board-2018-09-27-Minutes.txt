The next order of business was review and adoption of the orders by the Board as submitted by the Board’s
counsel.
In the matter of Kimberly Nelson, the Board finds Nelson's medical condition is disabling which entitles her
to an ordinary disability benefit. The Board further finds that Nelson has not met her burden of proving her
disability is the result of an identifiable act of duty incident. Nelson's application for a duty disability benefit
is therefore denied, and Nelson is granted an ordinary disability benefit as more fully defined in the Pension
Act.
It was moved by Trustee Beyna, seconded by Trustee Wright that the Board approve the order regarding
Kimberly Nelson.

Executive Director Tuczak summarized for the Board the events of September 26, 2018, the first day
allowed for the filing of petitions for this year’s Trustee Elections.
At 9:00 a.m., the posted time on the Fund’s website, the Fund's staff began to accept petitions. The rules
indicate that the candidates' order on the ballot is determined by the order in which the petitions are filed.
There were candidates in the hallway prior to the opening of the office. The Fund had intended to go with the
order by which the candidates were in the hallway. The Fund had one candidate who expressed concern that
the order of accepting petitions, which coincided with the order on the ballot, did not appear to be in
accordance with his view of the rules. The candidate believed that at 9:00 a.m. when the petitions drop-off
began, anybody present should be put into a lottery for the order on the ballot. When the candidate voiced
this issue on September 26, the other two candidates that were ahead of him in the hallway prior to petition
submission were no longer present. To address this matter in a fair manner, all affected candidates of this
group were invited to be present at this September 2018 Board meeting to resolve this matter.
Candidate Saladino addressed the Retirement Board.
Candidate Kelly addressed the Retirement Board.
Upon agreement with the candidates present, the Retirement Board indicated that the positioning on the
ballot for the 2018 election for annuitant representative will be 1) Lappe, 2) Kelly, 3) Saladino, and
following in order whoever else submits petitions.
After hearing from the candidates, other matters concerning the election were deferred to the Sufficiency
meeting scheduled for 1:00 p.m. on October 5, 2018, which is the appropriate time to address any further
election issues.
The President turned the meeting over to the Recording Secretary. Review of the agenda was as follows:

The next issue Executive Director Tuczak reviewed was the rescheduling of the Election Petition
Sufficiency meeting of Friday, October 5, 2018 to 1:00 pm. The time change was to accommodate
attendance of a quorum.
Ms. Tuczak next discussed a disability status matter regarding Officer Margaret M. Graszer. Based
on the Board’s consulting physician report on her current medical condition, she has been scheduled
for a status review. This status review was originally scheduled for June of 2018. However, Officer
Graszer provided communication to the Board requesting a continuance to September 2018, due to
her husband’s medical condition. Such continuance provided a timeframe longer than the typical
practice of the Board. The Board granted her a continuance to September 2018. Prior to sending out
the September 2018 Notices of Hearing, the Fund’s staff received a request from her for an additional
continuance, to April 2019, again due to the medical condition of her husband. She was then not
scheduled for a September 2018 hearing. Trustee Beyna indicated that he had spoken with Officer
Graszer and she assured him that she would attend a hearing in November if a continuance to such
date was granted.
It was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Beyna that the Board continue Margaret
Graszer’s status review to the November 2018 Board meeting, with suspension of her November
disability benefits if she fails to appear at the hearing.

Ms. Tuczak next discussed renewal of the Fund’s staff health insurance, which has a renewal date of
December 1, 2018. The Executive Director provided a cost analysis of two different alternatives. The
Fund has 21 employees and approximately 10 retirees on the health insurance plan. The Fund retirees
were not employed with the City, therefore are not eligible for any City plans. Option A covers all
active and retired members with all cost increases associated with retiree coverage assumed by the
retiree; any subsidy by the Fund would remain constant. Option B eliminates the retirees from the
plan with no further subsidy.
After discussion, it was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Beyna that the Board approve
Option A for the renewal of the Fund employee and retiree health insurance.
