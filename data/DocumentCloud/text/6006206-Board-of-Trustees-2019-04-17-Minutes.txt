


Appointment of Nick Khouri to the Investment Committee
o The Board of Trustees received correspondence dated February 26, 2019,
from the Investment Committee regarding the appointment/confirmation of
former State Treasurer, Nick Khouri to the Investment Committee. The
Board of Trustees resolved at its March 6, 2019 meeting to decline that
request and not accept Mr. Khouri’s nomination to the Investment
Committee. Correspondence stating such was forwarded to the
Investment Committee with a copy to State Treasurer Eubanks as well as
the Foundation for Detroit’s Future. At its April 3, 2019 meeting, the Board
received an update from its General Counsel and CIO that the Investment
Committee received the Board’s correspondence and still confirmed Mr.
Khouri’s appointment. The Board then resolved to provide additional
correspondence to the Investment Committee, with copies to both the
Governor and Mayor regarding the process and confirmation of Mr.
Khouri. A draft of this correspondence is attached to the Legal report;
attachment A. Before that draft could be finalized and sent, David
Sowerby, on behalf of the independent members of the Investment
Committee provided correspondence to the Executive Director dated April
12, 2019, which is attached as Attachment B for the Board’s review.
o The Board of Trustees engaged in discussion regarding the
appointment/certification of Independent Investment Committee member
Nick Khouri. The Board directed General Counsel to send correspondence
to the State Treasurer as well as the Governor and Mayor indicating their
disapproval of the appointment of Mr. Khouri. The Board of Trustees has
also extended an invitation to the current General Investment Committee
Chairperson, Kerrie Vanden Bosch as well as Independent Committee
member David Sowerby to attend an upcoming Board meeting.
