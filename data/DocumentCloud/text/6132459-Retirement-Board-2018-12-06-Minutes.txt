The Executive Director then reported on the status of the engagement with Novitas Business &
Technology (Novitas) who provides coding development and maintenance services for the Fund’s
pension administration system. She stated that the Fund was recently notified of personnel changes
at Novitas that will sharply impact its ability to provide coding development services to the Fund.
Other services provided have also been impacted with the personnel change. Because of these
developments, Novitas has entered into a teaming agreement with another provider, Bradley
Consulting, who can assist in providing such services. The Fund’s contract does not provide for
such arrangement. In addition, the current contract expires on December 31, 2018. Given the issues
discussed, the Executive Director proposed that the Fund engage external counsel to negotiate a
renewal of the agreement with Novitas, incorporating the new teaming agreement, and the most
favorable termination clause possible, but to request that their fees be reduced by $10,000 annually
due to the disruption to the Fund with the personnel changes and involvement of external counsel for
contract review. Based upon discussions with Mr. Chang, President of Novitas, Ms. Tuczak stated
that the Fund’s programming code is stored in a cloud environment which the Fund can access
through an escrow account. In addition, the former Novitas employee no longer has access to the
Fund’s data or code.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Fitzgerald that the Fund engage Burke
Burns & Pinelli, Ltd. to negotiate on the Fund’s behalf a renewal of the contract with Novitas for a
period not to exceed one-year, with the most favorable terms and termination clause, including, but
not limited to, a reduction of $10,000 in the annual fee. It was further moved that Fund counsel and
Fund staff take all action reasonable necessary to effectuate the foregoing including the execution
and delivery of any related written agreement on behalf of the Fund by the Executive Director.
