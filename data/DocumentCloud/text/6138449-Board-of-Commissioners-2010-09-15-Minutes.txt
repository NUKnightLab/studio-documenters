A RESOLUTION CALLING ON THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO
AMEND THE PROPERTY TAX CODE TO EXEMPT COOK COUNTY

10

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 15, 2010
FROM THE APPLICATION OF PUBLIC ACT 96-1329
WHEREAS, On July 27, 2010, Governor Quinn signed House Bill 6126 into immediate effect as Public
Act 96-1329 (“PA 96-1329”); and
WHEREAS, PA 96-1329 amended Section 21-150 of the Illinois Property Tax Code to require that “all
applications for judgment and order of sale for taxes and special assessments on delinquent properties
shall be made within 90 days after the second installment due date”; and
WHEREAS, PA 96-1329 “â€¦never was intended to apply to Cook County” as reflected in the email as
Exhibit A from Will County Treasurer, Pat McGuire, to the Cook County Treasurer’s Office; and
WHEREAS, Cook County taxpayers are experiencing an overwhelming number of real property
foreclosures during these difficult economic times, and PA 96-1329 will further adversely affect Cook
County taxpayers by significantly shortening the period of time in which a taxpayer may pay delinquent
property taxes before their exposure to public sale, which in turn will put many thousands more Cook
County taxpayers at risk of losing their homes and businesses; and
WHEREAS, PA 96-1329 will necessitate that tax sale delinquency lists be finalized for publication only
two (2) months (or less) after the second installment due date, and based upon historical data it is
anticipated that the number of Cook County properties advertised for sale will more than double; and
WHEREAS, as a result of the anticipated increase in the number of Cook County properties advertised
for sale, the required certified mailing and newspaper publication costs, and tax sale automation expenses,
associated with the tax sale are projected to more than double; and
WHEREAS, it is anticipated that PA 96-1329 will result, year after year, in an overlap of the Annual Tax
Sale and the first installment property tax collection period; and
WHEREAS, PA 96-1329 will give rise to numerous additional financial consequences adverse to Cook
County taxpayers and Cook County, including substantially increased costs incurred by the State’s
Attorney’s Office, Treasurer’s Office and the Circuit Court as a result of an expected surge in the volume
of sales in error.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urge the
Illinois General Assembly to consider the risk of loss of homes and businesses by Cook County taxpayers
and the adverse financial consequences to Cook County that will result from the unfunded mandates of
PA 96-1329 and therefore to promptly pass legislation exempting counties with more than 3,000,000
inhabitants from its application.
Approved and adopted this 15th day of September 2010.

Subject: Amendatory veto language for HB 6126
Colleagues,
Christ Balich of Gov. Quinn’s office this afternoon faxed me a letter dated June 3, 2010, from Cook
County Treasurer Maria Pappas to Gov.Quinn requesting an amendatory veto of HB 6126, the bill which
would allow a county treasurer to hold the annual tax sale any week in November.
To my knowledge, HB 6126 never was intended to apply to Cook County. However, my and Christ’s
examination of the bill this afternoon found no language exempting Cook County. Christ said that as long
as “both sides” agree on amendatory language, he would include the amendatory language in the bill
review he will forward to Gov. Quinn.
The deadline for the Governor to act on the bill is July 27. Christ told me the Governor does not like to
wait until the final day to act.
I just spoke with Jeff Hoffenberg, a lawyer on Pappas’ staff. We drafted the following language to insert
in HB 6126 at line seven before the word “Except”: “In any county with less than 3,000,000 inhabitants.”
I told Jeff I wanted to run this language by the bills’ sponsors, Sen. AJ Wilhelmi and Rep. Jack McGuire,
and Tim Bramlet. That’s the purpose of this email.
I’ll be on vacation from tomorrow through next Monday, July 12. I won’t be looking at email. My cell
phone is (815) 263-7739.
I appreciate everyone’s cooperation.
Sincerely,

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 15, 2010
ROBERT B. STEELE AND LARRY SUFFREDIN, COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
WHEREAS, the current economic conditions present a bilateral challenge for the public sector, as
revenues continue to decline concurrent with an increase in demand for the essential services that
government is mandated to provide; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has approved a reduction in the sales tax rate for
Cook County, effective July 1, 2010; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has approved 13 consecutive annual budgets
with no increase in the County’s share of the property tax levy, thus freezing the amount of general funds
received from property taxes at the 1996 level of $720 million; and
WHEREAS, the property tax levy and the sales tax are the two largest sources of revenue to fund the
operations of Cook County government; and
WHEREAS, zero growth in the property tax levy over a 13 year period, combined with a decrease in
revenue due to a reduction in the sales tax rate, will necessitate a renewed focus on core missions of Cook
County government, an adjustment in priorities, and a curtailment in overall spending; and
WHEREAS, efficiencies gained due to implementation of new technology initiatives must result in a
measurable and immediate savings of manual labor and associated costs; and
WHEREAS, streamlined work flows can decrease the amount of time required for completion of
mission-related tasks, leading to greater productivity with a lower rate of error; and
WHEREAS, emphasizing a focus on outcomes is essential to determining the method and scope of
reforming internal policies and procedures, to ensure that any changes in the way government operates
will result in a higher level of service to the public at a reduced cost; and
WHEREAS, an estimated $300 million revenue reduction for Fiscal Year 2011 is projected, thus
indicating that due diligence and advanced planning will be essential to implementing the systemic
reforms necessary for absorption of the revenue loss with minimal disruption to public service.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners does hereby call upon the
Chief Financial Officer to outline economic assumptions for Fiscal Year 2011, and project a working
estimate of total available revenue for budgetary planning purposes; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners does hereby call upon the
Department of Budget and Management Services to immediately prepare and distribute a Reductions
Guidance Memorandum to all departments, agencies, and offices of elected officials as they draft their
budget recommendations for Fiscal Year 2011; said memorandum to reflect a proportional reduction in
revenue that must be absorbed throughout their offices and departments; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Reductions Guidance Memorandum shall appear as a
communication from the Director of Budget and Management Services on the October 5, 2010 Agenda of
the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a Statement of Compliance listing each department, agency, and
office within Cook County government, along with its status regarding conformance or nonconformance

16

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 15, 2010
with proposed Fiscal Year 2011 budgetary reductions as published in the Reductions Guidance
Memorandum, shall appear as a communication from the Chief Financial Officer on the October 19, 2010

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION CONCERNING THE DISTRIBUTION OF PROCEEDS
FROM THE MOTOR FUEL TAX FUND
TO THE COOK COUNTY HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT
WHEREAS, the County of Cook, in Illinois, is the second largest county in the United States; and
WHEREAS, the latest FY 2009 data from the Illinois Secretary of State indicates that Cook County has
3,661,380 registered vehicles; and
WHEREAS, Cook County is the most populous County in Illinois, and has the most registered vehicles
and the most frequently used roads and bridges under its jurisdiction; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Highway Department was established in 1913 by the State of Illinois upon
approval of the first officially recorded County highway system maps; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Highway Department has the responsibility of designing and maintaining
over 573 center line miles of highways, many of which, are part of the major arterial network that leads to
and from area expressways and toll roads, including multi-lane highways, and has maintenance
responsibilities for 1,478 lane miles of pavement, 132 bridges, 351 traffic signals throughout Cook
County and 7 pumping stations from five maintenance garages; and
WHEREAS, Highway Department capital assets account for approximately 37 percent of Cook County’s
total governmental activity capital assets; and
WHEREAS, the County relies almost exclusively on the monies it receives from the State of Illinois
through the Motor Fuel Tax receipts (MFT), as the funding source for County highway projects, along
with maintenance of its roads and bridges; and
WHEREAS, from 2003 to 2010, $294 million of the County’s MFT distribution has been reallocated
from the County’s Highway Department to the Public Safety Fund, an average of $42 million a year or
almost half of the MFT funds allotted to the Highway Department; and

17

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 15, 2010
WHEREAS, the transfer is an intergovernmental transfer occurring via the passage of the County’s
annual appropriation bill and by resolution authorized by the County Board; however, the monies from
said transfer become part of the County’s general fund and expenditures of said MFT transfer monies are
not tracked; and
WHEREAS, said transfer of the County of Cook’s MFT money has an adverse effect on the County
Highway Department’s ability to fulfill its mission by delaying needed construction and maintenance
projects; and
WHEREAS, Cook County’s share of the MFT fund, per State statute, is 16.74% due to its status as the
only County in Illinois with over 1,000,000 or more inhabitants; and
WHEREAS, in the near future, several other Illinois counties will likely reach the 1,000,000 inhabitant
milestone, and consequently Cook County’s share of the MFT fund could be substantially reduced absent
an amendment to Chapter 35 ILCS 505/8 (e) (2) (B) increasing the population threshold; and
WHEREAS, Chapter 35 ILCS 505/8 states the allotment and payment of MFT funds is for use by “road
districts” defined as any road district, including a county unit road district, provided for by the Illinois
Highway Code; and
WHEREAS, Chapter 605 ILCS 5/5-701.1 to 701.16 further defines the purposes for usage of MFT funds,
all of which are related to a County’s Highway Department functions except Sec. 5-701.9, which allows
the county board of any county with a population of 1,000,000 or more to use motor fuel tax money for
constructing or maintaining auxiliary office space and Sec. 5-701.10, which allows any county board in
counties of 1,000,000 or more inhabitants to use any motor fuel money allotted to it for the purpose of
paying any and all expenditures resulting from activities conducted by the circuit court located in the
county; and
WHEREAS, in light of the above mentioned circumstances, it is essential that all distributed MFT funds
remain at the Cook County Highway Department to ensure the successful fulfillment of its mission.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, does
hereby request that all future MFT funds distributed to the County of Cook be directed in their entirety to
the County Highway Department to ensure the proper fulfillment of its mission; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that any request to transfer MFT funds from the County Highway
Department must be presented for approval before the Cook County Board of Commissioners with a
breakdown of how the funds are to be appropriated and expended, and that any such appropriations shall
comply with Illinois State statutes.

(j) The County Board, having reviewed the report of the County's staff and its outside consultants
and having conducted public hearings and received the testimony of witnesses, makes the following
findings:
(1)

Minority and women's businesses continue to be awarded prime contracts
and subcontracts in dollar amounts that are disproportionately lower than the availability of
such businesses willing and able to perform County contracts.

(2)

The County's procurement practices in the past have contributed to the
above identified underutilization of minority and women's businesses on County contracts.

(3)

Minority and women's businesses continue to be disadvantaged by
discriminatory practices in the local construction industry and economy when competing
for County contracts and in seeking subcontracting opportunities on such contracts.

(4)

The County was a passive participant in the discriminatory practices of
businesses which discriminate against minority and women's businesses by entering into
contracts with such businesses.

(5)

Despite its good faith efforts and implementation of previous affirmative
action programs, minority and women's businesses remain at a competitive disadvantage in
competing for County contracts and subcontracts.

(6)

Race and gender neutral measures or affirmative action programs without
numerical goals have not and are not likely to eliminate the competitive disadvantage of
minority and women's businesses in participating in County contracts due to discrimination
in the local economy.

(7)

The numerical goals for the participation of minority and women's
businesses in County contracts are commensurate with the availability of minority and
women's businesses willing and able to perform County work.

Sec. 34-28177. Implementation.
(a) Contract goals.

45

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 15, 2010
(1)

To achieve the goals stated in Section 34-28076, the Purchasing Agent,
except as provided in Subsection (a)(2) of this section, shall include in the bid
specifications a requirement that each contractor commit that Minority Business Enterprise
and Women's Business Enterprise participation in the contract will equal at least 25 percent
(30 percent in the case of construction contracts) and ten percent, respectively, of the total
dollar value of the contract.

(2)

The Contract Compliance Administrator shall evaluate the applicability of
the Minority Business Enterprise and Women's Business Enterprise goals to a specific
contract. Where the Contract Compliance Administrator, in consultation with the
Purchasing Agent and the user Departments, determines that the established goals are not
appropriate for a specific contract because of its particular requirements, the Contract
Compliance Administrator shall set an appropriate goal for the contract, based upon the
availability of Protected Class Enterprises which are capable of providing the goods and/or
services required by the particular contract, the past level of Protected Class Enterprise
participation in similar contracts, the specifications of the contract and any other criteria
adopted by the Contract Compliance Administrator.

(3)

The applicable goals for a specific contract shall be designated in the
contract specifications.

(b) Contractor responsibility and requirements.
(1)

As a precondition to selection, each contractor shall submit with its bid a
completed and signed utilization plan which lists the names, addresses and contact persons
of businesses intended to be used as Protected Class Enterprises on the contract, the type
and scope of work or service each business will perform and the dollar amount to be
allocated to each Protected Class Enterprise. Such listing shall not be duplicative (e.g., two
or more entities each listed as performing 100 percent of the same work or service). Within
three business days following submission of bids, a bidder shall submit its letters of intent
to Protected Class Enterprises listed on its utilization plan, provided that no substitutions
shall be permitted prior to bid award. Each contractor's utilization plan shall commit to
Protected Class Enterprise participation equal to or greater than each of the applicable
Protected Class Enterprise goals, unless the contractor requests a partial or total waiver of
the requirement that it file a utilization plan or achieve a particular goal for Protected Class
Enterprise participation by submitting with the filing of its bid a signed waiver request
form.

(2)

Notwithstanding its compliance with any other requirement of County
ordinances and contract specifications, no bidder or offeror shall be awarded an eligible
contract unless the Contract Compliance Administrator has approved its utilization plan or
granted a waiver on the contract. Such utilization plan shall be designed to meet the
applicable Minority Business Enterprise and Women's Business Enterprise goals set for
such project and shall be incorporated into the contract.

(3)

A contractor may achieve the applicable Protected Class Enterprise goals by
its status as a Protected Class Enterprise or by joint venture with one or more Protected
Class Enterprises or by subcontracting a portion of the work to one or more Protected Class
Enterprises or by purchase of materials or services from one or more Protected Class
Enterprises or by the indirect participation of Protected Class Enterprises in other aspects of
the contractor's business such as through a Mentor/Protege agreement as provided herein

46

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 15, 2010
(in accordance with applicable guidelines and provided that such Protected Class Enterprise
indirect participation may not be credited toward goal attainment on more than one contract
subject to this article) or by any combination of the above, subject to the following
guidelines:
a. Joint ventures. Where a contractor engages in a joint venture to satisfy
its affirmative action commitment, the Contract Compliance Administrator shall
review the profits and losses, initial capital investment, actual participation of the
joint venture partners in the performance of the contract, and other pertinent factors
to determine the amount of credit to be granted for the joint venture toward
attainment of the applicable Minority Business Enterprise and Women's Business
Enterprise goals. The Contract Compliance Administrator may review all records
pertaining to joint venture agreements before or after the award of a contract in order
to assess compliance with this article. A contractor shall receive credit towards
achievement of the applicable goals in proportion to the percentage of the contract to
be performed by the Protected Class Enterprise, provided that the Contract
Compliance Administrator may deny or limit Protected Class Enterprise credit to a
contractor where the Protected Class Enterprise joint venture partner is found not to
be performing a commercially useful function or not to have duties, responsibilities,
management control or risk with respect to the joint venture commensurate with or in
proportion to its joint venture ownership.
b. Subcontracts. A contractor may count toward its Protected Class
Enterprise goals only expenditures to Protected Class Enterprises that perform a
commercially useful function in the performance of a contract for work actually
performed or materials supplied by the Protected Class Enterprise. To determine
whether a Protected Class Enterprise is performing a commercially useful function,
the Contract Compliance Administrator may evaluate the amount of work
subcontracted, industry practices, whether the Protected Class Enterprise has the skill
and experience to perform the work for which it is being utilized and other relevant
factors. Consistent with normal industry practices, a Protected Class Enterprise
subcontractor may enter into second tier subcontracts. However, if a Protected Class
Enterprise contractor or subcontractor subcontracts a significantly greater portion of
the work of the contract than would be expected on the basis of normal industry
practices, the Minority Business Enterprise or Women's Business Enterprise shall be
presumed not to be performing a commercially useful function.
c. Manufacturers and suppliers. Where a contractor utilizes one or more
suppliers to achieve its Protected Class Enterprise goals, such Protected Class
Enterprise supplier participation may be 100 percent credited toward goal attainment
where the Protected Class Enterprise supplier manufactures the goods supplied or
where such Protected Class Enterprise supplier owns or operates a store, warehouse
or other establishment (and related distribution equipment) in which it maintains,
consistent with industry standards, an inventory of the materials or supplies required
for performance of the contract for sale in the normal course of business. The
participation of a Protected Class Enterprise supplier who acts as a broker (i.e., who
performs no manufacturing or warehousing) shall be credited toward the applicable
Protected Class Enterprise goals at a rate equal to ten percent of the payments to such
Protected Class Enterprise broker.
d. Protected Class Enterprise prime contractors or joint venturers. A

47

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 15, 2010
Minority Business Enterprise or Women's Business Enterprise contractor may count
its own participation toward the achievement of the applicable Minority Business
Enterprise or Women's Business Enterprise goal, respectively, but such a contractor
will be required to meet all other applicable goals by joint ventures, subcontracting or
purchase of materials or services. Where a contractor is a business owned and
controlled by minority women ("M/WBE") or where the contractor utilizes a M/WBE
in a joint venture, as a subcontractor or a supplier, the contractor may count the
M/WBE participation either toward the achievement of its Minority Business
Enterprise or Women's Business Enterprise goal but not both.
e. Mentor/protege agreements. Where a contractor enters into a written
agreement ("mentor/protege" agreement) with a Protected Class Enterprise to
improve or develop certain aspects of the business of the Protected Class Enterprise,
such an agreement may be evaluated by the Contract Compliance Administrator to
assess appropriate credit toward the Protected Class Enterprise goals of the
contractor. The contractor and Protected Class Enterprise shall remain separate and
independent business entities under the agreement. The mentor/protege agreement
may provide for the contractor to assist the Protected Class Enterprise in such areas
as technical aspects of its business, improving financial management, or providing
on-the-job training. No such credit shall be available unless:
1. The Protected Class Enterprise provides a commercially useful
function in the performance of its agreement with the contractor;
2. The agreement is in writing and is submitted to the Contract
Compliance Administrator before the award of the contract; and
3. The agreement clearly defines the respective responsibilities of
the contractor and the Protected Class Enterprise and includes specific,
measurable goals to be attained by both parties through the performance of
the agreement. Upon recommendation by the Contract Compliance
Administrator, the Contract Compliance Committee shall determine the
amount of credit to be counted toward the applicable goals of this division.
The Contract Compliance Administrator shall require the contractor to
submit periodic reports summarizing the progress of the execution of the
mentor/protege agreement, and shall notify both parties of any deficiencies in
performance. In order to qualify for credit, the mentor/protege agreement
must coincide in duration with, or not be for a shorter length of time than, the
contract between the contractor and the County.
(4)

Where a contractor seeks relief from all or part of a contract's goals, the
contractor shall submit with its bid a proposal or request for a waiver.

(5)

A contractor's submission of a utilization plan which commits to a Protected
Class Enterprise participation goal equal to or greater than the applicable goals shall not
provide a basis for a higher bid, an increase in contract price or later change order.

(c) Review of bid or offer.
(1)

The Contract Compliance Administrator shall review each bid or offer to

48

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 15, 2010
determine if the contractor has included in its submission a completed and signed
utilization plan which meets the Protected Class Enterprise goals for the contract, and
approve or reject the plan.
(2)

The Purchasing Agent, at the direction of the Contract Compliance
Administrator, shall declare the bid or offer nonresponsive where the Contract Compliance
Administrator determines that a contractor:
a. Failed to submit with its bid a completed utilization plan;
b. Failed to identify in its plan sufficient Minority Business Enterprises
and/or Women's Business Enterprises by name, scope of work and dollar value of
work to meet the applicable goals for the contract; or
c. Failed to submit with its bid a request for a total or partial waiver of
the applicable goals.

(3)

Where a partial or total request for waiver of a goal is made, the Contract
Compliance Administrator shall determine whether a bidder or offeror has made good faith
efforts to meet the applicable Protected Class Enterprise goals and whether a total or partial
waiver of a goal should be granted. Good faith efforts, as defined herein, shall include, but
are not limited to, the following:
a. Attend any prebid conference conducted by the County to acquaint
contractors with Protected Class Enterprises available to provide relevant goods and
services and to inform Protected Class Enterprise's of subcontract opportunities on
the contract;
b. Review lists of available Protected Class Enterprises maintained by the
County and other State and local governments and agencies prior to the bid opening
to identify qualified Protected Class Enterprises for solicitation for bids;
c. Advertise, not less than 15 calendar days before the bid opening date,
in one or more daily newspapers and/or trade publications, for bids by Protected
Class Enterprises for subcontracts or the supply of goods and services on the
contract;
d. Make timely written solicitations of available Protected Class
Enterprises identified on the County's list as providing relevant services for bids for
subcontracts or the supply of goods and services; and provide Protected Class
Enterprises with a convenient and timely opportunity to review and obtain relevant
plans, specifications or terms and conditions of the contract to enable such Protected
Class Enterprises to prepare an informed response to a contractor solicitation;
e. Divide total contract requirements into small tasks or quantities and
adjust performance bond and insurance requirements or otherwise assist Protected
Class Enterprises in obtaining the required bonding, insurance or financing, where
economically feasible, to encourage participation of Protected Class Enterprises;
f.

Follow up initial solicitation of Protected Class Enterprises by

49

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 15, 2010
contacting Protected Class Enterprises to determine if the enterprises are interested in
making bids;
g. Negotiate in good faith with Protected Class Enterprises prior to the
bid opening and do not reject as unsatisfactory any bids submitted by Protected Class
Enterprises without justifiable reason;
h. Establish delivery schedules, where the requirements of the work
permit, which will encourage participation by Protected Class Enterprises;
i. Establish joint ventures with Protected Class Enterprises;
j.

Use the services and assistance of the Contract Compliance
Administrator's staff, the Small Business Administration, the Office of Minority
Business Enterprises of the U.S. Department of Commerce and where the contractor
seeks a waiver, make timely notice of the need for Protected Class Enterprise
subcontractors to an appropriate community and minority and women's business
organization identified as an assist agency with respect to this article.

(4)

A contractor seeking a total or partial waiver shall, in accordance with
guidelines issued by the Contract Compliance Administrator, be required to submit
evidence of its good faith efforts to achieve the applicable Protected Class Enterprise goals
and in support of its reasons for seeking a waiver. Performance of all the actions set out in
Subsection (c)(3) of this section by the contractor shall create a rebuttable assumption that
the contractor has made good faith efforts to meet the applicable Protected Class Enterprise
goals. The determination of the adequacy of a contractor's good faith efforts will be
evaluated on the basis of the contractor's actions as of the date of the bid opening.

(5)

The Contract Compliance Administrator may grant the waiver request of a
contractor based upon the following criteria:
a. Sufficient qualified Protected Class Enterprises capable of providing
the goods or services required by the contract are unavailable despite the good faith
efforts of the contractor;
b. The specifications of and the reasonable and necessary requirements
for performing the contract make it impossible or economically infeasible to divide
the contract into sufficiently small tasks or quantities to enable the contractor to
utilize Protected Class Enterprises in accordance with the applicable utilization goals;
c. The price quoted by any potential Protected Class Enterprise source of
goods or services is more than ten percent above competitive levels; and
d. Any other factor determined to be relevant by the Contract
Compliance Administrator.

(6)

Where a partial waiver is granted, the Contract Compliance Administrator
shall specify the amount of the applicable goal.

(7)

Where the Contract Compliance Administrator determines that a contractor

50

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 15, 2010
has not made a good faith effort to meet the applicable goals and/or comply with the
provisions herein, including, but not limited to, failing to timely submit the required letters
of intent or other information request and/or has not otherwise met the requirements for a
total or partial waiver, the Purchasing Agent may declare the contractor nonresponsive and
reject the bid and reject any waiver request which may have been filed.
(8)

Where the Contract Compliance Administrator determines that the
utilization plan submitted by a contractor is false or fraudulent, the Purchasing Agent shall
reject the bid or, if such a determination is made after the bid award, the contract may be
forfeited and canceled.

(d) Subcontract requirements. Within 30 days after demand, the prime contractor shall furnish
fully executed copies of all protected class subagreements and these shall be reviewed by the Contract
Compliance Administrator and submitted to the Contract Compliance Committee of the County Board.
Subsequently, the prime contractor shall obtain and submit a copy of all Minority Business Enterprise or
Women's Business Enterprise related subtier contracts on demand.
(e) Review of contract performance.
(1)

The Contract Compliance Administrator shall review the contractor's efforts
during the performance of the contract to achieve its Protected Class Enterprise
commitments as stated in its utilization plan. If the contractor meets or exceeds its stated
goals, it shall be presumed to be in compliance. Where the Contract Compliance
Administrator finds that the contractor has failed to achieve its stated goals or otherwise has
failed to comply with the requirements of the division, including failure to provide any
documentation required by the Contract Compliance Administrator, has not satisfactorily
demonstrated good faith efforts, and/or has deviated without authorization from the
compliance related portions of the contract as originally approved, the Contract
Compliance Administrator shall report findings to the Contract Compliance Committee.

(2)

The Contract Compliance Administrator may establish such requirements
for periodic contractor reporting on the fulfillment of its goals and its utilization of
Protected Class Enterprises as the Contract Compliance Administrator determines
appropriate and necessary for effective enforcement of this division. A contractor also shall
be required to provide the Contract Compliance Administrator any additional requested
compliance documentation within 14 days of such request.

(3)

If the Contract Compliance Committee determines that the contractor has
failed to comply with its contractual commitments or any portion of this division, the
Contract Compliance Committee will notify the contractor of such noncompliance and may
take any of the following actions:
a. Instruct the Comptroller to withhold 50 percent of the current progress
payment due the prime contractor.
b. Withhold up to 100 percent of further progress payments until the
contractor demonstrates that it is in compliance with the requirements of this
division.
c. Debar the contractor from future bids or offers until the contractor
demonstrates that it is in compliance with the requirements of this division.

51

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 15, 2010

(f) Protected Class Enterprise bid and target market programs. To address more specifically the
barriers to Protected Class Enterprise participation as prime contractors in County work, the Contract
Compliance Administrator may direct the Purchasing Agent to institute the following special Protected
Class Enterprise bidding provisions, following determination of the appropriateness of such provisions.
(1)

In connection with the award of a contract subject to competitive bidding on
which a Protected Class Enterprise has bid and where the Protected Class Enterprise meets
the following criteria:
a. It is bidding on the item in question for the first time; and
b. It never has successfully bid on a Cook County purchasing contract,
the Contract Compliance Administrator may, at the opening of the bids on the item,
compare the Protected Class Enterprise bid with the lowest bid, and, if the Protected
Class Enterprise's bid is closely competitive as defined by guidelines to be
established by the Contract Compliance Administrator with that of lowest actual bids,
direct the Purchasing Agent to declare the Protected Class Enterprise the successful
bidder. A Protected Class Enterprise may use this procedure only once to become the
successful bidder on any particular item. Thereafter, the Protected Class Enterprise
must be totally competitive in terms of price to be the successful bidder.

(2)

The Contract Compliance Administrator shall develop and coordinate a
target market program as follows:
a. The Contract Compliance Administrator shall review the availability
of Protected Class Enterprises providing various goods and services and shall identify
for inclusion in a potential program for bidding among Protected Class Enterprise
firms certain commodity areas with sufficient Protected Class Enterprise availability
to ensure that the County receives a competitive price. The Contract Compliance
Administrator shall report his/her findings and recommendations to the Contract
Compliance Committee;
b. Upon a determination by the Contract Compliance Committee that such
a program is advisable for any particular commodity procurement, the Contract
Compliance Administrator will institute the following procedures:
1. The Contract Compliance Administrator will notify the
Purchasing Agent of identification of those commodity codes appropriate for
a target market program;
2. To the extent practicable, the Purchasing Agent, with the aid of
the Contract Compliance Administrator, shall divide procurement in the
designated commodity areas into economically feasible sizes to facilitate bids
or offers from Protected Class Enterprises and shall designate contracts to be
offered under the target market program;
3. The Purchasing Agent shall offer Protected Class Enterprises
the opportunity to bid on such contracts in a limited competition;
4. All standard County rules for bidding will then become

52

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 15, 2010
effective and, provided that at least three Protected Class Enterprises bid or
make an offer on the contract, the lowest responsive and responsible bidder
among the Protected Class Enterprise firms will receive the contract;
5. In the event less than three Protected Class Enterprises bid or
make an offer on the contract or if there is no responsive bid or offer received
from a responsible Protected Class Enterprise, the Purchasing Agent shall
rebid the contract not subject to the target market program.
c. Participation in the target market program shall be limited to Minority
Business Enterprises, Women's Business Enterprises and joint ventures consisting
exclusively of Minority Business Enterprises, Women's Business Enterprises or both.
The Protected Class Enterprise contractor on a target market contract may
subcontract up to 50 percent of the dollar value of the target market contract to
subcontractors who are not Minority Business Enterprises or Women's Business
Enterprises.
(g) Fifty percent Protected Class Enterprises required for informal bid solicitations. All buyers
shall solicit 50 percent PCEs in their informal bid solicitations for materials under $10,000.00, which are
not bid by formal advertising.

to use Protected Class Enterprises whenever possible in their requisitions for materials under $10,000.00,
which are not bid.
(i) Division of large contracts to facilitate offers from Protected Class Enterprises. With respect
to large contracts for which subcontracting possibilities are impracticable, all buyers will, to the extent
practicable, divide such contracts into economically feasible sizes to facilitate bids or offers from
Protected Class Enterprises.
(j) Technical assistance. The contractor is bound by all the requirements, terms, and conditions
of this article. Subsequent to the acceptance of an awarded contract, there will be no waiver of the
requirements, terms and conditions. The County Board, through its Contract Compliance Committee and
the Contract Compliance Administrator, will make technical assistance in meeting the terms and
conditions of this article available to all interested bidders.
(k) Finance; measures for reduction of cash flow problems of protected class contractors.
(1)

As needed, the Contract Compliance Administrator shall assist Protected
Class Enterprises with training seminars in the technical aspects of preparing a bid for a
County contract.

(2)

All prime contractors shall be urged to follow the County's example by
making prompt and timely payments to Protected Class Enterprise subcontractors working
on Cook County projects. The timeliness of such payments shall be monitored by the
Contract Compliance Administrator on a regular basis, and an investigation shall be made
of every complaint or charge of excessive delay in payment. Reports of these investigations
shall be made to the Contract Compliance Committee and to the County Comptroller.

(3)

If at any time during the progress of the work, the contractor shall fail or

53

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 15, 2010
neglect to pay a Protected Class Enterprise subcontractor for any labor performed,
furnished, or tools, machinery, appliances, fuels, provisions or supplies of any sort or kind
used or consumed upon, in or on account of the work for ten days after payment for same
shall become due, then the County shall have the power and authority to pay such
indebtedness, and the amount so paid shall be retained out of the money due or to become
due the contractor. The County Comptroller may refuse to make the payment hereinafter
specified to the extent of such indebtedness, until satisfactory evidence in writing has been
furnished that the indebtedness has been discharged. In any such case, the Purchasing
Agent is hereby authorized and empowered by the contractor to ascertain the amount due or
owing from the contractor to any laborer or laborers, or to any person or persons, or
corporation, for labor, equipment, material, tools, machinery, appliances, provisions, fuels,
or supplies of any sort or kind consumed upon, in or on account of the work covered by this
contract in such manner and upon such proofs as may be deemed sufficient.
(4)

The County Board shall encourage major prime contractors to make
available to Protected Class Enterprise subcontractors working on their projects their
sources of financial assistance.

(l) Contract award considerations. Where the lowest responsive contractor submits a bid/offer
which exceeds by ten percent or more the bid/offer of the lowest PCE nonresponsive contractor ["PCE
nonresponsive" for purposes of this subsection means nonresponsive pursuant to Subsection (c)(2) of this
section, but otherwise responsive to the contract specifications], the County shall have the right to reject
all bids/offers and rebid or request further offers.
Sec. 34-28278. Professionals and consulting services and sole source agreements.
All Department heads who may employ the professional services of accountants, attorneys,
physicians, dentists, statisticians, data analysts, engineers, and other such personnel or who require goods
or services procured through sole source agreements shall implement this article and compliance
programs in a "best effort" manner. In lieu of the requirements set forth in Section 34-28177(b), all
providers of such professional services or goods or services are to be notified that:
(1)

In the case of term contracts (annually or for more than six months), they are
to maximize the use of Protected Class Enterprises or individuals as subconsultants or
subcontractors.

(2)

In the case of contracts instituted on an as-needed basis or lasting less than
six months, they are to submit to the County affirmative action plans and goals and
maximize the number of women and minority professionals in their firm who participate in
various County projects.

(3)

In both of the above cases the internal affirmative action plans and goals of
the providers shall be submitted to the Contract Compliance Administrator and shall be
reviewed against the provider's actual affirmative action achievements and shall become a
part of the provider's protected class compliance review; this twice yearly review by the
Contract Compliance Administrator shall become a factor in the County's continued use of
the services of providers.

(4)

The County sets a "best efforts" goal of 35 percent Protected Class
Enterprise participation for the total professional services and consulting services utilized
by the County. The County must be able to call upon those professionals whose particular

54

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 15, 2010
training and experience most closely fit our needs. The County shall endeavor to increase
utilization of protected class firms. Because use of such services is not programmed or
predictable, a "best effort" standard shall be used for attainment of the goal amounts.
Sec. 34-28379. Other Federal and State regulations.
Nothing in this division shall be interpreted to diminish or supplant equal employment
opportunity requirements contained in Federal or State grant funded contracts.
Sec. 34-2840. Preference to residents of County.
In addition to the goals established pursuant to Section 34-28076, there is established as a goal

of goods and services used in County contracts;

in remedying the effects of discrimination against Minority Business Enterprises and

COOK COUNTY MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE MEDIATION PROGRAM UPDATE.
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 22, 2010 from Bridget Gainer, County
Commissioner:

62

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 15, 2010

requesting an update on the Cook County Mortgage Foreclosure Mediation Program from
the Honorable Timothy C. Evans, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County. The grant
activity report was requested by letter on July 21, 2010.
The Honorable Dorothy Kirie Kinnaird, Presiding Judge, Chancery Division, Circuit Court of Cook
County, State of Illinois, delivered an update on the Cook County Mortgage Foreclosure Mediation
Program.
Judge Kinnaird stated the following: Default foreclosure calls have been established. A home is not
taken away from its owner until it is clear that a bank owns the note. The PIN numbers and addresses are
scrutinized, and it is determined whether the affidavits and attorneys’ fees are appropriate. This is done in
all cases regardless of whether a borrower shows up. All of this has been done consistently since 2002. A
comprehensive support system was put into place in 2003 for foreclosures. In 2003 a Chancery Division
Advice Desk was created, which is staffed by attorneys from the Chicago Legal Clinic. We put together
the first Access to Justice Program in the Circuit Court of Cook County, whereby attorneys are appointed
in civil cases to represent anyone who cannot afford an attorney. In 2008 she put together a
comprehensive advisory group to help put together the Mediation Program, which is now fully up and
running. So far there have been 12,000 calls to the Illinois Housing Development Hotline. 3000 people
have had the opportunity to meet for an hour with a HUD-certified housing counselor, 88% of those
people have had off-site, follow-up, housing counseling appointments in their neighborhoods. 112
individuals have received free legal representation. Our judges have sent 412 cases into mediation with
attorney support.
With respect to Communication No. 307924, no action was taken by the Committee.
Vice Chairman Silvestri moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Butler. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.
YOUR COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS
WITH REGARD TO THE MATTER NAMED HEREIN:
Communication Number 306183
Approve
Communication Number 307924
No Action Taken

Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION CALLING ON THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
TO REMOVE THE UNNECESSARY PROVISION THAT REQUIRES
SENIORS IN COOK COUNTY TO REAPPLY FOR THE
SENIOR CITIZEN HOMEOWNER’S EXEMPTION EACH YEAR
WHEREAS, more than 284,000 senior citizens in Cook County benefit from the Senior
Citizen Homeowner’s Exemption each year, a valuable and important form of property tax
relief; and
WHEREAS, the Senior Exemption can reduce a senior’s property tax bill by several
hundred dollars, with 2008 tax bill savings ranging from $158 to $823; and
WHEREAS, in tax year 2007, the Cook County Assessor’s Office stopped requiring
seniors 65 years or older to apply annually for the Exemption and therefore saved
additional processing and mailing costs; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Assessor took this step in order to make the process easier
for seniors to avail themselves of the Exemption since no one gets younger; and
WHEREAS, the Assessor re-verifies the Exemption whenever a deed transfer occurs on a
property receiving the Exemption; and
WHEREAS, the Exemption has no income requirement and requires only that the
taxpayer be 65 or older and own the house that is their principal residence; and
WHEREAS, legislation recently passed by the General Assembly now requires seniors to
reapply every year for the Exemption, creating an unnecessary obstacle for them; and
WHEREAS, this requirement was mandated only for Cook County and does not apply to
any other assessor’s office or county office in Illinois; and
WHEREAS, this requirement will place an unfunded mandate on the County and require
the County to expend unnecessary funds for publications, mailings and administration of
the Exemption during an economic period where any and all unnecessary expenses to
taxpayers should be taken under high consideration; and
WHEREAS, every time a major change in an exemption application process has occurred
it has resulted in confusion and missed property tax savings, especially for those
exemptions specifically targeted for the senior citizen population.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners urge the General Assembly to promptly reconsider this onerous provision

83

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 15, 2010
imposed upon the senior population of Cook County and remedy this unnecessary
provision by enacting further legislation allowing for the Assessor to maintain the practice
of verification they have installed which allowed for automatic renewal of this valuable
property tax relief for Cook County senior citizens.

July 14, 2010 Memorandum refers to the Errata, as follows: “Errata: The Clerk of the Board will no
longer prepare an errata for each agenda. The Clerk of the Board will only indicate which items have
been withdrawn.”

of the State’s Attorney addressed to Tim Casey, Director of Legislative Reference Services, who
requested the opinion based on a request from Commissioner Peraica. Commissioner Suffredin asked
Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State’s Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, if such an opinion letter
exists, and if Commissioner Peraica was in receipt of the opinion letter.
Mr. Driscoll responded that an opinion letter was issued in May 2010 and was provided to Mr. Casey and
Commissioner Peraica. Mr. Driscoll continued by stating the “attorney-client privilege” precludes him
from providing copies of such types of documents to anyone other than the commissioner who originally
requested the opinion.
Commissioner Peraica stated he had provided a copy of the opinion letter to a third party, and he simply
forgot he had received it, as the matter was referred to the Finance Committee four months ago.

Total

$500,000.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
The need for a transfer of funds became apparent during April of this year. The account balance on
April 12, 2010 was $416,116.00. This amount was unchanged from the balance 30 days prior to
that date. However, it was determined that increased funds would be required for Information
Technology Services Management before the end of the fiscal year.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
More printed items were returned in the Voting Supply Carriers from Election Day than anticipated
thereby reducing printing costs.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from Account 524-240 Printing and Publishing.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The budget provided for more reprinting of election materials than were ultimately required.

OFFICE OF THE INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR GENERAL
TRANSFER OF FUNDS

157

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 15, 2010
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 23, 2010 from
PATRICK M. BLANCHARD, Independent Inspector General
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $400.00 from Account 080260, Professional and Managerial Services, to Account 080-185, Professional and Technical Membership
Fees, to enable Office of the Independent Inspector General (OIIG) investigators to become members of
the Association of Inspectors General (AIG), a professional organization offering training and
legal updates of developments within the Inspector General community.
Reason:

The Office of the Independent Inspector General is requesting a transfer of funds from
Account 080-260 to 080-185 to cover professional membership fees for OIIG investigators.
The OIIG has increased its investigative staff over the last year from three (3) investigators to
eleven (11), which includes the Inspector General and two (2) Deputies. This increase in
investigative staff has depleted the budget for professional membership fees as personnel
have joined the Association of Inspectors General to benefit from the group's training and
legal updates involving issues in the IG community nationwide. The training offered and the
legal updates are beneficial to the OIIG staff and contribute to the professionalism of the
OIIG. OIIG membership in this organization is an essential element in keeping OIIG
investigators current in the law as well as trends in this field.

Account 080-185

1. On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds in
order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what was
the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On August 13, 2010, the OIIG was advised by the Budget Office that there was zero balance in the
Professional and Technical Membership Fees Account. On July 13, 2010, there was a balance of
$60.00.
2. How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts that
were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The OIIG identified Account 080-260 as the source of funds to supplement the Professional and
Managerial and Technical Membership Fees Account because the funds were available and it was
determined that, due to changing priorities, the intended activity for which the funds
were budgeted would not occur in FY 2010. Because of the surplus of funds available, this account
was the logical choice. There were no other accounts considered.
3. Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in the
account that funds are transferred from 080-260.
Due to the changing priorities of the OIIG, the need for the Professional and Managerial Services
Account 080-260, was minimized. The money was intended to pay for professional assistance and
training in conducting desk audits and monitoring interviews. The workload and availability of
personnel assigned investigative matters has eliminated the possibility of these audits occurring this
fiscal year. Moreover, monitoring of interviews by this office is not yet required due to the

158

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 15, 2010
continuing jurisdiction of the Office of the Shakman Compliance Administrator. It is now anticipated
that these audits and monitoring will commence in FY 2011.
4. If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Not applicable.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved that the transfer of funds be
approved. The motion carried unanimously.
