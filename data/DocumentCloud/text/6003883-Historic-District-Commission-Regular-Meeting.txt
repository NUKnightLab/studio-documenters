AGENDA

STAFF REPORT 5-8-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6175
ADDRESS: 2275 W. BOSTON BLVD.
HISTORIC DISTRICT: BOSTON EDISON
APPLICANT: JOHN CLARK – AT HOME BUILDERS
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 05-02-2019

PREPARED BY: B. CAGNEY

PROPOSAL
The building located at 2275 West Boston Boulevard is an Italian Renaissance / Mediterranean-Style home
built in 1924. It sits midblock on the south side of West Boston Boulevard between La Salle Blvd. and 14th
Street. The home features an asymmetrical, yellow-brick façade with a low-sloped hip roof. The greygreen roof matches the shutters on the front façade and the wood siding on the rear of the home. The front
elevation features such character defining features as an arched doorway surrounded with Italianate
detailing and (3) centrally located arched windows on the first floor, framed with articulated limestone
trim.
The home currently has a detached garage at the rear corner of the property. While there is an alley to the
rear of the property, vehicular access to the garage is through a driveway that runs along the east side of
the site. The applicant has stated that she believes the existing garage on the property is original. The front
façade of the garage is partially visible from the primary West Boston Boulevard right-of-way. It features
(2) overhead garage doors (white) and a pedestrian door on the side. According to the applicant, in May of
2018, a storm knocked down a tree and power cables onto the roof the garage, not only disabling access to
the garage but also totaling the two cars parked inside. As stated in the application, “garage is unsafe to
enter and is now open for rodents and dogs to enter. Particles of wood and shingles are loose and continue
to pose hazard for myself and my husband of which both of us are senior citizens.” The applicant has
stated that an insurance adjuster has reviewed the damage and declared that the garage warranted
replacement. Staff has asked the applicant to provide any documentation from the insurance company to
the Commission.
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to complete the following
work associated with the overall rehabilitation of the building as per the attached drawings:
•
•
•
•

The demolition of the existing 20’x 20’ garage
The removal of the existing 24’x 20’ concrete slab
The pouring of a new 24’-6”x 20’-6” concrete slab
The erection of a new 24’ x 20’ garage at the location of the existing garage with the following
features:
o The garage will be 8’ ht. with 1’ overhangs at the gable and the eaves
o Two-car garage with (2) insulated overhead garage doors in white [8’x7’]
o (1) steel 6-panel exterior door on the front [36”]
o Textured fiber cement lap siding by Allura [5/16” x 7-1/4”]
 Trim and siding to be painted the same color scheme as the residence
o The roof will use Architectural shingles – color unspecified

ELEMENTS OF DESIGN

 REPORT

(7)

Relationship of materials. The majority of houses are faced with brick, while many are partially or
totally stucco. There are some stone buildings, sometimes combined with stucco; clapboard is rare, and
is extremely rare as the sole material. Roofing includes slate, tile and asphalt shingles. Wood shingle
roofs were once common and have generally been replaced with asphalt. Wood shake does not exist
and there is no known evidence that it was ever used in the district. Stone trim is common. Wood is
almost universally used for window frames and other functional trim and is used in many examples for
all trim.

(8)

Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that of a low-relief
pattern of mortar joints in brick contrasted with the smooth surface of wood or stone trim. There are a
few houses with rough or rusticated stone surfaces. The use of stucco or concrete, with or without halftimbering, as a contrast to brick surfaces, is not unusual. Tile, slate, or wood shingle roofs have
particular textural values where they exist. Asphalt shingles generally have little textural interest, even
in those types which purport to imitate some other variety.
Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors (such as red, yellow, brown, buff) predominate in wall
surfaces. Natural stone colors also exist. Where stucco or concrete exists, it usually remains in its
natural state, or is painted in a shade of cream. Roofs are in natural colors (tile and slate colors, natural
and stained wood colors), and asphalt shingles are predominantly within this same dark color range.
Paint colors often relate to style. The buildings derived from classical precedents, particularly those of
neo-georgian style, generally have woodwork painted white, cream, or in the range of those colors
including "putty"; doors and shutters are frequently dark green or black. Colors known to have been in
use on similar buildings of this style in the eighteenth or early twentieth centuries may be considered for
appropriateness. Buildings of medieval inspiration (notably neo-tudor) generally have painted
woodwork and window frames of a dark brown or cream color. Half timbering is almost always stained
dark brown. The original colors of any building, as determined by professional analysis, are always
acceptable for a house, and may provide guidance for similar houses.

(9)

(10)

Relationship of architectural details. Architectural details generally relate to style. Neo-georgian
buildings display classic details, mostly in wood, and sometimes in stone. Porches, shutters, window
frames, cornices, and dormer windows are commonly, although not always, treated. Details on
"mediterranean" style or vernacular buildings including arched windows, door openings, and porches,
are often done in stone, brick, tile, and sometimes in stucco. Buildings of medieval inspiration tend to
have details in the form of carved wood or carved stone ornaments on window frames, door frames, and
eaves. In general, the various styles are rich in architectural details.

(11)

Relationship of roof shapes. A variety of roof shapes exist in the district, depending on building style.
Shallow hipped roofs with dormers, roofs with triangular gables, and steep hipped roofs predominate. A
few gambrel roofs exist. Complex arrangements of the gabled and/or the hipped types, with subsidiary
or transverse roofs, are not unusual. Dormers are common. Flat roofs are present only as subsidiary
roofs on residential structures. Garage roofs generally reflect the style and pitch of the roof on the main
house.

(20)

Orientation, vistas, overviews. Most of the houses in the district have front entrances which are oriented
toward the streets running east-west. The houses on Lasalle Boulevard, from Chicago Boulevard to
Edison Boulevard, are orientated toward Lasalle. Garages are frequently oriented either toward an alley
and/or the front drive or toward a side street in the case of corner lots. Almost all garages are detached
and are at the rear of the lot.

 REPORT

RECOMMENDATION
Per the applicant, the existing garage on site has not been accessed by the owners in a year because of the level of
damage sustained during a storm. The applicant has an approved claim with her insurance agency that will allow her
to replace the structure. It is staff’s opinion that the proposed new construction does not detract from any of the
character defining features of the property. Staff finds the proposal appropriate for the following reasons: the
proposed garage will remain in the original location and relatively same footprint of the previous garage, it will
follow the residence in color scheme and maintain the dual overhead doors of the original garage. However, it is
staff’s opinion that the color of the new shingles on the proposed garage should match the color of the asphalt
shingles on the residence. Therefore, it is staffs recommendation that the Commission issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness for the proposed work based on the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation Number
10) New addition, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
… with the condition that the shingle color for the roof of the garage match that of the residence.
Motion DRAFT

•

I move that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed work items
proposed in application number 19-6175 because the work as described does meet the Secretary of the
Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation Number 10) New addition, exterior alterations, or related new
construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be
differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural
features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
