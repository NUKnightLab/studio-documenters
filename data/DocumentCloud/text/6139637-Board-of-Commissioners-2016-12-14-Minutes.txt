Summary: These contracts will provide state-of-the-art devices to assist the Adult Probation and Social
Service Departments in monitoring alcohol consumption by defendants and offenders who have been
court-ordered to monitoring as a condition of pretrial supervision, probation, conditional discharge, or
supervision. Two types of remote alcohol monitoring devices will be provided, each employing a
different measurement methodology for alcohol consumption: transdermal alcohol monitoring (TAM)
and remote breath alcohol monitoring (RBAM). Contract 1530-14415A with Cam Systems will provide
the TAM devices, and Contract 1530-14415B with 1A Smart Start, LLC will provide the RBAM devices.
Both contracts include the equipment, as well as monitoring and reporting services. The vendors will be
responsible for testing alcohol usage several times per day during the period ordered by the court and will
report results to the departments.
The two devices operate as follows: 1)TAM devices are worn around the ankle, take multiple readings of
perspiration each day to check for the presence of alcohol and do not require active participation by the
subject; and 2) RBAM devices require the participant to take breathalyzer tests each day that check for
the presence of alcohol.
The cost of the devices and services would be paid by program participants. Payments will be adjusted
based on the participants’ ability to pay allowing for reduced rates in appropriate circumstances. Basic
pricing for TAM devices ranges from $12.40 and $26.00 per day depending upon the annual income of
the participant, and basic pricing for the RBAM devices ranges from $3.26 to $3.78 per day, depending
on volume, and then may be reduced further based on the participants’ ability to pay. Both contracts
include provisions for additional charges to the participants for installation, unit removal, damaged units,
home visits, and for other circumstances.

Summary: Effective 9/16/2016, the enrollment fee for the court’s online parent education program,
“Children In Between Online,” was raised to $50 per participant pursuant to General Order No. 2016 D 5.
The online program is managed for the court by the Center for Divorce Education under Cook County
Contract #12-23-228. One of two proposed changes would allow for the enrollment fee to increase from
$39.95 to $50.00 to reflect the change authorized by General Order No. D 5. A second change would
increase the court’s percentage share of the fee from 10 percent, or $3.99, to 20 percent, or $10.00.
As a result of these changes, the amount of cost reimbursements from the court’s percentage share of the
fee that will be realized by Cook County are expected to increase from about $16,000 to $40,000 during
the final year of the contract.
The contract was originally approved for the three year period 11/1/2012 - 10/31/2015. Two renewal
options were subsequently exercised, extending the contract date to 10/31/2017. The proposed
amendments would be effective 11/1/2016, and for the remaining year of the contract.
CDE operates the online parenting education course for parents with children appearing in the Circuit
Court’s Domestic Relations Division, pursuant to section 404.1 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution
of Marriage Act and Illinois Supreme Court Rule 924. Participants are ordered by the court to complete
either this online course or the court’s Focus On Children classroom course. Either option generally
requires four to five hours to complete. In calendar year 2015, more than 4,000 parents completed the
online course. Classes are available 24 hours, 7 days a week, in order to provide more flexibility in
attendance to the litigants.
This contract was awarded through the Request for Proposal (RFP) process in accordance with the Cook
County Procurement Code. Center for Divorce Education was selected based on established evaluation
criteria.

 Journal of Proceedings
Board of Commissioners

Goods or Services: N/A
Agreement Number(s): N/A
Agreement Period: From date of execution through 11/30/2017
Fiscal Impact: $353,800,000.00
Accounts: 490-818
Summary: This proposed IGA, already approved and signed by the Pension Fund, would reflect the
County’s commitment to appropriate an additional $353,800,000.00 to the Pension Fund. As was stated
in the IGA for FY 2016, the agreement requires the Pension Fund to continue its commitment to
providing the County Board with actuarial data and certain reporting on its relative investment
performance. This FY 2017 IGA is in the same form as the FY 2016 IGA, as approved by the Board a
year ago, with revisions based on the total amount of the additional contribution and the payment of that
amount over the course of a year. The IGA reflects the undertaking of the Board and the Board President
when the decision was made to increase the sales tax by 1%.
