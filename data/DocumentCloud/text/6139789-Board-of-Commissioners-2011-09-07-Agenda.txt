ORDINANCE
POLICY FOR RESPONDING TO ICE DETAINERS
WHEREAS, Cook County is a “Fair and Equal County for Immigrants,” as defined in 07-R-240; and
WHEREAS, there is ongoing confusion regarding the proper boundaries of the relationship between
local law enforcement and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”); and
WHEREAS, this is especially true in the context of ICE detainers, which are issued pursuant to 8 USC §
1226 or 8 USC § 1357(d), and used by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to advise local law
enforcement agencies that DHS seeks custody of an individual presently in the custody of that agency;
and
WHEREAS, 8 CFR § 287.7 expressly provides that ICE detainers are merely “requests” that local law
enforcement advise DHS when the individual is due to be released, and that the agency continue holding
the individual beyond the scheduled time of release for up to 48 hours, excluding weekends and federal
holidays, in order for ICE to arrange to assume custody; and
WHEREAS, due to troubling inconsistencies in ICE policies, many local law enforcement agencies
erroneously believe ICE detainers are mandatory and that local law enforcement agencies are legally
required to comply; and
WHEREAS, ICE detainers are generally issued before a finding of probable cause that an individual is
deportable, and have even been imposed on U.S. Citizens by mistake; and
WHEREAS, ICE detainers are routinely imposed on individuals without any criminal convictions or
whose cases are dismissed, but the federal government only reimburses part of the costs associated with
ICE detainers, if there is a written agreement with the State or local subdivision of a State; and
WHEREAS, ICE will not indemnify local agencies for costs or liability incurred as a result of wrongful
detainers; and
WHEREAS, it costs Cook County approximately $43,000 per day to hold individuals “believed to be
undocumented” pursuant to ICE detainers, and Cook County can no longer afford to expend taxpayer
funds to incarcerate individuals who are otherwise entitled to their freedom; and
WHEREAS, the enforcement of immigration laws is a responsibility of the federal government; and
WHEREAS, ICE detainers encourage racial profiling and harassment; and
WHEREAS, having the Sheriff of Cook County participate in the enforcement of ICE detainers places a
great strain on our communities by eroding the public trust that the Sheriff depends on to secure the
accurate reporting of criminal activity and to prevent and solve crimes; and

 page 14

Meeting of September 7, 2011

COMMISSIONERS continued
ORDINANCES continued
ITEM #6 cont’d
WHEREAS, by means of this ordinance, Cook County joins states, cities, and counties across the nation
that are informed about the discretionary nature of ICE detainers and refuse to enforce them, except in
situations where federal reimbursement may be available.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter
46 Law Enforcement, Section 46-37 of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
Sec. 46-37.

Policy for responding to ICE detainers.

(a)
The Sheriff of Cook County shall decline ICE detainer requests unless there is a written
agreement with the federal government by which all costs incurred by Cook County in complying with
the ICE detainer shall be reimbursed.
(b)
Unless ICE agents have a criminal warrant, or County officials have a legitimate law
enforcement purpose that is not related to the enforcement of immigration laws, ICE agents shall not be
given access to individuals or allowed to use County facilities for investigative interviews or other
purposes, and County personnel shall not expend their time responding to ICE inquiries or
communicating with ICE regarding individuals’ incarceration status or release dates while on duty.
(c)
There being no legal authority upon which the federal government may compel an
expenditure of County resources to comply with an ICE detainer issued pursuant to 8 USC § 1226 or 8
USC § 1357(d), there shall be no expenditure of any County resources or effort by on-duty County
personnel for this purpose, except as expressly provided within this Ordinance.
(d)
Any person who alleges a violation of this Ordinance may file a written complaint for
investigation with the Cook County Sheriff’s Office of Professional Review.
Effective Date: This Ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

morning of the first day of school to take their children to school; religious leaders and faith-based
institutions are asked to adopt a neighborhood school and to partner with and support that school
throughout the school year; and
WHEREAS, the Million Father March was established by The Black Star Project in 2004 to encourage
fathers to take an active role in their children’s educational lives with the goal to take their children to
school on the first day of school.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners laud the efforts of The Black Star Project and the Million Father March and join with
them to encourage all men to show their commitment to the educational lives of their children on the first
day of school and throughout the school year; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to The
Black Star Project in recognition of the importance of the Million Father March to the

WHEREAS, Ramadan, celebrated the world over by more than one billion Muslims, is the month when
Muslims believe God gave the first verses of the Koran to the Prophet Muhammad, and is a sacred
Muslim holiday, spanning the ninth month of the Islamic calendar; and
WHEREAS, Ramadan is one of the five “pillars” or duties in the religion of Islam, and observance of
Ramadan is considered necessary to the strengthening of one’s faith; and

submissiveness to God; it is also a time to mend troubled relationships, forgive others, and give to charity;
and
WHEREAS, the month of Ramadan involves daily fasting from sunrise to sunset and, because everyone
is eating dinner after sunset, Muslims often invite friends and family to share in the evening meal during
Ramadan ; and

struggle toward a higher spiritual state.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Toni Preckwinkle, as Cook County Board President

PROPOSED CONTRACT
ITEM #14
REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE #314395
Transmitting a Communication from
MARIA DE LOURDES COSS, Purchasing Agent
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into and execute a County-wide contract with
Lexis Nexis d/b/a Vital Chek Network, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, for Credit Card Processing Services.
Reason:

Authorization to advertise for Multi-Step Bid was approved on June 1, 2011. Step 1 of this
Multi-step Sealed Bid process was to pre-qualify respondents for Credit Card Processing
Services. An evaluation was conducted based on the evaluation criteria listed in the
solicitation document. Responses were received and evaluated. Four firms were found
qualified and were invited to participate in Step 2 and submit a sealed bid. The County is
seeking the most economic flat rate convenience percentage fees to be charged to taxpayers
for credit card payment transactions. Lexis Nexis d/b/a Vital Chek Network, Inc. submitted
the lowest percentage fee. 

Estimated Fiscal Impact:
(Various -260 Account).

None.

Contract period: October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2016.

This is a revenue neutral service.
The Purchasing Agent concurs.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.

REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE #314396
Transmitting a Communication from
MARIA DE LOURDES COSS, Purchasing Agent
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $1,400,000 Contract No. 10-84-129 with
Warehouse Direct, Mount Prospect, Illinois, for Countywide Office Supplies.

Increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$1,373,256.50
1,400,000.00
$2,773,256.50

The original award amount of $1,373,256.50 has been encumbered by Cook County
departments through various purchase orders prior to the one year contract anniversary. Based
on analysis of the contract, usage history and annual spend, it appears that the initial amount
requested was for a one-year period, not a two-year period. In order to continue operation of
County services, the contract will need to be increased by an additional $1,400,000. The
expiration date of the current contract is September 14, 2012.

Re: Notice of 501 Account Fiscal Year 2011
Presented for your information is a list of projects funded from the 501 Illinois First Account that are now
assigned individual Section Numbers, as required by the Illinois Department of Transportation, to track

budget, approved the Department of Highway’s 501 Account, a Motor Fuel Tax funded account.
Individual appropriations, such as Appropriating or Maintenance Resolutions are not required for these
items by the Illinois Department of Transportation because this Account is part of the County’s Annual
Budget. The Board will be supplied with continued notification of the advancement of the projects
through established procedures, i.e., permission to advertise, award approval and payment processing as
appropriate.

ITEM #39
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 29, 2011 from
MARIA SALDAÑA, Bureau Chief, Bureau of Economic Development
I hereby transmit for your approval a request for the Office of Capital Planning and Policy, as authorized
by the Cook County Purchasing Agent, to participate in the City of Chicago (the “City”) Job Order
Contract (JOC) program to complete the 16 capital projects listed below (the “Projects”). JOC is a
quantity based procurement process that allows facility owners to complete a multitude of
repair/maintenance and construction projects with a single, competitively bid contract. The JOC process
generally involves first selecting a pool of potential contractors through a competitive procurement
process, and then identifying projects for such selected contractors.

POST BOARD ACTION AGENDA
Meeting of September 7, 2011

BUREAU OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY continued
AGREEMENT continued
ITEM #39 cont’d
The City has already completed a JOC competitive procurement process, and it has created the pool of
general contractors to perform certain projects generally associated with maintenance, repairs, and routine
work. Participating in, or “piggy backing” on the City’s existing JOC contract would allow the County to
enjoy the myriad cost savings achieved through volume purchases.
The JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group. The Gordian Group
maintains an area price book, which captures the prices for specific construction work items within this
region. JOC contractors bid against the prices included in the price book. The cost, therefore, of any work
performed by the contractor is a contractor markup from the price book. The Gordian Group would
receive a 2% administrative fee from Cook County based on the total project cost of the work.
I specifically request authorization for the Purchasing Agent, on behalf of the Office of Capital Planning
and Policy, to:
b. Enter into and execute an agreement with the Gordian Group on the same terms as, and actively
participate in, the City’s JOC agreement for the coordination and administrative management of
the Job Order Contracting program;
c. Do all such acts and things and to execute all contracts necessary to complete the Projects using
vendors selected through the City’s JOC program.
d. The following projects would be included and assigned by the Gordian Group to participating
JOC contractors:

ITEM #56
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 26, 2011 from
ABISHI CUNNINGHAM, JR., Public Defender
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $8,000.00 from Account
260-260, Professional and Managerial Services to Account 260-445 Operation of Automotive Equipment
to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet our obligation to the Cook County Sheriff's office for
gasoline.
Reason:

Due to the increase in gas prices, it is necessary to increase the funding in the Operation of
Auto Equipment account so that there are sufficient funds to cover FY2011 expenses.

From Account 260-260

Total

$8,000.00

To Account 260-445

Total

$8,000.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent on July 25th, 2011 that this account needed an infusion of funds to meet current
obligations. The balance in the account on July 25th was $5,976.00 and the balance 30 days prior
was $8,518.00

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The account used for the source of funds was identified because there is a unobligated balance of
$16,000.00 in the account. No other accounts were considered.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
This account was originally budgeted to accommodate any professional services that might be
required once the software integration program was in place to download case files from the circuit
court clerk's office. The development software integration program was delayed and therefore,
there is an unobligated surplus in the account.

ITEM #62
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 15, 2011 from
DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting approval from the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $15,000.00 from Account
335-240, Printing and Publishing to Account 335-268, Court Reporting to cover the cost of court
reporting and transcription services for the remainder of the fiscal year.

Total

$15,000.00

To Account 335-268

$15,000.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to the date?
On June 13, 2011 it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds.
The balance in the account at that time was $19,552.00 and the balance 30 days prior to that was
$23,205.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 335–240 was identified as the source of transferred funds since the FY 2011 budgeted
amount of $50,000.00 for rubber stamps (draw down contract) will not be fully needed in FY 2011.
The current contract has sufficient funds for the remainder of the fiscal year, hence, the availability
of funds for the transfers.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from Account 335-240.
