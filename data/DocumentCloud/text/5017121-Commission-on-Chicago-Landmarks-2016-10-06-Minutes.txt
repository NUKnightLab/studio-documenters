Chicago Landmarks (the "Rules and Regulations"), that the significant historical or
architectural features of the district are all exterior elevations and rooflines; and, (B)
Preliminarily find that the subject building, a 2-story frame and masonry house constructed
prior to 1886, with masonry first floor constructed prior to 1906, contributes to the character
of the Old Town Triangle District, which includes excellent examples of the architectural
styles that were popular in Chicago during the latter part of the nineteenth century; and, (C)
Preliminarily find that the demolition of a contributing building or structure within a

 features, pursuant to Article III, Section G.3.b., of the Rules and Regulations; and, (D)

demolition of the subject property will adversely affect and destroy significant historical and
architectural features of the property and the district; and, (E) Issue a preliminary decision
disapproving the demolition application.
Ms. Cuvalo informed the Commission that a preliminary decision disapproving the
demolition application would trigger an informal conference and, if the informal conference

 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
November 3, 2016
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on October 6, 2016, at 2:45 p.m. The meeting
was held at 121 N. LaSalle St., in Room 201-A.
Present:

Ernest Wong, Chair
Gabriel Ignacio Dziekiewicz
James Houlihan

Staff: Dijana Cuvalo
Kandalyn Hahn
Cynthia Roubik
Larry Shure
David Trayte
The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1. 800 S. Michigan
4th Ward
Historic Michigan Boulevard District and Proposed Essex Inn
Proposed revised design for a new 56-story, 620’-tall residential tower with 479 units,
ground-floor retail, and 4-levels of parking at the base screened by active uses along
Michigan Avenue.
Action:

The Committee found the following unanimously:
That the final design of the new construction project, contingent upon the
future approval of a demolition permit, and with the following conditions,
meets the criteria set forth in the Commission’s Rules and Regulations, the
Commission’s Guidelines for Alterations to Historic Buildings and New
Construction and the Design Guidelines for the Historic Michigan
Boulevard District therefore, the project will not have an adverse effect on
the significant historical and architectural features of the landmark district
and approve the project with the following conditions:
a) The size, shape, scale and siting of the building as shown on drawings
dated 9/19/16 is approved as proposed;
b) The various glazing treatments and metal slab edge cover for the
cladding of the base and tower are approved as proposed; and’
c) All applicable conditions of approval from the Committee’s previous
review of the project at the May 5, 2016, meeting will continue to be
applicable. Any major changes to the proposal will come back for
review and approval by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks or by
its Permit Review Committee.

 2. 5940 N. Sheridan
48th Ward
Edwin M. Colvin House
Proposed new, exterior, emergency exit stair at the rear of the building and new
rooftop mechanical units.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following condition:
1. The exterior exit stair and rooftop units shall be painted to match
adjacent masonry.

3. 558 W. Belden
43rd Ward
Mid-North District
Proposed attached 1-story garage addition and new curb cut in the rear yard,
alteration of window openings on Geneva Terrace façade, and a new rooftop deck
with a penthouse stair enclosure.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. Given that the proposed 9’-2”-wide curb cut and 1-car garage addition
is at the rear of the property, which is consistent with many existing
curb cuts in the district for corner properties, staff recommends
approval of the new curb-cut and attached garage with the condition
that the new garage doors be painted a dark color;
2. The replacement typical double-hung windows should be 2/2 to match
the historic configuration, and not 1/1 or 4/1 as currently proposed.
The window muntins shall be simulated-divided lites with substantial
interior and exterior profiles and a spacer bar. Enlarged existing and
proposed window details shall be included in the permit plans;
3. The proposed alterations to ten of the masonry openings facing
Geneva Terrace are approved as shown on drawings dated 9/19/16 as
the new sizes and locations are still compatible with the architectural
character of this secondary façade; and,
4. The proposed new rooftop railing, set back 17’ from the Belden façade
and 6’-3” from the Geneva Terrace façade and the new rooftop stair
enclosure will be minimally visible from the public way and are
approved as proposed.

Adjacent to Prairie Avenue District
Advisory Review: Proposed 4-story, 12-unit, townhouse development.
