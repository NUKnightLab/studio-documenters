WHEREAS, the Mikva Commission advised improved physical fitness for
members of the Chicago Fire Department; and
WHEREAS, the Chicago Fire Department is now implementing a new Health
and Fitness program designed to improve the physical fitness for fire fighting
personnel; and
WHEREAS, the study of legal and operational requirements to establish
physical standards for the hiring and the continued employment of Cook
County's law enforcement personnel was completed in August 2004 and
advised that promulgation of physical standards for the law enforcement
personnel employed by Cook County would be subject to collective bargaining
under the Illinois Labor Relations Act; and
WHEREAS, Cook County employs over 5,200 sworn officers and virtually all of
them belong to a union; and
WHEREAS, Cook County would have to bargain with each of the unions over
the creation and implementation of such a program, and if the county were
unable to reach agreement with each of these unions it would have to be
submitted for a decision to an Arbitrator who would have the authority to
determine whether the County would be allowed to implement such a program;
now, therefore
BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County urge the
Administration and the Sheriff of Cook County to negotiate appropriate physical
standards for sworn personnel of the Cook County Sheriff's Department in its
contracts with the unions representing sworn officers.
