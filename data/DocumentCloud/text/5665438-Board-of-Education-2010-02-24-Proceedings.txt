APPROVE THE CHICAGO PUBLIC NCLB DISTRICT IMPROVEMENT PLAN FOR THE
2009-2010 AND 2010-2011 SCHOOL YEARS

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RECOMMENDS:

That the Board approve the Chicago Public Schools? NCLB district improvement plan (DIP) for the 2009-
2010 and 2010-2011 school years.

DESCRIPTION: The Chief Executive Officer of the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) is requesting approval
of the two-year District Improvement Plan summarized on the attached Exhibit A which is required under
the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). NCLB requires that District improvement Plans identify
strategies the district is pursuing or pians to pursue in order to make AYP.

In Illinois. any district failing to make adequate yearly progress (AYP) in reading and mathematics scores
for five consecutive years or more must submit a school board-approved NCLB District Improvement Plan
to the Illinois State Board of Education for review.

in 2007. the Chicago Public Schools entered Corrective Action status and developed a two-year District
improvement Plan that covered the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 school years. The attached DIP
addresses how CPS intends to correct deficiencies that affect District AYP status during the 2009-2010
and 2010-2011 school years.

In developing the attached DIP. a range of strategies and measures were considered by the Chief
Executive Officer and the Chief EducatiOn Officer. CPS data were analyzed to target specific
interventions that are consistent with the District's identi?ed needs.

The attached DIP addresses the following specific student groups: 1) "All" group for reading, mathematics
and graduation rate; 2) African-American students in reading and mathematics: 3) Hispanic students in
reading; 4) English Language Learners in reading and mathematics; 5) Students with disabilities in
reading and mathematics; and 6) Economically disadvantaged students in reading and mathematics. A
range of strategies addressing these areas and the achievement of every CPS student has been included
in the District improvement Plan.

The Chief Executive Of?cer is authorized to file the attached DIP with ISBE and address all related
inquiries and modi?cation requests that result from review of the plan.

Four Conditions Are Required For Making Adequate Yearly Progress

 

1. At least 95% tested in reading and mathematics for every student gr0up. It the current year participation rate is less
than 95%, this condition may be met if the average of the current and preceding year rates is at least 95%, or if the
average of the current and two preceding years is at least 95%. Only actual participation rates are printed. If the
participation rate printed is less than 95% and yet this school makes AYP, it means that the 95% condition was met by
averaging.

2. At least 70% meeting/exceeding standards in reading and mathematics for every group. For any group with less than
70% meeting/exceeding standards, a 95% confidence interval was applied. Subgroups may meet this condition through
Safe Harbor provisions. 

3. For schools not making AYP solely because the IEP group fails to have 70% meeting/exceeding standards, 14% may be
added to this variable in accordance with the federal 2% flexibility provision.

4. At least 90% attendance rate for non-high schools and at least 78% graduation rate for high schools.

 

Includes only students enrolled as of 5/01/2008.

Safe Harbor Targets of 70% or above are not printed.

Subgroups with fewer than 45 students are not reported. Safe Harbor only applies to subgroups of 45 or more. In order
for Safe Harbor to apply, a subgroup must decrease by 10% the percentage of scores that did not meet state standards from
the previous year plus meet the other indicators (attendance rate for non-high schools and graduation rate for high
schools) for the subgroup. For subgroups that do not meet their Safe Harbor Targets, a 75% confidence interval is applied.
Safe Harbor allows schools an alternate method to meet subgroup minimum targets on achievement.

Three Conditions Are Required For Making Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) for LEP Subgroup

1. At Least 95.0% tested in Reading and Mathematics for the LEP Subgroup. If the current year's participation rates are less than 95%.
the participation rate far AYP will be considered sufficient if the average of the current year and the preceding year is at least
95%, or if the average of the current year and the two preceding years is at least 95%. Only actual participation rates are printed.
If the participation rate printed is less than 95% but 'Met is 'Yes?. it means the 95% condition was met by averaging.

2. At least 62.5% Meeting/Exceeding Standards for Reading and Mathematics for the LEP subgroup. For LEP subgroup under the 62.5%
Meeting/Exceeding requirement. a 95% confidence interval has been applied; or meet Safe Harbor requirements.

3. At least 90.0% Attendance Rate for elementary school districts or at least 75.0% Graduation Rate {or high school districts. Unit
districts must meet both criteria.

 

 

 

AYP for LEP subgroup includes only students enrolled as of 5/1/07.

Safe Harbor Targets of 62.5% or above are not printed.

LEP Subgroups with fewer than 45 students are not reported. Safe harbor only applies to subgroups. in order for sate harbor to apply. a
subgroup must decrease by 10% the percentage of scores that did not meet state standards from the previous year plus meet the other
indicators (attendance rate for non-high school districts, graduation rate for high school districts, and attendance and graduation rates for

unit school districts) for the subgroup. Safe harbor allows school districts an alternate method to meet subgroup minimum targets on
achievement.

State Assessments

62.1% students met or exceeded state standards on state tests in 2009. This is below the statewide average of75.5%. but is an increase of 1.7 percentage points over 2008. and

an increase of 4.1 percentage points since 2006.

67.5% of CPS elementary students met or exceeded state standards on the in 2009. This is below the statewide average of 79.3%. but is an increase of 2.3 percentage points

2008. and an increase of 6.2 percentage points since 2006.

ISAT Performance

On the ISAT, CPS showed improvement in most subjects and grade levels as compared to 2006 and 2008 performance levels. The areas With the most Improvement were:
9 ln mathematics. Grade 4 students improved by 4.5 percentage points from 2008 to 2009 and 6.2 percentage poian from 2006 to 2009.
In mathematics, Grade 7 students improved by 4.3 percentage points from 2008 to 2009 and I05 percentage points from 2006 to 2009.
In mathematics. Grade 5 students improved 3.2 percentage points from 2008 to 2009 and 10.7 percentage points from 2006 to 2009.
The only areas where performance between 2008 and 2009 declined were:
In reading. Grade 7 students decreased by 0.3 percentage points from 2008 to 2009. but improved by 6.4 percentage potnts from 7.006 to 2009.
In science. Grade 7 students decreased by 3.5 percentage points from 2006 to 2009, but improved by 1.6 percentage points from 2008 to 2009.
The percentage of African-American students meeting/exceeding on reading increased from 50.3% in 2006 to 59.4% in 2009. and From 527% to 63.9% in math.
0 African-American males have increased from 44.4% to 53.2% in reading between 2006 and 2009, and from 49.7% to 60.5% in math .
African-American females have increased from 56.3% to 65.7% reading between 2006 and 2009. and From 55.8% to 67.3% in math.

0 The percentage of ELL students meeting/exceeding on ISAT decreased from 53.9% to 33.7% between 2006 and 2009 in reading and from 68.1% to 56.4% in mathematics. However. in
2006. many ELL students took the IMAGE test. while in 2008 and 2009, all ELL students took the due to a change in State testing policy. ELL test scores dropped considerably
in 2008 as a result of this change in policy. Since 2008. the percentage of 151.1. students meetingicxcceding has increased by 1.1% in reading and 2.7% in math.

Despite the decrease in scores for ELL students. ISAT data for transitioned ELLs in their ?rst and second year of transition (T1 and T2) show that in both reading and math for
the past three years. these students are meeting or exceeding state standards at a higher rate in comparison to all students. In 2009. the percent ofTI and T2 students
meeting/exceeding standards was 73.6% in reading and 85.6% in math. compared to a district average of64.6% in reading and 72.1% in math.

0 CPS studean are also making State progress and pro?ciency targets on the ACCESS. In 2009. 93% made progress targets and 24.4% made pro?ciency targets.

a The percentage ofllispanic students meeting/exceeding on reading decreased from 65.3% to 64.1% from 2006 to 2009 in reading. and increased from 74.2% to 75.8% in

math. This may be largely due to the change in State policy regarding ELL students taking the in 2008. Since 2008, the percent of Hispanic students meeting/exceeding has
increased by 1.1% in reading and by 2.4% in math.

0 Hispanic males increased from 59.5% to 60.4% in reading between 2008 and 2009 and from 72.4% to 74.4% in math.
0 Hispanic females increased from 66.6% to 67.9% in reading between 2008 and 2009 and from 74.4% to 76.9% in math.
0 The percentage of White students meeting/exceeding on ISAT reading inc teased from 81.7% in 2006 to 84.2% in 2009. and from 86% to 89% in math.
0 White males increased from 77.8% to 80.8% in reading between 2006 and 2009 and From 84.8% to 88% in math.
White females increased from 85.5% to 87.9% in reading between 2006 and 2009 and from 87.2% to 90% in math.
0 The percentage of students with disabilities meeting/exceeding standards on has increased from 18% to 22.5% between 2006 and 2009 in reading and from 23.3% to 32.8% in
math.

0 The percent of economically disadvantaged students meetinyexceeding standards on ISAT increased from 56% to 61.6% between 2006 and 2009 in reading and from 61.2% to 69.9%
in math.

attendance collection procedures at CPS high schools. In moving from daily attendance collection to per-period collection, the attendance rate for CPS high schools dropped. This
began during the 2007-2008 school year. in 2009. attendance rates for high schools showed improvement.
0 Elementary school attendance was 94.5% in 200832009.

0 High school attendance was 81.0% in 2008?2009, compared to 77.9% In 2007?2008.

Areas of Strength

0 The percent of students meeting or exceeding on has increased substantially and consistently since 2002, from 39.5% to 67.5%. This growth spans grade levels and subgroups.
CPS is making state AMAO targets for progress and pro?ciency.

The proportion ofstudems exceeding standards on increased from 5.4% in 2002 to 13.3 in 2009.
0 Elementary schools have shown an increase in attendance and a decrease in mobility. Elementary school attendance is on par with the State.
First day student attendance was at an all time high in September 2009.

0 University of Chicago Consortium on School Research shows that the big gaps bemeen students in CPS and in the rest of the state disappear when we compare racial/ethnic groups

in CPS to their counterparts in the rest ofthe state, In fact. some groups to CPS consistently outperform their counterparts in the rest ofthc state. There are still large differences in
performance. however. between African-American and Latino students on the one hand and White and Asian students on the other.?

Areas of Weakness

Only 13% of elementary students and 10% of eighth grade students exceed state standards. Exceeding state standards in the is:h grade 15 correlated With high school success.
While the percentage of students meeting state standards is higher in the upper grades, the percentage nfsrudents exceeding state Standards is lower.
Despite increases on the PSAE between 2001 and 2006, the percentage of students meeting or exceeding state standards on PSAE has since fallen from 31.2% to 27.9%;

While the graduation rate has increased for all subgroups between 1999 and 2007. the high school dropout rate remains high. This is especially true for some subgroups, such as
African-American and Hispanic males.

0 High school attendance is qutte low compared to elementary school attendance. representing. on average. more than 2 weeks of school missed per student.

Factors - What factors are likely to have contributed to these results? Consider both external and internal factors to the district.
internal

. A significant number of district schools have adopted recommended high quality core curricula:
. 307 schools, or 64%, are implementing a supported core reading eurn'cula, which applies to grades K-5.
. 313 schools. or 65%, are implementing a supported core math curricula in grades K-5
. 286 schools, or 59%, are implementing a supported core math curricula in grades 6-8

. 231 schools, or 48%, are implementing a supported core science curricula in grades K-5

. 157 schools, or 32%, are implementing a supported core science curricula in grades 6-8

. 41 schools, or 34% of all high schools, are implementing the supported High School EnglishlLanguage Arts, Math and/ or Science curricula
The district must address the needs of high numbers of students citywide (more than 44,000), with especially large numbers in neighborhood high schools.
As the third largest district in the country. CPS has a large number of schools with a significant variety of needs, challenges and resources. It is unlikely that each
school has the right set of core instructional and intervention resources needed to address the needs of all students.

CPS does not offer a complete array of evidence-based reading interventions citywide, although more than 100 schools have implemented some interventions at
some grade levels.

CPS does not offer a complete array of evidence-based math interventions citywide to support struggling students.

External

A high percentage of the CPS population is economically disadvantaged. 83.4% of CPS students are eligible for free or reduced price lunch, compared to
approximately 32.9% of non-CPS students statewide.

CPS students had an annual mobility rate of 18.8% in 2009, meaning that approximately 77,000 students changed schools more than once in the 2008-2009 school
year. While this is a substantial drop from previous years, mobility among CPS students has averaged 24% annually from 2000 to 2009, representing a huge
challenge for schools losing and gaining students throughout the academic year.

CPS students were chronically truant at three times the rate of the statewide average in 2009 (11.3% vs. meaning that more than 46,000 enrolled students
did not attend regularly during the academic year. This was a large increase over previous years.

CPS serves more than 57,000 students who have Limited English Proficiency, significantly more than the statewide average of High rates of non-English
speaking households may result in parents who are less able to be involved in instructional support at home.

Declines in LEP performance may be largely due to change in State testing requirements; a much higher percentage of students taking the IMAGE prior to 2007'
2008 met state standards than do ELL students taking the ISAT or PSAE.

According to the 2000 Census the City of Chicago is home to more than 100 ethnic minorities and over 350,000 non-English speaking households, representing one
of the most diverse public school systems in the country.

Conclusions - What do these factors imply for next steps in improvement planning? These conclusions will be carried forward to Part (Key Factors).
In order to ensure that more students meet or exceed state standards, CPS must:

. Ensure all students have access to high quality core instructional practices and materials, as well as coaching and professional development supports that allow
teachers to deliver high quality core instruction.

. Utilize appropriate assessment practices to determine student response to core instruction, as well as assessment practices to determine areas of need for
students not making adequate progress in core instruction.

0 Ensure that schools have access to an array of evidence?based interventions to meet needs of students not making adequate progress in core instruction.

0 Utilize appropriate assessment and progress monitoring practices to determine student response to intervention strategies.

. Provide robust professional development to area. district and school staff to support high quality implementation of core instructional, intervention and data
driven decision making strategies required by the above.

CPS recently began implementing a performance management (PM) process that ensures that decisions are based on empirical evrdence about what best supports schools
and students. The process began in March 2009 with Central Office. Departments engaged with the PM team to develop outcome based performance metrics, data
collection methods and internal management structures that support data driven decision making. This performance management process is further informed by
comprehensive program evaluation and research provided by external partners. The PM team also extends beyond traditional performance management to provide
internal consulting services, including organizational design, process mapping and project planning. Currently, processes and tools are being developed to facilitate
school-based performance management.

CPS currently administers the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills in grades K-2 in most schools citywide. and grade 3 in several schools, 111:: DIBELS an: a set of
measures that assess foundational literacy skills. and serve as a screening and progress monitoring tool that identi?es students who are at risk of reading failure.

At the be innin of the 2009-2010 school car, 48%. 61%, and 47% of Kindergarten. grade. and 2nd grade students res cctivel were at benchmark.


CPS currently administers a reading and math benchmark assessment for grades 3-8 in the fall and winter. in the 2008-2009 school year, those benchmark assessments predicted the

percentage of students that would meet or exceed standards within 2-5% for each grade level. As a result ofthat close predictive relationship. the results ofthe benchmark assessment are
not repeated here.

As part of the district?s Performance Management initiative. CPS has also begun administration of the Scantron Performance Series on-linc adaptive assessment. This assessment provides
snapshots of student growth in reading, mathematics and science three times per year. In SY 2009-10. more than l50 elementary schools are using the assessment. By fall of 2010-1 l.al.i
elementary schools will use the test. Results are not yet available for the second administration of the assessment. but CPS plans to use them to identify schools, grade levels and

classrooms that require additional attention or from which promising practices can be gleaned. CPS is also working to select an assessment to measure growth on an interim basis in high
schools starting in SY 2009-2010.

CPS uses a redictive metric to determine which 9'9? radc students are on track to duate based on characteristics of ast raduatcs. The meme, called Freshmen On-Track. be an in 2005.

attainment the path to graduation from high school). By SY 2010?1 1, CPS plans to complete definitions ofthesc metrics and will make txrirtt-in~timc and annual data available to schools
to assist in tracking student progress on a regular basis against expected outcomes

Over 3.000 students at 135 elementary schools took the algebra placement exam in 2009? Of those taking the test. 42% passed. but only 8% received a ?high pass" score

In the Spring of 2007, CPS began a survey of 6?h-12?h grade student opinions on the safety. academic rigor, student support and the social emotional skills of their peers, As a result ofthat
effort. we know that in 2009:

75% of students felt their school was academically rigorous.

82% felt that there was an adequate or excellent level of safety and respect in the school's climate.

95% of elementary students and 79% of high school students felt that students were supported at the school

81% of elementary students and 71% of high school students felt that their peers had adequate or excellent social and emotional skills.
African American students felt least safe and thought peers possessed fewer SEL skills

0 High school students felt less supported at their schools than elementary students.

in the Spring of2007 CPS also began an annual parent survey to assess parent perceptions of and experiences with their children?s school(s), As a result. we know that in 2009:

89% of respondents were satis?ed with their child or children's school(s) overall
0 97% of respondents were satisfied with the opportunity for parent involvement at their child or children?s school

The number of students taking AP classes has almost tripled since 2000, increasing from 4.1% of high school students to 1 Despite this increase. the percentage of students enrolled in
AP classes who are successful on AP tests (scoring 3 or better) has stayed approximately even. in 2000. it wu 31.8% and in 2009 it was 30%.

There has been a substantial increase in the number of graduates going to college and the amount of?nancia] aid they receive?including a record $157 million in competitive scholarships
for 2008 graduates



CPS has implemented more opportunities for student to take rigorous courses. including AP courses at the high schools and algebra for grade students.

While the percentage of Students taking AP courses has nearly tripled, the percentage of students succeeding on tests has not gone down/

CPS has implemented an early literacy assessment citywide, providing teachers with ongoing access to progress monitoring data for instructional decision making.

CPS has implemented reading and mathematics benchmark assessments to identify student learning needs earlier in the school year and provide necessary interventions.
The percent of freshmen on-track to graduate by the end oftheir freshmen year is at an all?time high for the district.

Most students perceive the vast majority of adults in the building are available and accessible to support their learning needs. and want to help them learn,

The vast majority of parents feel welcomed in schools.

Weaknesses:

DIBELS and Benchmark data re?ect the same achievement gap weaknesses that are reported in for minorities. The relative ranking seems to be continued, where high
ranking schools have a different average score for each subgroup. but the same order it' ranked.

0 Different perceptions of safety among different subgroups may indicate that students in different schools or subgroups perceive less safe learning climates. which may impact
access to instruction.

0 Different perception of safety and support between high school and elementary school students may provide some insight into the different rates of meeting/exceeding on the
compared to PSAE

in some schools a relatively high proportion of students are involved in disciplinary infractions and suspension rates (sometimes even in response to non-serious behavioral
infractions) reduces access to instruction for students through reduced attendance in school or in class.

0 CPS has ongoing data on only negative student behavioral events. and is unable to identify students? or use reinforcements for posuive behavior in all schools

0 Parents are not sure that schools are meeting their child's needs, but it is not clear from additional parent data whether this is their academic needs. social needs or both.

Factors - What factors are likely to have contributed to these results? Consider both external and internal factors to the district.

Internal and external factors listed in the previous section also contribute to the results seen on internal assessment data. Improvements on some ofthe measures described above?

especially freshmen on-track rates and AP course participation? are largely due to the District's emphasis on these areas. as well as District support and professional development, over the
last few years.

Conclusions - What do these factors imply for next steps in improvement planning? These conclusions will be carried forward to Part 0 (Key Factors).

Conclusions detailed in the previous section. including an emphasis on high quality core instruction, interventions for struggling students, and a robust performance management (PM)
system, will positively impact results on internal assessments and measures.

Section i-C. Data E: Analysis - Other Data

 

Item 1 - Attributes and Challenges

Data - Briefly describe attributes and challenges of the district and commtmity that have affected student performance. What do these data and/or information tell you?
CPS services a student population which is 83.4% low income. nearly double the state average 

16.8% of families in Chicago were living in poverty as of 2008.
Seven neighborhoods had poverty rates higher 40%: more than 30.000 of our smdents reside in those neighborhoods.

CPS serves a student population that is 46.2% African-American. 41.2% Hispanic. 8.8% while and 3.5% ASJaniPacilic Islander. and 0.2% Native American.

12%. or more than 44.000. students were students with disabilities and 14%. or approximately 57,000, were LISP/English Language Learners.

CPS serves a city with high rates of community violence: There were 12 violent crimes for every l.000 residents in the City of Chicago during the 2007-2008 school year.

In 7 neighborhoods there were more than 30 violent crimes per 1,000 residents; more than 50.000 of our student reside in those neighborhoods.
0 Between September 2007 and October 2008. more than 400 active CPS students were shot away from school grounds in the City of Chicago.

According to the Illinois Dept. of Employment Security the City of Chicago had an unemployment rate of 1.4% as ofNovember 2009. higher than the nation and the rest of Illinois. This is
likely to disproportionately affect the lower income families CPS serves. 

annual funding for the 2008-2009 school year was $9,282 per student. compared With an average of $8.8l 7 statewide and $10,399 in surrounding suburban districts. Per-pupil funding in
suburban Cook county ranges greatly. however. from $6.094 in the lowest funded district to 517.547 in the highest.

Funding. poverty and violence provide signi?cant challenges to our school communities, However, it is important to note that CPS leadership does not feel that either demographics or
community factors provide an excuse for poor performance. it is our mission to provide the right supports to enable success for all students in all communities

Factor: - In what ways, if any, have these attributes and challenges contributed to student performance results?

Signi?cant community violence in some parts of the city creates an environment of stress and instability among students and families with which schools must contend. Signi?cant exposure
to violence limits students" ability to access even high quality instruction. Exposure to violence in community leads to trauma in many students which. if effects
school climate and student performance.

Signi?cant concentrations oflow SES households in some parts ofthe eity affect students' readiness to learn.

A limited array of academic and behavioral evidence-based strategies currently curtails the district?s capacity to respond with effective curricular and intervention resources given the
volume and diversity of need.

Conclusions What do these factors imply for next steps in improvement planning? Responses will be carried forward to Part (Kc-y Factors).

In response lo extreme violence. misconduct. and poor outcomes among Chicago Public Schools students. CPS has undertaken an ambitious program with two ultimate goals: l)Reduce the
likelihood that a CPS student will be involved in violent incidents both on and away from school grounds; and 2) Create a safe. secure and supportive environment for CPS students to excel
academically.

To achieve these goals. CPS is focused on three initiatives. One is early intervention for vulnerable high school students. CPS has identi?ed high-risk high school students based on a range
of factors, including attendance. behavior. and academic performance. To equip these students with the tools to succeed inside and outside the classroom. CPS would like to match each
student with a dedicated mentor. The mentor will work with the student to address the underlying iSsues that directly impact academic performance. safety, and overall well-being. Such
issues include substance abuse, gang involvement, troubled families. and poverty. CPS has retained a corps of advocates to focus on the 250 highest-risk students. Over time, CPS aims to
connect 10.000 at-risk high school students with community-based mentors. Toward that goal, CPS released an in early February, 2010 seeking community-based mentors for 2.000 at-
risk students.

The second initiative IS to create a safe school environment that allows students to excel academically. Despite the strong influence of non-controllable environmental factors on overall
safety and academic performance. school-level practices can make a difference. Focusing on approximately 40 high schools (with a deep program on an initial subset of6 pilot schools), CPS
will fund, monitor. and measure programs promoting a ?culture of calm?within schools. CPS will rigorously focus on data collection and monitoring to determine which programs work best
and to scale best practices These initiatives include social and emotional curriculum. classroom management training for staff. and additional staff to focus exclusively on
improving school culture. To track performance. CPS will measure both student-level and school-level data. including misconduct rate, safe climate survey scores. shooting victim rate,
attendance, and academic performance. As pan of this initiative, schools will also be expected to provide direct support to studean identi?ed among the 10.000 high-risk individuals.

The third initiative is ensuring safe passage to and from school. Although few shootings occur during transit to and from school, about 40% of students feel "not safe? or only ?somewhat
safe? during transit. Data suggest that the issue impacts attendance, academic performance, and extra-curricular participation. To address the problem, CPS. the Chicago Police Department,
and the Chicago Transtt Authority are working with principals and community members in the most troubled areas to develop a safe passage plan for their schools. To ensure required

resource allocation and program exec ution, CPS will coordinate with the key stakeholders. including community and faith-based organizations. CPD. CT A, CAPS. Local School Councils and
local elected of?cials.

Section I-C. Data 2: Analysis - Other Data

 

Item 2 - Educator Qualifications, Sta?f Capacity, and Professional Development

Data - Briefly describe do to an educator qualifications and data andlor information about stuff capacity and professional development opportunities related to areas of
weakness and strength. What do these data tell you?

CPS employs more than 23.000 teachers.

The average years of experience of a given CPS teacher decreased from 13.9 in 2002 to l2.7 in 2009.

93.6% ofclasscs are taught by highly quali?ed teachers

The proportion of teachers with a MaSLer's degree or above increased from 43.8% to 59.4% between 2002 and 2009.
Teacher vacancies were at 3% at the beginning of 2008-2009 school year.

302 CPS teachers achieved National Board Certi?cation in 2009, which is the largest class of any school district.

0 1.494 CPS teachers have National Board Certi?cation.

Factors - In what ways, if any, have educator qualifications, staff capacity. and professional development contributed to student performance resets?
Pre-servicc preparation does not always prepare teachers to differentiate instruction adequately to meet student needs, as evidenced by differential rates of performance and growth of
different subgroups.

Teacher tumover limits the sustained impact of coaching efforts and district supported PD in certain hard-to-staff schools.

Pic-service training does not necessarily prepare staff to work effectively in urban environments; for example. we know high quality math instruction requires experiential application of
concepts. including the use of manipulativcs. Staff do not always know how to prepare students to use manipulativcs

Even for well-trained and prepared staff to be successful in facilitating the academic and behavioral development of CPS students. structures and resources must be developed for ?delity.
monitoring and ongoing support.

Conclusions - What do these factors imply for next steps in improvement planning? Respmses will be carried forward to Part (Key Factors).

CPS has made a large investment in improving teacher and administrator quality through the Human Capital Initiative. in addition to recruiting higher quality teachers. CPS is implementing
higher standards for teachers and providing better teacher support. This is being accomplished by increasing the number of Nationally Board Certi?ed teachers and through locally
designed or partnered solutions for new teacher induction and professional development for all teachers

For school year 2010. the Department oflluman Capital implemented a new initiative to improve principal quality in our schools and piloted a parallel initiative for teachers. This initiative
redesigned two candidate screening processes. one for principal applicants and one for new teacher applicants The principal eligibility process screens candidates on the knowledge. skills
and abilities required for success in the principal role. These criteria re?ect available research about principal effectiveness. best practices and input from current and former CPS principals
and leaders. The new teacher application process requires candidates to undergo an intensive two-part screening An initial resume screen focused on teachers' certification, education, and
experience. In addition. successful candidates underwent a phone screen to assess their level of critical thinking. teaching ability, and classroom management.

CPS is aggressively working to revamp policies related to principal selection and support. Through its partnership with the Chicago Principals and Administrators CPS is
providing leadership development to current and aspiring princrpals. Programs for aspiring principals include an assessment of skills and dispositions First year principals are matched with
a veteran. successful mentor. Ongoing training for veteran principals is provided through the Illinois Administrators Academy (1AA).

Section I-C. Data 8 Analysis - Other Data

Item 3 - Parent involvement

 

Data - Brie?y describe data on parent involvement. What do these data tell you?
While most schools have Local School Councils (LSCs) that include parent representatives, fewer than 100 schools have active parent teacher or other voluntary parent organizations.

According to the State Sch00] Report Card, 89.6% of students had parents who had contact with teachers during the course ofthc 2008-2009 school year. This is below the statewide
average of96.7%. However. in a typical year over 90% of report cards are picked up at Report Card Pickup Day, suggesting that parent participation was underreported for the State School
Report Card. In addition. CPS recognizes that quality participation includes more than a single interaction between parents and teachers.

In the Spring of 2007. CPS began a citywide survey ol'parents. The 2009 survey indicated that most parents report that they know ofoppormmtics to participate in their child's school. but
only about a quarter ofthem report participating. Speci?cally:

90% report opponunities to participate in patent groups.
a 93% report opportunities to volunteer in the schoollclassroom.
94% report that the school offers information and events in the. language that they speak.

In addition? the survey indicated that:

86% of parents say that the school values their opinion.
0 74% feel welcome in the schools.
a 90% report that it is easy to contact their students? teachers ifneedcd.

Factors - in what ways, if any, has parent involvement contributed to student performance results?

CPS is a largely school district where schools have varying levels ofparental involvement in school activities, curricular strategies. etc, Additionally. CPS works with parents
who either do not speak English or for whom English is a second language. and this may limit their access to school staffand materials Based on limited data and varying levels of parent
involvement in schools. it is dif?cult to draw a direct conclusion on the impact that involvement might have on student performance. It is reasonable to conclude. however:

0 CPS parents are available in some schools at high levels. but are not consistently engaged in delivering or supporting strategies that advance student?s academic and behavioral
development;

0 Suf?cient data is not be collected to determine academic impact on student achievement; and

0 Where parents are engaged. CPS may not be fully focusing parent participation on supports aligned to core instruction. interventions matched to student needs.

Conclusions What do these factors imply for next steps in improvement planning? Responses will be carried forward to Part (Key Factors).

CPS is committed to involving parents and community members directly in the improvement process and the day-to?day learning process. CPS has a governance system that involves
parents and community members directly in the improvement process. Local School (LSC) are mandated by state law at everyvpublie school in the system. These LSCs have the

power to hire principals and oversee the implementation of the school?s improvement plan. Additionally. CPS supports a Parent Resource Center for Title Parent Advisory Council training
and support,

Describe the process and measures of success for this objective. (How will district personnel monitor the effectiveness of the strategies and activities?)

A performance management system has been established in the district to assess the effectiveness of programs and initiatives. and to monitor the progress of programs through Key

Performance Indicators (KPls) and regular performance management sessions. Annual department plans are designed to connect budget dollars to outcomes and align strategic planning,
budgeting, and performance measurement processes.

In concert with the Department of Student Assessment and Mctis. the Of?ce offloading and Language Arts is engaging in a comprehensive program evaluation ofthc Supported Core
Reading Materials Adoption. Success metrics include student scores; use of coaches to provide support to teachers around key activities: quality of
implementation; Professional Development participation among teachers and in-school instructional coaches; quality of lesson plans; changes in teaching strategies among teachers as
evidenced through survey results and observations: and school and teacher satisfaction with the program.

CPS has retained AIR to develop quarterly assessments tied to the particular [03 cumcula to gauge student progress. A data analyst manages the implementation of data (PD attendance.
pacing. coaching VISIIS) and enables careful management by principals and area of?cers ofthis work.

In addition. an evaluation ofthe use Olin-school instructional coaches is being conducted which looks at the activities in which coaches engage during in-school interactions and the
value-added bene?t of coaches in the schools

Also. the district is engaging comprehensive program evaluations of early literacy assessment (Reading 30). the Chicago Reading Benchmark Assessment, and the district writing

Objective 2 Title 

Strengthen mathematics teaching and learning through comprehenswe programs and systems of supports for Pre-Kindergarten through 12th grade in order to make Sate Harbor in
all subgroups in mathematics.

Objective 2 Description 

The Of?ce of Mathematics provides a system of supports to improve mathematics teaching and learning for students in Pre-K through 121h grade. and supports high-
quality, standards-based instruction. The following are important components ofthc programs.

I The implementation of quality instructional materials that incorporate cognitively demanding tasks
- Professional development that is aligned and connected with classroom instruction

- Professional development that is sustained through time and integrated with coaching

I Formative use of assessments

- Supports for instructional leaders

The Chicago Math and Screncc Initiative (CMSI). now in its seventh year, offers supported. coherent curricular programs. materials and tools, aligned teacher professional development.
and supports for administrators and coaches at the level. After six years or" expansion, more than 300 elementary schools use the mathematics programs. Participating schools have
shown greater improvement on the ISAT than nonparticipating schools. is continuing to expand to ensure that all students have access to high quality mathematics curricula. The
mathematics programs are research-based and designed to provide all students with high-quality. standards-based mathematics learning experiences

The district is committed to building teacher capacity to improve mathematics and science teaching and learning. Partnerships with local universities support middle grade endorsements for
teachers so that they are better prepared to teach mathematics and science in middle grade classrooms Courses are subsidized by CPS and programs provide opportunities for teachers to

take courses that develop teachers? content and pedagogical content knowledge In 2009-2010. the Board adOpted a middle grade specializatron policy requiring schools to prioritize content.
expertise in allocation and staf?ng of middle grades teaching positions to ensure students in 6-8 are taught by specialized teachers.

in 2008 the Board updated the elementary school algebra policy. The policy recognizes the importance of algebra as a gateway to high school success and prevides the opportunity for
algebra-ready middle grade students to enroll in a high school algebra course so that they are prepared to enroll in advanced mathematics courses in high school. Schools across the
district have applied to adopt a rigorous algebra program for advanced middle school students. Currently approximately 160 schools across the my are implementing an Algebra I course in
the middle grades.

The instructional Development System (IDS) provides a comprehensive system of supports for mathematics for grades 9-1] in 41 high schools that includes common courses. common
quarterly and summative assessments. professional development and coaching supports, and leadership development. Participating schools in their third year of implementation showed
greater improvement than non-IDS students on the PSAE exam in 2009.

The district is currently planning for the implementation of an model across the district during the 2010-20! I school year. The goal of RN is to provide high quality instruction to all
students and a tiered system of supports to meet the needs of students who are not making adequate progress and need additional interventions; During the 2009-2010 school year the
district is reviewing sereeners. diagnostic assessments. progress monitoring tools and interventions for mathematics to prepare for the implementation ofthe model the following school
year. The district will identify assessments and deveIOp the technology and processes to support progress tracking and reponing. Intervention programs that are research-based and
aligned to standards will be recommended to support school?based decision-making.

The district is in the process of piloting an early mathematics assessment designed to identify students and monitor progress of students needing additional supports in mathematics.

the Corey H. LRE monitoring processes. CPS has developed and refined tools to support schools in providing access to the general education curriculum for students with

disabilities. Areas addressed through the monitoring tools include quality. differentiated instruction, team teaching. integration of accommodations and modi?cations into
lesson plans. and collaboration between general and special education staff. The position of Specialized Services Administrators (SSAs) was created to monitor where schools are in
implementing best practices and work with schools to make improvements that ensure students with disabilities receive quality instruction in the least restrictive environment.

Improved Instructional Support for Schools: CPS has made improvements in the supports provided to schools around high quality instruction for students with disabilities. These
improvements have included the rede?nition of itinerant teaching positions to focus on building teacher capacity rather than providing direct services. the development of a series
of instructional professronal development modules designed to build school staff capacity, and improved alignment and coordination of instructional efforts with general education
staff. Support staff are being trained on the new professional development module series. which includes building inclusive environments. appropriately utilizing assistive
technology, implementing multi-sensory approaches to instruction. and utilizing data to drive instructional improvements for students with disabilities.
0 Improved Technology to Support High Quality 113? Development (Electronic IEP): During the 2009-20?) and 2010-20I 1 school years CPS will continue to deploy its new electronic
system. Key bene?ts include increased process ef?ciency. reduced paperwork burden, increased time to focus on instruction and service delivery. improved collaboration and

FINAL

APPROVE RESTRUCTURING PLANS FOR SCHOOLS CLASSIFIED AS IN NEED OF
RESTRUCTURING UNDER THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT (NCLB)

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RECOMMENDS:

That the Board approve restructuring plans for 22 schools that have newly entered restructuring status under
the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). and three schools with restructuring status that was recently
evaluated and confirmed by the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE).

DESCRIPTION: A summary of the new restructuring plans for the 25 Chicago Public Schools requiring
restructuring plans is set out on Exhibit A. The restructuring measures noted in each plan will also be
incorporated into the schools? School improvement Plans 

A school is placed in NCLB restructuring status if it fails to make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) for five
consecutive years. Upon being identi?ed as in need of restructuring. a school is placed in "Restructuring
Planning" status. and the district must develop a restructuring plan. If the school fails to make AYP for a sixth
year. the school is placed in "Restructuring Implementation" status. and the restructuring plan must be
implemented at the start of the subsequent school year.

NCLB requires a district to implement one of the following alternative school governance arrangements at a
school with restructuring status consistent with State law: (1) Reopen the school as a public charter school; (2)
Replace all or most of the school staff who are relevant to the school's failure to make (3) Enter into a
contract with an entity with a demonstrated record of effectiveness to operate the school; (4) Turn the
operation of the school over to the state; or (5) Any other major restructuring of the school's QOVernance
arrangement that makes fundamental reforms. such as signi?cant changes in the school's staf?ng and
governance. to improve student academic achievement and that have substantial promise of enabling the
school to make AYP.

In developing the attached restructuring plans. a range of strategies and measures were considered by the
school principal, Chief Area Officer. and the Chief Education Of?cer. School performance data were analyzed
to establish an individual plan for each school that targets specific interventions that address identified needs
and deficiencies. Parents and teachers at each school were provided with the opportunity to comment on the
plan.

The complete restructuring plan for each school is on file in the Of?ce of Performance.
