State of Ohio (Forf) Case # BR 12005687 and City of Cleveland propose to perform rock crushing on a
property located in a B1 General Industry District. The owner appeals for relief from the strict application of
the following sections of the Cleveland Codified Ordinances:
1. Section 325.572
which states that "Rock Crushing" means any activity that uses mechanical
processes to break down rock into gravel or other small particulate matter. Rock means any man-made
or naturally formed consolidated or coherent and relatively hard mass of material including but not
limited to stone, concrete, cement, asphalt, conglomerate or any similar material.
2. Section 345.04(b)(15)which states that Crushing is prohibited as the main or primary use it is
permitted only as accessory or incidental to a permitted us and only if approved by the Board of Zoning
Appeals through a Special Permit granted in accordance with the standards of this section. In
evaluating applications for Special Permits required by division (b) of this section, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall act to ensure that the proposed use or development does not adversely impact other
properties and the uses located on those properties. In its evaluation of potentially adverse impacts,
the Board shall consider, among others, the following factors:
A. The degree to which dust, smoke, cinders, heat, flares, odor, fumes, gases, radioactive materials,
glare, noise, vibration and other potentially harmful emissions or externalities are effectively confined
to the premises of the proposed use.
B. The nature and proximity of nearby uses with respect to their vulnerability to the off-site impacts of
the proposed use;
C. The extent to which impacts of the proposed use are comparable to the impacts typically associated
with the uses permitted in the General Industry District without the requirement for issuance of a
Special Permit. D. Hours of operation of the proposed use. E. Hazards associated with combust,
flammable or explosive materials on the property of the proposed use; F. The potential for adverse
impacts to streams, rivers and lakes; and G. Potentially mitigating effects of landscaping, buffering, or
topographical features.
