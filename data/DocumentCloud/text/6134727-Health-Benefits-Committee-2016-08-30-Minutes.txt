 members, there were discrepancies totaling 1408, based on various data elements such as HICN
(Medicare) numbers, dates of birth and name differences.
Ms. Howliet reported that staff reviewed the discrepancies, categorized them and then developed a plan
for correction of each category. In some cases members were contacted and asked to substantiate the
data Medicare provided. She reported that the file will be submitted weekly ongoing and staff will
continue to make corrections and rerun the file. As of August 12th, there were a total of 187 remaining
discrepancies.
Underwriting and Rate setting for 2017
Ms. Streit and Mr. Heppner of Segal Co. reported on medical plan cost drivers, historical medical plan
trend and total projected plan costs and associated member premium rates for 2017 noted as follows:
Medical plan cost drivers
Large claims above $25,000 account for 70% of claim dollars spent on only 9.9% of members in the
plans available to nonMedicare members. Within that group, members who are above age 65 but
ineligible for Medicare are driving up cost for the group as a whole. For 2017, this has resulted in added
expense for the Fund and higher premium increases for members. The monthly per capita medical cost
for under age 65 is projected to be $888, while the over age 65 nonMedicare is at $1,299 monthly.
The Trustees asked if it were possible in some instances for members to pay for Medicare part A if it
were not available for free. They discussed some possible ways to research getting Medicare coverage
for this group, and asked Staff to continue to reseach possible solutions.
Trend Projections - Medical
Over the past twelve month period through June 30, 2016, the UHC Choice Plan has had a 5% trend for
non-Medicare, and the Choice Plus Plan had a 17.7% trend. Both Medicare Plans have had flat medical
trend. For 2017, Segal has projected a 7% trend for non-Medicare plans, and a 5% trend for Medicare
plans. According to Segal’s methodology these prospective trends are based on industry reported data
and not indicative of any specific claims attributable to individual CCPF plan members.
Trend Projections – Prescription Drug
Over the twelve month period ending June 30, 2016, the pharmacy trend began at 16% but ended June
30, 2016 at 3.5%. For 2017, the projected trend for non-Medicare is at 13.8%, and for Medicare eligible
members, 15%.
Total Projected Annual Cost
Total annual plan cost for 2017 is projected to be $95,500,016 based on enrollment as of August, 2016.
Total Fund expense is expected to be $53,416,248, net of rebates and EGWP subsidies valued at
$6,046,600, expected expense is reduced to $47,369,648. The estimate included savings from the
previously recommended changes to Caremark’s formulary and also elimination of ED coverage.
