In early November 2015, the CEO provided written notice to Chicago Charter School Foundation that he
intended to recommend to the Board the revocation of the Chicago International Charter School - Lam
Hawkins Campus at the end of the 2015-2016 school year due to the following reasons:

Section of the Illinois Charter Schools Law states that a charter may be revoked if it fails to

?meet or make reasonable progress toward achievement of the content standards or pupil Errormance
standards identi?ed in the charter?. Furthermore. Section 27A-9lcll4} of the Illinois Charter Schools Law

states that, after being noti?ed of the reason for revocation. the charter school must submit a written plan
for remediation and the plan for remediation will be reviewed and a determination will be made whether
the charter failed to implement the plan.

In addition, Chicago International Charter Schdol?s Charter_SchooI Agreement dictates that the charter
campus will be evaluated annually in accordance with the CPS School Quality Rating Policy (SQRP) to
determine if the campus is meeting or making reasonable pmress toward achievement of the content
standards or pupil performance standards. in the 2014-2015 school year the Chicago International
Charter School Lam Hawkins Campus received a Level 3 rating on the SQRP. On December 3, 2014,
the Of?ce of Innovation and Incubation noti?ed the Chicago International Charter School that, for school
year 2014-2015, its Lapy Hawkins Campus was failing to meet standards or make reasonable progress
toward achievement of the content standards or pupil performance standards and the revocation process
began. Chicago International Charter School - Largy Hawkins Campus submitted a remediation plan. The
Of?ce of Innovation and Incubation; in coniunction _with the Of?ce of Accountabilitv. reviewed the
remediation plan and its implementation. The CEO has decided that Chicago lntemational Charter School
Lagy Hawkins Campus failed to implement its remediation plan. Pursuant to the Illinois Charter Schools

Law and the Charter School Agreement, the CEO recommends that the Chicago lntemational Charter
School Lar Hawkins Cam us be revoke at the end of the 2015-2016 school ear.

Chicago Charter Schogl Foundation shall wind down and cease operations of its Lara Hawkins Campus.
After the revocation of that campus, the overall at capacity enrollment for the charter school shall
decrease to 9,261 students by the fall of 2016. Both parties shall enter into an amendment to the Charter

school sites to deter crime and ensure the safety of students. CPD also provides school Sergeants who

determined by the Superintendent of CPD in consultation with the Board. CPD provides computer
terminals connected to the CPD network for the purpose of processing juvenile offenders at offices

The presence of CPD Of?cers has been very valuable in supporting the schools in maintaining a calm
and safe environment. CPS has enhanced the value of this partnership by transforming their role into
one where they work to be more proactive in addressing situations before they become serious incidents
through relationship?building and promoting supportive student interactions through strategies including
restorative justice. 

This proactive strategy is designed to eliminate the school?to-prison pipeline and has worked well In

2012 School Year. Across the district, CPS has seen a reduction in referrals to CPD by 22% over the
