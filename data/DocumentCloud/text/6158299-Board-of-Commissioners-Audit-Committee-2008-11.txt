Audit Committee

From: Donna L. Dunningsj 
Chief Financial Of?cer

The following are responses to your letter dated November 19, 2008:

Question #1

On page 3 of the Management Discussion Analysis, the net assets of the
County decreased $2 76 million in Fiscal Year 2007, continuing a downward trend.
Please explain the factors that are causing this decrease in net assets.

The Net Assets ?gure is comprised of two (2) components:

0 Restricted Net Assets. These assets are restricted due to external restrictions
imposed by legislation and bond covenants. The County?s restricted net assets
decreased $6.4 million from $374.6 million in ?scal year 2006 to 368.2 million
in ?scal year 2007. Of the $368.2 million in restricted assets, $6.3 million is
attributable to external restrictions imposed on Health Facilities and $361.9
million is restricted due to bond covenants.

Unrestricted Net Assets. Please note that the de?cit in unrestricted net assets of
$655.4 million in ?scal year 2007 does not indicate that the County did not have
the resources available to pay its bills or other short-term liabilities. The de?cit
was the result of having long-term commitments that were greater than currently
available resources.

Prinlud on Recycled Paper

The primary factor attributable to the decrease in unrestricted net assets in ?scal year
2007 included the following:

Cook County Health Facilities liabilities continually outpace assets and expenses outpace
revenues.

Program revenue are derived the program itself and reduce the cost of operating
the function to the County. Total program revenues for the Health Facilities have
continued to decrease year over year.

The decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to:
A shortfall for charges for services
0 A signi?cant decrease in patient fee revenue collected
0 Increases in the self?pay component of the payor mix while the Medicaid
payor utilization decreased over the same period.

For Cook County the primary factors attributable to the decrease in unrestricted net assets
in ?scal year 2007 included the following:

Continued signi?cant increases in the Net Pension Obligation (NPO) liability.
The net pension obligation is the cumulative amount by which the County has not
actually contributed the annual required contribution (ARC) of the employer
portion for the period. The ARC is an amount that is actuarially determined in
accordance with requirements established by GASB Statements 43 and 45. If the
ARC payments are made on an ongoing basis, the actuarial projections is that
suf?cient resources would be available to fund both the normal cost for each year
and the amortized unfunded liability. While a net pension obligation does not
indicate that the plan will run out of funds in the near future, it does indicate that
it is likely that the employer will need to increase their contributions to the plan in
the future, in order for the pension plan to be able to pay pension bene?ts and
expenses over the long?tenn. In ?scal year 2007, the NPO liability increased
$158 million from $736 million in ?scal year 2006 to $894 million in ?scal
year 2007.

The County is self-insured for various types of liabilities and utilizes an actuary to
calculate a liability and related expenses. The risk management expense and
long-term liability has been increasing year over year, especially in ?scal year
2008. In ?scal year 2007, the risk management expense was $125 million,
representing a $13 million increase from $112 million in ?scal year 2006.
In ?scal year 2008 the risk management expense, net of actuarial adjustments, is
projected to be $150 million, representing a $25 million increase from
$125 million in ?scal year 2007.

Question #2

On page 3 of the CAFR ?s a combined fund balance of $891.8 million was
reported, a decrease of] What is this ?gure projected to be at the end of the
current ?scal year?

An internal review of the various components of the combined fund balance waas

prepared by the Of?ce of the Comptroller. At this point in time, the ending combined
fund balance for ?scal year 2008 is projected to be in the rand of 113810?820 million.

Question #3

On page 14 of the Letter to Management, a repeat ?nding regarding the County?s net
pension obligation is detailed. How does the current ratio of assets to liability of 77.3 
compare to other comparable pension funds?

Question #4

On page 8 of the Letter to Management, the JD Edwards ?xed asst module is
mentioned as a new application, yet the Chief Information Officer is suggesting a
transition away from the JD Edwards system in the future. Please explain this
contribution.

The current JD Edwards ?xed asset module is not a new application. It is a part of the JD
Edwards ?One World? application. It has served our needs for over a decade. The issue
at hand is attributable to the depreciation schedule and applicable formula. This is a
known problem. We are now several revisions behind and cannot take advantage of the
enhancements to the system. As outlined in my Mainframe Transition Report previously
sent to all Commissioners and Staff, our current ?nancial systems are out of date and will
soon be unable to accommodate our government operations. We must seek approval of
the approximately $50?75 MM required to completely overhaul our Enterprise Resource
Planning and Financial Systems environment. The Bureau of Technology remains
consistent in our recommendation that the county should transition out of ID Edwards.

Question #5

On page I 7 of the Letter to Management, a repeat ?nding regarding errors on the
general ledger is discussed. Please list the steps taken to avoid this ?nding in future
audits.

The Comptroller?s Of?ce is in the process of implementing procedures to minimize the
potential for errors to occur.

Speci?c steps that are being undertaken include:

The Chief Financial Of?cer and County Comptroller have given authority to the
Director of Financial Reporting to manage the entire ?scal audit process including
monitoring the year-end closing activity.

. The Director of Financial Reporting is in the process of formalizing and
documenting a plan for year?end closing policies and procedures, assignments,
and general ledger entries maintained by the Comptroller?s Of?ce.

0 The General Ledger Department in the Comptroller?s Of?ce will be responsible
for closing the Appr0priation Ledger for the ?scal year and the Director of
Financial Reporting will manage the year?end adjustments to the General Ledger
for annual reporting purposes.

If you have any questions please call me at 312-603?5287.
