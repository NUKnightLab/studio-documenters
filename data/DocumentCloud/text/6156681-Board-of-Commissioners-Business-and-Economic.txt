Sec. 74-63. - Assessment classes.
Real estate is divided into the following assessment classes:
***
(16)Class E. Real estate property used for industrial or commercial purposes not qualifying for any other
classifications stated in this Section.

a. To be eligible for a Class E classiﬁcation an applicant must prove intent to employ youth as defined in

the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by
Class E is necessary for economic development and/or youth employment to occur on that speciﬁc real
estate and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class
E application to the Assessor. A certiﬁed copy of the Ordinance or Resolution must be ﬁled at the time
of application for the Class E classiﬁcation. A copy of that Ordinance or Resolution, whichever is
submitted, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Oﬃce to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to
the members of the County Board from the aﬀected districts.
c. To qualify for the Class E classiﬁcation, an application for Class E classiﬁcation must be filed with the

E; and
3. A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are ﬁled with the Oﬃce of the
Assessor before the expiration of the 90-percent assessment level period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply, qualifies for
Class E and complies with the youth employment requirements stated in this Section. Any property
which applies for Class E treatment on or before the adoption date of the ordinance from which this
Page 12 of 14

which the incentive was revoked or cancelled as to the subject property. In such an instance, the taxpayer shall be
liable for and shall reimburse to the County Collector an amount equal to the diﬀerence in the amount of taxes that
