Recommendations, Discussion / Information Item
A. Strategic planning discussion (continued)
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, stated that Agnes Therady, Executive Director of Nursing,
will be reviewing a strategic planning presentation on Nursing Strategy. Additionally, he introduced
Richard Sewell, Associate Dean of Community and Public Health Practice at UIC School of Public Health,
who will be facilitating the strategic planning discussions in these meetings through to the adoption of a full
strategic plan in the summer.
Ms. Therady provided an overview of the presentation on Nursing Strategy, which included information on
the following subjects:
• Nothing in Isolation: Nursing Strategic Plan Contributors;
• A Snapshot of Nursing:
- Age
- Years of Service within CCHHS
- Comparison of RN and Patient Race
- Ethnicity
- Education
• Relationships with Illinois Nursing Schools;
• Our Current Performance Metrics;
• Strategic Input from CCHHS Nurse Leaders;
• A Summary of the Findings;
• The Future Nurse;
• Ambulatory Integrated Care Team;
• Strategic Focus;
• Recommended Nursing Strategy Tactics for each of the five (5) Principle Objectives; and
• Magnet Recognition Program®.
During the discussion of the information on slide 6, Chairman Velasquez requested information on the total
number of registered nurses, and the number of those that provide direct patient care. Ms. Therady responded
that she will provide the information.
During the discussion of the information on slides 8 and 9, regarding race and ethnicity of CCHHS nurses and
patients, Chairman Velasquez noted that the aspect of having providers who are fluent and culturally
competent is very important. On slide 9, in reference to the chart reflecting that 13% of the patients selected
Spanish as their preferred language, Director Gugenheim stated that there is another category not identified in
the information presented – that is the monolingual, non-English speaking patient. Ms. Therady stated that
speaking in the language of the patient helps to engage the patient at a different level; this also becomes
meaningful for the patient to be able to relate to the caregiver if they are culturally and linguistically similar to
them.
Chairman Velasquez stated that another issue she struggles with relates to the terminology of “race and
ethnicity” – she stated that those who are Hispanic/Latino are of all colors. This chart does not represent that,
and she knows that it would be very difficult to do, but it is important to look at the numbers to be able to
identify the people being served. Director Junge inquired whether it is possible to break this information
down by location. Ms. Therady responded affirmatively; she stated that she will provide the information.

Recommendations, Discussion / Information Item
A. Strategic planning discussion (continued)
During the discussion of the subject of care coordination, Director Junge inquired regarding the use of
community health workers who would be employed by CCHHS; she noted that she did not see any reference
to that in the information. Dr. Shannon responded that the challenge for the organization going forward is
getting enough independence to be able to create positions. Today and historically, there is a very finite
number of positions; the challenge that always comes up when considering the creation of a new role is what
positions go away as a result. In the past, the administration has tried to find opportunities to either get grant
funding for those kinds of roles, or gets to the point of decision where there is no other choice but to create the
new role using existing positions.
During the discussion of the recommended tactics for the Nursing Strategy, Ms. Therady stated that what may
be the best way to be able to improve excellence in Nursing is to strive for the Magnet Recognition Program.
Realistically, this is not an overnight accomplishment, but the administration is laying the foundation brick by
brick to ensure success. Further information on the Program was included in the presentation.
During the discussion of the information, the following members of leadership joined the Committee in the
conversation: Debra Carey, Chief Operating Officer, Ambulatory Services; Dr. Karen Duncan, Interim Chief
Operating Officer, Hospital Based Services; Douglas Elwell, Deputy CEO of Finance and Strategy; Dr.
Claudia Fegan, Executive Medical Director/Medical Director-Stroger; Steven Glass, Executive Director of
Managed Care; and Mary Sajdak, Senior Director of Integrated Care Management.
Director Junge noted that it is important to be mindful that CCHHS serves a unique population overall,
including detainees; one important emphasis would be on the social determinants of health, which were
mentioned in the presentation.
The Committee discussed the challenges relating to reaching the goals set with potentially less resources. Mr.
Elwell noted that the administration is on alert that CCHHS will receive less County funding in the next fiscal
year. Dr. Shannon concurred; however, he added that there are some real opportunities for improvement.
Director Gugenheim stated that there is a fundamental need to define population as it relates to CCHHS and
the strategic plan; it is impossible to talk about population health without defining that. There are many
defined populations served – through clinic encounters, public health activities in suburban Cook County,
Emergency Department visits, care for detainees at Cermak – but what do we mean by population? The
expectations of what CCHHS can do in terms of population for any one of these defined populations, must of
course be very different and must be sorted out.

VII. Adjourn
As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman Velasquez declared that the meeting was
ADJOURNED.

Cathy Bodnar, MS, RN, CHC
Chief Compliance Officer
Cook County Health & Hospitals System
1900 West Polk, Suite 123 Rm 118
Chicago, IL 60612
Dear Cathy:
This is a summary report for our review of Cook County Health & Hospitals
System employees and vendors which was conducted by our office on March 1518, 2016. Based on data we received on March 14, 2016, we reviewed 6,500
employees and 754 vendors (after removing exact duplicates) for possible
sanctions which could affect federal or state healthcare funding.
These individuals and vendors were reviewed by checking for name matches
against the OIG List of Excluded Individuals/Entities and the System for Award
Management (SAM) Exclusions list (formerly known as the GSA Excluded Party
List System) which also includes the U.S. Department of the Treasury Specially
Designated Nationals (SDN) List. They also were matched against the State of
Illinois Provider Sanctions list.
When no match occurs, we assess that individual to be not excluded from federal
or state healthcare programs. When a possible match does occur, our analysts
then review each possible match and perform any additional research as
necessary to resolve each of these matches. After further review, we determined
that none of these matches were positive.
These employees and vendors will continue to be screened for any new
exclusions through our ContinueCheck® monthly rechecking service for the next
11 months as specified in our contract. Cook County Health & Hospitals System
also may send us a list of newly-hired employees and newly-engaged vendors
each month to be included in this monthly rechecking.
Sincerely,

Kirsten Ballman
