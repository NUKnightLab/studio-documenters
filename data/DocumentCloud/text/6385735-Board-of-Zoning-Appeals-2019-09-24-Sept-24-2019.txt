JAR Capital, LLC appeals the decision of the Buildings Safety
Engineering and Environmental Department’s Special Land Use
Review dated February 6, 2019 which states; the subject property
has been identified as being within 1000 radial feet of a Drug Free
Zone in a M4 INTENSIVE INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT). This case is
appealed because Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be
taken by any person, firm, partnership or corporation, or by any
City department, commission, board or other City agency which is
aggrieved 1) by a decision of an enforcing officer, or 2) by any
decision made by the Buildings and Safety Engineering
Department involving Conditional Uses. Also, the Buildings,
Safety Engineering, and Environmental Department shall not
approve any request under this Chapter for a medical marihuana
caregiver center in a Drug Free Zone. The locational specifications
related to drug-free zones of subsection 354(b)(1) of this section
may not be waived or modified by the Buildings, Safety
Engineering and Environmental Department, nor the Board of
Zoning Appeals. Applications that are not consistent with the
locational specifications of subsection (b)(1) of this section shall
be considered ineligible and shall be dismissed. Also, the
proposed MMCC located at 611 Hillger has been identified as
being in a Drug Free Zone (DFZ) based on its proximity to
Pathways Academy located at 11200 (aka 11340) E. Jefferson..
Pathways Academy is a legally, operating, public charter school
located approximately 539 radial feet from the subject property at
611 Hillger, therefore becomes ineligible to establish a Medical
Marihuna Growers Faculty (Sections 61-4-72 Appeals and 61-3355 Permitted districts for medical marihuana facilities;
Conditional Uses; Restrictions(c)(d).).AP
