Report from Chief Quality Officer

A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
Dr. Krishna Das, Chief Quality Officer, stated that there were no new updates to provide regarding regulatory and
accreditation matters. Staff continue their preparations for the full accreditation survey by The Joint Commission
(TJC) at Stroger Hospital; the survey will occur anytime between now and November. She noted that there have
been reviews by representatives of the Illinois Department of Public Health of a variety of newly installed
equipment.
B. Metrics (Attachment #1)
Dr. Das reviewed the presentation on Metrics. The Committee discussed the information.
With regard to Slide 2, Board Chairman Hammock remarked that, in looking at the first three (3) measures, it looks
like the performance is relatively consistent over the past two (2) years. He stated that, as the administration looks
at next year, if the measures look like they have stabilized, let’s find some others to track. Dr. Das concurred; she
stated that the administration is going through a process to determine those measures for next year.

 III. Report from Chief Quality Officer (continued)
During the discussion of the slides pertaining to Patient Experience, Director Lerner commented on the measures
relating to the patient’s willingness to recommend the hospital and their perspective on cleanliness. Dr. Das stated
that, with regard to cleanliness, the patient comments seem to focus on three (3) areas: bathrooms, general
cleanliness all around and cleanliness within the patient rooms. Director Lerner suggested that, in the future, on a
quarterly basis, the Committee should receive for review and information all of the open-ended comments received
from patients in survey responses.
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, stated that management of environmental services is provided
under the Sodexo contract; the staff is employed by CCHHS. Representatives from Sodexo are engaged in this
conversation; the managing director of that area sees these reports regularly, is involved in the patient experience
council, and is involved in the hospital quality improvement committee. Dr. Shannon added that there will also be a
greater investment in personnel for that area in FY2016. Director Lerner inquired as to the contract length for the
Sodexo contract and whether there is any incentive included in the contract in relation to these kinds of statistics.
Dr. Karen Duncan, Interim Chief Operating Officer, Hospital Based Services, responded that the Sodexo contract
expires in June of 2016; with regard to the question relating to whether those types of incentives are built into the
current contract, she responded in the negative. Director Lerner recommended that when the administration is
developing the Request for Proposals (RFP) for the new contract, some kind of metrics-based standards should be
built into that so the vendor has an ownership in this area. Chairman Gugenheim noted that there is also an issue of
general ownership by the collective of all staff. It was requested that the director from Sodexo responsible for
managing these services present their plans for improving the metrics at a future meeting. Director Junge recalled
that years ago, there were issues with Sodexo in terms of supplies and scheduling; it may be worth seeing if there
are obstacles from the union’s perspective on what is happening “on the ground.”
Board Chairman Hammock stated that he hopes the Board will be spending a lot of time and energy thinking about
ambulatory care in the upcoming year; this subject is so critical to CCHHS’ future as a health system. When
thinking about new metrics to add for the coming year, which starts December 1st, further thought should be given
to Ambulatory Services. He noted that there are currently four (4) measures relating to Ambulatory Services;
perhaps another three (3) or four (4) measures for next year would be appropriate.

C. Operating Room Performance Improvement Project (Attachment #2)
The following individuals reviewed the presentation on the Operating Room (OR) Improvement Project and
provided additional information: Dr. Richard Keen, Chairman of the Department of Surgery; Jayne Mitton, RN,
Interim Service Line Director, Perioperative Services at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County; and Dr.
Gennadiy Voronov, Chairman of the Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Management.
Board Chairman Hammock stated that, according to the information, the number of surgeries has been relatively
stable over a period of time; he inquired whether the number of surgery ORs has increased or decreased. Dr. Keen
responded that the number of ORs decreased by two (2) since March, from a total of twenty (20). Currently, there
are seventeen (17) ORs available: one (1) room is down and is not available for surgeries; one (1) room is reserved
for Trauma; and sixteen (16) are available for scheduling.
Dr. Keen stated that the complexity of the cases has increased, as there has been a conscious effort to move more
straightforward cases to Provident Hospital. There are a large number of emergencies that come in; staff have to
accommodate the emergencies/demand that comes in, accommodate those who were scheduled in advance, and
accommodate the new patients requiring urgent care.
Page 2 of 66

 III. Report from Chief Quality Officer (continued)
Director Marsh inquired regarding the wait time to get an elective case scheduled. Dr. Keen responded that the wait
time varies, and is based on many factors. Dr. Shannon provided information on some factors that affect this; he
stated that, currently, there is the immediate triaging for cases that come in through Trauma or the Emergency
Department (ED). The second tier of that is typically related to oncologic or cancer cases that are waiting;
everything else follows after that. The hope is that one of the byproducts of this project is to develop sets of metrics
across these different areas of surgery.
Information was provided regarding patient communications prior to the day of surgery. Ms. Mitton stated that staff
from Clinic C are supposed to call the patients on the day before the surgery; in addition, she noted that residents
frequently call the patient the day before the surgery. In the past, such communications were not tracked to ensure
contact was made, but those communications are now tracked. Ms. Mitton stated that there are ways to improve this
process; perhaps an additional phone call should be made to the patient one (1) week prior to surgery, as this may
help for those patients who have issues with securing transportation or child care services.
Dr. Shannon reminded the Committee that OR improvements were one of the key initiatives for the organization this
year. In keeping with last year, the baseline to comparison that will be used is 3rd Quarter - 2014 through 3rd Quarter
- 2015. Dr. Das will be bringing that up to the Quality and Patient Safety Committee as part of the annual reporting
on the System’s performance on the overall quality plan. Additionally, he noted that the administration will be
coming back with a follow-up in the coming year from the first look at the Illinois Surgical Quality Improvement
Collaborative (ISQIC) data. With regard to the follow-up for the OR project, Director Lerner requested that the team
try to differentiate from those cases that are pre-scheduled cases versus ED/Trauma cases.

 Opportunities for OR Process Improvement
• Meeting first start goal could increase available time by 3 %
• Meeting turnover time goal: approximate 5-7% increase in
available OR time, with no additional staff
• Ability to use the additional 3 ORs, not currently scheduled,
would provide additional 18 % OR hours, (requires hiring of
additional staff)
• Staffing 10 ORs until 6 pm increases available OR time by
20 % (requires hiring of additional staff)
Page 50 of 66

 Main OR Staffing Models:
Challenges
• National shortage of OR nurses
• Competitiveness in local market
– Sign on bonuses
– Flexibility of schedule

• Shortage of available staff via agency staffing
• Length of training and orientation required
for new hires

RE: Approval of Clinical Contract Review

As specified by the Joint Commission leadership standards (LD.O4.03.09) leaders of the
organization monitor the performance of contracted services for care and treatment of patients.
Leaders, including the organized Medical Staff and the Board of Directors, assure that the same
level of care is provided, whether directly by the hospital or through contracted services.

This standard applies to services such as care and treatment, which are provided to the hospital?s
patients. It does not apply to contracted services which are not directly related to patient care.

The Executive Medical Staff of John H. Stroger, Hospital, through the Department Heads of the
using departments, have reviewed the clinical contracts in the attached list. Key performance
indicators and clinical and regulatory indicators have been used to evaluate the contracts for
satisfactory clinical performance as summarized in this list. All the clinical contracts listed have
been found to be compliant. This evaluation has been presented to the Executive Medical Staff and
they have approved the compliance with the contracts as described herein.

This document is now being presented to the Quality and Safety Committee of the Board of
Directors for the Committee?s approval of the process of clinical contract review.
