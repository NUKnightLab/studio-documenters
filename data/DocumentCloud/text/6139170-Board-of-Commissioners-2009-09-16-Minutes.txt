(1)

Criteria for use of requests for proposals or requests for qualifications. Proposals for
contracts not adaptable to competitive bidding shall be solicited through the issuance of
requests for proposals ("RFP") or requests for qualifications ("RFQ") unless otherwise
authorized by the Board. RFPs and RFQs are appropriate when competitive bidding is not
practicable or advantageous to the County. RFPs and/or RFQs may result in the
negotiation of a contract with one or more proposers selected as the result of an
evaluation process which includes the simultaneous consideration of multiple evaluation
factors.

(2)

Notification. In order to issue an RFP or RFQ, the Using Department or Elected Official
must notify the Purchasing Agent in writing that it intends to issue a RFP or RFQ.

(3)

Prescribed content of RFPs and RFQs. All RFPs and/or RFQs shall include such forms
and provisions as shall be issued from time to time by the Office of the Purchasing
Agent. These forms shall include, but not be limited to: Instructions to Proposers;
General Conditions; Cook County Certification and Execution Forms and a Proposer
Registration Form which shall include the name and firm of any lobbyist retained for the
RFP; and all additional documents as required by the Purchasing Agent. The Using
Department or Elected Official shall be responsible for developing appropriate special
conditions, a proposer questionnaire and a cost proposal form.

(4)

Review prior to issuance. RFPs and/or RFQs shall be submitted to the Office of the
Purchasing Agent for review prior to their issuance. In addition to the direct transmittal of
the RFP or RFQ to potential firms or individuals, all RFPs and RFQs shall be posted on
the County's website. Such posting shall be performed by the Bureau of Information
Technology and Automation upon the request of the Office of the Purchasing Agent.

(5)

Opening of RFPs and RFQs. The RFPs or RFQs shall be opened in the presence of one
or more witnesses after the designated date for submission. A list of firms or individuals
offering proposals or responding to RFQs shall be submitted to the Purchasing Agent
within 24 hours of RFP or RFQ opening. The contents of the RFP or RFQ shall not be
disclosed to competing offerors during the process of negotiation. Any proposer that
cancels, withdraws or modifies its proposal after the proposal due date without County
approval may result in the proposer being deemed unqualified and may prohibit said
proposer from receiving a County contract for a period of one year. A record of proposals
shall be prepared and shall be open for public inspection after contract award.

(6)

Evaluation. The Using Department or Elected Official shall identify the factors to be
used in evaluating proposals, which information shall be set forth in the RFP. These
factors include, but are not limited to, price, experience and qualifications of the
proposer, the quality and cost effectiveness of the proposal, and the demonstrated
willingness and ability of the proposer to satisfy the requirements of the County as
described in the request. The Using Department or Elected Official shall evaluate
proposals and shall conduct any negotiations of a possible contract with one or more
proposers.

2737

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 16, 2009

Discussions. As provided in the RFP or RFQ, discussions may be conducted with
responsible proposers who submit proposals determined to have the greatest likelihood of
being selected for a contract for the purpose of clarifying and assuring full understanding
of and responsiveness to the County's requirements. Those proposers shall be accorded
fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of
proposals. Revisions to proposals may be permitted after submission for the purpose of
obtaining best and final proposals before a recommendation is made to the Board of
Commissioners. In conducting discussions there shall be no disclosure of any confidential
information derived from proposals submitted by competing proposers. If information is
disclosed to any proposer, it shall be provided to all competing proposers. Once a
proposer has been recommended to and approved by the Board of Commissioners, the
Using Department or Elected Official shall finalize the contract terms for the Board's
execution consideration.

(8)

Recommendations. The Using Department or Elected Official shall recommend to the
Board of Commissioners that the County enter into a contract with the responsible
proposer whose proposal or qualifications is determined in writing by such Using
Department or Elected Official to be the most advantageous to the County, taking into
consideration price, qualifications and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for
proposals. The Using Department or Elected Official shall document the results of its
evaluation and the reasons for its recommendation to the Purchasing Agent. The Using
Department or Elected Official shall be responsible for requesting that the Board of
Commissioners authorize a contract with the recommended proposer, provided that no
Using Department or Elected Official shall make such a recommendation without
stipulating the known services of a registered lobbyist, including but not limited to any
lobbyist listed in the RFP. The recommendation shall include the name of the individual
lobbyist and the name of the lobbying firm. The authorization of the Board of

shall be subject to the proposed contractor's compliance with all applicable laws and
County procedures and to the Purchasing Agent's review of the subject contract.

government unit or agency thereof such surplus materials, supplies, commodities, or equipment as may be
made available through the operation of any legislation heretofore or hereinafter enacted and to enter into
cooperative educational agreements with not-for-profit universities and hospitals without conforming to
the competitive bidding requirements of this article. Regular employment contracts in the County service,
whether with respect to the classified services or otherwise, shall not be subject to the provisions of this
article, nor shall this article be applicable to the granting or issuance pursuant to powers conferred by
laws, ordinances, or resolutions or license, permits, or other authorization by the County Board, or by
departments, offices, institutions, boards, commissions, agencies or other instrumentalities of the County,
nor to contracts or transactions, other than the sale or lease of personal property pursuant to which the
County is the recipient of money.

those within the 100 Series, as listed in the Chart of Accounts; and
WHEREAS, consistent with the spirit and intent of the powers and authority granted to the System Board

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 16, 2009

ordinance.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 16, 2009
Chairman Silvestri stated that Vice Chairman Murphy’s amendment removes the word, “residential” from
the amendment.
Vice Chairman Murphy asked if it could be changed to “acreage”, and if you had a certain amount of
acreage if it would be allowed.
Donald Wlodarski, Commissioner, Department of Building and Zoning replied the County Board can
make changes to this amendment. The only problem the Department of Building and Zoning would have
with enforcing lot sizes is when inspectors go out to the site it would be hard for them to determine
exactly the lot size so it would be an enforcement concern to the department.
Chairman Silvestri stated that the amendment should not usurp the authority of the townships in Cook
County. The townships are more familiar with the residential districts. So, it is appropriate for the
amendment to allow the township boards the authority to approve or disapprove the parking of
commercial vehicles in residential districts.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:

Tuesday, September 15, 2009 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building,
118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report, the recommendation
is as follows:
302414

COOK COUNTY HEALTH & HOSPITALS SYSTEM FISCAL YEAR 2010
PRELIMINARY BUDGET. Transmitting a Communication from Warren L. Batts,
Chairman and William T. Foley, Chief Executive Officer:
Please accept the Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board's budget recommendation
for the Cook County Health & Hospitals System for the Fiscal Year 2010. The budget
recommendation was approved by the System Board on August 26, 2009. The public
hearings shall be conducted by the Finance Committee of the Cook County Health &
Hospitals System Board. The System will hold public hearings on its Preliminary Budget at
times and locations to be announced.
* Referred to the Committee on Finance on 09/01/09.

Chairman Daley called on Warren L. Batts, Chairman of the Cook County Health & Hospitals System
Board, to present their Preliminary Budget.
Mr. Batts stated that the Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board will present their annual report
to the Cook County Board of Commissioners at the September 16, 2009 Board meeting. In addition, they
are working on a strategic plan with a target date for completion in November 2009.

2836

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 16, 2009
Mr. Batts then introduced Mr. William T. Foley, Chief Executive Officer of the Cook County Health &
Hospitals System.
Mr. Foley gave a presentation summarizing the 2009 accomplishments and 2010 goals of the Cook
County Health & Hospitals System. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County
Clerk).
Commissioner Schneider asked if the System Board has a position regarding a new union agreement of
physicians at Stroger Hospital of Cook County.
Mr. Foley responded that there are mixed feelings, but as Chief Executive Officer his recommendation to
the System Board was to recognize the physicians union at Stroger Hospital of Cook County. The
System Board is already dealing with a physicians union at other locations. Mr. Foley further stated that
the System Board needs to have both the physicians and their union as our partners to effectively
implement change. He doesn’t feel that this is the time to be fighting with the unions, and the System
Board agreed.
Commissioner Beavers inquired as to the types of services that are being expanded at Provident Hospital
of Cook County.
Mr. Foley responded that service expansions are under consideration as part of the strategic planning
process. The System Board has been in discussion with the University of Chicago about possible
partnership opportunities.
Commissioner Beavers stated that he would like to see Provident Hospital of Cook County gain
designation as a trauma center.
Mr. Batts stated that trauma center designation is under the jurisdiction of the State of Illinois.
Commissioner Murphy inquired about making Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County a trauma center.
Mr. Foley responded that the cost of building a new trauma center would be a huge expense.
David Carvalho, Finance Chairman of the Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board, stated that he
intends to convene a meeting for System Board members to be briefed on the procedure for attaining
designation as a trauma center. The time and date of this meeting has not been determined, but the Board
of Commissioners will be notified and invited to attend when the date has been set.
Chairman Daley inquired about the current rejection rate for reimbursement claims from Medicare.
Pitt Calkin, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board, said that he
would provide an answer to Chairman Daley’s question. He estimates that the rejection rate is lower
today than it was at this time last year, but the actual rate will be provided later.
Chairman Daley requested that Mr. Calkin’s response include an analysis of the performance of
MedAssets compared to one year ago.
Vice Chairman Sims asked how many of our employees are currently working with MedAssets?
Mr. Calkin responded that there are in excess of 200 county employees working with MedAssets.

2837

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 16, 2009
Chairman Daley asked for the number of employees in the coding section who have been terminated for
failure to meet minimum performance standards.
Mr. Calkin indicated there has been zero performance-based terminations since May 2008.
Chairman Daley asked if there are benchmarks for performance established by MedAssets.
Mr. Calkin responded performance analysis is ongoing. Currently, 60% of the medical records are coded
incorrectly.
Chairman Daley responded that this figure was unacceptably high.
Mr. Calkin agreed, and expressed his hope that the System Board will be able to work with the unions to
improve performance.
Mr. Foley stated that employees need support if they are to improve. MedAssets is also charged with
retraining staff and assisting them in reducing error rates.
Commissioner Gainer asked if there is a plan to reactivate the mammography van.
Mr. Foley stated the mammography van is under consideration as part of the strategic plan.
Commissioner Peraica asked for an explanation regarding apparent spending increases in various
budgetary lines.
Mr. Calkin clarified that an accurate comparison requires examining the prior year’s appropriation,
compared to the request for next year.
Chairman Daley explained that, once approved, the Preliminary Budget will be incorporated in the
President’s Executive Budget Recommendation for Fiscal Year 2010. After the President submits his
budget recommendations to the Board, the budget for the Health & Hospitals System will be subject to
amendment, just as any other section of the proposed 2010 budget.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Collins, moved approval of the Fiscal Year
2010 Preliminary Budget for the Cook County Health & Hospitals System (Communication No.
302414). Commissioner Peraica called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays being as follows:

Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on Wednesday, September 9, 2009 at the hour of

302413

RESOLUTION REQUESTING REVIEW OF THE PRESIDENT’S OFFICE OF
EMPLOYMENT TRAINING (P.O.E.T.) (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a
Proposed Resolution sponsored by Peter N. Silvestri, John P. Daley and Earlean Collins,
County Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the President’s Office of Employment Training (POET) was established to
offer job training services and programs to assist residents in the search for employment and
to help them enhance existing job skills; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity is freezing
$2.35 million in grant money for POET after a probe raised questions about spending and
accounting practices at the office; and
WHEREAS, the state is also demanding that POET return $1.8 million in unspent grant
money dating back to 2007; and
WHEREAS, the state is cutting off the county’s direct access to grant money for POET’s
summer job program for youth, directing administrators to go through a rigorous
reimbursement program through the state; and
WHEREAS, POET’s former financial manager was sentenced to four years in prison earlier
this year after pleading guilty to stealing more than $100,000 from the program; and
WHEREAS, in 2008, three former POET employees were charged with conspiring with two
ministers to siphon more than $2 million from banks and taxpayers for sham training,
according to prosecutors; and
WHEREAS, state officials say they are not trying to shut the doors on POET but would like
to push it toward more responsible management.

2886

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 16, 2009
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners promptly hold a meeting of the appropriate committee to review the program
and the allegations against it so that it can be run as intended.
*Referred to the Committee on Workforce, Job Development Training & Opportunities
on 09-01-09.
302435

RESOLUTION TO EVALUATE AND DISCUSS THE PRESIDENT’S OFFICE OF
EMPLOYMENT TRAINING (P.O.E.T.) (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a
Proposed Resolution sponsored by Earlean Collins, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII,
Section 6 (a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and
perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, on August 14, 2009 the President’s Office of Employment Training
(“P.O.E.T.”) received written communication from the Department of Commerce and
Economic Opportunity (“DCEO”) that access to cash for Grant 08-762007 had been
suspended; and
WHEREAS, while DCEO acknowledges that P.O.E.T. continues to make progress in some
areas of program management and administration, they note that P.O.E.T. needs to be more
aggressive in four major areas: (1) Service Providers; (2) Program Monitoring; (3) Financial
Management; and (4) Reorganization of the Labor Workforce Investment Board (“LWIB”)
and County Board oversight; and
WHEREAS, P.O.E.T. is a vital part of Cook County’s ability to provide necessary job
training and placement services to residents of south and west suburban Cook County and
therefore it is imperative that P.O.E.T. come into compliance with both Federal and State
guidelines to ensure continuous funding.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that this Board conduct a public hearing on
September 9, 2009 to discuss and evaluate P.O.E.T.’s compliance with State and Federal
guidelines.
*Referred to the Committee on Workforce, Job Development Training & Opportunities
on 09-01-09.

Commissioner Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Schneider, moved to receive and file
Communication Nos. 302413, as amended and 302435. The motion carried unanimously.
Chairman Collins stated the purpose of the meeting was to ascertain a better understanding of the federal,
state and local policies as they pertain to Congress’ intended goals for workforce development programs.
It has been alleged that the President’s Office of Employment Training (P.O.E.T.) in Cook County was
not in compliance with the state’s monitoring requirements. The role of the State of Illinois is to monitor
the P.O.E.T. supportive service program, determine appropriate services areas and provide
recommendations to the P.O.E.T. program (Cook County).

2887

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 16, 2009
Chairman Collins stated that Mr. Warren Ripley (Director, Illinois Department of Commerce and
Economic Opportunity) and Ms. Theresa McMahon (Deputy Director, Illinois Department of Commerce
and Economic Opportunity), have been very critical of P.O.E.T. services, and were invited to speak at the
committee meeting and provide an update on the federal stimulus package as it relates to workforce
development programs. P.O.E.T. had anticipated there would be difficulties with receiving the proper
paperwork to implement the youth jobs program for summer employment. Chairman Collins predicted
there would be problems in Illinois and the nation due to the federal government’s allotted time frame. In
spite of the limitations, P.O.E.T. hired youth for 2009 summer jobs.
Mr. Albert Pritchett, Workforce Investment Board, Oversight member, stated that the role of P.O.E.T. is
training and employment of its participants. The agency’s responsibility is not to keep agencies in
business that are not performing. One problem that P.O.E.T. experiences is the south and west suburbs
have limited job opportunities. P.O.E.T. needs commitments from businesses, at a minimum, to assist the
agency to improve the employment and training programs.
Mr. Charles Jenrich, Chairman of the Cook County Workforce Investment Board, stated his belief that
P.O.E.T.’s Workforce Board (CCWIB), has been falsely regarded as a rubber stamp board by the State of
Illinois. Since Karen S. Crawford has joined P.O.E.T., she has been subject to more oversight. Mr.
Jenrich stated he was the Dean at Prairie State College and there were comments regarding the position
being a conflict of interest, so he retired. P.O.E.T. has continued to provide the type of services that have
gotten P.O.E.T. commendations and incentives along the way. The board has successfully administered
its responsibilities. The Workforce Investment Board should be allowed to continue functioning in the
manner that was intended in the Workforce Investment Act. It is his sincere effort to run the board in a
professional manner and to resolve any issues that are proposed by the State of Illinois.
Karen S. Crawford, Director of P.O.E.T., stated the program provides significant services for individuals
located in the south and west suburban Cook County. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office
of the County Clerk.)
Chairman Collins inquired about the number of jobs that were available for the summer program.
Ms. Crawford responded that system-wide over 4,624 applications were received and 1,200 positions
were filled.
Chairman Collins stated Cook County does not receive the grant verification documents that are needed
to forward them to the Comptroller’s Office; so the Comptroller cannot process any financial claims.
Therefore, that lag time delays the financial process. The program starts July 1st but Cook County does
not start the program and approve it until September – sometimes October, because the State does not
send necessary documentation to the County for inclusion on the Board agenda. The stimulus grant was
awarded in February 2009. However, the County started the program after the State released the grant
documents in May. So, if you think about 4000 applicants, these individuals still need to be processed to
get the job and they still have to be notified that they have gotten jobs. Further the State’s direction was
not to use stimulus funding for staff and infrastructure so P.O.E.T. had limited means to deal with that
kind of volume.
In addition, the formula grant is a two year program where the federal government stipulated that 80% of
the funding should be spent in the first year of the program. If the funding was not spent, the State would
lose the funding and the federal government would send it to another state. So with that kind of pressure,
the program is doomed for failure.

2888

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 16, 2009
Commissioner Sims inquired about the letters received from the State of Illinois regarding the four
benchmarks and the hiring of personnel.
Ms. Crawford responded the State of Illinois has alleged that P.O.E.T. does not have an adequate number
of qualified staff to manage the financial function. The State of Illinois recommended the agency hire a
certified public accountant as financial director, a fiscal manager, a comptroller and up to 4 qualified
accountants or bookkeepers. The reality is all those positions are filled and are functioning. The State of
Illinois assessment of their qualifications seems to be the issue. Ms. Crawford stated that P.O.E.T. has a
seventeen year P.O.E.T. veteran as the fiscal director with federal funding expertise, a fiscal manager that
is a twenty-four year veteran at P.O.E.T. and four bookkeeper positions. The letter refers to an indictment
or the State of Illinois assessment of staff’s qualification versus positions not existing or functioning.
Those positions do in fact function in P.O.E.T.
Commissioner Gorman inquired about the certification of the staff.
Ms. Crawford responded the fiscal director possesses a degree in computer technology which is
significant to P.O.E.T. There is an accountant who is a college graduate. One bookkeeper came to
P.O.E.T with experience from one of P.O.E.T.’s service provider agencies and the other bookkeeper is a
graduate of University of Chicago with a master’s degree in economics. Finally, the last bookkeeper is an
experienced P.O.E.T. employee. Further, P.O.E.T. has two CPA’s on staff.
Commissioner Daley inquired on the number of meetings the Workforce Investment Board schedules.
Mr. Jenrich responded the Workforce Investment Board meets nine times a year as a full board.
Commissioner Daley stated that the Cook County Workforce Investment Board (CCWIB) meets more
often than the State Board and that the last time the State was in trouble with the United States
Department of Labor (USDOL) they seemed to focus unfairly on Cook County. This appears personal
and the President should probably reach out to the Governor on the issue of P.O.E.T.
Commissioners Beavers inquired as to the payment of the summer jobs for the youth.
Ms. Crawford replied the majority of the youth came to the orientation without all the required
documentation for payroll processing. All the young people received their paychecks.
Commissioner Gainer inquired to the validity of the State of Illinois’ comments.
Ms. Crawford replied there are four benchmarks remaining of the original ten given to complete. The
letter dated July 29 affords P.O.E.T. ninety days before the local area is reorganized by the Governor. It
is P.O.E.T.’s intention to meet all remaining benchmarks within the ninety day period, however the State
will assess if they have been completed to their satisfaction. Also, in the letter there is a requirement that
all invoices be submitted in the beginning of August and using software provided by the State of Illinois;
yet it is September 9th and the software has not been received.
Chairman Collins, Vice Chairman Schneider, Commissioners Daley and Gorman voiced their
disappointment in the State of Illinois not appearing today.
Chairman Collins asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers, in
accordance with Cook County Code, Sec. 2-108(dd):

OFFICE OF THE COUNTY ASSESSOR
CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication from
JAMES M. HOULIHAN, Cook County Assessor
by
JOHN M. FALLON, Special Assistant to the Assessor
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Cook County Suburban
Publisher, Chicago, Illinois, for the state mandated publication of the 2009 real estate non-triennial
assessment of South and North townships in Cook County, outside the City of Chicago. Also the Illinois
Property Tax Code requires that the Cook County Assessor provide certain notices through publication,
including publishing all "change action" on permanent index numbers.
Reason:

Cook County Suburban Publishers is and has been the sole-source vendor for the publication
of Cook County's suburban townships since 2002. The state statutes have strict requirements
on the content of the publication and newspaper's qualifications. (See 35ILCS 200/12-20 and
715 ILCS 10/2 et seq.). Cook County Suburban Publishers is the only vendor that meets
those requirements for Cook County's Suburban Townships.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $300,000.00. Contract period: September 16, 2009 through May 31, 2010.
(040-240 Account). Requisition No. 90400035.

by

requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $333,776.00 and extend from December
1, 2009 through April 30, 2011, Contract No. 07-45-443 with Lake County Press, Inc., Waukegan,

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 26, 2009 from
DAVID ORR, Cook County Clerk
by
CLEM BALANOFF, Deputy Clerk
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $996,700.00 from Account
524-240 Printing and Publishing to Account 524-260, Professional and Managerial Services for Election
Judge Management System (EJMS).

2905

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 16, 2009
Reason:

An RFP was issued on April 21, 2009 for an Election Judge Management System for the
County Clerk’s Election Department. After oral presentations, proof-of-concept sessions and
negotiations with four different respondents, the Clerk’s Evaluation Committee has
recommended Catalyst Consulting Group, Inc. for this contract and is requesting
authorization to proceed on the September 16, 2009 Board Agenda. Since there is a surplus
in the 524-240 Printing and Publishing account, the Clerk is requesting to transfer funds to
the 524-260 Professional and Managerial Services account in order to encumber the FY09
surplus funds for the entire contract.

From Account 524-240

Total

$996,700.00

To Account 524-260

Total

$996,700.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent in mid-August that RFP evaluations and funding availability would allow this
project to proceed in FY 2009. This will allow for lead time needed to have the system in place for
testing during the February 2010 primary. The unencumbered balance in the account on August 17,
2009 was $1,918,440, unchanged from the balance as of July 13, 2009.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The surplus funds in the 524-240 printing account are due to anticipated re-use of previously
printed election materials. Due to the recent completion of the post-election cleanout of the Voting
Supply Carriers (VSCs) the Election Department now has an updated inventory of re-usable printed
materials.
Additionally, as customers become more and more reliant on internet access to information,
printing requirements have been reduced as the Clerk’s office increasingly uses email to
communicate with its 12,000 election judges and others.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 524-240.
There are no other obligations for printing that will be deferred, delayed or cancelled as a result of
this transfer.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The 2009 account is funded to meet the printing requirements of the February 2010 gubernatorial
primary. Some printed materials have been updated in 2009 to provide for re-use. These materials
and other unused printed election materials from the two previous elections in 2009 exceed
expectations and will be re-used for the February 2010 election.

2906

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 16, 2009
In addition, though internet access to election information has reduced printing costs, the data is
too new to quantify and therefore, the budget is based on both historical data and contingencies
for emergency printings or extra elections.
_________________________
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved that the transfer of funds be approved.
The motion carried unanimously.

Proceedings, page 2904.

requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to renew Contract No. 08-41-357 with L-3
Communications and Security Detection Systems, Inc., Woburn, Massachusetts, for maintenance and
repair of x-ray security machines. (See related Item #60).
Reason:

L-3 Communications and Security Detection Systems, Inc. is sole source for maintenance and
repairs of the Linescan and PX series security x-ray screening system. This company
currently holds the Patent Number for the Linescan System. As the original equipment
designer and manufacturer, L-3 Communications is the only source of maintenance and

$17,600.00; and FY 2010: $193,600.00 - (230-449 Account)]. Contract period: October 30, 2009

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 16, 2009
TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 25, 2009 from
THOMAS J. DART, Sheriff of Cook County
by
ALEXIS HERRERA, Chief Financial Officer, Cook County Sheriff’s Office
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $63,600.00 from the
Department of Fiscal Administration and Support Services Account 211-449, Operation, Maintenance
and Repair Not Otherwise Classified to the Court Services Division Account 230-449, Operation,
Maintenance and Repair Not Otherwise Classified. (See related Item #59).
Reason:

The Court Services Division anticipated and budgeted an amount of $190,000.00 for fiscal
year 2009 which was for the maintenance contract and registration fee for courtroom x-ray
security machines. The actual cost of the maintenance contract for the x-ray security
machines came back higher than the anticipated budgeted amount.

From Account 211-449

Total

$63,600.00

To Account 230-449

Total

$63,600.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent that Account 230-449 would require additional funds on July 7, 2009, when the
purchase order was issued. The balance on this date was $163,411.00 and thirty days prior was also
$163,411.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 211-449 was identified as the source of transferred funds because of an unanticipated
surplus in this account. No other accounts were considered.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 211-449.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
This account has a surplus due to the budget preparation in the fall of 2008, we did not have a firm
amount for the new Motorola maintenance contract. We anticipated the amount of the contract to
be $2,100,000.00 per year, but the actual cost was $1,651,000.00. This has resulted in a surplus for
this account.

CONTRACT ADDENDUM
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 16, 2009 from
THOMAS J. DART, Sheriff of Cook County
by
KEVIN MCGUIRE, Director of Vehicle Services
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $35,000.00, Contract No. 08-84-2155
with Tryad Automotive, Oak Park, Illinois, for the purchase automotive parts.
Open Market Purchase amount 03-11-09:
Increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$ 79,899.70
35,000.00
$114,899.70

The requested increase of funds would allow Vehicle Services to continue purchasing
automotive parts from this vendor that are used for “in house” repairs of Sheriff's
Office vehicles. The aging condition of the Sheriff's Office fleet has caused a significant
increase in repairs. By buying vehicle parts "wholesale" from Tryad Automotive and doing
many repairs at our facility, the Sheriff's Office is saving Cook County a significant amount
of money. The expiration date of the current contract is March 10, 2010.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $35,000.00 (211-444 Account).
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.

Number 08-23-101-034-0000; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has defined abandoned property as buildings and other structures that, after
having been vacant and unused for at least 24 months, are purchased for value by a purchaser in whom
the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has defined an exception to this abandoned property definition shall be, if the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, finds that special circumstances justify finding that the
property is abandoned for purpose of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, in this case the property has been abandoned for more than 24 months there has
been purchase for value, and being that the property is in unincorporated Cook County, it has been
determined that special circumstances exist; and
WHEREAS, Class 6b requires a resolution by the County Board validating the property is deemed
abandoned for the purposes of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that the building was abandoned
for 25 months at the time of application, and that special circumstances are present. The property is
currently (08/09) fully operational and under lease contract; and

unincorporated Cook County, and reviewed by the Department of Planning and Development who has
verified that Mackey Building Corporation has not been able to lease this facility for over 2 years at the
time of application. Mackey Building Corporation has recently entered into a lease contract with Proteco
Fire Safety by reducing the rent to be competitive in the market place and secure a tenant, and in order for
this to be a successful endeavor the Class 6b is necessary for development to occur; and
