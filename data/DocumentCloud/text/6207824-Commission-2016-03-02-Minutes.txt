Quorum & Meeting Minutes
With only two commissioners present, a quorum was determined not to exist; therefore,
the December minutes were not able to be approved nor were any motions made.
Administration
There is one vacancy on the SSA Commission; persons interested in applying for the
mayoral appointment should contact the chamber of commerce.
The county ethics statement is due May 1. The city’s statement of financial interest is
due May 31.
Finances
Three year-to-date financial statements were presented: Balance Sheet, Actual vs.
Budget Profit & Loss, and Previous Year Comparison Profit & Loss.
Other/New Business
Aldermen Reboyras, Villegas and Santiago met with Ms. Kotak of DPD to discuss the
impact of the Belmont-Central TIF on the Belmont-Central SSA. Mark explained that
28% of the SSA tax is diverted to the Belmont-Central TIF so the operation of the
Belmont-Central Parking Facility and its ancillary services receive none of that money.
Mark also mentioned that the new DPD Commissioner, David Reifman, understands the
situation and is looking into reforming the TIF law.
Alderman Reboyras asked Mark what would be the consequences of dissolving the
Belmont Central SSA. Mark responded that something would need to be decided
regarding the parking facility such as placing the garage up for sale. In any event, the
SSA commissioners would need to support any such action.
Next Meeting
The next scheduled meeting is April 20 to approve the 2015 audit.
