We, Store Capital Acquisitions, LLC, submit this petition to request a change in right of way along

Currently, the building located at 15 400 Woodrow Wilson encroaches on Midland Street over an

We seek to maintain the encroachment over the right of way because the building was constructed
in this manner decades before our recent acquisition of the property.

We respectfully request that the item be added to the appropriate City Council Standing Committee
agenda as a line item for discussion and subsequent approval pending satisfaction of your
Honorable Body?s deliberation. Thank you for your time.

RE: TRANSFER STATION WASTE TO ENERGY PLANT

After receiving several inquiries from members of the Detroit Green Task Force and
community residents, my of?ce is requesting information from the administration on the
future of solid waste disposal in the City of Detroit, as a result of Detroit Renewable
Energy (DRE) stopping the incineration of trash within the waste to energy plant (WEP).
Even though incineration operations have stopped DRE continues to be obligated to
dispose of Detroit?s solid waste until 2021. This has prompted the City to explore other
options for the location of a backup transfer station, including the Krainz Woods area of
Detroit. My of?ce and community members have expressed concern because the quality
of life, and the health, safety and welfare of residents on Detroit?s eastside is at risk.
Therefore, the following questions must be answered:

1. What is Detroit?s plan for solid waste if DRE breeches its contract and stops
accepting Detroit?s solid waste prior to the expiration of its obligation?

2. Has the City identi?ed alternative locations for solid waste transfer stations on the
eastside besides 4500 E. Nevada?

3. The City held a public hearing in July 2019 for a modi?cation to the existing
conditional land use at Republic Waste?s 4500 E. Nevada facility to accommodate
the ?potential? need for a transfer station to accept household solid waste. How

was this location identi?ed and what type of community outreach was conducted
by the City of Detroit or Republic Services to alert residents to this potentially
new noxious use in their neighborhood?

What other locations, that are not located across the street from a densely
populated public housing development and a stable neighborhood, have been
identi?ed as other potential transfer station sites?

Has the City given any thought to locating an eastside transfer station in the
industrial areas of:

a. The M4 District at Sherwood and Mt. Elliot
b. The M4 District at the southwest comer of State Fair and John R.

What role does The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and
Energy (EGLE) play in the licensing/permitting of new transfer stations?

Is a Host Community Agreement (HCA), similar to the successfully negotiated
HCA with US. Ecology, required for the proposed transfer station at 4500 E.
Nevada?

How does the proposed transfer station impact the Wayne County Solid Waste
Plan?

Is the DRE transfer station operating under a current permit, or does a new permit
have to be acquired to continue transfer station operations?

Can the DRE negotiate a Consent Judgement with EGLE to continue operations
and meet its obligation to the City of Detroit, thereby, negating the need for a
transfer station at the Republic Services site?

If a new permit is required will it limit solid waste that is accepted at the transfer
station to Detroit Solid Waste only?

Is a Host Community Agreement required for the new transfer station permit or
Consent Judgement at

RE: Livernois Avenue of Fashion Parking Working Group

The current road construction in the Livernois Avenue of Fashion district has exacerbated an
existing parking problem. The challenges that business owners are facing related to the disruptions
caused by the City of Detroit?s street modifications, has made a bad parking situation in the area
exponentially worse.

In order to work out both short term parking solutions, during the construction period and
beyond, and ensure the long term health of the Avenue in all aspects, I'm recommending that a
joint administrative and legislative working group be initiated. Therefore, I?m respectfully
requesting the participation of the following departments and agencies in the working group, the
Municipal Parking Department, HRD, the Planning Department, the Law Department, DPW, OCFO,
the Legislative Policy Division, and DEGC as well as that of my Council colleagues. My sincere belief
is that together we might find a way to increase parking capacity in this business district in a
manner that is economically feasible and commercially practicable.

Thank you,

RE: Emergency Key Box Systems (Knox Box)

 

This communication is to request that LPD explore feasibility and ordinance options for
requiring emergency key box systems for senior buildings and other multifamily gated
communities.

Such a system is designed to protect the health, safety, and welfare of Detroit citizens by
requiring buildings to install key box emergency access systems for entry into the
building during emergency calls.

Please see attached sample ordinance for the City of Milton, GA.
Should you have any additional questions, please contact my of?ce.

Knox Box Ordinance

In order to ensure accessibility to commercial and some gated
residential properties, the City of Milton has passed a ?Knox Box
Ordinance" as part of its public safety legislation.

This ordinance requires commercial buildings to have what is
known as a "Knox Box" as a standard feature on their premises.
The Knox Box is a secure means for the Fire?Rescue Department

to gain access to the building in an emergency.

This ordinance requires the businesses or multifamily/gated
communities to keep the keys for all exterior doors current, and
to post the box in a location that is easily accessible by fire
department personnel not somewhere we need the
ladder truck to access.) In turn, the Milton Fire?Rescue
Department and our automatic aid partner, Alpharetta Fire
and Emergency Services, has very strictly controlled keys that

will give them access to the box in the event of an emergency.

Both in the interest of public safety and legal compliance, we
ask that all business owners and property managers please
review the ordinance and keep their keys current. Fire crews
will include a check of the keys in the Knox Box as part of the

annual inspection of business in Milton.

Fire Marshal Alex Fortner coordinates the Knox Box program for
the City of Milton. You can contact him through e-mail or the
Fire Marshal's Office at 678.242.2541 with any questions
regarding the purpose and administration of the Knox Box
System. However, your contractor should be quite familiar with
the process as this is common requirement in metropolitan

communities.
