Discussion

when previously Commission simply suggested options

communities
➢ Commissioner Peck

mandate

o

Letter to IPA is in response to the draft Long-Term Renewable Resources
Plan
IPA wants specific feedback at this point, not guide of options
If cannot agree, the Commission can be silent

➢ Alec Davis
o IPA used the Commission’s recommendations as a basis
o IPA’s definition is different than IEPA’s definition
o Definition not being adopted state-wide for all agencies and programs
➢ Commissioner Harley
o The draft letter is not saying or implying that using as a policy state-wide
➢ Commissioner Peck
o The wording on Page 2 of the letter is too strong

Enviro Screen

week
➢ Commissioner Peck

Community”

 o

Draft plan says that protections are needed because of problems with the
ARES program

o Should be a better way to approach the issue
➢ Commissioner Harley

consumer protections

out

then no, EJ Commission should not weigh in
o This is energy and should have environmental benefits
➢ Commissioner Peck
o The Commission would be picking a fight
➢ Commissioner Harley
o Who would we be picking a fight with?
o Looking at charge in legislation, the EJ Commission is to review state law and
policies related to EJ
