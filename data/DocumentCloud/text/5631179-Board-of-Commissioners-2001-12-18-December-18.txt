In October 2001, the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) notified the

total amount of $499,756. This grant will be used to assist 16-24 year old high school dropouts in
completing their high school education, developing leadership skills, obtaining on-site construction
training and opportunities for placement in union apprenticeship programs and employment in
living wage jobs. Recruitment for participants will occur at the Hilliard and Ickes Homes. The
resolution for Item A1 approves acceptance of the Youthbuild Grant and authorizes the Chief
Executive Officer to enter into sub-grant agreements with the following partners identified in the
application for this grant: Chicago Area Project, Dawson Technical Institute and Holsten Real
Estate Development Corporation.
RESOLUTION NO. 2001-CHA-180
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated November 26, 2001 entitled, “Authorization to accept a grant

THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designated representative to (1) accept an award of a grant from and execute a
grant agreement with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
for the amount of $499,756 for a Youthbuild Implementation Grant; and (2)
authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to enter into three three year
sub-grant agreements with the partners identified in the application for this grant

for Item A2 therefore approves the exercise of the second one-year option for each of the five
current Resident Relocation Services contracts. The exercise of the option period will allow the

Second one (1) year option period of the five (5) Resident Relocation Contracts for

to HUD approval.

purpose of the coordinated service program is to improve the quality of life and assist elderly
persons and persons with disabilities to live independently and/or to prevent premature or

The resolution for Item A6 approves an Intergovernmental Agreement with the Chicago
Department of Human Services for linking CHA residents to citywide services for FY2002. This
Agreement is necessary to continue with the CHA's Plan for Transformation to outsource services
previously performed by CHA staff. The CHA has chosen to focus on asset management rather
than the administration of social services. The CHA's goal is to mainstream and integrate public
housing residents into the citywide services network, which is administered by CDHS, including
private and public sectors, state and federally funded service providers. This IGA will enable
CHA residents to receive the same services that are available to all residents of the City of
Chicago.

open space, quality landscaping and on-site parking. The Consent Decree mandates that the

total units. The Plan provides for a total of 764 new units on site. Of this on-site total, 465 units

replacement units, 132 affordable units and 361 market rate units. These units will be constructed
