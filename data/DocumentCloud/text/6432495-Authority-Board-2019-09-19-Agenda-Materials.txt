Re:

Executive Staff Update

Fiscal Update
Office of Fiscal Management Staffing and Operations
ICJIA Acting CFO and Deputy Director, Angie Weis, resigned effective September 6, 2019. ICJIA
is grateful for her many contributions to ICJIA during her tenure and wish her all the best in her
new role within the City of Chicago’s Office of the Mayor. ICJIA is actively recruiting a
replacement and hopes to have an announcement very soon.
ICJIA submitted its Indirect Cost Rate (ICR) proposal on March 29, 2019. The proposal and
supporting documentation were submitted through Maximus which is the state contracted entity to
handle such negotiations with the federal government. Maximus has received no communication
from the Department of Justice since early July regarding our proposal. Once approved, the rate
calculated using a salary and fringe benefit base will be applied to federal funds for federal fiscal
year 2020.
ICJIA staff continue to work through issues arising from the mid-year conversion to SAP. As the
only agency that converted mid-year that administers any grants from outside sources, we are
essentially serving as a pilot site identifying issues related to our use of the system that were not
identified prior to the conversion. Available training and support thus far has been minimal.
Audits
As discussed in the June 27, 2019 Board Meeting, two audits were initiated for which ICJIA staff
have dedicated a significant amount of time responding to document requests. Staff have also been
made available for interviews and follow-up as needed and as determined to be necessary by the
auditors.
The state compliance audit began June 3, 2019. The audit is being performed by private
accountants on behalf of the Illinois Auditor General for Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019. The auditors
are on-site and staff continues to provide them with requested information and documentation.

 Fieldwork for the audit began on July 1, 2019 and is scheduled to be completed by November 15,
2019.
Regarding the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General audit of the state’s FY15,
FY16, FY17, FY18 Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) program, staff have provided grant master
files, applications from grantees and have sat for interviews. To date ICJIA staff have met requests
and will continue to assist. Audit activities were initiated in June and will take nine to twelve
months to complete.
Office of General Counsel Update
JAG 2018 Litigation Update
Due to pending ‘sanctuary city’ federal litigation, ICJIA currently cannot accept its 2018 Justice
Assistant Grant (JAG) award. Under this award, ICJIA would receive approximately $6.5M in
federal funds to continue funding a wide range of law enforcement-related programs. The State is
seeking an injunction to bar the Department of Justice (DOJ) from imposing immigration-related
conditions on this funding which require certifications of compliance from both the Governor and
the Illinois Attorney General.
The Illinois Attorney General’s complaint and arguments mirror those of the City of Chicago,
which also receives annual JAG funding, and are before District Court Judge Lienenweber. Judge
Lienenweber ruled against the DOJ last year on similar conditions imposed on the 2017 JAG
award. A ruling on the DOJ’s motion to dismiss the City’s complaint was set for August 22nd, but
was postponed. We expect the ruling in the near future and hope that a favorable ruling in the
Chicago case will lead the DOJ to remove the conditions as it did last year for the 2017 JAG
Award.
2019 Ethics and Sexual Harassment Prevention Training
As a reminder to Board members, you are now required to complete both an Ethics and a Sexual
Harassment Prevention training annually under the Ethics Act. As the Board’s Ethics Officer, I
will send out both 2019 trainings to you via e-mail later this Fall. We will need signed
certifications for both trainings. You can deliver to me – via e-mail, US mail, or in person – your
signed certifications.
Grants Update
The Federal and State Grants Unit continues to program the new state funds in addition to those
funds that require new competitive solicitations. Table 1 provides a revised Notice of Funding
Opportunity schedule.

 At the June 27, 2019 ICJIA Board meeting, the Board approved the Illinois Edward Byrne
Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Strategic Plan 2019-2024. The plan outlines five goals
that will guide the use of JAG funds for the next five years.
At the same meeting, the Board requested to review an implementation plan that will describe how
JAG funds will be programmed to achieve the five goals listed in the plan. Staff is currently
developing an implementation plan recommendation and will present it to the Budget Committee
at its October 17, 2019 meeting. The Budget Committee’s recommendations will then be presented
to the Board at its December 19, 2019 meeting for consideration.
Research Update
Funding
R&A unit was awarded a number of research grants.
• State funding for a new R&A research center, the Center for Violence Prevention and
Intervention Research. The funds, which will be derived from the Cannabis Regulation and
Tax Act, support research related to the Restore, Renew, and Reinvest (R3) program.
• Awarded $225,000 for two one-year grants from Bureau of Justice Statistics for web-based
application on arrest statistics and a study of opioid-related deaths and prior criminaljustice involvement
• Awarded $169,000 for a two-year grant through Illinois State Board of Education from the
Bureau of Justice Statistics for Students, Teachers, and Officers Preventing (STOP) School
Violence evaluation.
• Awarded $71,000 for a five-year grant through University of Chicago from National
Institutes of Health (NIH) for a multi-site randomized trial, Reducing Opioid Mortality in
Illinois (ROMI).
The Justice Research and Statistics Association invited R&A staff to conduct two national
webinars. See http://www.jrsa.org/webinars/ to register. In addition, staff presented at Illinois
Association of Chiefs of Police Conference and at the George Mason University, Center for
Evidence-Based Crime Policy Symposium.
R&A has served on the Illinois Supreme Court Commission on Pretrial Practices and this fall will
complete our work leading the performance measurement subcommittee whose recommendations
will be featured in the state’s final report.
InfoNet, the web-based, centralized statewide case management system for domestic violence
centers in Illinois, finalized an agreement with the city of Chicago who will use InfoNet the
domestic violence agencies they fund, adding at least five new user agencies.

 Chairman’s Remarks
Mr. Delfino welcomed new Board member Illinois Department of Corrections Acting Director Rob
Jeffreys and turned the meeting over to Dr. Alderden for the Executive Director’s Report.
Executive Director’s Report
Dr. Alderden stated the agency had received notification of its final 2020 budget in the first week of
June. She said the budget increased from what was initially proposed by almost by $30 million. She
said this would lead to a significant uptick in ICJIA’s workload over the next year, a need for
additional staff, and space to house them. She said executive staff are working to address the issues in
preparation for the additional funds.
Dr. Alderden next gave an update on administrative Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) and Justice
Assistance Grant (JAG) funds, used by the agency to support staff in grant administration. She said
Ms. Weis and Mr. Stevens designed a spending plan to ensure administrative fund availability through
the end of state fiscal year 2020, but noted the plan is contingent on approval of an indirect rate and
ability to finally draw down federal fiscal year 2018 JAG funds (after experiencing a delay resulting
from Chicago’s Sanctuary City status). She said ICJIA was successful in accessing FFY17 funds. Dr.
Alderden noted that if funds are not awarded by February 2020, funding would become critical.
Dr. Aderden said ICJIA implemented a 10 percent rule wherein only 10 percent of a grant award may
be used for administrative purposes. She said executive staff approval and proper documentation is
required when more than 10 percent of funds are used for administrative purposes.
Dr. Alderden said executive staff has been actively educating the Lieutenant Governor’s Office,
Governor’s Office of Management and Budget, and the legislators about the fiscal needs of the agency
and advocating for administrative funding to coincide with any additional grant programs inserted into
the ICJIA budget.
Dr. Alderden thanked executive and agency staff for an outstanding job during agency restructuring
over the last quarter and introduced the Authority Breakthrough Award. She said the award is given to
staff member(s) whose work goes above and beyond their normal duties to help the agency realize its
mission of improving the administration of criminal justice in Illinois. She named the quarter’s award
recipients, Nancy Determann, Dennis Shaw, Ieva Massengill, John Klaer and Bharat Mehta,
recognized for their help in implementing a new fiscal system data system.
Mr. Delfino thanked Dr. Alderden for her report and asked Mr. Stevens to give the Federal & State
Grants Unit report.
Justice Assistance Grant Strategic Plan Recommendations Discussion and Vote
Mr. Stevens noted Ad Hoc JAG Committee members met June 30, 2019, to develop the program’s
strategic plan and asked Ms. Salazar to summarize the process.
Ms. Salazar said the U.S. Bureau of Justice Assistance requires that the JAG Strategic Plan is designed
in consultation with local government and representative of all segments of the criminal justice system
and that committee members are representative of stakeholders in each of the eight JAG priority areas.

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Quarterly Authority Board Meeting
June 27, 2019
Page 3

 She said the Committee reviewed crime and system data in relation to the priority areas for JAG and
determined the best use of funds to reach program goals.
Mr. Stevens said the Ad Hoc JAG Committee recommended addressing a lack of transportation
experienced both by those who are justice-involved and cannot meet their court obligations and those
who have experienced harm and cannot get to needed services. The committee also recommended
targeting funds to reduce substance misuse and support statistical analysis within the criminal justice
system.
Ms. Wolff moved to approve the Illinois Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Strategic
Plan 2019-2024. Ms. Campanelli seconded and the motion passed unanimously.
Update on State Budget and ICJIA Financial Health
In a review of the ICJIA 2020 Budget, Ms. Weis noted $1.5 million in funding for ICJIA to provide
technical assistance and navigation of the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act, $835,600 for
costs associated with supporting the Recovery, Reinvest, Renew (R3) program, and a $309,800
increase for general operating costs.
She also noted staff has implemented corrective action plans related to the audit findings outlined in
the Auditor General’s report from January 29, 2019.
Executive Staff Update
Mr. Murphy gave an update from the Office of General Council and reminded members that if they
have an actual or apparent conflict of interest with an applicant recommendation for designation, they
must recuse themselves during the Budget Committee meeting from both the discussion and any
action taken. He noted that it is important to remember that Board members and staff must not
communicate information made or received as a result of ex parte communications at ICJIA Board or
Budget Committee meetings. He said a copy of the Competitive Notice of Funding Opportunity
Conflict Policy was included with meeting materials.
Mr. Stevens said the Federal and State Grants Unit was working diligently to administer the new state
funds and referred members to the table showing a funding schedule revised to reflect the ICJIA 2020
Budget.
Dr. Alderden described a new research project—an evaluation of police department-based victim
assistance programs. She said the Research and Analysis Unit contracted with the University of
Illinois to conduct an evaluation of four programs supported with ICJIA-administered funds. She said
the unit also received grant funding from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics for two State Justice
Statistics projects. She said the first grant would allow research staff to develop an application that
will enable web-based querying of Illinois’ Criminal History Record Information statistical summaries
and the second grant project would link between unintentional opioid overdose deaths and prior
criminal history. She said both projects would begin in the fall.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority Board Members

FROM:

Reshma Desai, Strategic Policy Advisor

DATE:

September 19, 2019

RE:

State Violence Prevention Plan update

When ICJIA absorbed the Illinois Violence Prevention Authority (IVPA), the ICJIA statute was
amended, mandating that ICJIA “coordinate statewide violence prevention efforts and develop a
statewide plan that includes public health and public safety approaches to violence prevention in
families, communities, and schools.” (P.A. 97-1151, eff. 1-25-13)
This statute was later amended to include the following mandate:
“coordinate statewide violence prevention efforts and assist in the implementation of trauma recovery
centers and analyze trauma recovery services. The Authority shall develop, publish, and facilitate the
implementation of a 4-year statewide violence prevention plan, which shall incorporate public health,
public safety, victim services, and trauma recovery centers and services.” (P.A. 99-938, eff. 1-1-18)
On June 24, 2019, ICJIA convened a meeting of state agencies to discuss the information gleaned from a
2018 survey that was sent to thirteen state agencies seeking specific information about their violence
prevention programming.
In an effort to complete a comprehensive, statewide violence prevention plan by the end of 2020, the
next steps for ICJIA staff are:
•
•
•
•

Address the gaps in the survey data through individual phone calls with the state agencies.
Convene a second meeting with the state agencies to present the survey data, discuss the scope
and utility of the plan.
Development of a workgroup that will clarify the outcomes of the second meeting, identify and
gather additional information needed to draft plan recommendations.
Convene the state agencies to discuss workgroup recommendations.

Board members will be notified of upcoming planning meeting dates and are welcome to attend.
