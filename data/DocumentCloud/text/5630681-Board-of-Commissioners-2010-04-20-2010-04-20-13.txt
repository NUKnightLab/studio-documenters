APPROVAL OF REVISED 2010 COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve and adopt the 1st Quarter Revised 2010
Comprehensive Budget.
EXPLANATION
The Chicago Housing Authority is required to submit for approval by the Board, a balanced annual
Comprehensive Budget detailing each of the following: General Fund, Section 8 Non-MTW, HOPE VI and Other
Funding Programs, and the use for these funds.
The FY2010 budgeted expenditures have been revised from $1,050,623,356 to $1,031,372,033, resulting in a
$19,251,323 decrease. The major changes by funding source are explained below:
•

General Fund. Total revenues and associated expenditures decreased by $115,589,065 for a fund
total of $864,098,168. The reduction reflects the reclassification of American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act Funds (ARRA) to Other Funds and changes in the cash flow schedule for
construction projects at Altgeld Gardens and Dearborn Homes as well as costs savings related to
ADA work at various CHA sites.

•

Section 8 Non-MTW Fund. Total revenues and associated expenditures increased by $1,678,774 for
a fund total of $7,875,729. This is due to an increase in the average cost per voucher.

•

Hope VI. Total revenues and associated expenditures increased by $5,454,889 for a fund total of
$49,888,585. The change reflects an increase in planned demolition as well as planned development
at various sites including: William Green Homes, ABLA and property Off-Site development.

•

Other Funding. The total revenues and associated expenditures increased by $89,204,079 for a fund
total of $109,509,551. This increase is primarily due to the reclassification of American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act Funds (ARRA) from the General Fund and boiler replacement at Lake Parc Place
and energy performance upgrades at various CHA sites.

The estimated sum of all revenues for fiscal year 2010 and the amount of the fiscal year 2010 Fund Balance
available for appropriation in the fiscal year is equal to the estimated sum of all expenditures to be made or
incurred during the fiscal year and the amount of all unpaid liabilities at the beginning of the fiscal year 2010.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the Chicago Housing Authority to adopt the Revised 2010
Comprehensive Budget.
