herein by this reference.

(b)
The requirement in subdivision I that minority- and women-owned businesses

v. County of Cook, 256 F.3d 642 (7th Cir. 2001). See also Builders Association of Greater
Chicago v. City of Chicago, 2003 WL 1786489, 2003 U.S. Dist. Lexis 23287 (N.D. Ill. 2003).

remedial affirmative action program in Public Works Contracts.

the levels of PCE participation in Public Works Contracts, has reviewed the report prepared

4

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR JUNE 19, 2012

indicating evidence of discrimination in Public Works Contracts and has considered the evidence
in relevant case law; and
(f)
In the absence of application of the Program to Public Works Contracts, the County has
witnessed a drastic decline in PCE in its Public Works Contracts, to levels below the availability of PCEs,
and thus, the County would be a passive participant in a discriminatory marketplace without the
application of PCE goals.
Sec. 34-287.

Policy.

Based on the findings set forth in subdivision I, Sec. 34-261 and the findings set forth in
subdivision II, Sec. 34-286, and in addition to the policy set forth at Sec. 34-262, the policy and purpose
of this subdivision is to establish and implement goals for participation of PCEs in Public Works
Contracts, in accordance with all applicable laws.
It is hereby found, determined and declared that the purpose of this Ordinance is to ensure the full
and equitable participation of Minority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprises in the County's
procurement process as both prime and subcontractors in the County's construction contracts. The County
is committed to a policy of preventing discrimination in the award of or participation in construction
contracts and has recommended appropriate narrowly tailored remedies to eliminate any such
discrimination.
Sec. 34-288.

Program goals. Applicability.

The Program Goal applicable to Public Works Contracts shall be a goal of twenty-four percent
(24%) of the annual total dollar amount of Public Works Contracts to MBEs and a goal of not less than
ten percent (10%) of the annual total dollar amount of Public Works Contracts to WBEs. In establishing a
Contract Specific Goal for Public Works Contracts, the CCD shall consider the availability of sufficient
Certified MBEs and WBEs for each trade required as part of the project.
This subdivision shall apply to all construction contracts funded in whole or in part by County
funds, regardless of the sources of other funds; provided that any contract with respect to which a goal for
Minority-Owned Business Enterprise or Women-Owned Business Enterprise participation is inconsistent
with or prohibited by State or Federal law shall be exempt from the goals included in this subdivision.
Sec. 34-289.

Commercially Useful Function. Severability.

To determine whether a PCE is performing a Commercially Useful Function, the County will
evaluate whether the portion of the work subcontracted to or by a PCE is in accordance with industry
standards. For example, if a PCE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a Contract than would be
expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful
Function. In addition, to perform a Commercially Useful Function, the PCE must be responsible, with
respect to materials, equipment and supplies used in performing its portion of the Contract, for
negotiating price, determining whether quality meets specifications, ordering the material, installing
(where applicable) and paying for the material itself.
If any section, subsection, clause or provision of this subdivision is held to be invalid by a court
of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the subdivision shall not be affected by such invalidity.
Sec. 34-290.

Program eligibility.

(a)
Only Businesses that meet the criteria for certification as a an MBE or WBE may
participate in the Program. The applicant has the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the
evidence.
(b)
Only a firm owned by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person(s) may be
certified as a MBE or WBE.
(1)

The firm's ownership by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person must be real,
substantial, and continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of the firm as reflected in
ownership documents. The owner(s) must enjoy the customary incidents of ownership
and share in the risks and profits commensurate with that ownership interest.

(2)

The contributions of capital or Expertise by the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) to acquire the ownership interest must be real and substantial. If
Expertise is relied upon as part of a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner's
contribution to acquire ownership, the Expertise must be of the requisite quality generally
recognized in a specialized field, in areas critical to the firm's operations, indispensable to
the firm's potential success, specific to the type of work the firm performs and
documented in the firm's records. The individual whose Expertise is relied upon must
have a commensurate financial investment in the firm.

(c)
Only a firm that is managed and controlled by a Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged person(s) may be certified as a MBE or WBE.
(1)

A firm must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions that limit the customary
discretion of the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s). There can be no
restrictions through corporate charter provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any
other formal or informal devices that prevent the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s), without the cooperation or vote of any non-Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged person, from making any business decision of the firm,
including the making of obligations or the disbursing of funds.

(2)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the power to direct
or cause the direction of the management and policies of the firm and to make day-to-day
as well as long-term decisions on management, policy, operations and work.

(3)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) may delegate various areas of
the management or daily operations of the firm to persons who are not Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged. Such delegations of authority must be revocable, and the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must retain the power to hire and fire
any such person. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must actually
exercise control over the firm's operations, work, management and policy.

(4)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have an overall
understanding of, and managerial and technical competence, experience and Expertise,
directly related to the firm's operations and work. The Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) must have the ability to intelligently and critically evaluate
11

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR JUNE 19, 2012
information presented by other participants in the firm's activities and to make
independent decisions concerning the firm's daily operations, work, management, and
policymaking.

(5)

If federal, state and/or local laws, regulations or statutes require the owner(s) to have a
particular license or other credential to own and/or control a certain type of firm, then the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the required license or
credential. If state law, County ordinance or other law regulations or statute does not
require that the owner posses the license or credential, that the owner(s) lacks such
license or credential is a factor, but is not dispositive, in determining whether the Socially
and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the firm.

(6)

A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside
employment or other business interests that conflict with the management of the firm or
prevent the owner from devoting sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the firm to
manage and control its day to day activities.

(d)
Only an independent firm may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An independent firm is
one whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another firm. Recognition of an applicant as
a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is
independent and non-Affiliated. In determining whether an applicant is an independent Business, the CC
Director will:
(1)

Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Firms in such areas as personnel, facilities,
equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.

(2)

Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified
Firms or persons associated with non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's
independence.

(3)

Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Firms to determine whether a
pattern of exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Firm compromises the
applicant's independence.

(4)

Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified Firms
with normal industry practice.

(e)
An applicant shall be certified only for specific types of work in which the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and Expertise to manage and control the firm's
operations and work.
(f)
The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or WBEs and
non-Certified Firms. To be considered an eligible Joint Venture, at least one partner of the Joint Venture
must be a Certified Firm, with a share in the capital contribution, control, management, risks, and profits
of the Joint Venture which is equal to its ownership interest. Each Certified Firm partner must contribute
property, capital, efforts, skill and knowledge and be responsible for a distinct, clearly defined portion of
the work of the contract. Joint Ventures must have an agreement in writing specifying the terms and
conditions of the relationships between the partners and their relationship and responsibility to the
contract.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR JUNE 19, 2012

(g)
In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the CC Director by rule may accept formal
certifications by other entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if the CC Director determines
that the certification standards of such entities are comparable to those of the County.
(h)
The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the
Office of Contract Compliance. Failure of the firm to seek recertification by filing the necessary
documentation with the CC Director as provided by rule may result in decertification.
(i)
It is the responsibility of the Certified Firm to notify the CC Director of any change in its
circumstances affecting its continued eligibility for the Program, including decertification by another
agency. Failure to do so may result in the firm's decertification.
(j)

The CC Director shall decertify a firm that does not continuously meet the eligibility

criteria.
(k)
Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by the
County. The challenged firm shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be
maintained.
(l)
A firm that has been denied certification or recertification or has been decertified may
protest the denial or decertification as provided by rule.
(m)
A firm found to be ineligible may not apply for certification for six (6) months after the
effective date of the final decision.
(n)
A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for certification or a Certified
Firm as provided by rule. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the individual challenging the
eligibility of an applicant for certification or a certified form. The burden of proof shall rest with the
complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The CC Director shall be the
final arbiter of all challenges. The presumption that the challenged firm is eligible shall remain in effect
until the CC Director renders a final decision.
Sec. 34-294.

Annual aspirational goals.

The Annual Aspirational Goals for the utilization of MBEs and WBEs on County construction
contracts and subcontracts shall be 24 percent for MBEs and ten (10) percent for WBEs.
Sec. 34-295.

Project specific goals.

The CC Director, in consultation with the User Department, shall establish Project Specific Goals
for construction Contracts based upon the availability of at least three MBEs and three WBEs to perform
the anticipated subcontracting functions of the project and the County's utilization of MBEs and WBEs to
date.
Sec. 34-296.

Counting MBE and WBE participation.

(a)
The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the MBEs or WBEs
own forces shall be counted, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the MBE or WBE
for the work of the contract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the MBE or WBE (except

13

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR JUNE 19, 2012
supplies and equipment the MBE or WBE purchases or leases from the prime Contractor or the prime
Contractor's Affiliate).
(b)
The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a MBE or WBE for providing a
bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing
bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of a contract, shall be counted, provided the
fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(c)
When a MBE or WBE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of
the total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the Joint
Venture's contract that is performed by the MBE or WBE with its own forces and for which it is
separately at risk, shall be counted.
(d)
Only expenditures to a MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function
shall be counted. To determine whether a MBE or WBE is performing a Commercially Useful Function,
the County will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the
MBE or WBE is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing
and other relevant factors. To perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be
responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining
quality and quantity, ordering the material, installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself.
A MBE or WBE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra
participant in the contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or
WBE participation. If a MBE or WBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would
be expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful
Function. When a MBE or WBE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the
Certified Firm may present evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e)
One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from a MBE or
WBE Manufacturer or Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of the fees or transportation
charges for the delivery of materials or supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the
payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and are commensurate with fees customarily
charged for similar services.
(f)
If a firm ceases to be a Certified Firm for any other reason than graduation from the
M/WBE Construction Program during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of work performed
under a contract with that firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted.
(g)
In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of a MBE or
WBE shall not be counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-297.

Contract pre-award compliance procedures.

(a)
For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all
subcontractors from which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have
been established, its achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan
shall be due at the time the bid / proposal is due.
(b)
Any agreement between a Contractor and a MBE or WBE in which the Contractor
requires that the MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.

14

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR JUNE 19, 2012
(c)
Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CC Director will
determine whether the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). In making this
determination, the Director will consider, at a minimum, the Contractor's efforts to:
(1)

Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings,
advertising and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs certified in the scopes
of work of the contract. The Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and WBEs with
timely, adequate information about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the
contract to allow MBEs and WBEs to respond to the solicitation. The Contractor must
follow up initial solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEs.

(2)

Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to increase the
likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where
appropriate, breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units to
facilitate MBE and WBE participation, even when the Contractor would otherwise prefer
to perform these work items with its own forces. It is the Contractor's responsibility to
make a portion of the work available to MBEs and WBEs and to select those portions of
the work or material needs consistent with the availability MBEs and WBEs to facilitate
their participation.

(3)

Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such negotiation
includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEs that were
contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and
specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and why agreements could not be
reached with MBEs and WBEs. The Contractor may not reject MBEs and WBEs as being
unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities.
That there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEs
is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific
Goals, as long as such costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to
perform the work of a contract with its own organization does not relieve it of the
responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all scopes of work that could be
subcontracted.

(4)

Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or
insurance as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.

(5)

Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary equipment,
supplies, materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate.

(6)

Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women
community organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government sponsored
minority/women business assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to
provide assistance in the recruitment and placement of MBEs and WBEs.

(e)
In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of
other Contractors in meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the
apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be
reasonably questioned whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor
could have met the Project Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet
the Project Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBE participation obtained by
other Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.
15

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR JUNE 19, 2012

(f)
A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the work, materials,
equipment or services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE and the agreed upon dollar value
shall be due at the time of bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(g)
The CC Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the
scope of work and the letters of intent from MBEs and WBEs. The CC Director may request clarification
in writing of items listed in the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the
opportunity to augment listed participation or Good Faith Efforts.
(h)
If the CC Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project
Specific Goals have been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User
Department, the CC Director and User Department shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent
Department.
(i)
If the CC Director finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the
CC Director shall communicate this finding to the User Purchasing Department and recommend that the
bid/proposal be rejected. A Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest
procedures.
Sec. 34-298.

Contract administration procedures.

(a)
Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the Project
Specific Goals become covenants of performance by the Contractors and incorporated in the contract.
(b)
The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the performance
of the contract, and detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment
submitted to the County or as otherwise directed by the County. The CC Director and the User
Department shall monitor subcontractor participation during the course of the contract. The County shall
have full and timely access to the Contractor's books and records, including without limitation payroll
records, tax returns and records and books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its
commitment to MBE and WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion
of the contract. This provision shall be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision
allowing inspection of the Contractor's records by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.
(c)
The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEs
named in the Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CC Director, Purchasing Agent
and the User Department. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this subdivision
and a breach of contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause
termination of the executed contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the Contractor
to contract penalties or other sanctions.
(1)

All requests for changes or substitutions of a MBE or WBE Subcontractor(s) named in
the Utilization Plan shall be made to the CC Director, Purchasing Agent and the User
Department in writing, and shall clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request. A
Contractor shall not substitute a MBE or WBE subcontractor or perform the work
designated for a MBE or WBE subcontractor with its own forces unless and until the CC
Director, Purchasing Agent in consultation with the User Department, approves such
substitution in writing. A Contractor shall not allow a substituted subcontractor to begin
work until both the Director, Purchasing Agent and the User Department have approved
the substitution.
16

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR JUNE 19, 2012

(2)

The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should have
been known by either party before the submission of the Utilization Plan. Bid shopping is
prohibited. The Contractor must negotiate with the MBE or WBE subcontractor to
resolve the problem. Where there has been a mistake or disagreement about the scope of
work, the MBE or WBE can be substituted only where an agreement cannot be reached
for a reasonable price for the correct scope of work.

(3)

Substitutions of the subcontractor shall be permitted only on the following bases:
(i)

Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed.

(ii)

Failure of performance.

(iii)

Financial incapacity.

Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price.

(v)

where agreement upon a reasonable price cannot be reached.

(vi)

Failure of the subcontractor to meet insurance, licensing or bonding
requirements; or

(vii)

The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal.

(4)

The final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed substitution, and the basis of
any denial, shall be communicated to the parties in writing by the CC Director.

(5)

Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the satisfaction of
the County, the Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan.
The Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in
obtaining a new MBE or WBE. If the Project Specific Goal(s) cannot be reached and
Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a non-Certified
Firm.

(6)

If the County requires the substitution of a MBE or WBE subcontractor listed in the
Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall undertake Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the
Utilization Plan. The Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of Contract
Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBE subcontractor. If the Goal(s) cannot be
reached and Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a
non-Certified Firm.

(d)
If a Contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not previously
disclosed in the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of the CC Director to modify the
Utilization Plan and must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure that MBES and WBEs have a fair
opportunity to bid on the new scope of work.
(e)
Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User Department at the time
they arise to establish the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the MBE or WBE goal.

17

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR JUNE 19, 2012
(f)
Prior to contract closeout, the CC Director shall evaluate the Contractor's fulfillment of
the contracted goals, taking into account all approved substitutions, terminations and changes to the
contract's scope of work. If the County determines that Good Faith Efforts to meet the MBE or WBE
commitments were not made, or that fraudulent misrepresentations have been made, or any other breach
of the contract or violation of this subdivision, a remedy or sanction may be imposed, as provided in the
contract.
Sec. 34-299.

Sanctions and penalties.

(a)

The following violations of this subdivision may result in a breach of contract:

(1)

Providing false or misleading information to the County in connection with submission of
a bid, responses to requests for qualifications or proposals, Good Faith Efforts
documentation, post award compliance, or other Program operations.

(2)

Committing any other violations of this subdivision.

(b)
A Contractor or subcontractor is subject to withholding of payments under the contract,
termination of the contract for breach, contract penalties, or being barred or deemed non-responsive in
future County solicitations and contracts as determined by the County's Purchasing Agent, if it is found to
have:
(1)

Provided false or misleading information in connection with an application for
certification or recertification or colluded with others to do so;

(2)

Provided false or misleading information in connection with the submission of a bid or
proposal or documentation of Good Faith Efforts, post-award compliance, or other

Annual Participation Goals and the County's progress towards meeting those Goals and eliminating
discrimination in its contracting activities and marketplace.
(c)
Within five years after the effective date of this ordinance, the County will review the
operation of the Program and the evidentiary basis for the Program in order to determine whether it the
County has a continuing compelling interest in remedying discrimination against MBEs and WBEs in its
construction marketplace, and the permissible scope of any narrowly tailored remedies to redress
discrimination against MBEs or WBEs so that the County will not function as a passive participant in a
discriminatory marketplace.
(d)

This subdivision shall sunset on or before June 30, 2016.

City’s longstanding landfill moratorium by joining unincorporated Cook County or annexing the property
to the adjoining Village of Dolton and seeking local sitting approval to expand its landfill operation onto
the disconnected property; and
WHEREAS, the disconnected parcel is located in the Lake Calumet area, for which Cook County and
other units of government including the State of Illinois and the City of Chicago have developed plans for
preserving and restoring unique environmental areas. These units of government have invested millions

planned for the future; and

COOK COUNTY CEMETERY (PROPOSED RESOLUTION).
Submitting a
Proposed Resolution sponsored by John A. Fritchey, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
COOK COUNTY CEMETERY
WHEREAS, recent events as well as investigations by the Cook County Sheriff have
brought into serious question and unfortunate light, the manner by which the Cook
County’s indigent, unclaimed and unknown individuals have been buried; and
WHEREAS, disturbing practices have included persons stacked eight coffins high, bodies
placed in coffins with unidentified limbs and skeletal remains from other bodies, medical
waste and non-human debris, and coffins buried haphazardly in a manner making future
location for personal or law enforcement purposes, difficult if not impossible; and
WHEREAS, such practices not only demonstrate an unacceptable lack of respect for the
least fortunate among us and are unbecoming of a civilized society, but additionally
impede ongoing criminal investigations in cases of unknown decedents, as the identifying
characteristics of hundreds of unidentified remains buried by the County have failed to be
entered into the NCIC (National Crime Information Center), the nationally recognized
71

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR JUNE 19, 2012
database for tracking crime-related information; and
WHEREAS, the discovery of the above-mentioned practices led to the introduction and
passage of an ordinance on May 4, 2011, setting new standards and safeguards for the
manner in which burials of the indigent, unclaimed and unknown are handled in Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, said ordinance clarified the role and responsibilities of the Office of the
Medical Examiner in preparing the bodies for burial as well as the methods by which
burials are to be conducted by cemeteries that have contracts with the county for such
burials; and
WHEREAS, this Government is ultimately responsible for these individuals, and
consequently it is the in the best interest of the County and its residents for the County to
once again operate a cemetery for the burial of our County’s indigent, unclaimed and
unknown persons; and
WHEREAS, for over a century, from 1854-1971, Cook County operated, maintained and
administered its own cemetery, the most recent site having been located on the land
adjacent to the Oak Forest Hospital, known as the Cook County Cemetery for the Indigent,
where tens of thousands of individuals have previously been laid to rest; and
WHEREAS, the reestablishment of a permanent Cook County Cemetery would not only
ensure that our indigent are put to rest in a respectful manner, but it would also facilitate
proper documentation for law enforcement purposes, proper maintenance, as well as save
the County millions of dollars; and
WHEREAS, with the use of approximately 5 acres of land contiguous to the location of the
former Cook County Cemetery for the Indigent, the County could establish a cemetery
capable of meeting the needs of the County for the next 100 years; and
WHEREAS, the aforesaid land is presently owned and maintained by the Forest Preserve
District of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, since the Forest Preserve acquired said cemetery, no plan for addressing the
former cemetery site has been forthcoming, and as such, ample opportunity still exists to
determine a proper use of that parcel and the surrounding areas; and
WHEREAS, there exist several precedents for the co-existence of cemeteries on Forest
Preserve property, including Bachelors Grove Cemetery, Sauerbier-Burkhardt Cemetery
and the above-mentioned Cook County Cemetery for the Indigent; and
WHEREAS, the County Highway Department already owns the equipment necessary to
operate and maintain such a cemetery; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Sheriff has expressed a willingness and ability to provide
sufficient labor necessary to operate and maintain such a cemetery; and
WHEREAS, based upon anticipated costs for the currently mandated indigent burial
program, the reestablishment of a County cemetery can reasonably expect to save Cook
County taxpayers in excess of $175 million over the next 100 years.

DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND POLICY, BUREAU OF ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT. Transmitting a Communication, dated May 15, 2012 from Herman
Brewer, Chief:
transmitted herewith are the proposed uses for the 2012 Program Year for the Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG); Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) (formerly known
as the Emergency Shelter Grant); and HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) programs
as well as specific project recommendations for CDBG. These funds are provided to Cook
County via an annual formula grant through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) and are restricted for use within Suburban Cook County. The Cook
County Community Development Advisory Council (CDAC) adopted these
recommendations at a public hearing held on May 10, 2012.
The 2012 Program Year CDBG allocation is $9,318,878.00. Related project funding
requests exceeded $20,000,000.00. The proposed uses of CDBG funds will benefit lowand moderate- income persons as detailed in the enclosed project recommendations.
The 2012 Program Year ESG allocation is $767,133.00. The proposed uses of ESG funds
include the provision of essential services, support of maintenance/operations costs for
homeless shelters, and assistance for homelessness prevention. Given the ongoing HUD
transition of the ESG program from the Emergency Shelter Grant to the Emergency
Solutions Grant model including changing rules and regulations, the Cook County release
of a request for applications has been temporarily placed on hold. Therefore, ESG project
recommendations are not provided at this time.

89

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR JUNE 19, 2012
The 2012 Program Year HOME allocation is $3,677,940.00. The proposed uses of HOME
funds include program administration and affordable housing development for the benefit
of low-income persons. Given the cyclical nature of affordable housing development,
HOME project applications are accepted throughout the year and presented to the Board
for review and approval as required. No HOME project recommendations are provided at
this time.
The proposed uses of all program funds including project recommendations for CDBG will
be incorporated into the County’s Annual Action Plan which will be made available for
public comment prior to submittal to HUD by August 15, 2012.
I respectfully request approval of the recommended proposed uses and project
recommendations as specified for the 2012 CDBG, ESG, and HOME funds; and that the
Bureau Chief of Economic Development or his/her designee be authorized to execute, on
behalf of the County of Cook any and all documents necessary to further the programs
approval herein, including but not limited to, subrecipient agreements, intergovernmental
agreements, amendments, and modifications thereto, loan documents, lien assignments,
releases of mortgages and liens, and mortgage assumptions.

respectfully submitting this resolution regarding AMB-SGP CIF-Illinois L.P.'s request for
a Class 6b property tax incentive for special for an industrial building located at 1281
Arthur Avenue, Elk Grove Village, Illinois. The applicant intends to lease to an industrial
user for warehousing, manufacturing and/or distribution.
AMB-SGP CIF-Illinois L.P. requests approval of the tax incentive based on the special
circumstances that the property has been vacant for more than 24 months and there has
been no purchase for value under the Class 6b Ordinance. This Resolution is required so
that the company can complete its application to the Assessor of Cook County.
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Toni Preckwinkle, President and Elizabeth
“Liz” Doody Gorman, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property
Assessment Classification 6b that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level
for an industrial facility; and
WHEREAS, the County Board of Commissioners has received and reviewed an
application from AMB-SGP CIF-Illinois L.P. and Resolution No. 17 from the Village of
Elk Grove Village for an abandoned industrial facility located at 1281 Arthur Avenue, Elk

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR JUNE 19, 2012
Grove Village, Cook County, Illinois, County Board District #17, Property Index No.: 0834-402-050-0000; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has defined abandoned property as buildings and other
structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 months, are purchased
for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, industrial real estate is normally assessed at 25% of its market value.
Qualifying industrial real estate eligible for the Class 6b can receive a significant reduction
in the level of assessment from the date that new construction or rehabilitation has been
completed, or in the case of abandoned property from the date of substantial re-occupancy.
Properties receiving Class 6b will be assessed at 10% of the market value for 10 years,
15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned
property, the municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special
circumstances justify finding that the property is abandoned for the purpose of Class 6b;
and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of over 24 months and no purchase for value by
a disinterested buyer, the County may determine that special circumstances justify finding
the property is deemed abandoned; and
