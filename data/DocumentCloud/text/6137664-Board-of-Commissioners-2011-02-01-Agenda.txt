CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT
PROPOSED GRANT AWARD
ITEM #22
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON TECHNOLOGY #310951
Transmitting a Communication, dated January 6, 2011 from
DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting authorization to accept a grant award in the amount of $129,600.00 from the Illinois Criminal
Justice Information Authority (ICJIA). The funds will be used to improve disposition reporting to Illinois
State Police. This grant requires a cash match or an in-kind match of a minimum of 20 percent to provide
for the additional funds for providing an overall method or system of correcting the rejected postings from
the Illinois State Police's Criminal History Record Information (CHRI) system.
As the Clerk of the Circuit Court (CCC) lacks an overall method or system of correcting the rejected
postings from the Illinois State Police’s CHRI system, CCC is proposing to build an application that will
process the rejected dispositions that did not post to CHRI, provide a user interface to allow for updates to
the information contained in the Clerk’s disposition reporting, and to transmit that information so that it
successfully posts to CHRI. This solution will specifically provide for:
Automating the interface of records that are pushed back to CCC for correction and resubmission
to ISP’s system for updating to CHRI; and
Implementing improved data capture procedures (technical and operational) that would facilitate
complete arrest reporting, research missing dispositions and information for reporting to ISP’s
system; and
Reengineering business processes that are impacted by the new application build; and
Examining and improving data collection at critical points throughout the justice process; and
Establishing more effective accuracy and information quality and auditable controls; and
Reducing the backlog of missing disposition or related information.
Additionally, the solution will have to examine the collection points of information coming into the
Circuit Court. There may be opportunities for improvements in receiving critical data through an
electronic exchange as opposed to many of manual entry points that exist today. Lastly, CCC will also
add stakeholders to the project as necessary, especially as it relates to agencies that are identified through
the data collection and exchange points, where improvements can be made in ensuring accurate and
complete information at its point of origin. Justice XML standards will be used as appropriate.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $32,400.00. (528-818 Account). Grant Award: $129,600.00. Funding period:
January 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012.
Sufficient funds are available in the Circuit Court Automation Fund.
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any.
