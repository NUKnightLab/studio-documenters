Discussion concerning the Blue Cross Blue Shield and Aetna/Labor First enrollments and
deduction requests has begun. Recommendation of Fund’s legal counsel is that the Fund’s
staff take the requested premium deduction at this time from his or her annuity, so as to avoid
any gap in coverage, and verify annuitant authorization during the reconciliation process in
2017.
The Fund received four responses, each, to the RFPs for Audit Services and Actuarial
Services. The Executive Director requested that the audit and actuarial committee review the
responses and invite selected respondents, at a later date, to provide oral presentations. The
Board requested that in the interest of timeliness of year-end procedures and adequate time to
make an appropriate selection, the incumbent providers would be utilized for 2016 and the
respondents be considered for year-end 2017, with the ability to adjust any related pricing due
to this change.
An update on the Cognizant Technology Solutions case, of which the Fund was advised to
seek lead plaintiff. Through communication with Avi Bernstein of Bernstein Litowitz Berger
and Grossman LLP, a larger fund has stepped forward to proceed as lead plaintiff. As such
Mr. Bernstein did not recommend that the Fund continue to seek lead plaintiff status and thus
the Fund’s staff took no action on the matter.
An update on the recovery of annuities paid after dates of death, was reviewed. As a
reminder, the Fund was not notified of the passing of these annuitant and continued payment.
The Fund’s staff has worked with Trustee Lappe who presented the cases to CPD Financial
Crimes. Based upon these efforts, the Fund has recovered substantial amounts.
A final letter to annuitants who no longer receive healthcare from the City of Chicago as of
December 31, 2016, and for whom the Fund’s records reflect no selection of coverage with
Blue Cross Blue Shield or Aetna, will be sent by the Fund. Such letter will be a final
reminder to each member of loss of coverage unless an alternative plan is selected.

President Hauser presented the Richard J. Jones Annuitants’ Assistance Fund with a $500
donation from the golf outing run by President Hauser, the FOP and the Detectives Association.
