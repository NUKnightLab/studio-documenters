 MHS BOARD POLICY
GOV-0X – Conflicts of Interest

Key Points
 The members of The MetroHealth System (MetroHealth) Board of Trustees (Trustees) owe a
duty of loyalty to MetroHealth in all activities affecting MetroHealth.
 The Trustees are committed to avoiding any actual or potential conflicts between any perso
interests he/she may have and those interests of MetroHealth or any of its affiliated
organizations.
 This policy protects The MetroHealth System’s interest in the context of transactions or
arrangements involving the private interest of a Trustee. All Trustees disclose Financial
1
2
Interests
and other activities that may be perceived as a Conflict
of Interest.
Policy

1. General Principles. This policy supplements but does not replace any applicable county, sta
and federal laws governing Conflicts of Interest applicable to MetroHealth as a public
organization. In addition to supporting the general fiduciary duty of Trustees, this policy
supports MetroHealth’s compliance with applicable Ethics Laws.

1.1. Fiduciary Duty. Trustees have a fiduciary duty to the organization and Trustees exercise
utmost good faith in all transactions related to their duties for MetroHealth. Trustees do
not use their positions, or the knowledge gained therefrom, in such a way that a Conflic
Interest might arise between the interest of MetroHealth and their personal interest.
General principles of fiduciary duty and Ohio law prohibit all Trustees from disclosing or
using any confidential information acquired in the course of their official duties.

1.2. Statutory Conflicts of Interest. Trustees are subject to Ohio conflicts of interest and ethic
laws, including sections 102.03 and 2921.42 of the Ohio Revised Code.

1.2.1.
These statutory conflicts of interest and ethics provisions are complex and require
careful evaluation of specific facts and circumstances pertaining to such personal o
private interest.
1.2.2.
The Ethics laws are criminal statutes and violation of such law could result in seriou
consequences.

2. Conflicts of Interest. In addition to statutory Conflicts of Interest, Trustees may have potenti
Conflicts of Interest which, although not expressly prohibited by the Ohio statutes, raise issu
of fiduciary duty. Such a Conflict of Interest may exist if a Trustee (directly or through Family
Members or Business Associates) has an interest in or other financial arrangement with an
entity with which MetroHealth is engaging in a transaction or arrangement.

 MHS BOARD POLICY
3
2.1. Specific Prohibitions. Ohio Ethics Laws prohibit a Trustee (or his/her Family
or anyMember
4
Business Associate
) from:

2.1.1.Having a private interest in a public contract unless an exception is available;
2.1.2.Using his or her authority or position to secure a public contract;
2.1.3.Using his or her office or position to secure anything of value; or
2.1.4.Soliciting or accepting anything of value.

2.2. Voting Restrictions. Any Trustee having a Conflict of Interest should not vote or use his/h
personal influence involving MetroHealth business.

2.3. Annual Statements. Upon appointment to the Board and annually thereafter, each Trust
submits a Conflict of Interest Disclosure Statement (Disclosure Statement) affirming tha
he/she:
2.3.1.
Received a copy of this Conflicts of Interest Policy,
2.3.2.
Completed the Disclosure Statement,
2.3.3.
Read and understands the Policy, and
2.3.4.
Agrees to comply with the Policy.

2.4. Duty to Disclose. A Trustee discloses the existence and nature of his or her personal or
private interest in connection with any actual or potential Conflicts of Interest in writing
the Chairperson of the Board of Trustees when he/she becomes aware of a change or
reasonably soon after it occurs (within 10 days).

2.4.1.
If a Trustee has a potential or actual Conflict of Interest and has not updated her/his
Annual Statement, the Trustee discloses the Conflict to the Chief Legal Officer prior
a MetroHealth Board meeting.
2.4.2.
The Chair dismisses the Trustee while the remaining Trustees review the disclosure
and determine if a Conflict of Interest exists.
2.4.3.
The Trustee does not participate in the Board of Trustees meeting while the persona
or private interest is discussed and voted upon.

2.5. Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists. The Chairperson of the Board refers a
actual and potential Conflicts of Interest to the SVP/Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer
review and determination of whether a Conflict exists. The SVP/Chief Ethics and
Compliance Officer will consult the Chief Legal Officer regarding the determination of
whether a Conflict of Interest exists.

2.6. Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy. If the Board of Trustees has reasonable caus
to believe that a Trustee failed to disclose actual or potential Conflict(s) of Interest, the
SVP/Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer informs the Trustee of the basis for such belief
affords the Trustee the opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.

2.7. Investigations of failed disclosures. SVP/Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, in consulta
with the Chief Legal Officer, investigates the circumstances regarding the failed disclosu

 MHS BOARD POLICY

If the Board of Trustees determines that the Trustee failed to disclose an actual or poten
Conflict of Interest, it takes appropriate corrective action.
2.8. Records of Proceedings. The minutes of the Board of Trustees and all committees with
Board of Trustees delegated powers contain:

2.8.1.
The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a persona
or private interest in connection with an actual or potential Conflict of Interest, the
nature of the personal or private interest, any action taken to determine whether a
Conflict of Interest was present, and the Board of Trustees’ decision as to whether a
Conflict of Interest in fact existed.

2.8.2.
The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes relating to th
transaction or arrangement, the content of the discussion, and a record of any vote
taken in connection therewith.

2.9. Periodic Reviews. This Policy is reviewed annually for the information and guidance of th
Board of Trustees, and any new Trustee is advised of the Policy upon entering on the du
of office.
