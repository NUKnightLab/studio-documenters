IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update on CountyCare Health Plan (Attachment #4)
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, reviewed the information contained in the Update on the
CountyCare Health Plan. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Velasquez inquired regarding potential impacts that may affect CountyCare resulting from the
impending change of administration at the State level. Douglas Elwell, Deputy CEO of Finance and Strategy
and Interim Deputy CEO of Operations, responded that there is some level of protection, as the Managed Care
Community Network (MCCN) contract was approved by the federal government; in order for the State to
move beyond that, it would require them to open negotiations with the federal government. At this point, the
administration continues to reach out to educate. There are certain reasons why the CountyCare Health Plan
receives rates that are different than those for other provider groups; it is important that those who are involved
at the State understand the genesis of those rates, and that they understand the benefit to the State.
Director Collens inquired regarding the decrease in membership from July through October; he asked for
further information on how this impacts the budget. Mr. Elwell responded that staff are tracking this
information; membership is a little bit lower than anticipated to be at this time, and is affected by the
redetermination project. In contrast, he noted that CCHHS is very far ahead in member months. Mr. Glass
offered to include information on member months in his future reports.
Mr. Scheer asked whether the administration can track the health costs for the risks associated with
CountyCare members against the health costs for its competitors. Mr. Glass responded that he and his staff
will look into that question.
Director Collens inquired regarding external partners and whether opportunities could be taken by those
external partners to recruit CountyCare members away from CCHHS and into that partner’s own health plan.
Mr. Glass stated that the top three (3) largest external partners are Mt. Sinai, University of Illinois and Chicago
Lakeshore Hospital. On the provider agreement side, from the health plan perspective, the CCHHS contracts
with the providers do not contain any type of language addressing that subject. In terms of tracking member
movement, a request was very recently made by Debra Carey, Chief Operating Officer, Ambulatory Services,
to have this information tracked, so staff is working on that.
Director Wiese asked whether information is available on the number of unduplicated patients that are being
served. Mr. Glass responded that the administration has not yet reached that level of information yet; however,
he noted that 32% of CountyCare members have selected a clinic in the Ambulatory and Community Health
Network of Cook County (ACHN) as their primary care medical home - that percentage has remained
consistent throughout the course of CountyCare.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved to receive and file the
Update on the CountyCare Health Plan.
THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.
