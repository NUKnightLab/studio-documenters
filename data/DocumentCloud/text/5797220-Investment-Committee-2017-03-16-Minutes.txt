WHEREAS, the Board has been informed that Participant TIMOTHY P. CATALANO is a
retired employee who is receiving his retirement benefits, and
WHEREAS, Participant’s date of birth is December 10, 1962, and, to date, Participant has

WHEREAS, the PFRS’ standard procedure as it relates to DROs is that a party will submit a
proposed DRO for review and pre-approval to PFRS General Counsel, which review
process is intended to confirm the proposed DRO’s conformity with the benefits available to
participants in the Combined Plan for the PFRS (the “Combined Plan”), a document publicly
available at: http://www.pfrsdetroit.org/Resources/Combined-Plan-Document, and
WHEREAS, once PFRS General Counsel pre-approves a proposed DRO, the parties may

that the Participant retired on September 1, 2012 and, therefore, accrued no service credit
in Component I under the Combined Plan because Component I benefits only relate to
service credit earned on or after July 1, 2014, and
WHEREAS, because the Participant retired September 1, 2012, the Participant’s retirement
benefits with PFRS are solely available under Component II of the Combined Plan, which
relates to service credit earned prior to July 1, 2014, and
WHEREAS, by copy of this resolution, the Participant and Alternate Payee will be advised
that the Court-entered DRO submitted to the PFRS is rejected for the reason that it
divides benefits unavailable to the Participant under the Combined Plan, and
WHEREAS, by copy of this resolution, the Participant and Alternate Payee will be advised
that corrective action must be taken before the PFRS will act on this matter; specifically, the
parties should be aware that a first-amended DRO must be drafted to conform with the
Combined Plan and provided to PFRS General Counsel for review and pre-approval
consistent with PFRS Standard EDRO/DRO Procedure, therefore be it
RESOLVED, that the DRO is rejected, and be it further
RESOLVED, that no action will be taken by this Board regarding this matter until PFRS
General Counsel receives a first-amended DRO to review for conformity with the Combined
Plan, and be it further
