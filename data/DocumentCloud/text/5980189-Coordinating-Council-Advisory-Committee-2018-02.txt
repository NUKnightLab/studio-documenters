February 28th Coordinating Council Advisory Committee Meeting Information

This memo provides a brief overview of the Coordinating Council Advisory Committee (CCAC) meeting
on Wednesday, February 28th from 3:00-4:00 p.m. at ICJIA’s office at 300 West Adams, Chicago, Suite
200. We look forward to your participation.
First, we want to begin with a discussion of this Committee’s charge: to review and advise on the
Authority’s efforts to encourage coordination and cooperation between the State and local agencies
on criminal justice planning in order to improve the safety of all the people of Illinois in the most
effective and cost-efficient way. This includes our work with Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils,
Family Violence Coordinating Councils, Juvenile Justice Councils, Adult Redeploy, and similar local and
regional collaborative groups.
Next, to kick off this effort, we will present an overview of the scope of local coordinated criminal justice
activities in Illinois with which ICJIA is involved. The presentation will explain the purpose and goals of
each group, map where they are currently active throughout the state, and provide list of each group and
their main contacts. Then we want to get your insights about the current mandates and design of these
groups and how the Authority can best coordinate and use its resources to support the success of these
efforts.
Finally, we would like to discuss your reaction to the results of a survey of our criminal justice
coordinating council sites (Lake, McHenry, McLean, St. Clair, and Winnebago counties), which solicited
input on the trainings and sessions to be held at our spring workshop for the councils. The workshop will
be hosted at Loyola University later this spring. More information about the workshop will be announced
as details are confirmed.
Thank you for your involvement with this new initiative,
John Maki
Executive Director,
Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
