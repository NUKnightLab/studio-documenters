Following Mr. Borgers’ testimony, Chairman Carvalho noted that the purpose of the October 13th Special Finance

result of the Committee’s October 13th review and discussion. He added that the data for FY2010 is not final and is

III. Action Items (continued)
C. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
This item was considered concurrently with Item III(D) Supplemental Contracts and Procurement Items.
Ann Marie Huddleston, Interim Deputy Director of Supply Chain, presented the requests for the Committee’s
consideration. She noted that request number 4 was being withdrawn; additionally, a correction to the contract
date for request number 5 was stated (correction reflected in the amended request included in Attachment #1).
The following individuals provided additional information on the requests presented for consideration:
Elizabeth Reidy, General Counsel for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System; Dr. Anthony Tedeschi,
System Chief Operating Officer; William T. Foley; Chief Executive Officer of the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System; and Dr. Stephen Martin, Chief Operating Officer of the Cook County Department of Public
Health.
With regard to request number 3, Director O’Donnell requested additional information on the request for
proposals (RFP) process for the new contract for these services. Ms. Huddleston responded that she will
provide this information.
Mr. Foley provided additional information on request number 25. He noted that David Gomez & Associates is
a certified minority enterprise; he added that the company has a focus on diversity. Sixteen searches have been
completed, including those for the positions of Director of Human Resources, Director of Public Relations,
Corporate Compliance Officer, Director of Risk Management, Director of Internal Audit, Director of Labor
Relations and Director of Quality. They are currently recruiting for the leadership positions at the Ambulatory
and Community Health Network of Cook County, including the positions of Chief Nursing Officer and Chief
Operating Officer. They are also recruiting for the Chair of Radiology. He added that there are positions for
which recruitment efforts are pending; recruitment efforts for these are contingent upon the approval of the
proposed request to increase and extend the contract. Because of the number of searches performed, the
average fee for their services is 17% of the position’s first year’s compensation, which is less than the earlier
negotiated rate of 25%; it is estimated that this results in a savings of approximately $250,000.
The Committee discussed the subject of utilizing search firm services for the recruitment of positions such as
the Chair of Radiology, and the process specified under the medical staff bylaws for candidate searches for
these types of positions. Ms. Reidy responded that, under the medical staff bylaws, there is a fairly intricate
process for searches; however, it is viewed that this is the advertisement before that process, where candidates
could be selected for inclusion with any other prospective candidates for the bylaw’s search process. Mr.
Foley added that there have been challenges in prior searches for these types of positions.
The Committee discussed the bid process and the subject of continuing efforts to engage prospective vendors.
With regard to the subject of holding vendor fairs, Ms. Huddleston stated that there was a diversity vendor fair
recently held. Chairman Carvalho noted that this type of activity should continue, and should also be
broadened to outreach to the entire vendor community.
Director Golden, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved the approval of request numbers 1
through 31, as amended, under the Contracts and Procurement Items and Supplemental Contracts
and Procurement Items, with the exception of request number 4, which was withdrawn. THE
MOTION CARRIED.
Chairman Carvalho abstained and voted PRESENT on request numbers 2 and 28.
Director Muñoz abstained and voted PRESENT on request number 10.

III. Action Items
C. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Note: request numbers 26 and 30 were withdrawn, and request number 29 was given
conditional approval, pending Contract Compliance, at the Board of Directors Meeting on
November 19, 2010.

Notification of Emergency Purchases (Attachment #2)
In accordance with Part II, Section 2.8 of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System Procurement Policy
that states that emergency purchases be reported to the Finance Committee no later than at its next regularly
scheduled meeting, Ms. Huddleston notified the Committee that emergency purchases have been made. Also
in accordance with the Policy, a communication in writing was sent to Chairman Carvalho and Board
Chairman Batts on this matter.

D. Supplemental Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #3)
This item was considered concurrently with Item III(C).

E. Proposed Resolution – authorizing the execution of the First Amendment to the Agreement between
CCHHS, the Cook County Department of Public Health and the Public Health Institute of Metropolitan
Chicago (PHIMC), with regard to the Communities Putting Prevention to Work Grant (Attachment #4)
Dr. Martin provided an overview of the request presented for the Committee’s consideration.
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved to approve the Proposed
Resolution. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
F. Any items listed under Sections III and VI

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Item
A. Discussion of CCHHS FY2011 Preliminary Budget
Chairman Carvalho reviewed the activity that has taken place with regard to the public hearings on the FY2011
Preliminary Budget. He stated that two hearings have been held; a third public hearing is expected to take
place this afternoon.
Chairman Carvalho presented information on some of the subjects discussed at the public hearings. He noted
that the balance of the items raised at the Markham Courthouse hearing related to the budgetary
implementation of the strategic plan as it affects the mix of services provided at Oak Forest Hospital. He stated
that there was a focus by the individuals providing testimony upon the services that that will be reduced or
eliminated, as opposed to consideration of the services that will be increased or added. Additionally, the
subject of transit issues as they relate to a fixed scheduling system was discussed.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Item
A. Discussion of CCHHS FY2011 Preliminary Budget (continued)
Director Golden noted that there were some comments relating to transparency and communication to the
public about this process; she stated that there was a request for a much more detailed budget to be presented.
The subject of line-item budgets was discussed. Chairman Carvalho explained that, following public hearings
and approval by the System Board, the FY2011 Preliminary Budget is presented to the Cook County Board for
approval. After it is approved, it becomes part of the President’s Executive Budget Recommendation presented
to the Cook County Board for approval. At the time that the CCHHS FY2011 Preliminary Budget becomes
part of the President’s Executive Budget Recommendation, it takes the form of a line-item budget request.
With regard to the comments relating to communications, Chairman Carvalho suggested that, for next year’s
budget hearings, further thought should be given to the subject of exploring additional opportunities to
communicate to the public.
Chairman Carvalho noted that, with regard to the proposed FY2011 Preliminary Budget, a question that
remains unanswered for him relates to special earnings. He stated that when the System Board approved the
first salary adjustments for physicians in 2008, it was indicated that the adjustments would bring the
physicians’ salaries to where they ought to be; therefore, the special earnings category would no longer be
necessary. He requested additional information on the budget request of $5 million for special earnings; he
stated that he wants a detailed understanding relating to this request.
Mr. Foley stated that two additional public hearings may be held. Plans have now been set to hold a public
hearing at the Maywood Courthouse on Wednesday, November 10, 2010 at 6:30 P.M.; notice for this hearing
will be sent out later today. Additionally, there may be a public hearing at the Chicago Urban League; plans
are currently being made to have this take place on Monday, November 15, 2010 in the evening; however, this
is yet unconfirmed.
V.

Report from System Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #5)
A. Update on CareLink policy
Mr. Ayres provided an update on the CareLink policy, which included information on the following subjects:
policy; procedure; communication; staffing; and areas of concern, including those relating to co-pays.
Discussion took place on the question of whether those individuals who are non-compliant with CareLink and
do not qualify for other eligibility programs can still use the pharmacy. It was determined that the CareLink
policy allows for the use of the pharmacy the first time the individual is found to be non-compliant; if the
individual returns the second time and is still non-compliant with the policy, the pharmaceuticals are not
provided.
Mr. Ayres stated that he is planning to present proposed revisions to the policy to the Committee in December.
Additionally, Mr. Ayres presented information on the historical patient cash summary; he noted that he is
planning to present this information each month. In response to a question from Director Ramirez regarding
how much of the collections is attributable to activities by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Mr. Ayres
responded that, on a gross level, they estimate $5 million is attributable to activities by PwC; however, on a
finite level, it is less than that amount. Mr. Foley noted that the Board will be receiving a comprehensive
report on PwC activities in either December or January.

Respectfully requesting ratification of a technical correction to the authorizations issued in connection with
the -contract with PricewaterhouseCoopers. LLP. H10-25-113, as follows:
The correct contract term for contract H10-25-113 is 7/13/2010 ,thru 7/1212013. While thJ individual project
timelines described in Statements of Work (SOW) are for up to two years, the contract has-a three-year
term in order to encompass SOWs which have variances in start and stop dates and in order to encompass
agreed benefit periods.
This correction is needed in order to conform the Board authorization documents to the dmtract documents.
The original authorization listed a contract period of from 6/1/2010 thru 5131/2012. An amendment to add a
SOW not included in the original scope of the contract was authorized by the Board in August 2010, and
provided for a contract term of 9/1/10 through 8/31/13; this information was incorrect, as the benefIt period
for this SOW is for a five month period starting 8/212010 thru 12131/2010. ~n~~~;tpR1Qiifilfrl~'

CareLink - Principles for Expansion in Clinics
-

.!..

l

The workgroup has reached agreement on the following principles for the CareLink program
administration. The step of expansion to the neighboring clinics is likely to require a joint effort that
will utilize qualified CCHHS staff. However, in order to gain staff buy-in, we will need to approach
this gradually.

Principles
•   CEA manages the overall process and program integrity
•   CCHS staff should be able to quickly determine patient eligibility for CareLink based upon
rule-based screening that includes rule-out for Medicaid
•   Both CEA and CCHHS staff should be able to screen patients for CareLink eligibility
•   Documents (verifications) must be able to be scanned into the CareLink system
•   CEA staff will approve CareLink applications
•   CEA will establish an internal audit function that is reliable and consistent
•   CEA will report on QA function on a regular basis
•   Defects found in QA process must be rectified within 20 business days

 CEA has seen a total of 2,050 patients at Oak Forest since initiation of the CareLink pilot. Of
those, some are initial screenings and some are being screened as part of the process for LOL
renewal. 175 patients (9% of the total) appear eligible for Medicaid. 36% of the patients seen have
been compliant with returning verifications and have been approved.

•

Co-pay changes

 The assumptions that are considered in this staffing model are based on data provided by the
CCHHS finance department. The data is total visits in all clinics across the hospital system. CEA
made several assumptions for the CareLink staffing plan.
Assumptions: 

-90% of Clinic Visits are Self Pay 

-Each unique patient has 3 OP visits 

-Approximately 50% of the patients will follow through for Care Link Screening 

-8% of those patients who present will require Medicaid applications

 The staffing model that CEA is recommending is based on a hybrid model utilizing onsite CCHHS
employees to give patients a handout regarding CareLink. The patient would then be instructed to
return for CareLink / Medicaid screening when they have their verifications prepared for the
interview.
