Through the Youth Ready Chicago Program, CHA youth will learn valuable and
transferable skills that connect life lessons and academic preparation; enhancing their
long-term employment prospects. CHA youth will be engaged in a variety of
employment models including, but not limited to, technology, “green” jobs, academic
preparedness and job shadowing. CHA will enlist an external vendor to ensure all
contractor payrolls are processed accurately and timely.
In 2009, 903 CHA youth had the opportunity to participate in the Youth Ready Chicago
Program. Youth had the opportunity to develop essential skills to strengthen their
professional development while earning a wage of $8.00/hour. In 2010, CHA will
specifically target youth residing in community areas that are not served by the JobStart
program. Participants will receive $8.25/hour, which will be the State of Illinois
minimum wage effective July 1, 2010.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the Chicago Housing Authority to
authorize the Chief Executive Officer, or his designee, to accept a grant award from the
City of Chicago’s Department of Family and Support Services in the amount of
$218,400, increase the FY 2010 comprehensive budget by $218,400 and enter into subgrant agreements with Center for New Horizons, Employment and Employer Services,
Heartland Human Care Services, Holsten Real Estate Corporation, Jane Addams Hulls
House Association, LR ABLA, Metropolitan Family Services, Near West Side
Community Development Corporation, Stateway Associates, The Community Builders,
and Uhlich Children’s Advantage Network in an aggregate amount, not-to-exceed
$218,400 to provide 104 Chicago Housing Authority youth with job training, skill
development and employment opportunities under the Youth Ready Chicago Program.
