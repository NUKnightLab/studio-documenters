FISCAL YEAR 2019 PROGRAMS SUMMARY
In FY2018 the IACA was able to reinstate programs that had been put on hiatus during
the budget impasse. That included Artstour & Live Music, Individual Artist Support,
StArts, and Arts and Foreign Language. For FY2019 the Agency will also reinstate the
Artist Fellowship Program and Literary Awards.
In October of 2018, the IACA and Arts Alliance Illinois will once again partner on One
State Together in the Arts, a statewide conference for arts advocates, administrators,
educators, funders, and practitioners representing the broad range of creative activity
and disciplines found across Illinois. The IACA shall use this forum for gathering vital
information and exchanging ideas for our new strategic plan. This year’s conference
will be held in the community of Galesburg, Illinois.
GUIDELINES DESIGN MODERNIZATION
Over the past several months the redesign of all twelve IACA program guidelines was
implemented and completed. The focus of the work was to update editorial and
structural changes that were needed. After an extensive amount of review and research,
an abundance of key information was used to determine improvements to streamline
the application process. The new guidelines design creates both enhanced clarity and
accessibility for the IACA’s grantees.
CHAIRMAN’S REPORT
The Chairman provided Board members with an update on recent IACA activities. She
thanked the Board for their excellent service in chairing the IACA panels throughout
the spring and summer, which enabled the review of over six hundred, FY19
applications. Chairman Madigan noted that due to a requirement that the IACA
implement and pay for newly mandated initiatives from the Governor’s office, a slight
increase was received in our appropriation for FY19.

 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S REPORT
The focus of the IACA continues to be on the recovery from the Illinois State budget
impasse. Retirements and attrition during the impasse reduced the Agency’s Full Time
Equivalent (FTE) to eight staff members. When a full budget was received, the priority
of the Agency was to fill all vacant positions to both ease the burden on the limited staff
and to ensure programs ran smoothly. By the end of the calendar year the IACA will
have returned the Governor’s approved FTE headcount to 14. Job responsibilities and
IACA procedures have also been examined and redistributed to ensure a balanced
workload throughout the staff.
In addition, and as part of the new Strategic Plan, the Agency has begun updating its
style guide and branding. This includes design changes to all of the guidelines,
webinars, instructional videos, constituent documents, and the website. This will allow
the IACA to present a cohesive look which establishes a strong brand voice that is easily
recognizable and can resonate within the state.
It was moved by Rhoda Pierce and seconded that the Illinois Arts Council Agency,
having completed its scheduled business, be adjourned. The motion carried.
Chairman Madigan adjourned the meeting at 10:22 A.M.
Respectfully submitted,

Rhoda A. Pierce, Vice Chairman/Secretary
