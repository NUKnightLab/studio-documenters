PROPOSED MISCELLANEOUS ITEM OF BUSINESS
Department:

Capital Planning and Policy

Summary: The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, as authorized by the Cook County Chief
Procurement Officer, plans to participate in the Cook County’s Job Order Contract (JOC) program to
complete the three (4) capital projects listed below. JOC is a quantity based procurement process that
allows facility owners to complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and construction projects with a
single, competitively bid contract. The JOC process generally involves first selecting a pool of potential
contractors through a competitive procurement process, and then identifying projects for such selected
contractors.
The County has already completed a JOC competitive procurement process, and it has created the pool of
general contractors to perform certain projects generally associated with maintenance, repairs,
replacement and routine work.
The JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group. The Gordian Group
maintains an area price book, which captures the prices for specific construction work items within this
region. JOC contractors bid against the prices included in the price book. The cost, therefore, of any
work performed by the contractor is a contractor markup from the price book. The Gordian Group would
receive 5% administrative fee from Cook County based on the total project cost of the work. The
Gordian Group will manage the JOC process and will verify that all proposals and work are compliant
with the terms and conditions outlined in the JOC contract with the County.
The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, proposes to assigns the projects listed below to the Gordian
Group to share with participating JOC contractors.
Project Descriptions
1. DOC Division IX Cell Replacement - This project will remove and replace the existing windows
overlooking the gymnasium with a detention grade energy efficient window.
2. DOC Division IV Plumbing Piping Replacement - This project will remove and replace the
existing shower units with an open shower area resulting in a more secure environment that is ADA
compliant.
3. DOC Division VI Plumbing Piping Replacement - This project will remove and replace the
existing shower units with an open shower area resulting in a more secure environment that is ADA
compliant.

was formerly owned by Cook County. On 7/10/2012, the County Board and the District Board amended
the IGA to provide for access, signage, and other actions to further the cooperative development of the
Preserve. The parties now have determined that the use of portions of the existing service road on the

the Preserve. The proposed Second Amendment to the IGA provides for the following actions:
1. Temporary Easement Agreement. The County and the District agree to execute an Easement
Agreement upon completion of surveys and legal description for conveyance of approximately 1.418 acres
for purposes of constructing, inspecting, maintaining, repairing, replacing and removing a multi-purpose
recreational trail.
2. Permanent Easement. The County and the District agree that this temporary easement will be
replaced with either a permanent easement or the conveyance of the fee upon a determination of the
desirability of conveying additional property for purposes of the Preserve and upon agreement of the
parties as to any appropriate compensation.
If the Board approves the proposed amendment, this approval shall include the following authorization:
For the President or the Real Estate Director to execute any and all documents and instrumentsand to take
such other action as may be necessary to effectuate the Temporary Easement Agreement.

Summary: Since deploying Palantir Technologies Government Software at the Sheriff’s Office
Intelligence Center, the system has significantly enhanced investigatory abilities, streamlined criminal
analysis, and helped generate critical intelligence products that support the crime fighting efforts of law
enforcement agencies across Cook County. Palantir’s engineers have successfully connected the
following data sources: I-Clear (the City of Chicago Arrest Database), Cook County Sheriff’s Police
Record Management System, the Jail Management System, Protocol (the Electronic Monitoring
database), Securus (the inmate phone system database), the Computerized Dispatch System for the
County (CAD), the Computerized Booking System for the County (CABS) and the Regional Gang
Intelligence Database (RIGID). These systems previously had no way to communicate with one another.
Palantir has provided the Sheriff’s Office Intelligence Center with the ability to generate high level
criminal intelligence products with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. Currently, there is a need to
increase the number of licenses and servers of Palantir, in order to support the collection and exchange of
data with other law enforcement agencies throughout the county
