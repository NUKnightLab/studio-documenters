Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items (continued)
C. Update on status of the selection of Internal Auditor
Michael Ayres, System Chief Financial Officer, and William Foley, System Chief Executive Officer,
provided an update on the status of the selection of Internal Auditor. The recruiter for that position, David
Gomez and Associates, has three candidates to present for interviews with the Committee.
The Committee determined that after the other items on the agenda were exhausted, the meeting should
recess and reconvene on Thursday, October 15, 2009 at 9:30 A.M., at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook
County, 1901 W. Harrison Street, in the fifth floor conference room, Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose of
continuing the discussion on the subject and conducting interviews with the three candidates for the position
of internal auditor.
D. Update on status of internal audits
Pat Kitchen and Christina Eng-Tran, of RSM McGladrey, presented an update on the status of the internal
audits (Attachment #2).
With regard to the information technology audit, Chairman Muñoz inquired whether their team had begun
the assessment. Mr. Kitchen responded that the initial kick-off meetings are being planned next month; the
on-site field work will likely begin in November. Director Greenspan inquired whether the focus would be
on data security, facilities security, or both. Mr. Kitchen responded that the focus will be on data security;
to the extent that there are physical security constraints around the information systems, they will
contemplate that as well.
Director O’Donnell inquired whether the payroll audit was only for John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook
County. Mr. Kitchen responded that initially they will roll the audit out for Stroger Hospital, but will then
look at the other facilities as the risks evolve.
E. Presentation of the web-based audit reporting tool (Auditor Assistant)
Ms. Eng-Tran provided a presentation on the web-based audit reporting tool, Auditor Assistant (Attachment
#3).
Chairman Muñoz clarified that this tool would be maintained by RSM McGladrey, so that those who have
access to it can be provided with the most up-to-date information to manage the internal audit functions and
to review the activities involved.
Mr. Kitchen stated that this tool provides the design, as well as the operating effect. He provided an
example in which a deficiency is identified. They would work with the individual responsible for that area
to identify mitigating controls from a design standpoint. As a result, a policy or procedure will be put in
place to address the issue. The next step, after the policy or procedure has been implemented, they can go
back to test the operating effectiveness of the control.
Director Greenspan asked, using this example, how long they would wait to go back and audit the utility of
the control. Mr. Kitchen stated that, depending on the area and the risk associated with it, they would
typically go back after six months to test the effectiveness. Based upon Mr. Kitchen’s response, Director
Greenspan asked if they should not expect to see change of the risk assessments for at least six months after
their field work begins. Mr. Kitchen responded affirmatively, adding that a six to twelve month time frame
would be a reasonable expectation to complete the audits, take corrective action, and reassess based on
subsequent testing.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items (continued)
F. Update from Deloitte & Touche on 2008 Audit
Tracy Guidry, of Deloitte & Touche, presented an update on the 2008 Audit. She stated that back in July,
the Committee was given an update and was presented draft financial statements and a draft management
letter for their review. At that time, Deloitte & Touche mentioned that they were still working on the
County’s audit. She stated that they are still working on the County’s audit. They did not receive the trial
balances from the County for their particular funds until towards the end of September. At this point, they
are working diligently to audit those numbers.
Chairman Muñoz clarified that with respect to the System, all information is up to date. Ms. Guidry
responded affirmatively; however, the only issues outstanding with regard to the System are for those areas
that inter-relate with the County (construction in progress, for example).
With regard to timelines, Ms. Guidry stated that they are attempting to finish the majority of their field work
by the end of October, possibly stretching into early November. After that point, they will work on
reporting. If everything goes according to plan, they hope to issue in mid-November.

General Note:
The Planning Phase consists of all planning activities that take place prior to on-site visit. Activities include, but are not limited to reviewing the applicable sections of
the 2009 CCHHS Risk Assessment, relevant committee meeting minutes in the CCHHS website and any background information we have on file; creating a process
understanding questionnaire, creating a document requests list; identifying risks we believe exist/applicable to the area; coordinating the timing for the audit and
have the interviews lined up; reviewing the documents/information provided by the auditee in response to the information request list, etc.
The Fieldwork Phase consists of conducting process walkthroughs, obtaining detailed understanding of the process/area, documenting our understanding, fine-tuning
risks and identifying controls in place to mitigate the risks identified, performing control gap analysis, developing and executing the audit program with specific focus
on testing key controls, documenting test results and reporting audit results to executive management and audit committee, etc.

Excerpt from the 2009 CCHHS Risk Assessment

Internal Audit Priorities
In order to address the higher risk activities and other areas of concern identified during the risk assessment process, the following internal audit activities should occur in the near future.
These audits are not in any specific order, but RSM McGladrey recommends that these projects be the first 10 internal audits completed by CCHHS:
 Grants audit with focus on the Hektoen Institute entity.
 Human Resources and Payroll audit for Stroger Hospital.
 Audit of Third Party Settlement Accounts.
 Revenue audit of Stroger Hospital with emphasis on Medicare/Medicaid revenue.
 IT audit of System Access and Security.
 IT audit of System Integration.
 Contracts Management audit for all of CCHHS.
 Procurement audit for all of CCHHS with focus on Inventory.
 Corporate Compliance audit with emphasis Medical Coding.
 Audit of monthly Financial Statement Preparation process.
These internal audits can be performed in any order that the Audit Committee deems proper, or can be changed at any time the Audit Committee receives additional information on risks
to CCHHS.

 Auditor Assistant ™ - Engagement planning
•
•

•

Understand your business and assess
the overall risk in order to generate an
annual audit plan.
Risk assessment based on an
analytical review of management
reporting and answers to
questionnaires.
The steps in this phase consist of the
following:
–

–

–
–

•

Page 20 of 26

Establish communication
protocols with management,
including engagement logistics
and information requests
Analyze risks in the business,
financial position and growth
expectations, strategies and key
objectives, and key controls
Assess and rate business risk and
control risk, resulting in a “heat
map”
Understand, the “tone at the top”
and the control environment,
monitoring and risk assessment
activities and the effect of entitywide controls on the execution of
transactional activity

Determine and document the structure
of the organization and who is
responsible for the management of
major risks in each area, as a
foundation for creating the audit
universe

 Auditor Assistant ™ - Project scoping
•
•

•

Project scoping is the first phase of
the methodology focused on the
individual auditable entities.
Annual audit plan lists the various
auditable entities within the
organization whose risk was deemed
to be at a level that requires an audit.
The major activities of project scoping
are:
–
–
–

–

•

Page 21 of 26

Determine the various subprocesses within the auditable
entity that contain the greatest risk
Develop an initial work plan for
addressing each major risk area
(listing key risks and controls)
Create a schedule and detailed
budget for the engagement, and
communicate a schedule of items
needed
Develop the project team to
perform the various tasks

The major deliverables are an initial
request letter, a detailed work plan or
audit program, and a planning memo
with estimated hours for each
business process.

 Auditor Assistant ™ - Assessing control adequacy
•

Determine if the design of the control
activities within the various business
functions is adequate to mitigate all
significant risks to the business.
–

–

–

–

–
–

Page 22 of 26

Document understanding of
individual business processes,
functions and departments
deemed in scope, based upon the
risk assessment
Develop documentation that
highlights prevalent risks, their
impact to the overall control
structure, and the control activities
in place to mitigate the risks
Identify and categorize controls
(key and secondary) to focus on
the key controls that will be tested
and relied upon in future phases.
Perform walkthroughs of the
various control activities to
validate they are performed as
described.
Develop recommendations for
remediation of any design gaps.
Populate the risk and control
matrices that describe the
inherent risks and key controls
and other information related to
the controls (these matrices will
allow for test programs to be
written appropriate controls).

 Auditor Assistant ™ - Assessing control effectiveness
•

•

The primary objective is to assess the
effectiveness of the control activities in
place to mitigate significant business
risks. Specific testing must be
performed to determine whether which
controls worked as intended, and what
control gaps exist.
The process steps for this phase of
the methodology are:
–
–
–
–
–
–

Page 23 of 26

Create test plans
Request transaction documents,
data or evidence from client
Execute test, preserving
appropriate documentation as
required.
Analyze exceptions and
determine findings and
conclusions
Complete Risk and Control matrix.
Prior to completing fieldwork,
discuss initial findings and
potential recommendations with
client staff.

 Auditor Assistant ™ - Reporting

•

The Final Report encompasses the
executive summary, observations
summary, detailed observations and
management responses. The
purpose of the Internal Audit Report is
twofold:
–

–

•

The Risk Control Matrix is a key
document that contains all of the
information the team has assembled
on risks and controls in each process,
as well as any changes in controls the
team is recommending including:
–
–
–
–
–
–
–

Page 24 of 26

Communicate Internal Audit
observations and
recommendations in a systematic
and timely manner.
Ensure that all issues are
resolved by auditable entity
management without significant
financial loss or embarrassment.

Primary risks the project team
identifies,
Key controls used by the client to
manage those risks,
Significance of the control (e.g.,
key or secondary)
Type of control (e.g., automated,
combined, or manual)
Process owner
Frequency of control (e.g., daily,
weekly, monthly, quarterly,
annual)
Assertions addressed by control
