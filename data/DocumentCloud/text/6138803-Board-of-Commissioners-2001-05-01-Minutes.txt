allowance only funds the establishment of shelled space in the facility. The additional funding
will provide for the furnishing and installing of a 2000 kw generator, electrical substations and
all conduit and cabling necessary to supply normal and emergency power to the new data
center which is being relocated from the Hektoen Building to the second floor of the new
hospital. This work must be performed by the current building contractor in order to be
compatible with all other electrical and building systems installed in the new facility.

The funding required will be allocated from the new hospital technology budget.

SUBJECT: SINGLE AUDIT REPORT FOR YEAR ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 1999
Attached is a copy of Cook County's Single Audit Report for year ending November 30,
1999, as prepared by Washington, Pittman & McKeever, LLC. I respectfully request that
the report be referred to the Audit Committee for further discussion.
Referred to the Audit Committee on November 2, 2000.

seconded by Vice Chairman Goslin. The motion carried.

The Chairman then proceeded to Item No. 4.

239538

BUREAU OF FINANCE, by Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer. Transmitting a
Communication dated, October 3, 2000:
SUBJECT: COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT (CAFR) FOR FY
1999
Enclosed is a copy of Cook County's Fiscal Year 1999 Comprehensive Annual Financial
Report (CAFR) prepared by Arthur Andersen LLP. 1 am hereby requesting the
opportunity to discuss this report with the Finanee Audit Committee of the Board of
Commissioners.
Also, included for your information, is an executive summary of the County's revenues,
expenditures and fund balances as per the figures obtained from the FY99 CAFR.
Referred to the Audit Committee on November 2, 2000.

In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on where the Forest Preserve District's financial data is
located in the report, Laura Burman stated that the District's financial information is presented on page
60, under a separate special revenue fund tab, in the middle column referenced as "Forest Preserve
District-General."
Noting his concern regarding the District's past erroneous budget figures and the actual deficit figures
recently disclosed to the Board, Commissioner Hansen asked if the report's financial information
concerning the District was accurate. Laura Burman stated that the information presented on page 49

1735

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 1, 2001

does include the District's fiscal year 1998 financial statements, but differs slightly from the recently
disclosed figures due to the fact that the District's fiscal year differs from the County's fiscal year. She
noted the figures in the County's CAFR for the year ended November 30, 1999 do not include the
District's fiscal year 1999 financial statements.
Chairman Daley called on Gary Fink of Arthur Andersen to explain the financial information presented in
the report relating to the Forest Preserve District.
Gary Fink stated that the report (or CAFR) is based on financial statements for the County's fiscal year
ended November 30, 1999 (December 1, 1998 to November 30, 1999) and includes the Forest Preserve
District's audited financial statements, supplied to Arthur Andersen, for the year ended December 31,
1998 (January 1, 1998 to December 31, 1998) as disclosed in the footnotes on page 49 of the report. He
stated since the District's 1998 fiscal year end falls within the 1999 fiscal year of the County, the audit
covers the 1999 County combined financial statements, which includes 1998 financial statements for the
Forest Preserve District.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding how the District's information is shown in the
table on page 60, Gary Fink stated the general fund of the District, as well as the special revenue funds,
are shown in the County's combined financial statement. The capital project funds of the District, as well
as the debt service funds, are presented and combined (based on GASB's concept of blending) with the
County's capital projects in total.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page 49 regarding what funds of the District are
included in the presented material under item 12, Gary Fink stated that the District's general fund
accumulated deficit for the year ended December 31, 1998 is shown as $10.2 million; and, the capital
projects fund accumulated deficit for the same period is shown as $800 thousand. Mr. Fink noted the
District's deficit for the year ended December 31, 1999 will be disclosed in the County's CAFR for the
year ended November 30, 2000.
In response to Commissioner Lechowicz's question regarding a target date for the Forest Preserve
District's FY2000 audit, Mr. Fink stated he did not know since Arthur Andersen was not involved in that
audit.
On the question, Chairman Daley responded that Pandolfi, Topolski and Weiss & Co. was doing the audit
and stated that the target completion date is June, 2001.

Commissioner Hansen moved to receive and file Item No. 4 (Comm. No. 239538), seconded by Vice
Chairman Goslin. The motion carried.
The Chairman then proceeded to Item No. 5.

BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVICES, by Ruth M. Rothstein, Chief, transmitting a
Communication, dated December 13, 2000.
This letter is to formally request that the Bureau of Health Services Audited Financial
Statements, related Management Letter and request for Bad Debt write-off for fiscal year
1999 be forwarded to the Audit Committee of the Board of Commissioners for
discussion.

Referred to the Audit Committee on January 4, 2001.

1736

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 1, 2001

In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page 1 regarding why a past recommendation to
increase the $250 purchasing limit for competitive bids had not been presented to the Board as of yet,
Chairman Daley noted that Pat Shymanski is working on the proposal and should be submitting it to the
Board for consideration in the near future.

"

In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page 2 regarding why the past recommendation to
complete the development of a corporate compliance program had not been done, Alvin Holley stated that
David Carvalho, Special Counsel to the Bureau of Health Services, is working on the recommendation.
In response to Commissioner Lechowicz's question regarding the penalties for not having a corporate
compliance program in place, Alvin Holley stated without a compliance program in place penalties can
run from $25 to $50 thousand dollars for each violation.
Commissioner Lechowicz suggested the Chairman send a letter to David Carvalho requesting a status
report and a target date for implementation of the Bureau of Health Services' corporate compliance
program.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page 4 regarding a target date for correcting errors on
Medicare claims and eligibility records, Alvin Holley stated that the Bureau has notified the Medicare
program fiscal intermediary, AdminaStar, of the errors and has requested they correct their software. Mr.
Holley stated the Bureau currently is working with the intermediary to correct errors on a claim by claim
basis, but has set a 90-day target date for AdminaStar to resolve their software problem.
Mr. Holley suggested that the Bureau might have to seek legal action if AdminaStar has not corrected the
problem by the 90-day target date. Mr. Holley stated that these errors should not occur and did not in the
past when BlueCross/BlueShield was the Medicare program's fiscal intermediary.
Commissioner Lechowicz requested further infonnation on who AdminaStar is and what duties they
perform for the Medicare program relating to the Bureau's claim process.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page 5 regarding how the depreciation expense was
derived, Alvin Holley stated that the $23.2 million depreciation expense relates to the total amount of
current year in use assets and is calculated using the historical costs of the assets depreciated over an
estimated useful life period. He noted buildings (property) are being depreciated over a forty year period
using historical costs (noted as $237,824,940) and building improvements (equipment) are being
depreciated over a ten to twenty year period (noted as $143,172,764), or a total value or accumulated
depreciation of $385,410,554.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the relationship between the depreciation
expense and the accumulated depreciation, Alvin Holley stated that there is not a direct relationship since
the depreciation expense is the total amount based on the current year in use assets depreciated over an
estimated useful life and the accumulated depreciation is the total value of all assets depreciated for prior
years.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page 19 regarding what caused the percentage
difference in the County pension funded ratio from 1996 to 1998 and what the Unfunded Actuarial
Accrued Liability (UAAL) percentages mean, Alvin Holley stated he would get an explanation of the
information from the County Pension Board and submit their response to the Chairman for the members
review, since the information in the report is put together by the County Pension Board, not the Bureau.

1737

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 1, 2001
Chairman Daley stated in the future when information is contained in a report but not provided by the
Auditor, a footnote should be provided on where and whom the information came from. On the same
subject, Commissioner Lechowicz suggested that two items should also be reflected in future reports
covering pension plan information: 1) an explanation of any change in the county pension provisions
authorized by the General Assembly, including the timeframe and the number of employees who took
advantage of the change; and 2) an explanation of how these factors impacted the amount of money in the
fund.
Commissioner Butler commented that the percentage difference shown on page 19 of the report may
reflect the impact of the County's 1997 early retirement incentive. He also suggested that the name of the
auditing firm or individual who prepares information contained in any report be provided in the future.

Commissioner Hansen moved to receive and file Item No. 5 (Comm. No. 240683), seconded by
Commissioner Lechowicz. The motion carried.
The Chairman then proceeded to Item No. 6.

BUREAU OF FINANCE, by Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer. Transmitting a
Communication, dated March 19, 2001, from Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer,
Bureau of Finance.
Subject:

Cook County Illinois-Memorandum on Internal Control Structure for
Fiscal Year Ending November 30, 1999.

Submitting a copy of the County's "Memorandum on Internal Control" prepared by
Arthur Andersen for the period ending November 30, 1999. I am hereby requesting that
this item be referred to the Audit Committee of the Board of Commissioners for further
discussion.

Referred to the Audit Committee on March 20, 2001.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page 17, No. 2, regarding an explanation of the
Veterans' Assistance Commission's management response, John Houlihan stated that under the Military
Veterans Assistance Act (330 ILCS 45) the Commission is authorized to operate in Cook County and is
permitted to receive funding assistance from the County Board. However, he stated under the statute the
Superintendent and its employees are technically not considered county employees but rather are
employees of the Veterans' Assistance Commission. Mr. Houlihan explained that the statute does permit
the county to budget and fund the Commission's operations and give its employees any benefits it agrees
to provide. Currently, Mr. Houlihan stated the Cook County Board treats the Commission's employees
like other county employees and provides them with the same benefits.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page 20 regarding the status of fixing system
malfunctions and the target date for completion, Linda Gillie Batchelor stated that the Recorder's Office is
currently finalizing the review of an upgrade assessment report from Unisys (the system vendor) and
plans on sending the report by the end of next week to the Bureau of Information Technology and
Automation for their review and recommendations.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding if the problem can be resolved in the near
future or is it an inoperable system issue, Cathy Maras O'Leary stated that the current system was not
configured adequately and the requirements were not defined thoroughly enough to provide the office
with the hardware and software needed to integrate its Accounting and Cashiering systems. She noted
she had not reviewed the report from Unisys, but believed an RFP on the future needs of the Recorder's
office may need to go out to resolve the problem.

1738

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY I, 2001

In response to Commissioner Hansen's inquiry for further history on the system, its problems and the
office's future needs, Darlena Williams-Burnett stated that the RFP went out in 1998 and three vendors
responded. Unisys won the bid. She stated that part of the problem was with the RFP, which by the time
it came back for bid and the initial installation of the system was delivered, the hardware and software
were already outdated. She explained that from the onset the office has not been confident with the
integrity of system and noted that the Board was informed by the Recorder's office of the problems in
integrating the cashiering data to the accounting system, along with the various temporary solutions that
were attempted.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding when the review will go to the Bureau of
Information Technology and Automation, Ms. Williams-Burnett stated that the Recorder's office expects
to get the Unisys report to Cathy Maras O'Leary within the week for her committee's review and will
continue to work with the Bureau on their recommendations. She concluded that the Recorder's office
currently does not wish to upgrade the Unisys system, since it has not worked up to this point, and hope
to put out an RFP covering the committee's recommendation that would allow the office to move to a
Windows based system environment with the ability to interface the cashiering and accounting systems.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding if the county has a contract performance bond on
the supplier, Pat Driscoll stated that no such bond is required on purchasing contracts that do not involve
construction, but could in the future be written into the purchasing specifications and vendors contract.
Chairman Daley asked when the Recorder plans to submit a plan and RFP to the Board, Ms. WilliamsBumett stated the office first needs the requirements and recommendations from Cathy Maras O'Leary,
but would like to get this to the Board as soon as possible.
Cathy Maras O'Leary stated she would start writing the RFP on the hardware and software together, since
the requirements of the Recorder's Office have not changed drastically and would work with Darlena
Williams-Burnett and the State's Attorney's Office to modify and incorporate any additional
recommendations.
In response to Commissioner Lechowicz's question on whether or not the County's RFPs include a
provision for errors and omissions, Patrick Driscoll stated he would look into this and get back to the
committee with a recommendation on language that could be included similar to a warranty clause
provision.
Commissioner Butler asked if Unisys's proposal to upgrade the system has been scrapped by the
Recorder's Office, since an RFP is being drafted. Darlena Williams-Burnett responded that the current
vendor continues to evaluate the problems with their system and has made recommendations that are
being reviewed. However, she stated since the office has no faith in the integrity of the information in the
current system it favors the Board's approval of an RFP for a new system.

Commissioner Hansen moved to receive and file Item No. 6 (Comm. No. 242458), seconded by
Commissioner Lechowicz. The motion carried.
The Chairman then proceeded to Item No. 7.

Dantino stated that the fee ordinance was submitted to the Board for approval, but was withdrawn and is
currently under review.

Commissioner Hansen made the observation that the figure on taxes due to the County in redevelopment
districts has grown from $21,816,159.12 in 1997 to $33,356,675.38 in 1999 and noted this should be
watched since these funds represent a loss to the county's operating fund.

ORDINANCE

Transmitting a Communication, dated April 13, 2001 from
JOHN W. DAVIS, Director, Real Estate Management Division
requesting authorization to have certain property declared as "excess" by the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County and to convey the property by Quit Claim Deed to the Village of Riverside for use as a
public park. The property is located in the Village of Riverside in the vicinity of Harlem Avenue, West of
Illinois 43 and South of 26th Street. The Highway Department has indicated that this property is no
longer necessary for highway purposes, nor does it appear to be required for any other County use. The
Highway Department feels that the public park as proposed by the Village of Riverside is an appropriate
use of the property.
Therefore, the undersigned respectfully requests that the Cook County Board of Commissioners declare
the property to be "excess" and authorized the conveyance of the property by approval of the following
Ordinance. The property is legally described in the Quit Claim Deed submitted to the Ordinance.
