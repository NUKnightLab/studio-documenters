Responses to BZA Questions

 

FY 2018-19 Board of Zoning Appeals Questions

1. How will the legalization of marijuana affect the Board of Zoning?s capacity and

appeals process?

Until I see at least a draft of the proposed ordinance for the legalization of marijuana
I can only speculate that we will be able to handle the process. At the peak of
Medical Marijuana the BZA sta?? was three. We currently have staff of four and
expect to hire an additional Inspector this spring or summer.

Please provide an organizational breakdown of the contractual and full time staff
allocated to the BZA.

Director Appointed through 2024, Administrative Assistant full time, Inspector 
Full time (union) and Office Assistant TASS.

Does the Board of Zoning have adequate staffing to handle the workload that comes
before 

We currently have a staff of four and expect to hire an additional Inspector this
spring or summer. We will have adequate staffing to handle the workload once we
complete these hiring process.

Responses to Budget: Board of Zoning Appeals FY 2020

 

(851?5) There is a slight decrease in revenues in FY 2020 compared to the previous fiscal
year. What is the cause for this decrease?

The decrease in Salaries and Wages is due primarily to the transfer of funding for one (1)
Administrative Special Services Sta? ll position to Miscellaneous Professional Services and
the re-allocation of a second Administrative Special Services Sta?? II position to an Office
Assistant position.

What were the actual revenues amounts from fiscal year 2019?

The actual revenue amount from FY 2019 are $67,763.36 as of April 2019, with a projected
amount of 104,166.70 for the FY.

(351?10) It appears that there is a decrease of 1 FTE in FY2020. What position will this affect
and will this allow the Board to still function effectively?

BZA is not losing a position. Funding for one (1) Administrative Special Stajj? Services ll
position was transferred from Salaries/Benefits to Miscellaneous Professional Services.
How many zoning inspectors has the Board employed in previous years? What number of
inspectors would be Optimal?

Since 2012 the BZA has had one (1) zoning inspector. The optimal number of inspectors
would be two (2). I am currently working with Human Resources to hire a second inspector.

 

5. How many cases are the Board hearing each year?

6. There is some confusion on whether or not there is an ability to come before the Board of
Zoning Appeals to seek waiver of zoning restrictions for Marihuana related businesses.
Please explain the Board?s ability to hear and act upon such cases. Is it true the BZA should
only be hearing old cases, or things remanded from court?

I refer to the zoning ordinance to clarify what the ability of the BZA is related to seeking

waivers.

Sec. 61 -3-355. Permitted districts for medical marihuana facilities; Conditional Uses;
Restrictions

Medical marihuana facilities may be permitted on a conditional basis in the following
zoning districts in accordance with this Article, subject to the provisions of this Division
and any other applicable provisions of this Code, and all applicable state of Michigan

(1) Medical marihuana grower facilities may be permitted on a conditional basis zoning districts;

(2) Medical marihuana processor facilities may be permitted on a conditional basis zoning districts,-

(3) Medical marihuana provisioning center facilities may be permitted on a conditional
basis in the 82, B4, BS, 36, M1, M2, M3, M4, and SDZ zoning districts but must not be
permitted in any zoning district if the citywide total number of legally established
provisioning center facilities and medical marihuana caregiver centers for which a
building permit or certificate of compliance has been issued is equal to or greater than
seventy-five 

Cc:

 

(4) Medical marihuana safety compliance facilities may be permitted on a conditional
basis and SDZ zoning districts;

(5) Medical marihuana secure transporter facilities may be permitted on a conditional

A medical marihuana caregiver center or medical marihuana provisioning

(1) within a drug-free zone, as defined in Sec. 61-3-353 of this Code; or

(2) within a Gateway Radial Thoroughfare overlay area or Traditional
Main Street overlay area, as provided in ARTICLE XLDIVISION 14 of this
Chapter; or

(3) on a zoning lot that is located less than:

(A) One thousand (1,000) radial feet from any zoning lot occupied by any religious institution
identified as exempt by the City Assessor; and

(B) One thousand (1,000) radial feet from any zoning lot with an unexpired conditional land use
approval, building permit, or certificate of occupancy for a medical marihuana caregiver center
or medical marihuana provisioning center facility; and

(C) One thousand (1,000) radial feet from any zoning lot occupied by a Controlled Use.

A medical marihuana grower facility, medical marihuana processor facility, or
medical marihuana secure transporter facility must not be located in a drug-free zone, as
defined in Sec. 61-3-353 of this Code, or within a Traditional Main Street overlay area, as
provided in ARTICLE Xl. DIVISION 14 of this Chapter.

Neither the Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department, nor the
Board of Zoning Appeals is authorized to waiver or modify the locational specifications
set forth in subsections of this section. Applications that are not consistent with
the locational specifications of subsections and of this section,
which may be confirmed by the City Engineer, shall be considered ineligible for further
processing and shall be denied.

Responses to FY 2019-2020 BZA Budget Questions

 

Please describe the regular training efforts for board members and staff. How often is
training provided? What types of training opportunities are provided? How much is available in
the proposed FY 2019-2020 budget for training?

Since 2016 the BZA has had quarterly trainings, January, April, July, and October. February 13,
2018 DD Director presents to the BZA on city development updates; February 27, 2019 Kimani
Jeffries, presents to the BZA on ordinance and December 11, 2019 Ethics presentation
presented by Board of Ethics. 52500 is budgeted for Training for FY 2019-2020.

Please describe the general policy as it relates to non~conforming uses. How does the BZA
work to ensure the removal of non-conforming uses overtime consistent with the stated goals
of the Detroit Zoning Ordinance?

Sec. 61-2-52. Powers and duties; nonconformities.

The Board shall hear and decide requests which involve nonconforming uses, nonconforming
structures, nonconforming lots and other nonconformities that came into existence legally, but
do not comply with one (1 or more requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.

Sec. 61 -15-2. Purpose and scope of regulations.

It is the general policy of the City of Detroit that nonconforming uses be eliminated over time. It
remains the general policy of the City to allow uses, structures, and lots that came into existence
legally?in conformance with then-applicable requirements?to continue to exist and be put to
productive use, but to bring as many aspects of such situations into compliance with existing
regulations as is reasonably possible.

Sec. 61 -15-7. Board of Zoning Appeals.

The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the authority to hold hearings and render decisions with
respect to nonconforming uses, buildings, and structures.

Pursuant to MCL 125.3406l2), a person is not eligible to apply for a decision with respect to
nonconforming uses, buildings, and structures if the person is delinquent in paying a civil fine,
costs, or a justice system assessment imposed by an administrative hearings bureau established
pursuant to section 4q of the Home Rule City Act, 1909 PA 279, MCL 117.4q. This ineligibility
does not apply to an applicant for a zoning authorization if the applicant became the owner of
the property by foreclosure or by taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure as provided in MCL

Cc:

 

Further, this ineligibility does not apply if the zoning authorization will correct, in
whole or in part, the blight violation that was the subject of the delinquent payment.

Does the BZA consider the neighborhood framework plans that have been developed for various
neighborhoods as part of its review for variance request? If so, how does the BZA factor those
planning priorities into its review to ensure that future development activity is consistent with
the vision for the neighborhood?

Sec. 61 -4-74. Action by the Board of Zoning Appeals.

The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not act without consideration of any report or
recommendation that is submitted by the Planning and Development Department as specified in
Sec. 61 -2-31 (1) of this Code or by any advisory review committee as provided for in ARTICLE II,
DIVISION 7 of this Chapter.
