Representatives from The Office of the Inspector General reported on findings and
recommendations of the PBC Construction Change Order Audit issued on June 12, 2018.

recommendations and implemented efficiencies.

million was included in net investment in capital assets and $19.9 million was restricted

project revenue that directly impact the Commission’s administrative fee.
