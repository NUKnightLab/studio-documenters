For Council?s review, the attached schedules present the gaming tax revenue activity through
June 2019 and prior ?scal years.

Through the twelfth month of the ?scal year the casinos reported a combined gross gaming
receipts increase of 2.65% compared to the prior ?scal year. Broken out by casino, gross
receipts are up by 3.66%, Motor City?s are up by 1.13% and Greektown?s are up by 3.01%,
compared with the prior ?scal year.

In the twelfth month of the ?scal year, the City collected $13.98 million in gaming tax revenue,
which was 1.35% lower than June 2018, as re?ected in Chart 1. Chart 2 Detroit

Gaming Tax Collections? through a twelve-month moving average trend line shows an increase
of 2.68% since last June among the combined casino tax revenues. There is a surplus of $3.036
million compared to budget for the ?scal year for a gaming revenue total of $183.815 million, a
2.70% increase over last year.

Adjusted gross casino gaming receipts were reported at $117.5 million for the month of June
2019 as shown in Chart 1A. This represented a 1.35% drop compared with June 2018. Chart 2A
Detroit Gaming Receipts? through a twelve-month moving average trend line shows
growth of 2.62% among the combined casino receipts which totaled $1.45 billion for the ?scal

year.

MGM and Motor City are each paying 12.9% of adjusted gross gaming receipts to the City,
while Greektown Casino is paying 11.9% of adjusted gross gaming receipts and is broken out as
follows. By state law, all casinos are now paying 10.9% of adjusted gross gaming receipts to the
City as wagering tax. The casinos also have an additional 1% payment because of the 2002
amended development agreement with the City. Additionally, if a casino reaches $400 million in
adjusted gross gaming receipts in a calendar year, like MGM and Motor City, then an additional
1% is paid to the City per the amended development agreement of 2002.

There is not a complete one-to-one relationship between the adjusted gross receipts and the tax
revenue collection increases when comparing prior years, due to two factors. First, there is the
fact that MGM and Motor City casinos began paying the City 1% less due to the permanent
casinos opening on October 3 and November 29 of 2007. This reduction to the City is part of
state Public Act 306 of 2004, when the legislature amended Public Act 69 of 1997, which was
the original casino gaming legislation. PA. 306 increased the wagering tax by 6% of which 2%
went to the City of Detroit. PA. 306 also allowed that when the permanent casino had been
certi?ed by the state gaming board as having operated for 30 consecutive days and once the City
determined the project was complete, 5% of the 6% additional wagering tax would be
eliminated, with the remaining 1% allocated to the City where the casino is being operated.
Greektown continued to pay the 6% additional wagering tax 4% to the state, 2% to the City 
until its permanent status was agreed to by the Administration and approved by the State Gaming
Commission, which occurred on March 9, 2010.

Second, the amended development agreement of August 2002 between the City and the casinos,
which is separate from the state law, has all casinos, beginning in January 2006, paying an
additional 1% over the state law, plus another 1% when the casino reaches $400 million in
adjusted gross gaming receipts in a calendar year. For the thirteenth year, MGM and Motor City
each did exceed $400 million in the calendar year and increased gaming tax collections by
$11.09 million between August and December. MGM reached $400 million in August, a month
earlier than prior years, and Motor City reached $400 million in October similar to last year.
additional 1% totaled $6.19 million and Motor City?s totaled $4.89 million.
