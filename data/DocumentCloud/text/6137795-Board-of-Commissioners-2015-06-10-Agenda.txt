of Cook County which is used by Cook County government officials, departments and agencies to
convey, and does convey, the official imprimatur of the Cook County government; and
WHEREAS, when members of the public see the County Seal on any communication or object, they are
likely to believe, and do reasonably believe, that the person or entity displaying the County Seal is a
Cook County government official, department or agency, and that the communication or object has been
approved by a Cook County government official, department or agency; and thus the display of the
County Seal communicates official approval by Cook County government and an association with
official Cook County government business; and
WHEREAS, from time to time, private persons or entities have displayed the County Seal on various
communications and objects with the intent and/or the effect of misleading and confusing members of

WHEREAS, examples of potential fraudulent misuse of the County Seal include, but are not limited to,
the use of the County Seal on letters from non-government entities offering property tax appeal

employees; and
WHEREAS, such fraudulent use of the County Seal puts the most vulnerable members of the public at
financial and physical risk and creates a public safety danger;

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING CALLING UPON THE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT
TO COMMUNICATE AND COORDINATE WITH THE COOK COUNTY SHERIFF’S POLICE
TO ADDRESS ISSUES RELATED TO THE PRACTICE OF “STOP AND FRISK,” BY
REVIEWING THE POLICIES OF THE SHERIFF RELATED TO MOTOR VEHICLE STOPS,
SEARCHES AND SEIZURES, SUPERVISORY RANK AND RESPONSIBILITY, AND
DETENTIONS
WHEREAS, despite the fact that the nation’s attention has turned to police practices because of high
profile killings, concerns about policing extend beyond the use of force and into the everyday
interactions of police with community members; and,
WHEREAS, in black and Latino communities, these everyday interactions are often a “Stop and Frisk”;
and,
WHEREAS, under the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), officers are
allowed to stop you if the officer has reasonable suspicion that you have been, are, or are about to be
engaged in criminal activity. Once you are stopped, if an officer has reasonable suspicion that you are
dangerous and have a weapon, the officer can frisk you, including ordering you to put your hands on a
wall or car, and running his or her hands over your body; and,
WHEREAS, a report on “Stop and Frisk” police practices by the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) of Illinois, published this past Spring, contains troubling signs that the Chicago Police
Department has a current practice of unlawfully using stop and frisk; and,
WHEREAS, “Stop and Frisk” is disproportionately concentrated in the black community. Last month’s
ACLU Report found that black Chicagoans were subjected to 72% of all stops, though they constitute
just 32% of the city’s population; and,
WHEREAS, the ACLU of Illinois, comparing stops to population, found that Chicagoans were stopped
more than four times as often as New Yorkers at the height of New York City’s stop and frisk practice;
and,
WHEREAS, the abuse of stop and frisk is a violation of individual rights, but it also poisons police and
community relations and directly impacts the bottom line for Cook County taxpayers by leading to
arrests that would not have otherwise occurred, thereby burdening Cook County Courts and the Cook
County Jail; and,
WHEREAS, the Cook County Sheriff operates pursuant to four specific policies that govern the
procedures of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police related to “stop and frisk,” namely the following: Section
500 of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police Supplemental Manual dealing with Motor Vehicle Stops;
Section 312 of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police Policy Manual dealing with Searches and Seizures;
Section 201 of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police Policy Manual on Supervisory Rank and
Responsibilities; and Section 421 of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police Policy Manual on Detentions; and,

BOARD AGENDA

June 10, 2015

WHEREAS, all units of county and local government stand to benefit by exchanging information
regarding best practices;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Cook County President and the Board of
Commissioners that the Chicago Police Department be urged to review the above-referenced policies of
the Cook County Sheriff’s Police, and meet with the Chief of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police to
discuss the manner in which these policies are implemented and whether these policies might be directly
transferable to the work of the Chicago Police Department, particularly regarding “Stop and Frisk.”

by the State of Illinois. Such an agreement was reached in November 2014. However, since the State
will not begin collection until July 2015, at the earliest, and then will not collect on any bills issued prior
to that date, it is necessary to amend the agreement with ELS to allow for them to provide collection
services for all amounts that will not be collected by the State.
Since the beginning of this fiscal year, there are 250 sales agent locations participating and we have
collected approximately $446,000.
This Agreement has been reviewed and approved as to form by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s
Office.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION TO ADD MEMBERS TO THE COOK COUNTY HOME CONSORTIUM
WHEREAS, the County of Cook (the County) is an entitlement community pursuant to the regulations
of the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) at 24 CFR Part 92 and the Community
Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) at 24 CFR Part 570, which entitles the County to receive an
annual allocation of CDBG and HOME grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD); and
WHEREAS, the amount of HOME funds that the County receives pursuant to entitlement status is
determined by a HUD formula that takes into consideration the populations of the municipalities within
its jurisdiction; and
WHEREAS, the City of Des Plaines and the Village of Arlington Heights (the Electing Municipalities)
within the County that receive Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds directly from HUD
can elect to join the County’s HOME Consortium (the Consortium), which would allow HUD to take
into account the populations of these municipalities when calculating the County’s annual HOME funds
entitlement grant, thus increasing the County’s annual allocation; and
WHEREAS, the Electing Municipalities are choosing to join the Consortium, as signified by resolution
of their municipal boards; and

Page 37 of 68

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

June 10, 2015

WHEREAS, each Electing Municipality must conform to the Consortium Program Year, which runs
October 1 through September 30 in accordance with HUD rules; and
WHEREAS, as the Electing Municipalities move to the Consortium Program Year they may experience
a gap in their administrative funding for the few months after their old program year expires and before
the Consortium Program Year begins. (i.e., if their current program year ends on June 30 there is a three
month gap before the new program year starts on October 1); and
WHEREAS, the County wants to maximize its federal allocation of HOME Funds by including the
Electing Municipalities in the Consortium. The County’s HOME Investment Partnerships Program could
see up to a $163,000 increase over two years by adding the populations of the Electing Municipalities
into the formula for calculating the grant amount.; and
WHEREAS, to facilitate the addition of the Electing Municipalities to the Consortium, the County will
provide the financing for the loss in administrative funding and program funding that is needed to align
the program years in each Electing Municipality; and
WHEREAS, HUD requires that the Cook County Board of Commissioners act by resolution to add the
new entitlement communities into the HOME Consortium; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, the President and the Board of Commissioners of the
County of Cook, Illinois:
Section 1: That the County will set aside a fund of no more than $56,610 in non-federal dollars to be
used to fund the administrative costs incurred by the Electing Municipalities for periods not funded,
within a three year period, due to the alignment of the program years of the Electing Municipalities with
the Consortium Program Year in accordance with HUD requirements.
Section 2: That the County be and is hereby authorized to enter into an Addendum to the HOME
Investment Partnerships Program Consortium Agreement for Federal Fiscal Years 2016, and 2017 to add
the Electing Municipalities and that the President, Bureau Chief of Economic Development or the
County Clerk are hereby authorized to execute said HOME Investment Partnerships Program Consortium
Agreement Addendums, Memorandums of Understanding, and any additional documents necessary to
further the aforementioned initiative, and any modifications thereto.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Resolution shall be in full force and effect from and after its
passage and approval as provided by law.

PROPOSED GRANT AWARD
Department: Circuit Court of Cook County, Office of the Chief Judge
Grantee: Circuit Court of Cook County
Grantor: John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation
Request: Authorization to accept grant
Purpose: This Safety+Justice Challenge Program Grant will fund the development of a comprehensive
plan to examine how the Cook County Department of Corrections is being used and to develop and
implement strategies to reduce the incarceration of low-level, nonviolent persons awaiting trial without
compromising public safety.
Grant Amount: $150,000.00
Grant Period: 5/1/2015 - 12/31/2015
Fiscal Impact: None
Accounts: N/A
Concurrences:
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any.
Summary: Cook County was one of 20 jurisdictions out of nearly 200 applicants from 45 states
selected by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation to receive a $150,000 Safety+Justice
Challenge Program Grant to reduce the number of low level, nonviolent persons incarcerated in the Cook
County Department of Corrections and to increase the number of persons who can safely be released
while awaiting trial. The award marks the first time that all Cook County criminal justice stakeholders
have joined forces to obtain funding to implement system-wide change that will enhance access to
justice.
The awarding of the grant also builds onto recent collaborative efforts by the Chief Judge, the State’s
Attorney, the Public Defender, the Sheriff, the Circuit Court Clerk, and the Cook County Board President
that have helped to reduce the jail population to its lowest point since 1991, while maintaining public
safety. These include increased use of electronic monitoring and pretrial supervision, deferral from
prosecution programs, and the development of specialty courts that offer alternatives to incarceration.
The stakeholders recognize that significant challenges remain. These include the disproportionate
incarceration of people of color; recent increases in length of stay in the Cook County Department of
Corrections; and continued high levels of parole and probation violations and new arrests. The
stakeholders will use this planning grant to identify the key data and decision points that influence these
outcomes, and develop collaborative responses.
