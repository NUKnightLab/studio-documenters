He then provided a brief overview of the information contained in the report and
proceeded with the details.
Runway Use Report

 FINAL Minutes of the April 23, 2015, Meeting of the
Midway Noise Compatibility Commission
The B737, used almost exclusively by Southwest, was the most used aircraft with
an average of 402 operations per day. General Aviation followed with 124
operations per day, 5 of which were helicopters.
Ms. Pinion asked if the type of plane Porter is using could affect the noise level.
Mr. Jackson responded that they are turboprop planes and would not have a
significant impact. He also stated that the Fly Quiet letter was sent to all of the
airlines listed.
Permanent Noise Monitor Locations
The report indicates the addresses of the 12 noise monitor locations near the
airport as reflected in relation to the Midway 2018 Noise Contour. The report
shows the results for January 2015 through March 2015 with quarterly
breakdowns and a 12 month rolling average. The 1st quarter 2015 results are
compared to those of the 1st quarter of 2014.
At the request of the Commission, this report now indicates the ward boundaries.
Chairman Baliga asked what accounts for the significant increase in noise level
to 71.9 at the Site 304 location. Mr. Jackson responded that two contributing
factors may be the increase in departures to the southwest on 22L/22R and also
the 31C departures turning down south of the airport. Mr. Jackson stated that
further investigation will be needed. He will report the results back to the
Commission.
Noise Hotline Report
There were 2,277 total complaints for the 1st quarter. Of the 1,509 from Chicago,
990 came from one address. 314 of the 320 complaints from Burbank also came
from a single address. 70 of the total complaints were nighttime. The report
gives a breakdown from 18 communities and also includes a breakdown by
Chicago neighborhoods.
Chairman Baliga commented that the high volume of complaints coming in from
single addresses distorts the accuracy of the report. Mr. Frame stated that he
would take that issue under advisement and report back to the Commission.
Mr. Jackson discussed the following additional handouts.
B. Typical Aircraft Noise Event
The aircraft represented is the most common, which is the B737-700, arriving on
31C which is the most used runway. The report indicates what happens as one
plane flies over 2 noise monitors, Sites 308 and 303. The graphic indicates the
times of the peak noise events, the noise levels, and the altitude at which the
plane is flying at the time. As the altitude decreases there is an increase in
noise.

Midway Noise Compatibility Commission
C. Midway Aircraft Noise Comparison (2014 operations)
Information is ranked by the average daily operations per day which is the most
used aircraft, and by the footprint area which is ranked by the loudest to the
quietest aircraft. The blue noise contour represents the commercial aircraft
activity and the orange represents the general aviation activity. The exhibit
indicates the noise level at various distances from the airport. The integrated
noise model is created by the FAA.
The most used aircraft is the B737-700 with 314.5 operations per day which is
46.3% of total aircraft operations at Midway. The noise footprint/impact area is
23.2 square miles at the peak point.
This is followed by the B737-800 which comprises 84.9 operations per day which
is 12.5% of the total but has the greater noise footprint at 28.8 square miles. The
B737’s comprise the bulk of the aircraft at Midway and the majority flown by
Southwest Airlines. All of the aforementioned aircraft are Stage 3.
Chairman Baliga asked about Stage 4 aircraft and Mr. Jackson responded that
many of the current aircraft are Stage 4 and any new aircraft purchased must
meet Stage 4 requirements. He also noted that there is no Stage 3 phase out.
.
D. Status of New Permanent Noise Monitor
Work has begun on the installation of the new noise monitor located on Albany
north of 40th Street. Mr. Frame anticipates completion of Site 314 before the next
quarterly meeting. Mr. Jackson stated that Site 314 is being located in Ward 12
and will be on the flight path coming in from the northeast over Bridgeport.
Mr. Lihosit asked how high the aircraft are when flying over Bridgeport. Mr.
Frame stated that they are at an approximate altitude of 1500 to 2000 feet. He
will provide the Commission with the exact numbers once they are confirmed.
E. Status of Long-Term Portable Noise Monitors
Mr. Frame noted that they have encountered some logistical issues with the Park
District concerning the first of the two portable monitors being installed. The
southeast side location chosen may have to be reconsidered. He will provide the
members with an update early next week. He will also contact Mayor Klein for
his input in deciding which of the Burbank locations should be considered for the
placement of the second monitor.
F. Commission letter to the Midway Air Carriers regarding the Fly Quiet
Program
A letter, signed by Chairman Baliga, along with a copy of the latest version of the
Fly Quiet Program Manual, was sent out on behalf of the Commission to the six
larger airlines at Midway. The letters were sent as a reminder of their
commitment to the Midway Fly Quiet Program. This program includes the
Voluntary Air Carrier Nighttime Curfew which is implemented at Midway between
the hours of 12 a.m. and 6 a.m.

 FINAL Minutes of the April 23, 2015, Meeting of the
Midway Noise Compatibility Commission
G. FACT SHEET – RSIP at Midway International Airport
The Fact Sheet has been updated and reformatted. It covers the background of
the program stating the number of homes (8,000) that have been sound
insulated. It states that the purpose is to reduce the effects of aircraft noise
inside the homes within the contour. The requirements for eligibility are broken
down. It also explains how funding is provided.
There is a graphic showing the noise contour indicating homes completed and
those that are eligible. Additionally there is a table showing the locations of the
properties and when they were completed.
The final topic is types of insulation along with pre-construction, construction and
post-construction activities.
Mr. Frame stated that the fact sheet will soon be available on the CDA
FlyChicago website.
CHAIR’S REPORT
A. Residential Sound Insulation Sub-Committee Report
Mr. Lihosit presented the Residential Sound Insulation Sub-Committee Report
(see attached).
Mr. Lihosit asked why multi-unit buildings do not require an inspection. Mr. Frame
responded that most multi-unit buildings are already zoned as such and therefore
in compliance. If the RSIP inspector finds that a building is questionable, that
property is referred to the Department of Buildings for its inspection and
determination of code compliance.
NEW BUSINESS
A. Chairman Baliga asked about the status of determining the location of the
majority of the declines. Mr. Frame responded that he will follow up with that
information. Mr. Frame also informed Chairman Baliga that he had a preliminary
discussion of the current noise issues with the FAA and no conclusions have
been drawn yet.
Chairman Baliga asked if there were any further questions or new business
requiring further discussion. With none, a motion to adjourn was made by Ms.
Pinion and seconded by Mr. Lihosit. The motion passed.
MEETING ADJOURNMENT
Chairman Baliga adjourned the meeting at 7:28 p.m. and informed those present that
the next meeting of the Midway Noise Compatibility Commission will be held on
Thursday, July 23, 2015 at 6:30 p.m. at The Mayfield, Chicago.
