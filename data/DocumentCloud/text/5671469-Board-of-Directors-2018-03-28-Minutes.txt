Vice Chairman Baker stated that at the last Audit Committee Meeting, there
was a WRAP (Water Residential Assistance Program) report, which listed a
community in Macomb County, Roseville, which had not signed up or given a
response to the WRAP Program, so he contacted Roseville, and they
(Roseville) will schedule a meeting with GLWA.
Director Daddow stated that he read in the daily newsletters received that
Flint is only billing 53% of the water it uses and collecting only 42%, which
William M. Wolfson, Chief Administrative and Compliance Officer, responded
