EXPLANATION

The provision of CSS at Oakwood Shores was contemplated as part of the competitive
procurement of the developer and is governed by the Master Developer Agreement with respect
to this community. Under this agreement, the parties envisioned that TCB, as the developer,
would be responsible to provide CSS to CHA residents who move into this new mixed-income
community, and that TCB would receive financial assistance from CHA pending funding
availability and contract performance.
On January 1, 2004, CHA entered into a two (2) year contract with a one-year option with TCB
to provide CSS to residents of Oakwood Shores. The primary focus of the Contract was to assist
CHA families that chose to return to the Oakwood Shores mixed-income community. Case
management services were specifically designed to address barriers a family may have in
meeting the site specific criteria for relocating to Oakwood Shores. In December 2005, the
Board authorized CHA to exercise the one-year option period. The Board authorized the CHA to
extend the Contract for an additional year in 2006, and again for the second and third year
extensions in 2007 and 2008. CHA authorized a four-month no-cost extension in December
2009 for the term of January 1, 2010 through April 30, 2010.
Based on funding availability and TCB’s satisfactory performance during the recent no-cost
extension term, CHA desires to extend the Contract for an additional one-year term. This will
allow TCB to continue providing post-occupancy services to the 208 families who have
relocated to Oakwood Shores and provide services to the families desiring to relocate into the 29
units available for Phase 2B of Oakwood Shores in FY 2010.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Officer, or his designee, to extend the Contract with TCB for the period of May 1, 2010 through
April 30, 2011 and to increase the Contract’s funding by an amount not-to-exceed $400,000
adding it to the carryover balance available at the end of the Contract’s current term to provide
CSS to CHA residents relocating to Oakwood Shores.
