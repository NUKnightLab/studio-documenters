PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING ON THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY TO APPOINT A SPECIAL STATE’S
ATTORNEY TO HANDLE THE PROSECUTION OF OFFICER JASON VAN DYKE, PURSUANT TO 55
ILCS 5/3-9008

WHEREAS, pursuant to 55 ILCS 5/3-9008, the Circuit Court or an interested party in a proceeding may
file a petition alleging that the State’s Attorney is unable to fulfill her duties; and
WHEREAS, 55 ILCS 5/3-9008 sets the proper procedure for the Circuit Court to review such petition;
and
WHEREAS, the 13-month time period between the shooting death of a 17-year-old African American,
Laquan McDonald, and the filing of criminal charges by the Cook County State’s Attorney against the
shooter, Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke has undermined local confidence in the criminal justice
system in Cook County; and,
WHEREAS, the delay in prosecuting Officer Van Dyke has placed the Cook County State’s Attorney in
the position of having to defend the impartiality of the State’s Attorney’s Office in prosecuting Officer
Van Dyke; and,
WHEREAS, with respect to the prosecution of Officer Van Dyke, the utilization of the Chicago Police
Department by the State’s Attorney for its own investigatory purposes places the Cook County State’s
Attorney in the position of prosecuting a member of a government agency that often functions as witnesses
of the State’s Attorney’s Office; and,
WHEREAS, as a result of its relationship with the Chicago Police Department as outlined in the foregoing
paragraphs, a clear conflict of interest exists for the Office of the Cook County State’s Attorney in its
prosecution of Officer Van Dyke; and,

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that this Honorable Body requests that the Circuit Court of Cook County or an interested
person immediately file a petition alleging that the State’s Attorney is unable to fulfill her duties
pursuant to Section 55 ILCS 5/3-9008 and to appoint a Special State’s Attorney to handle the
prosecution of Jason Van Dyke.
