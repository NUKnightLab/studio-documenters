The CHA has utilized the services of a professional insurance brokerage and consulting firm
with a wide range of insurance expertise since 1999 to market and procure CHA’s insurance
requirements and the requirements for the Property Management Insurance Program to secure
financial protection at competitive rates from commercial insurance carriers. The PMIP is an
owner-controlled insurance program in which participation is mandatory for all of CHA’s Private
Property Managers (PPM). The RFP for professional insurance brokerage and consulting
services for the CHA and the PMIP was released in October 2010. The RFP was advertised in
area newspapers and on the CHA website. Of the four proposals received, three firms were
determined to be in the competitive range and Best and Final Offers were requested and received
from each firm. Based on the results and recommendations of the evaluation committee, AON
will provide services that include risk management project support, auditing and insurance
placement. During the last 5 years, AON has aggressively marketed both insurance programs
starting with holding an informational session at the Authority with prospective carriers and
taking carriers on a tour of various locations. AON conducted an in depth analysis of all
coverage and made recommendations that resulted in coverage enhancements ant no additional
cost and procurement of additional lines of coverage. AON’s efforts resulted in CHA receiving
optimum insurance coverage, while realizing cost savings for the CHA and the PMIP, and
obtaining competitive bids for various lines of coverage. Accordingly, the resolution for Item
A3 approves award of contract to AON Risk Services for insurance brokerage and consultant
services.

 There being no questions or discussion, the Chairman thereupon declared said Motion carried
and said resolutions adopted.
Commissioner Ponce, Chairman of the Operations and Facilities Committee, then presented his
report. Per Commissioner Ponce, the Operations and Facilities Committee held its regular
meeting on Wednesday, January 12, 2011 at the CHA Corporate Offices.
Commissioner Ponce then presented an Omnibus Motion for adoption of the Resolutions for
Items B1 thru B10.
(Item B1)
Pursuant to an agreement the CHA entered into with HUD, the CHA was required to inspect its
non-dwelling and community spaces to determine whether these facilities are compliant with the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The CHA
performed such inspections and discovered that certain aspects of a large portion of such
designated facilities were not in compliance with ADA/504 laws and regulations. Accordingly, a
Request for Proposal was advertised requesting qualified architectural and/or engineering firms
to perform Prime Design Consultant (PDC) services for the modernization of various nondwelling Public Housing facilities designated to be ADA/504 compliant. The RFP was
advertised in area newspapers and on the CHA website. The CHA also directly solicited 470
firms, including 103 MBE firms, 77 WBE firms, and 70 assist agencies. Of the 19 proposals
received and evaluated 13 respondents were within the Competitive Range. Upon further
consideration of each Respondent following the presentations, the Evaluation Committee
recommended that six firms be awarded contracts. Accordingly, the resolution for Item B1
approves six Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Task Order Contracts for Prime Design
Consultant Services for ADA design at various CHA non-dwelling properties to the following
vendors: Architrave, Ltd., d’Escoto, Inc., Globetrotters Engineering Corp., Hasbrouck Peterson
Zimoch Sirirattumrong, Pappageorge Haymes Partners and Solomon Cordwell Buenz. To
distribute the work required under the contracts, all six PDCs will submit proposals to perform
the Task Order work on a Lump Sum basis. The CHA will then evaluate the proposals, work
plans and Lump Sum Base Bid in accordance with the criteria set forth in PDCs’ contracts, select
the successful respondent to perform the Task order work and issue a Notice to Proceed for the
work. Performance on ongoing Task Order assignments will be a factor in determining future
awards of specific Task Orders. While each firm will have a guaranteed minimum of
$50,000.00, poor or late design work will impact a firm’s ability to be awarded additional tasks.

(Items B6, B7 and B8)
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bids (IFBs) for the demolition of dwelling units at LeClaire
Courts Extension-Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3 in July 2010. The IFBs were advertised in the
area newspapers and on the CHA website and at BuySpeed Online. Pre-bid meetings and site
visits were held in August 2010. Of the bids received for each IFB, after reviewing the bid
submittal material staff held a pre-award survey meeting with the lowest bidder. The bidder
responded to questions on the thoroughness of their bids and their capacity to perform their
work. With the review, analysis and meeting completed, the award was approved at the
September Board meeting. After Board approval but prior to execution of the contract, the
recommended awardee disagreed with the CHA on its understanding of the contractor’s
responsibilities with respect to obtaining a permit for the work. After numerous attempts to work
with the recommended awardee and its failure to honor its bid, the CHA considers the bid
withdrawn without consent. In an effort to expedite the demolition at LeClaire Courts Extension,
and to avoid the lengthy delay and potential economic impact on the cost of demolition should
this work be rebid, staff reviewed the bid of the second lowest bidder for each Group. Staff then
held a Pre-Award Survey with Delta, reviewing the Scope of Work, with particular attention
given to Delta’s understanding of the permit process. Delta’s answers were determined to be
satisfactory, including their understanding of the requirements with respect to the permit process.
Accordingly, the resolutions for Item B6, By and B8 approves award of contracts to Delta
Demolition in the amount of $394,670; $469,555 and $332,185, respectively.
