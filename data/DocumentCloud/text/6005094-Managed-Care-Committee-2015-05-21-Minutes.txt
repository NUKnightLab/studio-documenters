Report on CountyCare Health Plan (Attachment #1)
A. Metrics
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, reviewed the Report on the CountyCare Health Plan.
Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Strategy and Finance, provided additional information.
During the discussion of the information regarding members by Medicaid category on slide 7, Chairman
Lerner inquired as to how the changing distribution of members will affect or change the way CountyCare
operates. Mr. Glass responded that this will affect the innovations and new projects that will be considered
and put into play. As one thinks about initiatives with the justice-involved population, involving more of the
Affordable Care Act (ACA) adult population, that has really been the focus. Although it is possible, it is not
believed that many children associated with the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center make up a significant
portion of members in the Family Health Plan population. The changing distribution of members also
requires operational changes to make sure the network is sufficient for both populations; the administration is
confident that the network is strong, as it is really anchored with the safety-net providers and the Federally
Qualified Health Centers, who have a long history of serving women and children. With regard to changes
that may need to be considered for services provided in the network, he noted that the administration is
currently talking with a provider regarding specialty transplants for kids; this is for a very specialized and
small population, and it is something that would not have been thought of six months ago - today it is
something to consider and review.

Report on CountyCare Health Plan (continued)
Chairman Lerner indicated that he would like to return to that subject in the future; he stated that this is an
intriguing question, as an evolution is being seen in the population served. Perhaps not in June, because it is
too early and he would like to see more trend lines, but maybe in September the Committee can come back
and really discuss the issues of the populations being served, what is the network required to serve them and
what are the risk parameters in each of these populations that may be different.
With regard to the information on Medicaid cancellations due to members not completing the
redetermination process on slide 10, Chairman Lerner inquired whether there are any other initiatives that
could be done to try and control this process; he suggested sending community case workers out to talk to
people to help bring applications in for processing. Mr. Glass provided information on the initiatives
currently in place for this; these initiatives include phone calls and mailings to members. These initiatives
raise member awareness, but in many cases do not effect a call to action by the member. He noted that the
State is moving to a new system in the Fall, which will allow individuals to go online to complete their
redetermination. That system is supposed to launch sometime in September or October; when that occurs,
the administration will be able to really re-examine how to work with the provider network and consider
other initiatives, such as deploying community workers and giving them the ability to go into someone’s
home with a mobile device to assist with the completion of the application. Chairman Lerner stated that,
compared to the cost associated with members not completing the redetermination process, it may be worth
the investment of something relatively small, such as utilizing community health workers or patient
advocates. In addition to considering the effects of redeterminations from a financial point of view, more
importantly, there has been an investment in these people’s health; there will likely be negative consequences
for them if they drop out of coverage and have to start all over again or if the benefit is given to someone
else.
Director Junge inquired whether a system was put in place to help the doctors flag patients, so the doctors
would know if a patient was nearing or within the redetermination process timeframe. Mr. Glass responded
that he believed that was the approach that was going to be internally taken; he will confirm if that has been
put in place. He added that this information was provided to the Medical Home Network (MHN); MHN is
now putting this information into their MHN Connect tool. When staff at CCHHS clinics and network
providers go into MHN Connect to see what is going on with a patient, they will have this redetermination
information in there, as well.
Director Velasquez inquired whether outreach takes place at churches and faith-based organizations on
Saturdays and Sundays. Mr. Glass responded that Marcelino Garcia, Director of Community Affairs, is
responsible for outreach activities; he will ask Mr. Garcia to provide information on that subject to Director
Velasquez. Director Velasquez commented that a community health worker is at his or her best in that
environment, as that is where the action is; an amount of money will have to be invested to do this, but it
produces many positive results, including the establishment of a trust relationship with the community,
which takes time and effort. Mr. Elwell stated that the administration is expanding the community liaison
effort and have been bringing that in-house to a certain degree. In the Waiver period, there was quite a bit of
flexibility as CountyCare for outreach activities; due to Medicaid marketing and outreach rules, there is less
flexibility as a health plan. There is more freedom for CCHHS as the provider to do this; this will require a
plan that outlines the investment and staffing that will be needed. He believes that, if these activities can be
moved to the provider, in addition to increased flexibility, there is a chance that a 50% participation rate
could be received from the federal government.

Report on CountyCare Health Plan (continued)
Director Velasquez inquired whether enrollment activities take place at Malcolm X College, which has a
large student body. Mr. Glass indicated that CCHHS and Mr. Garcia have a very good working relationship
with the City Colleges of Chicago, which includes Malcolm X College. Mr. Glass stated that they are very
active and present at the City Colleges; he will work with Mr. Garcia to get some additional information on
those activities for Director Velasquez in response to her inquiry.
With regard to slide 12, Chairman Lerner inquired whether data can be presented regarding ACA population
utilization under the network partners. Mr. Glass responded affirmatively. He stated that they track both
internal and external utilization; for external utilization, they are able to break it down to the provider level.
Chairman Lerner stated that, at some point in the future, the Committee can do a drill-down about the
network; he would like to look at utilization within the network, see how much of it is coming here versus
the network, see who is at-risk and who is not, and see who is getting paid on a per-member per-month basis
versus fee-for-service. Board Chairman Hammock inquired whether data is collected in a way that can show
across the County the locations of the clinics and the number of people who are using those locations - a
“heat map,” so to speak, of the County in geographic distribution. Mr. Glass stated that one of the things
they do track in the geographic distribution is where the dollars flow; one could assume that is where the
individuals are, as well. This map can likely be changed to look at individual utilization across the County.
Chairman Lerner requested that this be presented as part of an internal strategic review of the CountyCare
Health Plan at some future date, when there is a substantial amount of time. He suggested that this take place
at a Board Meeting; this type of drill-down would be beneficial for the Board, because this involves the
discussion of the kinds of things that will lead to the continued success of CountyCare. Board Chairman
Hammock concurred with the suggestion.
During the discussion of the information on the 60-day Medicaid cuts on slide 14, Chairman Lerner
requested an update on any expected or anticipated issues in terms of the State’s budget or regarding the
continued fight over the pension liability; he noted that, perhaps more worrisome over the long haul is the
transfer of responsibility from the federal government to the state government for Medicaid, as the ACA is
implemented. Mr. Elwell stated that, at the federal level, things are heating up. The concern that the
administration is hearing from lobbyists is this is going to end up being a compromise; there are great
concerns that things that would never been agreed to historically may get agreed to as part of the deal. At the
State, they are in a very difficult budget situation. Mr. Elwell stated that there are hospitals that want to
reverse the whole managed care deal and return to a fee-for-service arrangement. Those hospitals are
arguing that the current arrangement is too expensive, and are using as an example some of the moneys paid
to safety-net hospitals; part of that relates to the unique way that payments to safety net hospitals in the State
of Illinois have come about over the years. The administration also continues to have major concerns about
potential reductions to funding of behavioral health services; those services have been extraordinarily
underfunded for a long time, and were the major subject of the Waiver. As the administration looks at the
criminal justice responsibilities and its responsibilities to the community, any reduction will have significant
negative effects.
Chairman Lerner stated that this update is not only relevant to CountyCare, it is relevant to the whole System
and its strategic direction and competition in the area. His hope is that, at the Board level, a broader strategic
discussion can be held about some of these factors that play into it; his fear is that the patients will get hurt as
a result. He thanked Mr. Elwell for the update, and suggested that the Committee receive updates like this in
the future on a regular basis.
With regard to the Stakeholder and Enrollee Advisory Committee Meetings referenced in the report, Director
Gugenheim requested further information, as she would like to attend meetings in the future.

Report on CountyCare Health Plan (continued)
Chairman Lerner referenced the Enrollee Advisory Committee Survey results included in the report. He
commented that the Committee is starting to really reach into the area of social attributes; he believes that the
CountyCare members should be engaged in a broader discussion about social attributes and how those are
affecting their physical and clinical health. This would be a great project for a school of public health; some
graduate students could go out in the community and engage people in a face-to-face dialogue, help them fill
out surveys, and then use that information to not only look at the utilization trends but how to intervene.
Additionally, this type of information can be invaluable when the subject of budgetary interventions is
introduced by politicians.
Chairman Lerner stated that there are two particular areas that impact not only CountyCare but also the
broader System that really need to be addressed – behavior health and the post-acute side of the equation.
Since there has been a fair amount of media recently about C4, he asked Mr. Glass, as part of the drill-down
for next month, to also start to get at the behavioral health side.
Chairman Lerner noted that the way the Board has separated the responsibilities of managed care is that the
Finance Committee has put its arms around one segment, and the Managed Care Committee has put its arms
around another segment. The Managed Care Committee and enterprise is really moving in its ability to look
at quality from a broad point of view. Clinical quality, member and provider satisfaction and employee
satisfaction all relate to quality; eventually the Committee will get to metrics that look at all of these.
Additionally, the Committee will need to get to a metric that looks at health status of health plan members, as
well as for the rest of the people served.
Chairman Lerner stated that, given the fact that the Audit and Compliance Committee meets every other
month and has an extensive agenda, the Managed Care Committee, for the foreseeable future, will move to a
10:30 A.M. start time; if an adjustment needs to be made in the future, it can be done.

I have been truly blessed 
through County Care services 
and the services I receive at 
Provident Hospital. If it 
hadn’t been for this 
insurance my health would 
be very bad.
