WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property Assessment
Classification 7b that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for an abandoned industrial
facility; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Classification System for Assessment defines abandoned property as
buildings and other structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous months,
have been purchased for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances may exist that
justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 7b; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, with new
construction and substantial rehabilitation by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest,
the County may determine that special circumstances justify finding the property is deemed abandoned;
and
WHEREAS, Class 7b requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period of qualifying
abandonment in cases where the facility has been abandoned for less than 24 consecutive months upon
purchase for value; and
WHEREAS, the municipality states the Class 7b is necessary for development to occur on this specific
real estate. The municipal resolution cites the five eligibility requirements set forth by the Class 7b

real estate eligible for the Class 6b can receive a significant reduction in the level of assessment from the

the date of substantial re-occupancy.
Properties receiving Class 7a will be assessed at 10% of the

Summary: This grant would provide continued funding from the State of Illinois Adult Redeploy Illinois
Program, through the Criminal Justice Information Authority, for the Circuit Court of Cook County’s
Access to Community Treatment Court (ACT) Program.

The ACT Court is a drug court probation program that operates in the Circuit Court Criminal Division. Its
goal is to help certain nonviolent, felony criminal offenders suffering from substance abuse problems from
becoming repeat offenders and incarceration. The program links participants with behavioral health,
vocational, and educational treatment services from community-based sources. The court closely monitors
participants’ compliance with program protocols and provides encouragement for success through a range
of rewards and sanctions. Incarceration is used as a last resort and for short periods.
The grant will fund treatment and toxicology services for participants not covered by Medicaid health
insurance. Funds will also be used for court staff salaries and payroll fringe benefits, training, supplies and
county indirect costs.
