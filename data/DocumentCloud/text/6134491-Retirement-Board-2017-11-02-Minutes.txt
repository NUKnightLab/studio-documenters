pension funds. About 86% of the Fund’s annuitants reside in Illinois and the weekly
reports received from the IDPH since July 13, 2017, have been the fastest and most
accurate tool used by the Fund in identifying annuitants who have died in the state.

the annuitant data provided by the Fund. It was also discussed how the Fund could
improve collection of data about annuitants’ deaths occurring outside of Illinois.
