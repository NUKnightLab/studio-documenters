PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AN AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY AMUSEMENT TAX

WHEREAS, it is the intent of the County Board to recognize and encourage both the artists who add to
our cultural identity as well as the venues that allow them to display their talents to crowds from around the
County and around the world by exempting them from the City and County?s amusement tax for live
performances; and

Page 65 of 85

WHEREAS, it is not the role of government to restrictively decide and define what is and is not ?music?;
and

WHEREAS, to single out one or any type of music genre performed at these types of venues as not
applicable to the small venue exemption clause is not in the spirit or purpose of the exemption clause nor
the expansive de?nition of music;

WHEREAS, as the recording industry and music genres have evolved, the National Academy of Recording
Arts and Sciences has recognized although sometimes more slowly than society at large, that new music
genres evolve and form, such as Rock, Rap, Reggae, Metal, Roots, Electronica, New Age etc.; and

WHEREAS, DJ ?5 have been considered an art form for many years now and in fact the National Academy
of Recording Arts and Sciences? Grammy Awards created the Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year,
Non-Classical at the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998 to recognize an individual(s) who takes previously
recorded material and adds or alters it in such a way as to create a new and unique performance; and

WHEREAS, the ?rst Grammy Award for such category was presented to Chicago?s very own Frankie
Knuckles whose key role in developing and popularizing House music into an internationally recognized
musical genre during the 19803 led to him being referred to as the "The Godfather of House Music"; and

WHEREAS, in 1998, the Cook County Board created an exemption to the Amusement Tax for small
venues with a maximum capacity of not more than 750 persons, and in 1999 the County Board further
amended said ordinance by de?ning live performances by examples giving several genre examples and art
forms including live musical performances, but does not restrict it to only those examples by including the
encompassing term_?music?; and

WHEREAS, the current language contained in the County Code has created unintended and unnecessary
confusion as to what constitutes ?music? and has created undue burdens on venue operators who are being
required to comply with inconsistent de?nitions, restrictions and exemptions by the County and the City of
Chicago; and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
74 Taxation, Article X, Amusement Tax, Sections 74-39] and 74-392 of the Cook County Code of

WHEREAS, it is the intent of the County Board to recognize and encourage both the artists who
add to our cultural identity as well as the venues that allow them to display their talents to crowds
from around the County and around the world by exempting them from the City and County?s
amusement tax for live performances; and

WHEREAS, it is not the role of government to restrictively decide and de?ne what is and is not
?music?; and

WHEREAS, to single out one or any type of music genre performed at these types of venues as
not applicable to the small venue exemption clause is not in the spirit or purpose of the exemption
clause nor the expansive definition of music;

WHEREAS, as the recording industry and music genres have evolved, the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences has recognized, although sometimes more slowly than society at
large, that new music genres evolve and form, such as Rock, Rap, Reggae, Metal, Roots,

Electronica, New Age etc; and

WHEREAS, DJ ?3 have been considered an art form for many years now and in fact the National
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences? Grammy Awards created the Grammy Award for
Remixer of the Year, Non-Classical at the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998 to recognize an
individual(s) who takes previously recorded material and adds or alters it in such a way as to create
a new and unique performance; and

WHEREAS, the first Grammy Award for such category was presented to Chicago?s very own
Frankie Knuckles whose key role in developing and popularizing House music into an
internationally recognized musical genre during the 19808 led to him being referred to as the "The
Godfather ofHouse Music"; and

WHEREAS, in 1998, the Cook County Board created an exemption to the Amusement Tax for
small venues with a maximum capacity of not more than 750 persons, and in 1999 the County
Board ?irther amended said ordinance by defining live performances by examples giving several
genre examples and alt forms including live musical performances, but does not restrict it to only
those examples by including the encompassing term ?music?; and

WHEREAS, the current language contained in the County Code has created unintended and
unnecessary confusion as to what constitutes ?music? and has created undue burdens on venue
operators who are being required to comply with inconsistent de?nitions, restrictions and
exemptions by the County and the City of Chicago;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that
