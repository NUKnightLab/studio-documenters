HONORABLE DETROIT CITY COUNCIL

RE: SECONDARY STREET SIGN REQUEST IN HONOR OF BISHOP SAMUEL A. WILSON
(RECOMMEND DENIAL)

On February 5, 2019, Petition #669 was submitted to the City Clerk?s Of?ce requesting that the intersection
of E. Outer Drive and Gratiot Avenue be assigned the secondary street name Bishop Samuel A. Wilson.

The Historic Designation Advisory Board (HDAB) staff has reviewed the documentation submitted to the
City Clerk?s of?ce by the petitioner for the establishment of a Secondary Street Sign. Upon review of the
documentation submitted by the petitioner (see attachment) staff has determine that reasonable grounds has
not been provided and therefore has concluded that the petition does not meet the criteria for Secondary
Naming of Street in accordance with Article VII Sections 50-7-31 through Sections 50-7-50 of the
1984 Detroit City Code. More speci?cally, out of the 376 signatures submitted, none were within 300
feet of the proposed intersection as required by the ordinance.

Since February of 2019 the petitioner has been afforded the opportunity to submit additional signatures in
order to meet the two-thirds signatures requirement as outlined in the ordinance, however, despite collecting
approximately 186 signatures throughout the commu nity and the City of Detroit, the petitioner was unable
to obtain the required number of valid signatures within 300 linear feet of the proposed intersection.

While the application and documentation submit adequately speaks to the signi?cant and positive
contributions of Bishop Wilson and his 30 plus year history near the intersection of E. Outer Drive and
Gratiot Avenue, there is no mechanism in the secondary street sign ordinance which would allow staff
recommend approval without the valid number of signatures, nor an endorsement from a seated
Councilmember.

Criteria

As stated in Chapter 50 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, Streets. Sidewalks and Other Puhiic Pine-es. Article
VII, Opening, Ciosii-ig, Extending, lt?idening. Wearing. Naming and Renaming of Streets and Assigning
Secondary Names to Streets. A secondary street name designation may be sought to recognize a person
who achieved prominence as a result of his or her significant, position, contributions to the City ofDetroit,
State ot?MiclLigan, the United States of America, or the international community.

1. Sites, buildings, structures where cultural, social, spiritual, economic, political, architectural
history of the community, city, state or nation is particularly re?ected or exempli?ed.

2. Sites, buildings, structures, which are identi?ed with historic personages or with important
events in the community, city, state or national history.

Staff is available to answer any questions and or concerns you may have.

HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: Petition #900, requesting interim designation of the historic Blue Bird Inn,
located at 5021 Tireman Avenue, Detroit MI 48204, and the appointment of
ad hoc representatives in connection with this matter.

A request for interim designation of the historic Blue Bird Inn was referred to the Flaming 
Economic Development Standing Committee on March 19, 2019. The proposed Blue Bird Inn

Historic District consists of the single building located at 5021 Tireman Avenue.

A provision in the local designation ordinance, Sec. states, ?Upon receipt of

substantial evidence demonstrating de?nite signi?cance in a proposed historic district, the
city council may, at its discretion, adopt a resolution of interim historic designation, requiring
that all applications for permits for work Within the proposed historic district be referred to
[Historic District] commission as provided for in section 25-2-18 et seq.? Interim designation
would require that, for a period of up to one year, the Historic District Commission would have
the same powers as it would if the Blue Bird Inn were a designated local historic district.

Reasonable grounds for the study have been provided, and a resolution directing the Historic
Designation Advisory Board to conduct a study is attached. Should Your Honorable Body adopt
that resolution, you must appoint two persons to serve as ad hoc members of the Advisory Board

in connection with the matter.

Staff has worked with the petitioners and identi?ed two recommended ad hoc board members. A
resolution appointing these ad hoc board members is attached. Staff is available to answer any
questions you may have in regards to this proposed designation.

prescription lenses, non-prescription sunglasses, contact lenses and accessories for
glasses and contact lenses. Their emphasis is on mid to high quality or luxury eyewear
and meeting Medicare requirements to allow for availability to all demographics. There
pricing strategy is Medicare-dictated and optical insurance pricing, as well as non?
insuranee pricing based on manufacturers requirements (suggested retail) with
competition lens pricing and competitive ?ames and lens packing pricing for low to mid?
level non-insurance patients.

The project will be renovated within the current footprint of the existing building.
Demolition will include the complete interior, exterior wall removal for a new entrance,
dormers on the second ?oor roof, etc. Site remediation is not expected. New
machine/equipment would be as follows:

0 Equipment/Instruments (new and used) - $15,000 for minimum exam

Display/Storage Cabinets/Shelving/Table/Chairs - $20,000

Inventory - $30,000

0 First Year Start-Up Expenses - $100,000 to $120,000

Paragraph #4
The requested exemption period is for 12 years.
Paragraph #5

Economic advantages of the project to the City of Detroit would be:

0 The introduction of an affordable optical practice in an area that is mostly
poor and in need ofsuch.

- The project will be an addition to the on-going development and planned
development of the area, further providing incentive to new
developers/companies thinking of returning/expanding into the City of
Detroit.

- The addition of collected taxes from employees and sales at the site.

The taxes on the property are current.
Paragraph #6

OPTIK Birmingham draws many patients from Detroit and the metro Detroit area
including Ann Arbor and Grosse Pointe, and OPTIK Detroit will draw on the established
reputation of OPTIK Birmingham and will be very close to the Indian Village and West
Village neighborhoods, and more accessible to eastern suburbs including Grosse Pointe.

OPTIK will be a panel provider on optical insurance. There are limited private of?ces in
Detroit and, therefore, limited choices for VSP optical insurance patients (Detroit Police
for one) and OPTIK Detroit will be accepting many optical insurances.

Please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned at (248) 417-6516 with any questions. I

RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Obsolete Property District (PA 146) at 2220 Gratiot
[Petition #897]
DATE: June 7, 2019
CC: Maurice Cox, Director, Planning and Development

Kevin Schronce, Central Region, Planning and Development

in order to ensure that the creation of an Obsolete Property District is in conformance with the City?s
Master Plan of Policies and will have the reasonable likelihood to increase commercial activity; create,
retain or prevent a loss of employment; revitalize an urban area; or increase the number of residents in
a community, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public Act 146 of 2000 (section 125.2788), the Planning and
Development Department submits the following interpretation. The Petitioner of this project is Optik.

Location and Project Proposal: 2220 Gratiot; The project proposes to rehabilitate a one?story
retail/warehouse building {approximately 0.30 acres} into a facility for exams and health care,
including the sale of frames and prescription lenses, non-prescription sunglasses, contact lenses and
accessories for glasses and contact lenses.

Master Plan interpretation:

The subject site area is designated Mixed Residential-Commercial (MRC). Mixed Residential?
Commercial areas consist primarily of high density housing developed compatibly with commercial
and/or institutional uses. This classification is well suited to areas proximal to existing centers of major
commercial activity, major thoroughfares, transportation nodes, or gateways into the city.

The following Master Plan goals and/or policies of the Lower East Central neighborhood describe the
following recommendations to support/advise project:
I Policy 4.1: Encourage high-density mixed?use development to replace obsolete commercial
properties along Gratiot
I Policy 5.2: Continue to support neighborhood-servicing retail uses for the residential area north
ofJefferson
I Policy 6.1: Along Jefferson and Gratiot, incorporate streetscape, landscape and signage
improvements leading into the Central Business Distict

The proposed development conforms to the Future General Land Use characteristics of the
area.

Parcel Numbers: 09001284., 09001283., 09001282. and 09001279-81

Dear Mr. Cox:

The Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of the Assessor, has reviewed the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
District located at 2220, 2234, 2238 and 2240 Gratiot in the McDougall Hunt neighborhood in the City of Detroit. OPTIK has
the same members as the owner of the property 2220 Gratiot LLC.

The rationale for creating Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Districts under PA 146 of 2000, as amended, is based on the
anticipation of increased market value upon completion of new construction and /or significant rehabilitation of existing
commercial property and commercial housing property. Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not
necessarily generate additional market value.

intends to rehabilitate the building into an optical related retail business including examination rooms, tech testing
room, contact lenses area and frame adjustment area with 400 to 500 square feet dedicated to storage. The one-story
building at 2220 Gratiot is currently vacant and consists of 2,140 square feet of retail building area, built in 1915 and
situated on .058 acres of land. The two-story building at 2228 Gratiot is currently vacant and consists of 2,685 square feet
of mixed-use building area, built in 1915 and situated on .031 acres of land. The remaining land has a total of .211 acres of
vacant land and gravel parking. Rehabilitation will include complete interior demolition, exterior wall removal for a new
entrance, demolition of dormers on the second floor and reconfiguration ofthe floor plan.

This property meets the criteria set forth under PA 146 of 2000, as amended. It applies to blighted, functionally obsolete
and contaminated properties. "Rehabilitation," meaning that changes to qualified facilities that are required to restore or
modify the property, together with all appurtenances, to an economically efficient condition. Rehabilitation also includes
major renovation and modification including, but not necessarily limited to, the improvement of floor loads, correction of
deficient or excessive height, new or improved fixed building equipment, including heating, ventilation, and lighting,
reducing multistory facilities to 1 or 2 stories, adding additional stories to a facility or adding additional space on the same
floor level not to exceed 100% of the existing floor space on that floor level, improved structural support including
foundations, improved roof structure and cover, floor replacement, improved wall placement, improved exterior and
interior appearance of buildings, and other physical changes required to restore or change the obsolete property to an
economically efficient condition.

A field investigation indicated that the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District located at 2220, 2234, 2238, 2240
Gratiot is eligible as it pertains to the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act under PA 146 of 2000, as amended.

In today?s formal session, Council member Ayers requested that the Legislative Policy Division
con?rm if the Detroit City Council passed a resolution which designated the city of Detroit as a
?Sanctuary City. Upon our research, we found several resolutions which referenced Detroit
as a ?Welcoming City. 

Regarding the definition of the two de?ning terms, Sanctuary and Welcoming Cities, the news
publication the Orange County Daily1 de?nes the distinction between Welcoming and
Sanctuary cities as one of semantics, stating: di?erence between Welcoming and
Sanctuary city status is more semantic than substantive. The/armor doesn 't carrv the polarizing
branding of'tlie latter, but the outcomes are the same. The Washington DC.
ACLU, concurs with this position, indicating online, "The terms ?l'Veleoming Cities" and
Cities are alien used interchangeably, and there is no exact legal meaning or
definition for either. Generallv. their are both understood to be cities that do not aslc people
about in-in-iigration stains, particularlv in law enforeen-ient activities or in providing services,
and decline to engage efforts in to ei-iforee immigration law, which is the federal government?s
responsibilitvi Therefore, there is no real distinction between Sanctuary or Welcoming Cities.

 

The Welcoming America website used to have a page explaining the difference between Welcoming and
Sanctuary city status. it's no longer publicly accessible but there is a cached version available from November 22,
2016. Judging by Welcoming Cities own description, the difference between Welcoming and Sanctuary city status is
more semantic than substantive. The former doesn?t carry the polarizing branding of the latter. but the outcomes are
substantially the same.

However, on several occasions, the Detroit City Council has reaf?rmed its commitment as a
?Welcoming City,? by stating its opposition to State legislation which would undermine the
City?s relationship with local law enforcement, which fostered a welcoming environment for
immigrants. In addition, Council reaf?rmed its commitment to the City?s 2007 Ordinance,
which banned any bias based policing and the solicitation of immigration status.

A Resolution
in Support of Sanctuary Cities
By Council Member Castaneda-Lopez:
Whereas. A Welcoming City is an inclu-
sive environment that prowdes opportuni-
ties for all to particrpate socially. Civically
and economically in order to contribute to
the vibrancy of the city: and
Whereas. In 2007. the City of Detroit
passed an anti-profiling ordinance that
prohibits the police department from
requesting a person's immigration status
or requesting the immigration status of a
crime victim or witness: and
Whereas. This ordinance ensures that
immigrants feel safe reporting crimes. tes-
tifying as Witnesses. and interacting with
local law enforcement. thus building trust
and providing access to police protection
in order to enhance public safety; and
Whereas. Creating a safe and welcom-
ing environment is integral to improving
the lives of all new. existent. and future
immigrant communities in Detroit: and
Whereas. Local ordinances such as
this are a step toward comprehensive
immigration reform at the national level:
Now. Therefore Be It
Resolved, That the City of Detroit. as a
Welcoming City. opposes any legislation
that seeks to undermine the relationship
between the community and local law

 

 

 

enforcement and remains committed to
creating a welcoming environment for all:

Now. Therefore Be It Further

Resolved. That the City of Detroit reaf-
firms its commitment to the 2007 legisla-
tion against bias=based policing and
solicitation of immigration status.

RESOLUTION
In Support of Detroit Minority
Businesses and Entrepreneurs
By Council Member Sheffield:

Whereas. The City of Detroit is current-
ly undergoing a positive translormative
process particularly in the downtown
Central Bus3ness District and in various
business districts throughout the city
infusing much needed life and vitality into
the city and business cornunities: and

Whereas. Small businesses play a vital
role in the makeup of our local economy
and have the ability to respond and adapt
to changing economic climates.
Additionally. they stimulate economic
growth by providing employment opportu-
nities to individuals who might not have
access to employment in large corpora-
?ons:and

Whereas. While growth and develop-
ment of new businesses are welcomed
and much sought after. it is important to
recognize that the businesses that have
weathered turbulent times and stayed
within the city should not be forgotten and
pushed out in the current renaissance of
Detroit. and

Whereas, Specifically. it is critical that
the City of Detroit support long-standing

RE: Amended Property Sale by Development Agreement
3119 Brush and 313 Watson, Detroit, MI 48201

Honorable City Council:

On November 20, 2018, your Honorable Body adopted a resolution approving the sale by
development agreement of certain real property at 3119 Brush and 313 Watson, Detroit, M1 (the
?Properties?) to Brush 8 LLC, a Michigan limited liability company, for the purchase price of
Three Hundred Seven Thousand and 00/100 Dollars (the ?Purchase Price?). Brush
8 LLC proposes to construct a residential development on the Properties that will include
approximately 8 for sale units consistent with the current PD-H (Planned Historic District) zoning.
The Historic District Commission reviewed the proposed use in October 2018 and determined that
the project would have a positive effect on the Brush Park Historic District.

As part of the due diligence Brush 8 LLC has conducted on the Properties, environmental
assessments have identi?ed the unexpected existence of underground storage tanks that are now
required by law to be properly removed. Brush 8 LLC still wishes to pursue their proposed
development project and has agreed to conduct the tank removal/remediation at an estimated cost
of $93,680, provided that the City discount the Purchase Price by the environmental remediation
costs.

We, therefore, request that your Honorable Body adopt the attached resolution that reduces the
Purchase Price to $213,320 in furtherance of the sale of the Properties.

Whereas, the CITY and each desires to mitigate the negative impacts of the Vacant
School Properties on their neighborhoods by identifying which of the Vacant School Properties
