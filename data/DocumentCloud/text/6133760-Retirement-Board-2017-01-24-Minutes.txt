improve administration of the related provisions found in Article 11 of the Illinois Pension Code. The Board
directed Mr. Walsh to put together a plan of action for handling all the administrative challenges that are part of the
current process for granting disability service credit, as well as a plan for addressing any future challenges that may

Mr. Carroll reviewed situations which cause overpayments to be made to members of the Fund and the Fund’s
current procedures for the collection of such overpayments. Mr. Carroll also explained the various processes that the
Fund has put in place to limit overpayments to members and suggested adding the hiring of a debt collection firm as
an extra tool to be used for the collection of overpayments. Mr. Carroll presented to the Board companies that had
been researched and interviewed by Fund counsel to fulfill this task and recommended one firm that would best
meet the needs of the Fund. As an initial step, the Trustees directed staff and counsel to move forward with the
Markoff Law Firm on a contingency basis to recoup inadvertent overpayments made by the Fund to a small group of
members.
