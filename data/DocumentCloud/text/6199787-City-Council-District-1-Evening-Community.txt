HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: Neighborhood Enterprise Zone Certificate Application for the rehabilitation of 459
E. Milwaukee Avenue in the Vanguard/E. Grand Boulevard DeVelopment
Neighborhood Enterprise Zone area. (RECOMMEND APPROVAL)

The of?ce of the City Planning Commission (CPC) has received an application requesting a
Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (NEZ) certi?cate forwarded from the of?ce of the City Clerk for
the rehabilitation of one condominium property located at 459 E. Milwaukee Avenue. This
application corresponds to a quali?ed facility that is to be newly renovated into a high end
residential condominium unit. The proj ect consists of all new mechanical, electrical and
plumbing systems. The rehabilitation also includes new cabinetry and millwork, drywall,
insulation, flooring, counter tops, ?xtures and ?nishes. CPC staff has reviewed the application
and recommends approval.

The subject property has been con?rmed as being within the boundaries of the Vanguard/E.
Grand Boulevard Development NEZ which was established by a vote of Council on April 30,
2003, and should be eligible for NEZ certi?cates under State Act 147 of 1992 as currently
written. The anticipated cost of rehabilitation is $110,000.00. The NEZ certi?cate application
appears to have been submitted prior to the issuance of any applicable building permits.

Please contact our of?ce should you have any questions.

Respectfully submitted,

0 In 2016, the Council developed a new system of review for the approval of
certain NEZ certificates:

LPD assisted in developing a system for which the Council applied a greaterlevel
of scrutiny at the NEZ Zone approval stage. The recent upswing in the use of NEZS
for the development of apartment buildings and condos downtown and in

?Downtown Revitalization Districts,

n1

residents, created a need for this review.

This Neighborhood Enterprise Zone was established in Anna;

 

instead of just neighborhood single family

which is prior to the

development of a system of additional ?nancial review for NEZs in 2016, therefore there
is no additional ?scal review for this item.
