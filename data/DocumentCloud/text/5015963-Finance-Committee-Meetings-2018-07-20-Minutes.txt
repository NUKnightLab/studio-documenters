III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to the requests relating to CountyCare claims reimbursement (request numbers 4, 7, 8 and 9),
Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, provided additional information. He
stated that these requests are for the pass-through payments that go to the other providers through the third-party
administrator (TPA) and through the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). In this case, the administration took
some time to ensure they understood exactly what the population would be and that there was contract authority
still left; at this point, the administration can estimate what the costs will be for the remainder of the contracts. A
couple of the contracts (pharmacy and transportation claims reimbursements) are being re-bid, so funding for
Optum and First Transit is being requested to get through the re-bid period. The other two contracts, Evolent and
DentaQuest, are co-terminus with CountyCare’s contract with the State; so the funding being requested is what is
estimated to get through that contract process. The administrative costs were previously approved, so that is not
part of these requests.
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, asked Mr. Elwell to provide information on how the claims
expense is tracked and reported to the Board and Committees. Mr. Elwell stated that the CountyCare financials
that are provided every month reflect actual claims expense to budgeted claims expense. It also includes the
Medical Loss Ratio (MLR); MLR is everything expended for a patient and is compared to the premium collected.
MLR takes out all of the administrative costs and only leaves medical costs. This organization has a higher goal
than most for MLR. The federal government allows it to be as low as 85%; this organization’s MLR runs
between 91-93%.
Director Richardson-Lowry inquired regarding the allocation of administrative fees and the status of Contract
Compliance review for these contracts. Mr. Jones responded that Contract Compliance has reviewed each of the
four (4) requests and has found them to be responsive to the Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise
(M/WBE) Ordinance. There are no administrative fees associated with these requests, as these are all passthrough claims reimbursements. Director Richardson-Lowry inquired whether the record will be updated with
current information on these four (4) contracts with respect to Contract Compliance. Mr. Jones responded
affirmatively; he noted that any goals set for Contract Compliance for these will be on administrative costs only.
Those goals do not include claims, as those are 100% pass-through, so these contract dollars today will not have
M/WBE participation.
With regard to a question from Director Junge regarding the DentaQuest claims, and whether they include claims
from internal (CCHHS) providers, Mr. Elwell responded in the negative; he stated that internal providers are
included and used by plan members, but are effectively paid through internal accounting entries. Therefore,
checks are not issued for reimbursement of internal providers, and CountyCare does not pay an administrative
expense relating to the provision of services by CCHHS providers for plan members.

Board Chair Hammock, seconded by Chair Reiter, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 15, subject to completion of review by Contract Compliance,
where appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

III. Action Items (continued)
C. Proposed Transfers of Funds (Attachment #2)
Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, provided an overview of the proposed transfers of funds. Mr. Elwell
provided additional information. He stated that the administration is struggling with the new electronic resource
planning (ERP) system. It is doing a great job of allowing for accrual accounting; however, the purchasing
system is still operating on a cash basis. This is causing a variance and results in being charged twice for the
same expenditures. Staff are working very hard to fix this; they are keeping the financials straight, but they also
need to continue to be able to buy supplies.
Mr. Elwell noted that, next month, there will be another item presented for approval for transfers of funds.
Pursuant to County Budget Resolution, the System is permitted to grow its budget if its revenues grow in
managed care. They are awaiting the County’s action to increase the appropriation based on increased revenues
in managed care; that is expected to take place early in August. Once that happens, the System will present the
proposed transfers of funds to transfer that additional appropriation to the designated expense areas.
Chair Reiter expressed concerns about the way matters like this are reconciled; moving forward into the County
budget process, when Commissioners and their staff start looking back at these types of transactions, it can
sometimes be complicated to explain and is confusing. Mr. Elwell stated that one of the reasons for doing this
now is that this will change the FY2018 appropriation amount - in the budgeting process, there are three columns
of data for line items and accounts: FY2018 Appropriation, FY2018 Adjusted Appropriation, and FY2019
Budget. This makes things line up much better and would answer a lot of the questions that would otherwise be
asked, based on seeing wide gaps.
Board Chair Hammock, seconded by Chair Reiter, moved the approval of the
proposed transfers of funds. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer (continued)
During the discussion of the Income Statement on slide 4 of the presentation, Director Richardson-Lowry noted
that the System is perennially challenged regarding overtime; often, a discussion is held about what to do, but that
problem continues to impact the bottom line and presumably operations. She inquired whether there are any new
initiatives underway to address excessive overtime usage as the System goes into a new year.
Chair Reiter commented on the subject of overtime. He stated that when an organization has a unionized
workforce with collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) that have overtime provisions in them, it is a structural
factor that one knows about when they are going to budget, so it is not an unknown. That, to him, is irrelevant. It
is not the CBA or rules that drive overtime, it is the organization’s ability to catch up on the hiring and being able
to deal with the turnover, because the overtime number is driven by the fact that people have to work more
overtime because the organization is not meeting staffing needs.
Mr. Elwell also commented on the subject. Employees at the System, like other County employees, receive a
number of holidays that are not present in the healthcare industry; this organization still has to run the hospitals on
those designated County holidays, and that means everyone who works those days earns overtime. The System’s
overtime increases approximately $500,000 every pay period in which a weekday holiday takes place. He
believes that the System has overtime that is structural, but it does not have anything to do with unions, it has to
do with the fact that as a County organization, the System has more holidays that fall during the week that
necessitates more overtime pay. That element is budgeted. With regard to the element of overtime that the
administration thinks is controllable - some of it is definitely related to staffing up and call-offs, and some of it is
related to habit, and this is something that the administration is working to correct. Mr. Elwell provided
information on a new initiative that is expected to affect nursing overtime.
It was communicated to the
administration that some nurses now would rather work twelve (12) hour shifts and only have to come to work six
(6) days per pay period, as opposed to ten (10) days per pay period. So the administration is in the process of
transitioning positions to a .9 full-time equivalent (FTE) employee to accommodate that change for anyone who
wants it. It is believed that this will help us staff up and help drive some of the overtime down, by making the
organization more attractive to younger nurses who want to work here, because they are generally very open to
twelve (12) hour days.
During the discussion of the Financial Metrics on slide 6, Chair Reiter inquired regarding the figure for Days
Cash On Hand. He stated that his assumption is that the System is in a better situation now than last year, in
terms of the State budget impasse being over, and while the State is notoriously slow, they hit a complete full stop
for the two (2) years prior to this. Now the State has money to dispense, albeit not as quickly but more readily
than the previous two (2) years, so why is the Days Cash at Hand in a worse position than it was during State’s
budget impasse? He requested information explaining the reason for that difference. Mr. Akpan noted that the
2017 figure of 66 days was as of November 2017; the 31 days figure is as of the end of May 2018 – he should
have lined them up with the same month’s figures.
During the discussion of the information on Operating Margin on slide 6, after learning that this is calculated
by excluding pension expense and capitation, Board Chair Hammock indicated that he was not sure that this is
a meaningful number to inform the Committtee and Board. Mr. Akpan indicated that he will look for a peer
group more similar to this organization to use for comparison, which may make it more informative. Director
Junge asked him to inform the Committee of the composition of that peer group when he finds it.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer (continued)
During the discussion of the information on Average Age of Plant on slide 6, Chair Reiter indicated that
bringing new facilities online impacts the average age of the plant. He inquired as to how that number will be
affected once the additional clinics are brought online and new buildings are opened. Mr. Akpan guessed that
if the new asset addition is maybe $200 million, it would probably shave two (2) to three (3) years off the
average age of plant number. The new Professional Building would be included in this; however, the new
community-based clinics would not, because they are leased premises and are not System assets. When Mr.
Akpan indicated that Oak Forest is part of the System’s assets, Director Richardson-Lowry requested that this
information be footnoted on that slide.
The Committee discussed the subject of pension liability and costs. Chair Reiter expressed an interest in
obtaining a greater knowledge of the subject, as it is a critically important matter. Board Chair Hammock
recommended that the Committee have a special focus discussion on pension liability, after the budget is
passed, sometime after December.

VI.

Recommendations, Information/Discussion Item
A. Introduction to CCHHS FY2019 Preliminary Budget (Attachment #5)
Mr. Akpan provided an overview of the Introduction to the CCHHS FY2019 Preliminary Budget, which
included information on the following subjects:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

FY2019 Budget Drivers
FY2019 Service Improvements
FY2019 Projected Volume
FY2019 Revenue Drivers
County Health Fund Allocation
FY2019 Expenditure Drivers
Controlling Expenses
Critical Success Factors
FY2018 Budget
FY2019 Budget Calendar

Director Richardson-Lowry referenced information reviewed earlier during the review of Mr. Akpan’s
financial report regarding the uncompensated care-based trend areas. She requested that information on
compensable care-based trend areas be provided to the Committee through the Chair (or factor this
information into a future presentation), as it will be helpful, from a budgetary standpoint, to look at some
potential areas for opportunities.
Following the presentation, Chair Reiter noted that he would like to have further information on the budget
topics, so the Directors can provide context during budget discussions. He suggested that this be further
discussed at next week’s Board Meeting; what may be a good idea is to circulate information on this to the
Board.

VI. Recommendations, Information/Discussion Item (continued)
Director Richardson-Lowry stated that one (1) of the revenue drivers in the neighborhoods and clinics are the
women who bring their children or family members, so those budget topics that are on-trend with respect to
women’s health issues, whether it is breast health, cervical health, etc. are of interest to her. She would like to
hear more about those so the Board can see where the organization stands, where the revenue opportunities
may be, and how the organization is serving people. Director Junge noted that she would like to see a
mention of the System’s role in coordinated care in response to the opioid epidemic.
