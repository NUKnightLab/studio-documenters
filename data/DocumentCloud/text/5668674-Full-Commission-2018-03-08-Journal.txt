PRESENTATION OF PETITIONS, ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS
Pursuant to the Wayne County Commission Rules of Procedure, a Resolution of
Memoriam was read into the record in memory of former Wayne County Commissioner Burton
Leland. The resolution is listed below:
WHEREAS, it is with great sadness that we, the members of the Wayne County Commission,
solemnly pause and reflect on the life of a truly celebrated community servant and longtime member of the
Commission, BURTON LELAND, who passed away February 25, 2018, at age 69; and
WHEREAS, BURTON LELAND was born November 24, 1948, in Detroit, Michigan, and attended
Mumford High School before furthering his education at Wayne State University, where he was awarded a
business degree, and later at the University of Michigan, where he earned a master’s degree in social work; and
WHEREAS, a “dyed-in-the-wool Democrat” never fearing to express his opinion, BURTON
LELAND was passionate in his continuous fight to better the lives of his Wayne County constituents, being
personally responsible for neighborhood cleanups, organizing trash pickups, manicuring residential lawns and
fighting blight caused by abandoned homes, vacant lots, neglected parks and playgrounds and abandoned
businesses; and
WHEREAS, BURTON LELAND began his public service career in 1980 after being elected to the
Michigan House of Representatives, where he worked diligently on behalf of the children and families in northwest
Detroit for 16 years. From there, he won a seat in the Michigan Senate, where he proudly served from 1998 to
2006 before being elected to the Wayne County Commission in 2006. In addition to chairing the Commission’s
Committee on Government Operations, he served on the Committee on Ways and Means, Committee on
Economic Development and the Special Committee on Rules until his retirement from the Commission on
January 10, 2018; and
WHEREAS, BURTON LELAND will forever be remembered for his 11 years of faithful and
distinguished service to the Wayne County Commission and, in making family life his priority, will serve as an
inspiration to his loving and charming wife of 45 years, Rosanne, precious children Zach and Gabe, and adorable
granddaughter, Lillian;
Now therefore be it
RESOLVED, on this 8th day of March 2018, that this resolution endure as a lasting record of
acknowledgement and remembrance as the Wayne County Commission proudly recognizes the dedication and
devotion to public service by former commissioner BURTON LELAND, and that a suitably enrolled copy be
presented to the beloved Leland family. He will forever be remembered as a passionate and outspoken public
servant who fought hard for his constituents, and his spirit will always be present in our august body’s future
proceedings.
Members rose in support of the adoption of the resolution.
