Community Advisory Council Meeting
June 28, 2019
NOACA Offices
1299 Superior Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44114
Present: Please see the attached attendance record.
Ms. Barb Clint, Chair of Community Advisory Council (CAC), convened the meeting at
10:40 a.m.
Meeting Minutes of March 22, 2019
CAC did not have a quorum so no action was taken on the minutes.
Public Comments
No public comments were made at this meeting.
Executive Director’s Report
Ms. Grace Gallucci thanked CAC members for their service. She talked about the Irishtown
Bend project; NOACA’s INFRA Grant application for the project; and efforts made by the
Northeast Ohio delegation to get funding for the project. Ms. Gallucci encouraged CAC
members to reach out to their constituents to get support for the project. She informed
members that they will receive a one-page fact sheet about the project, delegation contact
list, and NOACA’s 2019 Legislative Agenda.
Project Planning Reviews (PPRs)/Intergovernmental Review and Consultation (IGRC);
1st Quarter State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2020
Mr. Ed May provided background on PPR and presented information on the following projects:
•

CUY – 43-1.98 (Widening Aurora Road from Solar Shopping Center Drive to
Liberty Road) – This project involves the following roadway improvements:
pavement resurfacing, minor widening, new traffic signal at Portz Parkway, 10’
multi-use path on the south side, bike lane westbound (5’ sidewalk) on the north
side, new water line and storm sewer. The total cost of this project is $8.1 million.
No NOACA funds will be used.

•

CUY IR 480 06.47/VAR Paint PID 22131 (Bridge Painting on IR-480 and SR10 in
Fairview Park and Cleveland) – This project involves painting the structural steel
of the bridges. The total cost of this project is $34.5 million. No NOACA funds will
be used.

•

Laketran Bus Replacement – Laketran is planning to purchase a new 35-foot zero
emissions battery electric transit bus which costs $783,500. Funds for the bus will

8267c

 come from the Diesel Emissions Reduction Grant (DERG) program and Laketran.
No NOACA funds will be used.
Mr. May reviewed project comments from NOACA staff and advisory councils.
SAVE Plan
Mr. Brian Blayney provided background on SAVE, which is NOACA’s strategic plan for
transportation safety. The goal of the plan is to reduce fatalities and serious injuries by 50%
by 2040; identify emphasis areas; and recommend strategies and actions.
Mr. Blayney reviewed the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Annual fatalities and serious injuries (2007-2017)
A comprehensive approach using the “6 E’s”
Fatalities and serious injuries by maintenance responsibility, local vs. state and
emphasis areas (chart)
Emphasis areas – targets and road departure 5-year average FSI trends
Emphasis areas - Strategy #1: Identity high crash intersections and other trends
through data collection and analysis; and Strategy #2: Promote the implementation of
proven and low-cost safety countermeasures

Mr. Blayney stated that NOACA staff will inform and coordinate the efforts of its safety partners
to build a better infrastructure, influence traveler behavior, and promote safer policies.
Mr. Lou Serrano asked if roadway departure is when drivers come off the highway.
Ms. Gallucci said yes.
Ms. Clint asked if roadway departure also includes turn movements in driveways. Mr. Blayney
stated that roadway departure is when someone departs (left or right) from a travel lane and
sometimes hit an obstruction, such as a utility pole, ditch, or culvert.
Ms. Clint asked how will the SAVE Plan interface with the City of Cleveland’s Vision Zero
initiative.
Mr. Blayney mentioned that he is on the Vision Zero Task Force and the Data and Evaluation
Subcommittee. He noted that Ms. Melissa Thompson, NOACA staff, is on the Vision Zero
Design Subcommittee; and Ms. Kate Moening, NOACA staff, is on the Vision Zero Education
and Outreach Subcommittee.
Mr. Bill Harper asked if the reduction in state funding for local municipalities contributed to the
reduction in law enforcement capabilities. Mr. Blayney said NOACA staff did not look at the
reduction in funding when developing the plan.
Mr. Harper mentioned that the reduction in funding has caused Lorain County to reduce the
number of law enforcement officers, who enforce traffic laws, and has made it difficult to
maintain the infrastructure.
Ms. Mary Warren commented on the high rate of speed some motorists drive on Route 2.
She noted that police presence is needed on the route.

 Ms. Gallucci stated that NOACA created the Safety and Operations Unit to address issues
like the one mentioned by Ms. Warren.
Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Program Update
Mr. Mike Kubek stated that the TLCI program provides $2 million annually for projects (up to
$500,000 for planning studies and $1.5 million for implementation projects). He noted that
this year, applications will be accepted from August to October 2019.
Mr. Kubek reviewed the planning studies done in 2017, 2018, and 2019 and the following
improvements made to the program:
•
•
•

Addition of TLCI implementation project applicant interviews
Stronger coordination with the City of Cleveland Planning Commission on project
applications
Stronger coordination with the City of Cleveland Mayor’s Office of Capital Projects on
TLCI implementation project applications and execution

Mr. Kubek reminded CAC members that at the meeting in February, NOACA staff presented
the TLCI solicitation process and the City of Cleveland Planning Commission presented its
process to partner with stakeholders and select needs to be included in NOACA TLCI
applications. CAC members at that time said they would be willing to communicate the TLCI
project solicitation to local stakeholders.
Mr. Kubek stated that a tailored project solicitation will be made to CAC and will include
guidance on how to explain the process to interested parties looking to pursue project
consideration.
Mr. Kubek said NOACA staff will continue to work with local communities to develop
implementable planning studies that provide a vision with an implementation plan on how to
integrate the TLCI program objectives into the communities.
Mr. Serrano asked staff to provide an example of an environmental justice objective.
Mr. Kubek stated that the purpose of environmental justice is to make sure burdens and
benefits are shared equally. He noted that in the past, there has been a history of unfair
practices. For example, years ago, the highway system was put in areas that had the
cheapest properties, but the transportation benefits were too skewed and did not benefit lowincome people.
Ms. Clint asked if TLCI planning funds are sometimes carried over to the next year. Mr. Kubek
said yes and noted that staff evaluates the merits of each project and in some cases, planning
studies awarded funds do not get done, so the money is carried over.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that some CAC members expressed concern with the TLCI process,
such as the public not having a say in what projects are approved by NOACA or the public
not being able to provide input into the project selection. Ms. Gallucci asked Mr. Kubek to talk
about the changes made to the TLCI process for the next round.
Mr. Kubek stated that advisory council members will be provided with a link to the applications
weeks in advance so they can comment on projects and/or share the link with others who may
want to provide comments.
8267c

1-3

 Ms. Gallucci stated that some communities may not know what projects to submit to NOACA,
may not be aware of the TLCI program, or may not agree with the projects submitted to
NOACA. She asked Mr. Kubek to comment on how the TLCI process will be more
comprehensive.
Ms. Kelley Britt stated that CAC members were not aware that each community has its own
process, so a representative of the City of Cleveland was invited to the meeting to explain the
city’s process. CAC members wanted to understand how they could take what they learned
from the City of Cleveland and share that information with people in their communities.
Ms. Clint mentioned there was some discussion at the meeting about getting input from
smaller organizations so their projects would not get missed.
Ms. Gallucci stated that NOACA needs to think about what it can do region wide to ensure
every community has an opportunity to apply and receive a TLCI grant. She noted that at a
previous CAC meeting, some members suggested that NOACA make the public process part
of the TLCI process. Ms. Gallucci said one option would be to require applicants to hold a
public meeting/hearing prior to applying for a TLCI grant. She asked staff if the public process
was discussed at the meeting in February. Ms. Britt said no.
Ms. Warren asked if public meetings are held in the communities. Ms. Gallucci said public
meetings are currently held after projects have been selected and noted that some
communities are not aware of the TLCI program or process, so NOACA needs to do a better
job of helping communities solicit projects.
Ms. Erika Anthony asked if NOACA has the authority to mandate municipalities to host a public
meeting.
Ms. Gallucci said yes and noted that it could be done during the application process. She
also said NOACA requires a resolution from a governing body (administration and city council)
to demonstrate that there is full support of an application. Ms. Gallucci talked about various
issues that have come up in communities with respect to a project and/or TLCI grant.
Ms. Warren asked staff to provide CAC with dates and locations of future public meetings so
members can share that information with others.
Ms. Clint inquired about the local match for a TLCI grant. Ms. Gallucci said NOACA no longer
requires a local match for a TLCI grant.
Coordinated Public Transit Human Services Transportation Plan
Ms. Sarah White provided background on the Coordinated Plan; discussed the public
outreach that was done; talked about how feedback was gathered from various sources and
goals were developed for the future and strategies for implementation. She mentioned that
NOACA is the designated recipient of FTA Section 5310 program funds for the Cleveland
Urbanized Area (UZA). Currently, NOACA directs at least 60% of the funds to transit agencies
and up to 40% of the funds to other specialized transportation providers. NOACA will use the
Coordinated Plan as an evaluation tool to prioritize Section 5310 funding and guide current
and future regional needs.

8267c

 Ms. White mentioned that the NOACA Board of Directors approved Mobilize: Accessibility for
Independence as the Coordinated Public Transit-Human Services Transportation Plan for
Northeast Ohio for the years 2019-2022.
Air Quality Forecast and Advisories
Ms. Mara Caputo stated that NOACA forecasts daily peak eight-hour ground-level ozone
concentrations and fine particulate matter concentrations. In 2019, daily forecasts for ozone
began on March 1 and will conclude on October 31. Daily forecasts for fine particulate matter
are year-round. NOACA posts daily air quality forecasts through AirNowTech, in affiliation
with U.S. EPA.
Ms. Caputo stated that NOACA’s ground-level ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
forecasts are based on a review of several meteorological variables and model guidance.
Ms. Caputo reviewed the forecast performance of ozone for the NOACA region in 2019. She
stated that NOACA’s forecasts for good/moderate threshold were correct 68% of the time and
the forecasts for moderate/unhealthy threshold were correct 100% of the time.
Ms. Caputo stated that the forecast performance of ozone was as follows for the period of
March 1 - May 31, 2019:
Agency
NOACA
NOAA (6Z/12Z)

50 ppb
85%
(89/89)%

70 ppb
100%
(100/100)%

Ms. Caputo stated that NOACA staff will continue to track the forecast performance of ozone
for NOACA and NOAA; track the forecast performance of particulate matter for NOACA only;
collaborate with NOAA personnel to report model performance in Northeast Ohio; and provide
the Air Quality Subcommittee and advisory councils with updates as necessary.
Mr. Harper asked if air quality forecasting changes people’s behavior. Ms. Caputo said it will
take some time to see if NOACA’s educational campaign impacts people’s behavior.
Mission Advancement Initiatives
Ms. Danielle Render stated that the division of External Engagement and Public Affairs will
support CAC with its 2019 focus areas.
Ms. Render mentioned that an External Affairs Operating model has been developed to focus
on several areas built around the following:
•
•
•
•

Roles and responsibilities
Leadership
Organizational structure
Communications, advocacy, public engagement and efforts to build stronger
stakeholders relationships

Ms. Render provided an overview of the platform NOACA is looking to create. She asked
CAC members if they would be willing to serve on a working committee to assist NOACA with
devising a plan of action and discuss how they can help NOACA connect to community
organizations; provide direction to facilitate ongoing engagements; and elevate NOACA’s
position and priorities.
8267c

1-5

 Ms. Render stated that the working committee could have a brainstorming session at NOACA
offices or by conference call. She noted that the goals are to have a purpose, leverage
NOACA’s network, maintain ongoing communication, provide guidance and support, bridge
new ideas and strategic initiatives, and provide a stronger link with both local and national
communities.
Ms. Render stated that building relationships to support legislative needs will help NOACA
deliver its mission and strategic plans to its network and create opportunities for partnerships.
She mentioned that there are no financial impacts and the next steps involve staff setting up
a working meeting in July-October; creating an agenda for CAC discussions; leveraging a
network/introducing a detailed plan in September; and having ongoing communications / an
event to support the agenda / plan.
Ms. Anthony, Mr. Harper and Ms. Clint agreed to be on the working committee.
Ms. Clint suggested that staff send out an email to other CAC members, who were unable to
attend this meeting, to see if they would be interested in being on the working committee.
Mr. Harper asked if CAC members should bring their marketing people to the working
committee meeting. Ms. Render said yes and noted that it would be helpful to hear other
perspectives.
Ms. Warren asked staff to provide her with the date, time and place of the meeting so she can
share that information with the League of Women Voters.

In reference to Goal #5, Ms. Bishara Addison asked if NOACA is targeting a series of public
policies or best practices used by communities to promote cleaner air.
Ms. Caputo stated that NOACA staff is looking at policies and practices that have been
successful in the communities. Ms. Gallucci added that NOACA will include anti-idling
legislation in its Air Quality Programs and will help communities develop legislation at the
council level.
Mr. Joe MacDonald mentioned that some communities in the region currently have an antiidling ordinance that NOACA would like to see implemented widely. He noted that staff would
also work on enforcement to ensure there are teeth put behind the legislation.
Ms. Christine Matusik-Plas asked about the role of the health departments in NOACA’s
Communications Plan. Ms. Caputo stated that NOACA will collaborate with public health
departments on the messaging since they are able to reach a lot of communities.

Phase 4: Project Development Cost and Schedule

Mr. Justin Bibb asked how far away the Hyperloop will be implemented. Ms. Sarli stated that
Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) has a test track in Toulouse, France and is
planning to build a track in Abu Dhabi for the 2020 Expo.
Mr. Bibb asked who, locally, will pay for the Hyperloop. Ms. Sarli stated that the Hyperloop,
fuel, maintenance and staff will be paid mostly by the private sector.
Mr. Bibb asked if NOACA looked at the investment priority of the Hyperloop versus local transit
needs.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the Hyperloop would not compete against public transit for funding
since the two are separate forms of transportation. She said there is an intrinsic partnership
between Hyperloop and public transit systems, which need to be part of the process. She
said there has been some discussion about including a ticket fee for public transit as part of
the Hyperloop travel. Public transit agencies would be able to participate in the Hyperloop
and get some subsidy for their systems and hopefully take up capacity at no additional cost
moving forward.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the Hyperloop will be funded primarily by the private sector, while
standards, safety policies, regulations would be funded by the public sector. She noted that
pricing, fare structures, and fixed guideway structure should not impact public transit funding.
Mr. Bibb asked if local transit systems are involved in the Hyperloop discussion to ensure
there is interconnection between the two models. Ms. Gallucci said yes and noted that transit
systems are represented on the Technical Advisory Committees.
Ms. Addison asked what the difference is including cost between high speed rail and
Hyperloop.
Ms. Gallucci stated that there are similarities between high speed rail and the Hyperloop
because of the guideway. She said the Hyperloop would be twice as fast as high speed rail,
would transport people differently, the mechanics would work differently, the cost to transport
would be less, the cost to build the Hyperloop would be less, would produce more energy than
it consumes; the pods would depart every 45 seconds and would be uniquely designed/
configured.
Ms. Addison asked why there is a connection between Chicago, Cleveland and Pittsburgh
versus a connection between Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati. Ms. Gallucci stated that
the connection between Chicago, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh was proposed to the private
sector because of the Great Lakes. She noted that Phase II and Phase III of the feasibility
study include connections to other cities including Columbus and Cincinnati

8354c

 Ms. Addison asked if the Hyperloop is more energy efficient and better for the environment
than alternative options. Ms. Gallucci said yes and explained how energy would be saved.
Ms. Laura Toth asked why there was no stop in Sandusky on the Hyperloop map since Cedar
Point is a big tourist attraction.
Ms. Gallucci stated that there will be a stop in Sandusky and will be included in the pilot
segment. She noted, however, that Sandusky was not included on the map because people
travel to the city seasonally, not year round. She explained how one Hyperloop pod will stop
at one location while the other pods continue on to other locations.
Ms. Addison asked if construction workers will receive training to build the Hyperloop. She
also asked about the timeline to build the Hyperloop.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the requirements to build the Hyperloop are similar to a highway or
rail system. She said there has been some discussion about manufacturing the Hyperloop in
Northeast Ohio or another area of the Midwest.
Mr. Bibb asked how much money did the public sector invested in the Hyperloop. Ms. Gallucci
said the private and public sectors each invested $600,000. Mr. Bibb asked what the cost
would be to build the Hyperloop. Ms. Gallucci stated that the proposed investment would be
billions of dollars.
Ms. Matusik-Plas asked staff to talk about the user’s experience at the King’s Cross Station
in London. Ms. Sarli said she could not comment on the user’s experience, but noted that the
train that travels from London to Attenborough is very well used.
SFY 2021-2024 TIP Projects Recommended for NOACA Funding
Mr. Randy Lane stated that NOACA is in the process of developing its SFY 2021-2024 TIP.
He noted that the TIP contains road, bridge, public transit and other transportation projects
scheduled for implementation and includes projects supported by federal funds through
NOACA, ODOT and transit agencies. Mr. Lane mentioned that over 700 potential projects
were identified through a comprehensive planning process. He noted that approved projects
represent the priorities in the LRTP and align with asset management and performance
measures initiatives. Mr. Lane reviewed the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Project Prioritization – STBG, TAP and CMAQ Programs
Regional priority
Approved projects to receive STBG, TAP, and CMAQ Program funds
NOACA funding by general project type is a total of $148.6 million)
Impact of approved projects

Mr. Lane stated that staff will work with the sponsors of approved projects to finalize the
scopes, schedules and fiscal constraint for inclusion in the SFY 2021-2024 TIP. He noted
that the final draft TIP will be presented to the Planning and Programming Committee for
review on January 17, 2020 and then to the Board for approval on March 6, 2020.
Ms. Gallucci thanked CAC members who advocated for the INFRA grant for the Irishtown
Bend project.

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

November 27, 2019

RE:

Planning Reviews (PPRs)/ Intergovernmental Review and Consultation (IGRC); 3rd
Quarter State Fiscal Year 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
Attached are PPR summary documents for the proposed project to be presented to the NOACA
Transportation Subcommittee, Planning and Programming Committee and Executive Committee for review
and recommendation.
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federal-aid
transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and federal
requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff; Board, including committees, subcommittees, and
councils: intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC); and public involvement. The end product of
PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPRs is
included on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained
from the public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed
projects are posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the project sponsor will be notified that their project has completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with the project sponsor to address any planning issues identified during PPR.

Attachments: Project Summary

Improvements along Cleveland Avenue in Elyria
Title: Improvements along Cleveland Avenue in Elyria
Sponsor: City of Elyria
Estimated Total Cost: $7,206,891
Proposed Source of Federal Funds: ODOT and NOACA
History/Background: The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) Safety program provides
funds to ODOT and local governments for highway safety treatments or corrective activity
designed to alleviate a safety problem or a potentially hazardous situation. The program is
funded at approximately $100 million annually. Priority is given to those projects with
recommended activities/countermeasures that improve safety at roadway locations with a high
frequency, severity, and rate of crashes.
There are two application cycles per year. Applications must be signed off by the respective
ODOT District Safety Review Team. A safety engineering study must typically accompany the
application unless the application is for preliminary engineering funds to complete the study.
The following project was selected for Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) funding.
The NOACA Board of Directors adopted Resolution 2019-045 approving the projects to be
funded with NOACA administered Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) funding and
STBG set-asides for Transportation Alternatives Projects (TAP) for the state fiscal year (SFY)
2021 – 2024 Transportation Improvement Program. The projects recommended for NOACA
funding included rehabilitation of Cleveland Street, in the City of Elyria.
Proposed Project: LOR CR-658 - 00.00 (CLEVELAND ST): PID No. 110986 - This project
involves rehabilitation along Cleveland Street, from East Bridge Street and Gulf Road to
Hawthorne Street in Elyria (maps and illustrations). The work will include full and partial depth
pavement repair, resurfacing, replacement of curbs, deteriorated culverts and roadway drainage
catch basins, and installation of a roadway underdrain system and conduit. The City will also
implement a road diet, reducing the number of lanes along Cleveland Avenue, from four (4)
through lanes to three (3) lanes (one lane in each direction and a center turn lane).
According to the sponsor, the number of curb cuts will be minimized, access point locations will
be controlled and bicycle lanes will be possible. The project will also include crosswalks, ADA
(Americans with Disabilities) ramps, intersection improvements, new sidewalk, lighting and the
creation of bicycle lanes. The project will also include pavement markings, signage and the
replacement of the traffic signal at the intersection of Olive Street and possibly Gulf Road. Traffic
calming measures will also be considered with the project including curb bump-outs and
contrasting pavements. The project will also involve improvements to the intersection at East
Bridge Street/Cleveland Street with four-leg non-circular roundabout.
The STBG funding is dedicated to the roadway rehabilitation component of the project. The HSIP
funding is dedicated to the road diet and roundabout components of the project.
The project’s estimated total cost is $7,206,891. The estimated cost of preliminary engineering
preliminary development (PEPD) is $352,952. The estimated cost of preliminary engineering
detailed design (PEDD) is $173,842. The estimated cost of right-of-way (RW) is $300,000. The
PEPD, PEDD and RW will be funded with HSIP funds ($744,115) and local funds ($82,679). The
estimated cost of construction (CO) is $5,900,097. The CO will be funded with STBG funds
($3,329,686), HSIP funds ($1,255,885) and local funds ($1,314,527). The estimated cost of
construction engineering (CE) is $480,000. The CE will be locally funded.

 Staff Comment (Summary):
RECOMMENDATION:
o A transition for the bike lane into the roundabout should be provided, such as wide
sidewalks/shared use paths and signage for bike traffic moving through the roundabout
intersection.
o Consider utilizing ladder-style crosswalk markings across Cleveland Street, in addition to
the contrasting pavement. The visual contrast of a differing pavement type tends to fade
over time, and ladder-style markings would maintain the safety benefit of a high-visibility
crosswalk. (Example: see West 25th Street and Detroit Avenue intersection crosswalks).
o Consider utilizing the center turn lane to create median refuge islands to improve the
safety of crosswalks along the corridor. Median refuge islands are an FHWA Proven
Safety Countermeasure.
o The work summarized in this PPR will occur within two subwatersheds: 1) Black River
Mainstem and Jackson Ditch-East Branch Black River. According to Ohio EPA’s 2018
Integrated Report (IR) Watershed Assessment Unit (WAU) summary, sampling results
along the Black River Mainstems subwatershed indicate that the river is in full and partial
attainment of its Aquatic Life Uses (ALUs). The WAU lists the causes of impairment as
due to nutrients and conductivity modifications associated with municipal point source
discharges. According to the 2018 IR WAUs, the Jackson Ditch-East Branch Black River
subwatershed's sampling sites are in full, partial and nonattainment due to
sedimentation/siltation due to natural causes (Black River falls) NOACA staff
recommends that ODOT maintain stormwater runoff on-site for as long as possible to
keep nonpoint source pollutants from reaching the Black River. NOACA staff also
recommends that ODOT consider incorporating habitat restoration along the river
wherever possible.

RE:

Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and discussion only.
BACKGROUND
NOACA's Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Program provides assistance to
communities for integrated transportation and land use planning and projects that strengthen community
livability. TLCI advances the goals of NOACA’s Regional Strategic Plan by:
• Developing transportation projects that provide more travel options
• Promoting reinvestment in underutilized or vacant/abandoned properties
• Supporting economic development
• Ensuring that the benefits of growth and change are available to all members of a community
• Enhancing regional cohesion
• Providing people with safe and reliable transportation choices
The TLCI Program has two components: The TLCI Planning Studies Program and the TLCI Implementation
Program. The TLCI Planning Studies Program assists communities to develop transportation planning studies
that facilitate and promote sustainable development, multimodal transportation, and complete and green
streets. The TLCI Implementation Program provides funding assistance for communities to implement priority
projects identified in TLCI or TLCI-like community developed plans.
This year NOACA is soliciting applications for its Planning Study program that promote regional
benefit. Applications for community-based planning studies that do not provide a larger regional benefit
are not considered to be eligible. Examples of studies that provide a regional benefit and that are being
considered this round by NOACA are:
• Downtown Cleveland Transportation Connectivity Study
• Regional Metroparks Trails/Transportation Connections Study
• Regional Lakefront Transportation Connections Study
An application round was opened for both planning studies and implementation projects on August 29, 2019.
On October 11, 2019, NOACA received 20 requests for funding: 4 planning study requests totaling about
$476,000 in funding and 16 implementation project requests totaling about $4.8 million in funding. NOACA’s

5 - 11

 anticipated three regional planning study projects total $700,000 in funding. All requests are being evaluated
based on the criteria established in the TLCI Policy. Projects requested for both the planning studies and
implementation projects are attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is $2 million in available funding for the 2020 TLCI program. The TLCI program is funded by an annual
set aside from NOACA’s Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) funds during the development of
NOACA’s annual Overall Work Program and biennial Transportation Improvement Program.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Input received from the Council will be incorporated into the application evaluations.

RE:

Membership Expansion of Advisory Councils

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and discussion only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Governance Committee recently discussed expanding the membership of the Advisory Councils to
include emerging future leaders, which will advance the Charter count from 15 to 18 members.
The purpose of expanding the membership count to the Councils will allow emerging professionals
opportunities to help advance and reinforce NOACA’s mission and agenda. The inclusion of emerging
future leaders is expected to help spark new ideas, approaches and perspectives for growing NOACA’s
stakeholder and community connections, especially targeting specific messages to other future leaders.
The request includes the expansion of three seats for each council. The future leaders will help the Council
build and enhance relationships with various government agencies and subdivisions, the media and
general public. NOACA advisory councils, whose make-up of business representatives, the general public
and large groups affected by transportation decisions, could better inform the Committee’s
recommendations to the NOACA Board of Directors and enhance NOACA’s advocacy on infrastructurerelated and environmental issues.
The Councils help monitor community reactions to agency policy, proposals, and progress early in the
planning process, and supplement the public involvement activities that NOACA staff performs. The
Council also assist the External Affairs Committee in developing agency policies for outreach to the
public, business and rural communities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact at this time.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
The External Affairs Committee and NOACA staff will recruit members for each advisory council and
establish meeting schedules.

RE:

SAVE: NOACA’s Plan for Transportation Safety

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND
NOACA has recently completed SAVE Plan; NOACA’s Plan for Transportation Safety. The purpose of the
SAVE Plan is to save lives in the NOACA region by identifying actions to reduce the most severe crashes
that too often result in fatalities and serious injuries. The SAVE Plan was developed with the vision that traffic
deaths and injuries can be prevented with appropriate planning, policies and programs, with a long-term goal
of reducing the number of fatalities and serious injuries by 50% by the year 2040. The SAVE Plan provides
direction that will enable NOACA and others to work together to set goals and work toward the vision this
Plan establishes for the region.
Achieving a safer transportation network requires addressing the interaction among the infrastructure,
vehicles and the skill and behavior of travelers. The SAVE Plan incorporates a “6 E’s” approach into the safety
planning process, acknowledging the key roles that engineering, education, enforcement, emergency
response, evaluation, and equity all play in preventing severe crashes and saving lives. After evaluating 10
years of crash data to identify trends, ten emphasis areas associated with fatal and serious injury crashes
were identified.

At the meeting, the presentation will provide more detail about the Plan. The full Plan is available on NOACA’s
website at this link.
In order to influence emphasis areas closely associated with driver behavior, the Ohio Traffic Safety Office
(OTSO) and ODOT work together to develop a rolling calendar of safety campaign messaging to raise public
awareness on specific emphasis areas and initiatives promoted by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA). Typically these campaigns involve messaging pushed out via social media and
press releases, supported with messaging by ODOT on freeway message boards, and often coupled with
increased enforcement. The full OTSO safety calendar may be viewed on their website at this link.
NOACA encourages local public safety partners to be aware of broad safety campaign messaging and to use
campaign materials provided by Traffic Safety Marketing and ODOT (including the “Your Move” campaign) to
educate and encourage road users in their jurisdictions to obey traffic laws and practice safer behaviors.
Continuing support of education and outreach programs is necessary to make and continue positive changes
in behavior of the traveling public. At the national level, significant reductions have been made in reducing
the rate of fatalities for unbelted motorists (reduced from 54% to 48% between 2007 to 2016) and alcoholimpaired driving fatalities (reduced from 32% to 28% between 2007 to 2016); however, both emphasis areas
still comprise a large fraction of all crash fatalities. (Source: Terry Shelton, Associate Administrator, National
Center for Statistics and Analysis, “2016 Fatal Crash Overview” presented on December 14, 2017.)
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
NOACA will develop and support key initiatives in partnership with other organizations to advance safe
projects and to encourage safer traveler behavior. Agencies within the NOACA region are encouraged to
assist the Ohio Traffic Safety Office with maximizing impact of statewide message campaigns by crosspromoting these messages at the community level.
