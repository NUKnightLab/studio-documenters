 Journal of Proceedings
Board of Commissioners

January 18, 2017

WHEREAS, the Cook County Commission on Social Innovation was established via ordinance, April of
2016, and codified as Chapter 14, Article IX Sections 14-89 to 14-97 to develop policy recommendations
for the Cook County Board of Commissioners on matters related to economic development that address
divestment and or disinvestment in areas within the Cook County region; and
WHEREAS, the Commission has found through the Cook County Long Range Transportation Plan that
improved and expanded passenger train service is essential to maintain Cook County’s economic vitality
and allow for increased growth and prosperity; and
WHEREAS, finding major transportation projects that can unite the county’s economy, by linking
business centers to housing centers, convention centers and tourism destinations in order to connect
disconnected populations should take precedence; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has ceased the diversion of Motor Fuel Tax funds; and
WHEREAS, the Commission on Social Innovation’s committee on Public Capital learned of the
Metropolitan High Speed Rail Association’s Cross-Rail Chicago proposal, and collectively introduced it
to the overall Commission on Social Innovation on October 20th of 2016; and
WHEREAS, the Cross-Rail Chicago plan seeks to connect the tens of thousands of unemployed and
underemployed residents living in the south and west sides to jobs available in and around O’Hare

WHEREAS, the Cross-Rail Chicago plan seeks to affirm the county’s place as financial, business and
cultural capital of the Midwest by attracting ridership from millions of tourists and visitors every year;
and
WHEREAS, Cross-Rail Chicago proposes coordination between the Chicago Transit Authority, Pace
and Metra to create a unified, county-wide transportation network that may be piloted through the
expansion of the Metra Electric line, the Metra North Central service to O’hare via existing connections
through Union Station, and the 16th Street tracks that would allow for direct rides from South Cook
County to Northwest Cook County; and
WHEREAS, increasing the number of Metra trains, and connecting Metra lines together to Pace and
Chicago Transit Authority bus lines would significantly improve service for Cook County; and
WHEREAS, such coordination could also provide access to and through Cook County for Amtrak and
other trains transporting visitors to the region resulting in broader positive impact for the nation; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Commission on Social Innovation unanimously voted in favor of
encouraging the County of Cook to conduct such feasibility study of Metra Electric on December 18th,

Summary: The proposed amendment exercises the second year renewal option available in the Cook
County contract with Sentinel Offender services, LLC for electronic monitoring and Global Positioning
System (GPS) services for the Adult Probation Department and Juvenile Probation and Court Services
Department minor and adult clients who are ordered by the court to wear electronic monitoring devices.
Sentinel provides GPS monitoring equipment and services for adult probationers and pretrial defendants
in order to comply with Public Act 95-0773, also known as the Cindy Bischof Law, which calls for the
monitoring of certain domestic violence offenders through GPS technology. The law allows the court to
order adults charged with certain domestic violence offenses to be monitored electronically by the Adult
Probation Department Home Confinement Unit as a condition of bail or probation. Offenders are
ordered to wear a GPS tracking device to help monitor compliance with orders to stay away from the
complaining witness, the complaining witness’s home/workplace, or any other protected address
specified. There are currently more than 210 adults under GPS monitoring and 110 victims who carry
GPS devices to create mobile exclusion zones. Effective on 1/1/2015, new legislation (Public Act
98-1012, 725 ILCS 5/110-5) significantly expanded the types of charges required to be considered for
GPS monitoring as a condition of bail.
GPS technology is also used by the Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department to monitor
high-risk minors in home confinement as an alternative to secure detention or as a condition of release
into the community. These devices are deployed at various points of the judicial process from preadjudication through post-dispositional stages of court proceedings. As of late December 2016, there are
more than 275 court-involved youth under GPS electronic surveillance, 60% of whom are on pretrial
status.
The contract was awarded through the Request for Proposals (RFP) process in accordance with the Cook
County Procurement Code. Sentinel Offender Services, LLC. was awarded this contract based on
established evaluation criteria.

have been purchased for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the

justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 8; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in
whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify
finding the property is deemed abandoned; and

WHEREAS, the municipality states the Class 8 is necessary for development to occur on this specific real
estate. The municipal Resolution cites the qualifications of this property to meet the definition of abandoned
with special circumstances; and
WHEREAS, commercial real estate is normally assessed at 25% of its market value, qualifying commercial
real estate eligible for the Class 8 can receive a significant reduction in the level of assessment from the
date that new construction or rehabilitation has been completed, or in the case of abandoned property from
the date of substantial re-occupancy. Properties receiving Class 8 will be assessed at 10% of the market
value for 10 years, 15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the County
of Cook, that the President and Board of Commissioners validate the above-captioned property is deemed
abandoned with special circumstances under the Class 8; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to forward a

to enter into a contract with Wex Bank, Inc. This contract, which is administered by the Sheriff’s
Office, will allow various County Agencies to make fuel card purchases for the County’s vehicle fleet.
The Sheriff’s Office worked with the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer to solicit bids twice for
