EXPLANATION
The Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago (hereinafter “The Boys and Girls Clubs”) provides programs for
children in an area of the City that needs a safe place for the children. The Boys and Girls Clubs have
over 50 years of service at Chicago Housing Authority properties such as Henry Horner, Robert Taylor,
Lathrop Homes, and Washington Park. In this particular south side neighborhood (Washington Park),
there is a lack of existing services available to the community. The Boys and Girls Clubs continued
partnership with the Chicago Housing Authority, at the Yancey Boys and Girls Club within the
Washington Park community, will ensure the delivery of these much needed programs.
The Chicago Housing Authority supports The Boys and Girls Clubs’ mission to enable all young
participants to reach their full potential as productive, caring, and responsible citizens. The Boys and
Girls Clubs’ programs deal with character and leadership development, health and life skills, the arts,
fitness, sports, and recreation, as well as music, dance, drama, photography, and sports camps. The Boys
and Girls Clubs have committed to provide to the Chicago Housing Authority an annual report that will
highlight the number of participants and success of their programs at the Yancey Boys and Girl Club
location.
The Boys and Girls Clubs will contract for preventative maintenance at the Yancey Boys and Girl Club
location on an annual preventative maintenance schedule (which will be shared with the Chicago Housing
Authority). All utilities will be contracted for and paid for by The Boys and Girls Clubs.
Based upon the foregoing, it is recommended that the Board of Commissioners authorize the submission
of a disposition application to HUD for the property located at 6245 S. Wabash Avenue and authorize the
execution of a long-term lease with The Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago for a base term of three (3)
years with a five (5) year option, subject to HUD disposition approval. The monthly rent for the term(s) of
the Lease shall be $100.00.
