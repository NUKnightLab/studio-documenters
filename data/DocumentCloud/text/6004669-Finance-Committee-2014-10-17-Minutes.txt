III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Board Chairman Hammock inquired as to the reason why all of the requests (with the exception of the grantrelated items, which do not require review by Contract Compliance) were pending review by Contract
Compliance. Ms. Besenhofer responded that Contract Compliance staff have received the contracts but have
not been able to complete the work necessary to finalize their review; they are doing their best to complete this
work as soon as possible. The Director of the Office of Contract Compliance has been trying to hire another
person to handle the CCHHS contracts, but they have not yet been successful; she noted that they have been
trying to recruit for that position for a year.
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, provided additional information. The administration has had
conversations with the Chairman of the County Board’s Contract Compliance Committee as recently as this
past month; concerns were expressed about the exact issues that have been raised today. Dr. Shannon stated
that the Chairman of that Committee is highly motivated to get the position filled. The System will be funding
the position, which will be located downtown in the Office of Contract Compliance; this person will work
directly with the Director of the Office of Contract Compliance, and will work closely with Ms. Besenhofer.
Part of the reason for the delay in filling the position is that, initially, it was determined that the salary for the
position was too low; they are working to address that.
With regard to request number 1, information was provided to respond to a request made by Director
Velasquez at the October 3rd Board Meeting; she had requested the list of partners that are part of the grant.
With regard to request number 3, Director Gugenheim noted that there is a media campaign referenced in the
transmittal that is associated with the grant. She asked whether a contract relating to the media campaign will
be brought back to the Board for approval, or whether approval for that is included in the acceptance of the
grant. Ms. Besenhofer responded that a contract for the provision of those services will be a separate item
coming back for approval by the Board.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 5. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the conditional approval of
request number 6, pending completion of review by Contract Compliance. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the conditional approval of
request number 7, pending completion of review by Contract Compliance. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the conditional approval of

Note: Request number 8 was withdrawn from consideration at the October 31,
2014 Board Meeting, due to its pending status with regard to review by Contract
Compliance.

request number 9, pending completion of review by Contract Compliance. THE

B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the conditional approval of
request number 10, pending completion of review by Contract Compliance. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the conditional approval of
request number 11, pending completion of review by Contract Compliance. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
With regard to request number 12, Ms. Besenhofer indicated that a correction to the term of the contract needs
to be made. She stated that the term of the contract should be July 1, 2014 through September 31, 2017. Note:
following the meeting, those dates were further revised to reflect the final corrected term of the proposed
thirty-six (36) month contract, which is July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2017.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the conditional approval of
request number 12, as amended, pending completion of review by Contract
Compliance. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the conditional approval of
request number 13, pending completion of review by Contract Compliance. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the conditional approval of
request number 14, pending completion of review by Contract Compliance. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
With regard to request number 15, Director Gugenheim inquired whether the contract amount is based on
actuarial data. Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, responded that the calculation is based on
the membership at the rates that the State has under its contract with DentaQuest. Approximately $87,000 of
the $3 million is directly paid to DentaQuest for administrative services, and the rest is used to reimburse the
dental providers on a fee-for-service basis as they receive the claims.
In response to a question from Director Wiese regarding the scope of services, in terms of adult dental care,
Mr. Glass stated that, in 2011, the State Legislature passed the Saving Medicaid Access and Resources
Together (SMART) Act; included in that bill was a reduction or elimination of adult dental benefits for
Medicaid beneficiaries. Through community advocacy and medical community efforts, it was demonstrated
that, by not having that access, additional costs were being incurred and Medicaid beneficiaries were not as
healthy because they could not get access to dental care. The reinstatement of services included dental
cleanings, as well as some restorative services. He noted that the Medicaid benefits for dental are fairly
limited. In the CountyCare Plan, they have added an additional benefit above and beyond what the State
requires; if the State benefit allows for one (1) or two (2) annual cleanings, CountyCare allows for three (3) or
four (4) annual cleanings. In response to a question from Director Wiese regarding how many people this
estimate really covers, Mr. Glass stated that the estimate is based on the current CountyCare membership of
approximately 100,000 members over the course of twelve (12) months.

III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
In response to Director Gugenheim’s question regarding who assumes the risk under this arrangement, Mr.
Glass responded that the Health Plan is at risk for the cost of the services. When Public Act 98-0651 was
passed in July to restore dental services, there was an increase made to the PMPM to help offset these
additional expenses. The administration has had to build this based on the State’s history with DentaQuest,
and through their experience with the Medicaid program. He stated that he will commit to provide updates to
the Committee regarding what the spend is looking like and how it is moving.
Director Junge inquired regarding the relationship of these services to the work that the System’s own dentists
provide; she asked why the System is not hiring its own dentists to provide these services. Mr. Glass stated
that, from the Health Plan side, staff have worked very closely with Dr. Jorelle Alexander, System Director of
Oral Health, in identifying what the scope should look like and anticipating what the volume and utilization
could look like. Dr. Claudia Fegan, Executive Medical Director/Medical Director Stroger Hospital, stated that
the administration is hiring more dentists and there are plans for expansion; however, there is no way that the
System can ramp up at the rate that is needed. The administration is looking to fill positions; there is a plan for
a systematic approach as to how the System’s dental services will be expanded and more accessible.
Board Chairman Hammock stated that very sophisticated models will need to be developed to understand
utilization and to be able to forecast and predict that sort of cost, with error factors. He referenced the subject
of the dashboard that will be developed; he stated that once the dashboard is developed, the Board will be able
to really monitor this.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the conditional approval of
request number 15, pending completion of review by Contract Compliance. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the conditional approval of
request number 16, pending completion of review by Contract Compliance. THE

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update on CountyCare Health Plan (Attachment #2)
Mr. Glass reviewed the information contained in the Update on the CountyCare Health Plan. The Committee
reviewed and discussed the information.
Mr. Glass informed the Committee that membership dropped significantly from the end of August to the end of
September; he stated that membership is down approximately 6% from the beginning of July, which was the start
of the Health Plan. Once a year, Medicaid beneficiaries must complete a redetermination process with the State
of Illinois in order to retain their benefits. The 8,000 member decrease is related primarily to a lack of
redetermination of CountyCare members; approximately 6,700 members were lost because those members did not
complete the redetermination process on time. The administration is making very aggressive efforts to reach out
to the members and the provider community, to make sure they are aware of this, and get as much information
into their hands to hopefully reduce that number moving forward. He added that, through staff efforts, they have
been able to connect about 2,400 members directly to the Illinois Medicaid Redetermination Project’s hotline, in
order to get their paperwork completed.
Mr. Glass stated that there is also a technical glitch in the State’s system relating to CountyCare. Part of the
redetermination process allows for individuals to be returned back to the health plan that they had, prior to the
redetermination process. Because CountyCare was technically built as a waiver, there is no health plan to which
its members can return. To fix this issue, the State is in the process of doing is a mass conversion of all of the
CountyCare members from waiver status to health plan status, so some of that loss can be avoided.
Representatives from the State have also agreed that they will not cancel coverage for CountyCare members until
they fix that technical error, starting with the December enrollment.
Additionally, Mr. Glass stated that the State has reported to all of the health plans that the response to the mailings
for the movement into managed care has been so significant on their call center that they are going to be
extending the mailing process and the mailing timeline they have published; this includes those mailings going to
CountyCare members who were originally scheduled to have this take place in January. From a positive
perspective, this means that current members will not be asked to select a different health plan until a later time;
however, the delay means that the new members that the administration expected to receive will be slower to
come in.
With regard to the information on slide 7, regarding claims by cost category, Director Gugenheim commented
that it would be interesting to compare these amounts with either an actual patient count or an encounter. Mr.
Glass responded that this is something he can do. Mr. Scheer asked whether the claims by cost category can be
broken out between CCHHS and contracted providers. Mr. Glass responded in the affirmative1.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved to receive and file the
Update on the CountyCare Health Plan.
THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

VI. Report from Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #3)
A. Financial Reports through August 2014 (Attachment #4)
John Cookinham, System Chief Financial Officer, reviewed the information presented in his update on
financial matters. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Mr. Cookinham stated that the System receives a Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA)
payment that is not related to patient activity twice per year. In August, the System received $93.7 million for
that; therefore, the August patient service revenue was larger than the year-to-date average. On a go-forward
basis, that revenue will be accrued every month even though it is only received twice a year, to level out that
fluctuation.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved to receive and file the
Report from the Chief Financial Officer and the Financial Reports through August
2014. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
VII. Adjourn

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended August 31, 2014. This discussion focuses
on the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current month.
It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of the
CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Starting this fiscal year 2013, we have added the
Medicaid Expansion. Collectively, these entities provide primary, intermediate, acute,
and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to pay. The Bureau of
Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2012 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and Cook County Board Officials
collaborated to cut Medicaid costs, help county taxpayers, and transform Cook County’s
hospital system by jump-starting national health care reform in Cook County. In
November, 2012 the federal governmnent approved the 1115 Medicaid Waiver for Cook
County, allowing CCHHS to enroll more than 115,000 individuals who will be eligible
for Medicaid in 2014 into a Cook County network with no cost to the state of Illinois.
Medicaid Expansion allows the Cook County’s Health System to early enroll certain
uninsured patients into Medicaid. Specifically, these are patients who are not currently
eligible for Medicaid, but who will be eligible in 2014 under the Accountable Care Act.
Many of these individuals are patients who already are being treated by our system
without compensation. The Waiver is funded entirely by the federal government.

 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the nine months with overall
revenue of $1,108,772 and overall expenses was $1,118,935.
Net Patient revenue for the nine months was $941,801.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $4,370. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable
General
As compared to November 30, 2013, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
August-2014 increased by 10 to 115 days. Additionally, there was a 1 day decrease in
this figure, as compared to the previous month’s figure.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage, including the
Medicaid Expansion Program and MANG applications;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Total billed accounts grew by $34M (10.6%) as compared to the November-2013
balance. As compared to the previous month, this figure increased by $4.856M (1.4%).
The growth in this figure indicates a decreasing number of accounts are completing the
collection process, which includes charity care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
6
Page 53 of 83

 care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for Medicaid Expansion Program patients is
made through a per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of August-2014 increased by
$4.432M (52.4%), as compared the November 30, 2013 balance and increased by
$1.372M (11.9%), as compared to the previous month’s balance. This indicates that
fewer inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous
month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for Medicaid Expansion Program patients is
made through a per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of August-2014 increased by $20.617M (12.9%) as
compared to the November 30, 2013 balance. This figure fell by $4.900M (-2.6%)
compared to the previous month’s total.
The decrease in this number indicates more accounts had the collection process
completed than in the previous month and that a greater number of accounts are being
removed from active accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity
care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
up on the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for Medicaid Expansion Program patients is
made through a per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts increased by $5.961M (55%) by the end of
August-2014, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2013.
This balance was $1.715M (-9.3%) less than the previous month’s balance. This change
indicates that more outpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to
the previous month.

Page 54 of 83

 The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.

Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of August-2014 increased by
$13.383M
(8.3%), as compared to the balance as of November 30, 2013. This
figure is $9.756M (5.9%) greater than last month’s figure.
The growth in this figure indicates that fewer Out-Patient accounts had their collection
and write-off related activities completed, as compared to the prior month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $404.350M
Insurance - 22.307M
Depreciation - $25.185M
Utilities - $8.477M
Nonoperating Revenue was $156.124M. The largest portions of this are attributed to
cigarette tax in the amount of $81.831M and property tax in the amount of $27.912M.
For the current fiscal year, Nonoperating revenues allocated to CCHHS are Cigarette
8

 Tax, Other Tobacco products and Firearms Tax. There is no Sales Tax allocated to
CCHHS for the current fiscal year.

Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

The OFHC FFS budget has been combined with the SHCC FFS budget due to the configuration of CCHHS system that treats OFHC as a SHCC clinic.

Beginning March-2014, the capitation for the Medicaid Expansion program is paid at 100% instead of 50%.
The Medicaid fee-for-service revenue through the IGT covers the period beginning week ended 07/23/2014 - 08/13/2014.
Vendor Payments From Revenue are payments out of revenue posted by the County Comptroller. Pharmacy Billing and Revenue Enhancement
payments are reductions to Medicaid revenue. Collection Agency payments are reductions to Self-Pay (Other) revenue. Physician Billing payments
include refunds processed by CCHHS. Included in the "Revenue Enhancement" totals are payments to the state for supplemental workers hired to help
process CountyCare and MANG applications.
The Meaningful Use budget was spread over 12 months, as it was not known at the time the budget was created in which month this payment will be
received. Meaningful Use includes both the Medicare and Medicaid portions. The Meaningful Use payment is detailed as follows:

Notes:
- ER Elopes are patients who leave without being seen by a physician.
- "Medicaid-Pending" assumes 30% of the Self-Pay accounts accepted by the eligibility vendor will be successfully converted to Medicaid accounts.
- The "Payer Type" represents the financial class in which the patient presented to CCHHS; it is not necessarily the final financial class for the patient, especially for Self-Pay patients.

Notes:
- ER Elopes are patients who leave without being seen by a physician.
- "Medicaid-Pending" assumes 30% of the Self-Pay accounts accepted by the eligibility vendor will be successfully converted to Medicaid accounts.
- The "Payer Type" represents the financial class in which the patient presented to CCHHS; it is not necessarily the final financial class for the patient, especially for Self-Pay patients.
