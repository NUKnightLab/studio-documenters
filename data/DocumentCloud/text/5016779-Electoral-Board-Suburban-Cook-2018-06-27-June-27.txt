ADDRESSING THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF IMMIGRANT CHILD AND
FAMILY DETENTION AND CALLING ON THE U.S. CONGRESS AND THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO RESCIND THE “ZERO TOLERANCE” POLICY
WHEREAS, Cook County is a “Fair and Equal County for Immigrants,” as defined in 07-R-240; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has demonstrated leadership and commitment towards upholding the rights of
immigrants by being the first county in the nation to develop and approve a policy of how to respond to
Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers per Ordinance 11-O-73; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has benefitted culturally, socially and economically from the diversity of its
residents, including over one million immigrants from throughout the world; and

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF ROCEEDINGS

WHEREAS, in April 2018, United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum requiring
all federal prosecutors along the Southwest border to adopt a zero tolerance policy for attempted entries as
defined under 8 U.S. Code § 1325; and
WHEREAS, there are migrant parents who have been criminally prosecuted as a result of this zero
tolerance policy and are currently being detained in immigrant detention facilities in Illinois, despite their
children being scattered across the country and thus further complicating the litigation of their asylum cases;
and
WHEREAS, this has vastly expanded the criminalization of adult migrants, some of whom are presenting
asylum claims and are now being criminally prosecuted before federal judges, instead of appearing in civil
immigration proceedings, and has resulted in the separation from their minor children who have been
erroneously labeled as unaccompanied alien children; and
WHEREAS, there has been a spike in separations after the issuance of the zero tolerance policy
memorandum with nearly 3,000 children separated from their parents with an unspecified number of these
children being sheltered in Chicago facilities with no plan to reunify the children with their parents per a
June 21, 2018 Chicago Sun-Times report; and
WHEREAS, on June 20, 2018, the President of the United States signed an Executive Order requiring that
families be detained together indefinitely during criminal or immigration proceedings, with expanded use
and construction of facilities as needed, yet does not rescind the zero tolerance policy and further contributes
to the mass incarceration of people of color in the United States; and
WHEREAS, the federal government has not clarified a pathway to reunification for families who have
already been separated, whom are experiencing extreme duress, as evidenced by the suicide of a Honduran
father who killed himself in a detention cell after being separated from his child in June 2018; and
WHEREAS, adding to a growing pattern of permanent family separation, the Chicago-based National
Immigrant Justice Center reports that some parents have already been deported to their home countries
without knowledge of their children’s whereabouts; and
WHEREAS, the Office of Refugee Resettlement has historically been charged with reunification of
unaccompanied minors with sponsors, but now, any future sponsors of the separated children, including
parents, would be subject to investigation and discretion by the United States Department of Homeland
Security per a recent April 2018 Memorandum of Agreement between said department and the United
States Department of Health and Human Services which would continue to put the well-being of children
and families at risk; and
WHEREAS, these practices impose long-lasting, trans-generational toxic stress on impacted families with
negative ramifications on public health, according to decades of research on the factors needed for healthy
child development; and
WHEREAS, furthermore, in light of a May 2018 joint report from the American Civil Liberties Union and
the International Human Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School which details evidence of
abuse against immigrant children while in government custody as well as separate reports that Immigration
6

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF ROCEEDINGS

June 27, 2018

and Customs Enforcement will start destroying records of abuse against detained immigrants, it can be
argued that detained families are in a perilous state with no accountability; and
WHEREAS, renowned mental health organizations such as the Illinois Childhood Trauma Coalition and
the American Psychological Association have decried the practice of separating families and have
emphasized the harmful effects that trauma caused by detention and deportation can have on children and
families; and
WHEREAS, moreover, mental health providers have reported that they cannot adequately address premigration trauma that causes youth and families to seek asylum when trauma is further compounded by
family separation and family-based detention practices and current actions that place undue stress on
families, including in Cook County, who await reunification with loved ones via asylum; and
WHEREAS, the American Psychological Association’s Society for Community Research and Action
documented that the broader community can suffer negative consequences of immigration enforcement and
deportations by becoming more fearful and mistrustful of public institutions and being less likely to
participate in community activities such as school, church, and social services; and
WHEREAS, the situation has prompted a national outcry for the federal government to address the
malignant effects of detention, with leading immigrant rights organizations demanding United States House
and Senate leaders scale back funding for immigrant detention and enforcement; and
WHEREAS, in the United States, there already exists very limited mechanisms to safeguard parental rights,
let alone for the precarious situation of newly arrived migrant parents who are unduly being referred to
federal custody for criminal prosecution; and
WHEREAS, elected officials across the country, including Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, have
either participated in various actions or issued statements condemning the practice and calling out the lack
of legal basis in the “zero tolerance policy”; and
WHEREAS, the current actions on behalf the Executive Branch are burdening practitioners in the social
service and legal sectors and are further unnecessarily entangling families into indefinite interaction with
both child welfare and criminal justice systems.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, Cook County calls on the United States Attorney General
Jeff Sessions to rescind the zero tolerance policy enacted in April 2018 which prosecutes families at the
border and instead adhere to core human rights as stated by the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights in order to allow United States Citizenship and Immigration Services
(USCIS) to properly review and process asylum cases to ensure the safety of all children and families within
our borders while ensuring due process to these individuals; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Cook County calls on the United States Department of Health and
Human Services and the United States Department of Homeland Security to retract their Memorandum of
Agreement that allows for the Office for Refugee Resettlement to share data on minors and potential
sponsors with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and keep the work of these agencies separate to
safeguard the basic rights of children and families; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners do hereby demand that the Congress of the United States and the Executive Branch ensure
that separation of families and the detention of families at the Southern border is halted and define a
reunification pathway for impacted families and that it conduct review and reform of current conditions of
detention for immigrant children; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution be presented to the Illinois
Delegation to the United States Congress and to the President of the United States as a sign of our
commitment to this critical issue.
Approved and adopted this 27th of February 2018.

Summary: This extension would allow Sentinel Offender services, LLC to continue to provide electronic
monitoring and Global Positioning System (GPS) services for the Adult Probation Department and
Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department for youth and adult clients who are ordered by the
court to wear electronic monitoring devices. Sentinel provides GPS monitoring equipment and services
for adult probationers and pretrial defendants in order to comply with Public Act 95-0773, also known as
the Cindy Bischof Law, which calls for the monitoring of certain domestic violence offenders through GPS
technology. The law allows the court to order adults charged with certain domestic violence offenses to
be monitored electronically by the Adult Probation Department Home Confinement Unit as a condition of
bail or probation. Offenders are ordered to wear a GPS tracking device to help monitor compliance with
orders to stay away from the complaining witness, the complaining witness’s home/workplace, or any
other protected address specified. There are currently more than 210 adults under GPS monitoring and
110 victims who carry GPS devices to create mobile exclusion zones. Effective on 1/1/2015, new
legislation (Public Act 98-1012, 725 ILCS 5/110-5) significantly expanded the types of charges required to
be considered for GPS monitoring as a condition of bail.
GPS technology is used by the Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department to monitor high-risk
youth in home confinement as an alternative to secure detention or as a condition of release into the
community. These devices are deployed at various points of the judicial process from pre- adjudication
through post-dispositional stages of court proceedings.
This extension will allow the corresponding Request for Proposals process to be completed. The extension

PROPOSED GRANT AWARD
Department: Cook County Sheriff’s Office
Grantee: Cook County Sheriff’s Office
Grantor: U.S. Department of Justice
Request: Authorization to accept grant
Purpose: State and local law enforcement agencies receive equitable sharing funds by participating
jointly with Department of Justice agencies on investigations that lead to the seizures and forfeiture of
property. Once an investigation is completed and the seized assets are forfeited, the assisting state and
local law enforcement agencies can request a share of the forfeited assets or a percentage of the proceeds
derived from the sale of forfeited assets. Generally, the degree of a state or local agency’s direct
participation in an investigation determines the amount or percentage of funds shared with the agency.
Before requesting a share of the seized assets, a state or local law enforcement agency must first become a
member of the DOJ Equitable Sharing Program. To participate in the program, agencies sign and submit
to DOJ an equitable sharing agreement and certification form. The agreement must be renewed
annually, and by signing and submitting the agreement, the officials of participating agencies certify that
they will use equitable sharing funds for law enforcement purposes.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property
as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may
still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is
deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 6b, unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures
have not been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other
structures have been vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous
months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and
consenting to the Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a
municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a
County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the
municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances
and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that
the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County
Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding
that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance
or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned"
for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b
eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no
later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class
6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b eligibility application,
the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the
County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding
special circumstances has been requested.
If the real estate is located within an Industrial Growth Zone, prior to filing a Class
6b eligibility application with the Assessor and in lieu of an Ordinance or
Resolution, an applicant may obtain from an authorized officer of the municipality
or an authorized officer of the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development if
the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, a letter stating that the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the
filing of the Class 6b application with the Assessor. Such authorized officer shall
have been designated by the legislative body of the municipality or, in the case of
an unincorporated area, by the Cook County Board.

Bureau of Economic Development will forward the application to the Assessor's
Office for filing. A certified copy of the legislative action designating the
authorized officer and the authorized officer letter shall be included with the Class
6b application at the time of filing the application with the Assessor. The applicant
must demonstrate that the industrial development project qualifies for the Class 6b
classification.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In
the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property
as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may
still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is
deemed "abandoned" for purpose of a Class 6b under the TEERM Program if:
1.

There has been no purchase for value; and

2.

The buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least
12 continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, and a determination that the applicant's participation in the TEERM
Program is necessary for the development to occur, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the
property to be in imminent risk of remaining vacant and unused, shall be included
in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b
application under the TEERM Program.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution where applicable shall:

Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Critical Emergency Employee Retention Modification (CEERM) Program: In the
instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still
determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purpose of a Class 6b under the CEERM Program if:
1.

There has been no purchase for value; and

2.

The buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least
3 continuous months; and

3.

The applicant has provided sufficient documentation to establish that such
applicant will create or maintain at least 250 jobs for employees at the
subject location. For purposes of this Section, the term "employee" shall
mean an individual who performs duties or services at the subject location
on average at least 30 hours per week in any two-week period for which
such individual is paid; "hours per week" shall mean hours for which an
individual is paid or entitled to payment for a period of time during which
no duties are performed by such individual due to vacation, holiday,
illness, incapacity, jury duty, military duty or approved leave of absence.

Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall
be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the

time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming
that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program: In the instance where real estate
does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that
special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for
purpose of Class 6b under the SER Program if:

location for a minimum of ten years prior to the date of application for the
SER Program; and

The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, and a determination that the applicant's participation in the SER
Program is necessary for the industrial enterprise to continue operations at its

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of
Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the
property and the number of persons employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports,
recipients shall be required to certify whether the industrial enterprise that
occupied the premises at the time of the SER application continues its operations
at that location. In addition, recipients of Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to
the SER Program shall be required to report to the Assessor within 30 days if the
industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application
ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members
of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within
the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for
the period relating to the non-filing. Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that
occupied the premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that
location, then the Class 6b incentive granted pursuant to the SER program shall
terminate.
e.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was
completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the
date of substantial re-occupancy, or in the case of incentives granted pursuant to
the TEERM Program or the CEERM Program, from the date of the notice of
approval. In the case of incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program, this
classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date of the notice of
approval, or until the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of
the SER application ceases operations at that location if that occurs sooner.

f.

Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program
or the CEERM Program, this incentive may be renewed during the last year a
property is entitled to a ten percent assessment level pursuant to Section 74-64(7),
if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of intent to request renewal of
the incentive from the municipality or the County Board if the real estate
is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board,
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution
expressly stating that the municipality or the County Board, as the case
may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary
and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal
of the Class 6b; and

3.

A copy of the Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed
with the Assessor's Office before the expiration of the ten percent
assessment level period.

g.

Class 6b incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER
Program or the CEERM Program are not renewable. For all other Class 6b
incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property
continues to apply and meet the requirements for Class 6b.

h.

A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members
of the County Board from the affected districts.

i.

If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years,
pursuant to Section 74-64(7). After expiration of the last incentive period, the real
estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.

j.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure
proper review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits
provided under Class 6b.

k.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports
by all Class 6b recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class 6b site. A copy of such reports will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members
of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within
the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for
the period relating to the non-filing.

Class C. Real estate which is to be used for industrial or commercial purposes, including
abandoned property, as defined in Section 74-62, including the land upon which such
property is situated; or vacant land; where such real estate because of contamination has
undergone environmental testing and remediation and has received a "No Further
Remediation Letter" from the site remediation program.
a.

To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No
Further Remediation Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation
objectives based on the industrial or commercial use.

b.

The owner of the property is rendered ineligible for the Class C classification by
having previously owned or operated the site, directly or indirectly, or having been
a partner or being associated through a family or business relationship with anyone
who has owned or operated the site, which ownership or operation caused the
contamination which was remediated pursuant to a site remediation, except for an
employee who worked for an owner, as defined herein, that operated the site. A
present owner or employer who can successfully demonstrate that the owner or
employer was not responsible for the contamination may be eligible for Class C
classification.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located
or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an
Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board,
as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by Class C is
necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the
Class C application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the Ordinance or
Resolution must be filed at the time of application for the Class C classification. A
copy of that Ordinance or Resolution, whichever is submitted, will be forwarded
by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the
members of the County Board from the affected districts.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution shall:
1.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

2.

State the applicant's intended use of the property; and

3.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division,
was received and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case
may be.

d.

To qualify for the Class C classification, an application for Class C classification
must be made within one year of the receipt of the "No Further Remediation
Letter". Where an application for Class C classification encompasses less than all
of the contiguous property owned by the applicant upon which remediation has
been completed, the one-year limitation will be waived for any subsequent separate
application for Class C classification for the remainder or for additional portions
of the property, provided that such subsequent application is made within seven
years.

e.

Additionally, to qualify for the Class C classification, the estimated remediation
costs, including site investigation, testing, oversight, remediation and removal
costs, monitoring, and engineering and legal fees associated with the remediation
process, must total at least $100,000.00, or alternatively, must total at least 25
percent of the market value of the real estate as determined by the Assessor's
property record card in the year prior to the remediation, whichever is less.

f.

The initial Class C classification shall continue for a period of 12 years for both
industrial and commercial property. For industrial property, this incentive may be
renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a 16-percent assessment level,
if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to
request renewal of the incentive from the municipality, or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;
72

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF ROCEEDINGS

June 27, 2018

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board,
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution
expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may
be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and
beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of
the Class C; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed
with the Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the 16-percent
assessment level period.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to
apply and qualify for Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment
on or before the adoption date of the ordinance from which this division is derived
will be eligible for this renewal term at the end of their original incentive period
subject to the above requirements. The notice of intent to request renewal which is
filed with the Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the
effected districts.
g.

If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class C treatment, but the
assessment level is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as
outlined above and receive a 16-percent assessment level for the prescribed period
beginning after the filing and approval of the resolution and renewal application.
However, if, as of that effective date, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16
percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years,
no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will
be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the
next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After such ten-year period expiration of
the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification
under this Division.

h.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired,
the commercial Class C incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not
be subject to renewal and the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification
under this Division.

i.

The Assessor shall review the application and supporting documentation to
determine eligibility for the Class C classification. The Assessor may adopt rules
consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper review of all factors
relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided
under the Class C classification.

j.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports
by all Class C recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class C site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such
73

A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution, or authorization letter and
certified copy of the municipal enabling legislation (if applicable), need not be
filed at the time of filing the Class 7c eligibility application with the Assessor, but

 Board of Commissioners
a.

JOURNAL OF ROCEEDINGS

June 27, 2018

Property qualifies for the Class S classification if its Section 8 contract has been
renewed pursuant to one of the following alternatives:
1.

HUD has approved renewal of the Section 8 contract under the mark up to
market option, after finding that:
i.

The property has received a physical inspection score of at least
60, in an inspection by HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center,
confirming that the property is decent, safe, sanitary and in good
repair with no uncorrected exigent health and safety (EHS)
violations;

ii.

The property does not have a low- and moderate-income use
restriction that cannot be eliminated by unilateral action by the
owner. If, however, the current rent is lower than the use
restriction, HUD may use the mark up to market option to increase
the rents to the use restriction level, which would be a renewal
qualifying for the S classification; and

iii.

2.

3.

b.

A rent comparability study conducted by HUD has demonstrated
that comparable market rents are above 100 percent of the HUD
Fair Market Rent.
HUD has approved a contract renewal for five years of the Section 8
contract under the mark up to market under HUD's discretionary authority,
after finding that the property meets at least one of the required criteria:
i.

A vulnerable population is affected,

ii.

There is a low vacancy rate in the area, which would make tenant
based assistance difficult to use, or a lack of comparable housing,
or

iii.

The project is a high priority for the local community, as
demonstrated by a contribution of state or local funds to the
property.

HUD has approved renewal of a Section 8 contract for a not for profit
corporation under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures
as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines.

Additional requirements for qualification for the S classification are:
1.

At least 20 percent of the living units must be Section 8 units for qualifying
low- and moderate-income persons.

89

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF ROCEEDINGS

June 27, 2018

2.

The owner must agree to retain at least the existing number of Section 8
units for at least five years after the expiration of the expiring or expired
Section 8 contract.

3.

For the duration of the Class S classification period, applicant must file
annually with the Assessor, on or before a date determined by the
Assessor, a sworn statement verifying continuous compliance with the
Class S provisions of this Division.

4.

Applicant must agree to notify the Assessor's Office if the Section 8
contract is terminated prior to its expiration date. Applicant shall provide
to the Assessor's office a copy of any notice of default or notice of
abatement received from HUD.

c.

When the applicant applies to HUD for a contract renewal, no less than 120 days
prior to the expiration of the contract, the applicant shall notify the Assessor's
Office of the application, on a form provided by that office. Upon receiving
approval of the contract renewal from HUD, the applicant shall file an application
for the incentive with the Assessor's Office, on a form provided by that office. The
application shall be supported by a copy of HUD's letter approving the contract
renewal and a copy of the executed renewal contract.

d.

Any property which, as of November 23, 1999, has an existing Section 8 contract
with a mark up to market option may apply for Class S classification for the any
portion of the 2001 assessment year encompassed within the contract term, and for
the remainder of the contract term, including any renewals approved with the mark
up to market option. The classification shall continue until the expiration or
termination of the Section 8 contract.
Any property which, as of (DATE AMENDMENT APPROVED), has an existing
Section 8 contract renewal may apply for Class S classification for any portion of
the 2006 assessment year encompassed within the contract term, and for the
remainder of the contract term, including any renewals approved with the mark up
to market option, mark up to market option under HUD's discretionary authority
or a Section 8 contract that has been renewed by a not-for-profit corporation under
any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's
Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines. The classification shall continue until the
expiration or termination of the Section 8 contract.

e.

The incentive may be renewed if the Section 8 contract is again renewed under any
of the following three options: 1) the mark up to market option; 2) the mark up to
market option under HUD's discretionary authority; or 3) by a not-for-profit
corporation under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as
described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines. Upon filing an
application with HUD, no less than 120 days prior to termination of the contract,
for renewal of the Section 8 contract, the taxpayer shall provide notice to the
Assessor's Office of its application for renewal. The taxpayer shall provide a copy

to the Assessor's Office of HUD's approval of the contract renewal, or notification
of other action.
f.

(15)

The Assessor's Office shall adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary
to ensure proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued
eligibility for the benefits provided under Class S.

Class L. Real estate which is to be used for commercial or industrial purposes and which
is designated as Class 3, Class 4, Class 5a or Class 5b pursuant to this Division; is a
landmark or contributing building; and has undergone substantial rehabilitation. The
substantial rehabilitation must constitute an investment by the owner of at least 50 percent
of the building's full market value as determined by the Assessor in the assessment year
prior to the commencement of the substantial rehabilitation.
a.

Generally, the incentive shall apply only to the building and will not apply to the
land underneath the building. However, if the entire building has been vacant and
unused for at least 24 continuous months prior to the filing of the eligibility
application with the Assessor, the land upon which the building is situated shall
also be eligible for the incentive.

b.

Prior to filing a Class L eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must
obtain an Ordinance or Resolution from the unit of local government in which the
real estate is located, which expressly states that the local government:
1.

Has determined that the incentive provided by Class L is necessary for the
substantial rehabilitation of the property;

2.

Supports and consents to the granting of the incentive; and

3.

Has reviewed and accepted its preservation commission's written
recommendation of the project for the Class L incentive. This
recommendation will specify the project's budget and proposed scope of
work and will specify that the project will meets or exceeds the Standards
of the United States Department of the Interior for Rehabilitation,
Preservation, Restoration, and Reconstruction of historic properties.

4.

In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution shall:
i.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

ii.

State the applicant's intended use of the property; and

iii.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this
Division, was received and filed by the municipality or County
Board, as the case may be.

91

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF ROCEEDINGS

June 27, 2018

c.

A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed with the Assessor
at the time the Class L eligibility application is filed but the Ordinance or
Resolution must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment
appeal is filed to request the class change to Class L.

d.

If the Ordinance or Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application
is filed, the applicant shall instead, include the following items with the eligibility
application:
1.

A letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be,
confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance supporting the incentive has
been requested; and

2.

A copy of the preservation commission's recommendation of the project.

e.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office
to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of the County Board
from the affected districts.

f.

Additionally, to qualify a landmark building or contributing building for Class L
classification, an eligibility application must be made to the Assessor within one
year prior to the commencement of substantial rehabilitation. After the substantial
rehabilitation has been completed, the preservation commission shall review the
project to determine that it is eligible under Subsection (14) of this Section. The
applicant must supplement the eligibility application with a copy of the
determination of the preservation commission prior to classification of the real
estate as Class L.

g.

The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the
date such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.

h.

For property which was initially classified as Class 3, 4 or 5b, this incentive may
be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a 16-percent assessment
level, if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to
request renewal of the incentive from the municipality, or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board,
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution
expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may
be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and
beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of
the Class L; and
92

 Board of Commissioners
3.

JOURNAL OF ROCEEDINGS

June 27, 2018

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed
with the Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the incentive
period.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to
apply and qualify for Class L. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed
with the Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board
from the affected districts.

(16)

i.

If, as of November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class L treatment, but the
assessment level is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as
outlined above and receive a 16-percent assessment level for the prescribed period
beginning after the filing and approval of the Resolution and renewal application.
However, if as of the effective date, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16
percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years,
no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will
be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the
next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After expiration of the last incentive
period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this
Division.

j.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired,
the commercial Class L incentive will expire. The incentive classification will be
subject to renewal subject to subsection (h).

k.

The Assessor shall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure
proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility
for the benefits provided under Class L.

l.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports
by all Class L recipients as to the continued landmark status of the property and
the number of persons employed at the Class L site. Failure to file such reports
within the time established by the Assessor's rules may result in loss of the
incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.

m.

The Assessor shall provide the Chairman of the Business and Economic
Development Committee of the Cook County Board, annually on or before
December 1, a report of each Class L that was designated in the prior year. Such
report shall consist of the address of the Class L designated property, the date such
designation was granted, the amount of property taxes that were not assessed each
year during which the Class L incentive was in effect for such property, and if
provided by the applicant, the aggregate amount of the investment in the project
and the number of jobs generated in connection with such project.

County municipality where the property is situated, or registered as a Bed & Breakfast with

WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property Assessment
Classification 6b that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for an abandoned industrial
facility; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Classification System for Assessment defines abandoned property as

rehabilitation ; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances may exist that
justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of over 24 months and no purchase for value by a disinterested
buyer, the County may determine that special circumstances justify finding the property as being deemed
abandoned; and
WHEREAS, Class 6b requires a Resolution by the County Board validating the property as abandoned for
the purpose of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, the municipality states the Class 6b is necessary for development to occur on this specific

Summary: This amendment provides for the second and final of two (2), one (1) year renewal options
and increases to the Countywide Job Order Contract (JOC) Program. JOC is a quantity based
procurement process that allows facility owners to complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and
construction project with a single, competitively bid contract. The JOC process involved first selecting a
vendor pool of potential contractors through a competitive procurement process in accordance with the
Cook County Procurement Code, and identifying projects for such selected vendors. The vendors listed
below were found to be the lowest, responsive and responsible bidders.
The County is under no obligation to expend the amount requested, and is only obligated to pay JOC
contractors when the construction work is procured through the JOC Program. The amendment will allow
the County to extend the utilization of JOC contracts to facilitate all departments’ upcoming projects.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION OPPOSING THE REDUCTION OF AIR AND WATER POLLUTION
STANDARDS IN WISCONSIN FOR THE PROPOSED FOXCONN DEVELOPMENT
WHEREAS, Foxconn Technology Group (“Foxconn”) is a manufacturer of computer, communication and
electronics; and
WHEREAS, Foxconn is constructing a fabrication plant in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin to manufacture
LCD glass panels. Mount Pleasant is in Racine County, Wisconsin; and
WHEREAS, the proposed plant is sited at the headwaters of the Des Plaines River and is located
approximately 50 miles from the border of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, Cook County shares the Des Plaines Watershed Region, and our water and air resources are
all interconnected; and
WHEREAS, the State of Wisconsin has passed legislation that waives environmental regulations for the
Foxconn plant;
WHEREAS, the legislation allows Foxconn to fill 26 acres of wetlands with dredged materials without an
Environmental Impact Study or input from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; and
WHEREAS, the United States Environmental Protection Agency exempted Racine County, Wisconsin
from air quality requirements for ozone, allowing Foxconn to avoid having to install stringent pollution
control equipment; and
WHEREAS, the Foxconn plant will divert approximately 7 million gallons of water from Lake Michigan
a day; and
WHEREAS, the greatest natural resource Cook County has is Lake Michigan and the proposed plant will
adversely affect that resources; and
WHEREAS, there has been no stormwater management plan for the proposed plant, even though the plant
will encompass thousands of acres of farmland; and
WHEREAS, the Des Plaines River has had significant flooding and removing permeable land at the
headwaters of the River will likely increase the downstream flood risk; and
WHEREAS, without a proper study of all potential environmental impacts of the plant, it is unknown if
there will be adverse effects to the environment and population of Cook County.
