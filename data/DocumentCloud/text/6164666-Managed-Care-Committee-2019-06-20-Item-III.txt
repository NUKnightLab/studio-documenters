CDPS RISK SCORE 

Chronic Illness and Disability 
Payment System (CDPS), developed 
by the University of California, San 
Diego. CDPS is used as a tool for 
Medicaid programs to help develop 
health based capitated payment 
rates. It uses diagnosis codes and 
NDC codes derived from medical and 
pharmacy claims data to develop 
chronic disease classifications and 
risk factors. 

 Domestic
Spend

 

 

l( CountyCare
PLAN

 

Background on Domestic Spend Strategy 
•  Majority of hospital spend for CountyCare members is nondomestic 
•  CountyCare and CCH set target of $86M and initiatives were 
created (Centers of Excellence) to increase domestic spend 
•  CountyCare and CCH identified surgical procedure categories 
to further evaluate and quantify clinical and financial 
opportunity  
•  Centers of Excellence (CoEs) can be created within CCH for 
procedure categories with opportunity
