Commissioner Goslin inquired whether Mr. Hylton has a consolidation proposal which could
lead to efficiencies and on behalf of which the Commissioners could advocate.
Mr. Hylton replied that the Enterprise Architectural model under consideration – which most
large counties have – is a road map that can lead to efficiencies. He further stated that it is his
recommendation that all the major IT consulting firms be hired in connection with this Item to
ensure independence and transparency.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to the timeline for this plan.
Mr. Hylton replied that the plan would be ready by Spring, depending upon what consolidation
recommendations the Enterprise Architectural model yields.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to how long this company has been in existence.
Mr. Hylton replied ten years; he further stated that this company has met all of the compliance
requirements posed by the Purchasing Department.
In response to Commissioner Peraica’s request, Mr. Hylton agreed to forward a copy of the
Electronic Knowledge Interchange, Inc.’s RFP response to Chairman Beavers.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether this study will examine internal enhancements and
improvements, consolidation, external outsourcing and privatizing of particular functions.
Mr. Hylton replied yes, and added that any ROI and justification for what the final plan is will
also be examined.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to the target date for the completion of this study.
Mr. Hylton replied one year.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether the company recommending this plan will also be
involved in the implementation of this plan.
Mr. Hylton replied it is not the intention at this time that the company be involved in the
implementation of the plan; however, common practices do not preclude them from being so
involved.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether this company is an IT practitioner as well as a
consulting firm.
Mr. Hylton replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Schneider stated that it was his understanding that this study would move the
County IT operation toward consolidation.
Mr. Hylton replied confirmed this, stating further that the directions which this study would yield
would then be brought before the Board to be adopted.
