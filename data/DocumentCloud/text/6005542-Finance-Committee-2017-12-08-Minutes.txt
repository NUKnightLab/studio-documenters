 III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Charles Jones, Chief Procurement Officer, provided an overview of the requests presented for the Committee’s
consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
It was noted that request number 7 was withdrawn from consideration.
With regard to request number 9, Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, stated that this contract is for outside
laboratory testing services. The System will need to develop an in-house skill for these services, particularly for some
of the advanced molecular diagnostics around cancer care, which is not done frequently enough to have that done inhouse. He noted that the System’s laboratory director resigned this month, so the administration will be recruiting for
a new laboratory director. That will be an opportunity for the organization, because there has been much investment in
new equipment to automate the laboratory, but the organization has not yet capitalized on the returns on that
equipment. Advanced diagnostics, besides the basics that get done on hospitalized patients, is a fast moving field. It is
the administration’s hope that the individual who comes in as the new laboratory director can increase the skills and
technology necessary to allow for bringing some of this in-house. He added that the administration is in frequent
conversations with neighbors in the Illinois Medical District and regionally, trying to find out if there is a solution that
makes it efficient for many of the organizations. There might be partnership opportunities, as volume from two (2)
institutions is likely to see more favorable pricing. In response to a question regarding when the Committee can expect
to receive a status report on the subject, Dr. Shannon stated that mid-year would be a good time for that.
With regard to request number 13, Mr. Jones provided information on the price per unit. The System’s cost per drugeluting stent is $1,200, and list cost is approximately $3,750. Director Richardson-Lowry inquired whether that kind
of markup is standard. Mr. Jones indicated that he will research the question and provide a response.
Director Richardson-Lowry stated for the record that on the transmittal is a reference in parentheses referring to the
number of companies available under the GPO; this is a useful piece of information for Directors to see the selection
pool and see that staff are being thoughtful in their determination.
Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Director Reiter, moved the approval of
request numbers 1 through 22, with the exception of request number 7, which was
withdrawn, and subject to completion of review by Contract Compliance, where
appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Any items listed under Section III

IV. Report from Supply Chain Management (Attachment #2)
 4th Quarter FY2017 Report of Purchases made under the authority of the Chief Executive Officer
 Report of emergency purchases
Mr. Jones presented the 4th Quarter FY2017 Report of Purchases made under the authority of the Chief Executive
Officer. There was no report of emergency purchases made.

 V.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #3)
 FY2018 Budget Update (Attachment #4)
 Metrics
 Financials through October 2017
Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, presented the information contained in his report, which included
Financials through October 2017. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
The Committee discussed the subject of the claw-back of revenue by the State that resulted from their retroactive
CountyCare rate change. Additionally, they discussed the subject of CountyCare external claims expense
exceeding budget estimates and strategies to address it.
Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, reviewed the Budget Update with Mr.
Akpan.
The Budget Update included information on the following subjects:





County Health Fund Allocation to CCHHS Operating Expenses
Changes to CCHHS FY18 Budget Through the Balancing Amendment
Changes to CCHHS FY18 Budget Through the Technical Amendment
Impact on Staffing

Following the discussion of the information, Director Driscoll inquired to confirm that those individuals who are
being laid off will be provided information on open positions at the System; if they are qualified and want to move
into those positions, they will be able to do so. Mr. Elwell concurred; he believes that less than ten (10) individuals
will end up leaving the organization (with the exception of the staff in the Labor Department, because that function
will no longer be performed at the System).
Dr. Shannon noted an additional point for the record relating to the budget. The Committee may be aware that the
Chief Judge is using legal actions to try and halt the changes that happened with the budget. It is anyone’s guess as
to how that will move from a timing standpoint and what the outcome will be, but if there is a significant change,
that might cause a mid-year readjustment at the budget, as well. Also, because the proposed budget that this Board
approved back in late summer contemplated a much smaller membership in the health plan, the growth in the
health plan due to recent acquisitions will change the revenue and expense projections, which will be reflected in
the financial reporting.
