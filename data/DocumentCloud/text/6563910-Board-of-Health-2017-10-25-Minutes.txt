Legislative Updates SB 2 –
Mr. Barry Grisez, Supervisor in Environmental Public Health, provided the following update on Senate
Bill 2: On June 30, 2017, the Ohio General Assembly passed Senate Bill 2. This bill states that the
director of environmental protection shall adopt new rules governing construction and demolition
debris processing facilities. There are currently three such processing facilities within CCBH
jurisdiction. The rules will address issuance of permits-to-install and annual licenses, as well as

 Cuyahoga County Board of Health

October 25, 2017

conditions for the location, design, construction, operation and closure of C&DD processing facilities.
As of October 6, 2017, owners or operators of C&DD processing facilities are required to submit a
one-time application for registration to the licensing authority (i.e.: CCBH). The registration form
requires the applicant to provide a name, phone number and address of the owner/operator, the location
of the processing facility, and a drawing depicting the facility layout. There is also a registration fee of
$100 payable to the licensing authority. Both new and existing facilities (facilities operating prior to
Oct. 6, 2017) will be required to obtain the registration, however existing facilities that obtain the
registration will not be subject to the siting criteria. Mr. O’Donnell also discussed the issue that since
the Ohio EPA does not yet have any regulations, it would probably be prudent to keep the CCBH
regulations in place. He will have discussions with the Ohio EPA regarding the best time to sunset the
CCBH regulations.
HB 299 –
Mr. Terry Allan provided an update on House Bill 299 to Enact Lead Safety and Uniformity Act.
HB 299 is to amend section 3742.04 of the Revised Code to enact the Lead Safety and Uniformity Act
to provide that the state, acting through the Department of Health, has the sole and exclusive authority
to compel, prohibit, license, or regulate lead abatement activities in Ohio. The Primary Sponsor of the
legislation is Representative Merrin.
