Question/Comment

Status

Complemented CHA for newly remodeled units at
Trumbull Park.

Comments Noted.

Will Trumbull Park residents have an option for
another cable provider other than ComCast?

There is one other cable provider, Wide Open West (W.O.W),
that has a franchise agreement with the City of Chicago to
provide cable where Trumbull is located. The CHA is more than
willing to negotiate a right-of-entry agreement to allow WOW to
provide service to CHA properties in its cable region.
Once they begin to offer cable service in the City of Chicago,
AT&T will be another option for Trumbull residents.

Public transportation limited for Trumbull Park
which also affects vacancy rate. Can CHA look
into this matter.

Transformation. Considers herself a proud
stakeholder in Community and enjoys her newly
