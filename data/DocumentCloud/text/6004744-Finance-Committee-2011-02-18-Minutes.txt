III. Action Items
A. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, January 21, 2011
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved to accept the minutes of the
Finance Committee Meeting of January 21, 2011. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
This item was considered concurrently with Item III(C) Supplemental Contracts and Procurement Items.
Nita Stith, Interim Deputy Director of Supply Chain, presented the requests for the Committee’s consideration.
She noted that request number 21 has been withdrawn.
The following individuals provided additional information on the requests presented for consideration: John
Morales, Chief Financial Officer of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County; Dr. Stephen Martin, Chief
Operating Officer of the Cook County Department of Public Health; Dr. Robert Cohen, System Chair of the
Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine; Dr. Anthony Tedeschi, System Chief Operating Officer;
Dr. Patrick Dunne, System Chair of the Department of Radiology; Dr. Richard Keen, System Chair of the
Department of Surgery; Michael Ayres, System Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Enrique Martinez, Chief Medical
Officer of the Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County; Daniel Howard, System Chief
Information Officer; Robert Hamilton, Interim Chief Operating Officer of Provident Hospital of Cook County;
Rachel Canning, President of RL Canning; and Lucio Guerrero, System Director of Public Relations.
During the Committee’s review of the contractual requests, Chairman Carvalho suggested that the subject of
the way the System defines sole source contracts be reviewed. Ms. Stith responded that there have been
discussions regarding modifying the procurement language to acknowledge those types of contracts that don’t
fit into the common definition of “sole source”. These are the types of contracts that are not required to be bid
and for which there is more than one source for a product. Because there isn’t a description for these types of
contracts, in which the System has selected out a single company as a result of their analyses, these contracts
have fallen under the category of “sole source”.
Chairman Carvalho asked Elizabeth Reidy, System General Counsel, to address a question regarding the
County’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise (MBE/WBE) Ordinances. He noted that critical
comments were made by a Commissioner at the Cook County Board’s budget hearing relating to the System; it
was stated that the System is not meeting “mandatory” goals with regard to MBE/WBE. Chairman Carvalho
was under the impression that, based upon the Supreme Court decisions in this area, MBE/WBE participation
in County contracts is a goal, and is not mandatory.

III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Ms. Reidy responded affirmatively. She added that, as provided for in County Ordinances, MBE/WBE
participation is reviewed and evaluated by Contract Compliance on a contract-by-contract basis. William T.
Foley, Chief Executive Officer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, provided additional
information. He stated that he recently met with the new County Directors of Contract Compliance and
Purchasing, LaVerne Hall and Maria de Lourdes Coss. Ms. Hall intends to assess appropriate goals on a
contract-by-contract basis and has asked to have pre- contract/bid/Request for Proposals (RFP) meetings so
that this can be done in advance.
The Committee held an extensive discussion regarding request number 16. Mr. Howard reviewed the RFP
process used to select the vendor. When the RFP was released, eighteen companies took the RFP packet; five
companies responded with proposals. The number of proposals to evaluate reduced down to three, due to the
requirement that the company had to have health care experience. It came down to Cerner and ACS; he stated
that ACS was chosen based upon the features and functions that were included in their proposal.
With regard to the evaluating group, Mr. Howard stated that this was a group of seven, including himself; he
added that he abstained on the vote. He provided information regarding the fee schedule for the services and
MBE/WBE participation in the contract. Rachel Canning, President of RL Canning, whose local MBE/WBEcertified information technology staffing company will be participating in the contract, was introduced and
provided additional information.
During the discussion of the proposed contract extensions, Chairman Carvalho noted that, although there may
not be a request for additional funds associated with the extensions, there may be a cost to the System
associated with the extension, particularly if the new contract has been negotiated down to a lower cost. He
indicated that he would like this information to be provided for contract extensions in the future.
Director Golden noted that she intends to vote PRESENT on request numbers 15 and 16; she requested further
information on the items to review prior to the Board Meeting next week.
Director Muñoz, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 25, with the exception of request number 21, which has been
withdrawn, under the Contracts and Procurement Items and Supplemental Contracts and
Procurement Items. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Chairman Carvalho abstained and voted PRESENT on request numbers 1 and 2.
Director Golden voted PRESENT on request numbers 15 and 16.
C. Supplemental Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #2)
This item was considered concurrently with Item III(B).

III. Action Items (continued)
D. Request to enter into Letter of Intent for possible purchase of real estate owned by Vision House, Inc.,
located at 515 E. 50th Street, in Chicago, Illinois (Attachment #3)
Mr. Foley and Mr. Hamilton provided an overview of the item presented. During the Committee’s discussion,
questions were raised regarding the cost to renovate the building, space needs, operational status of Vision
House, potential use and plans for the building and current ownership status of the building. Commissioner
Robert Steele provided additional information regarding Vision House and the building; he outlined the
potential benefits that could be achieved through the acquisition of the building.
With regard to space needs, Chairman Carvalho stated that a space usage plan at Provident Hospital needs to
be provided. Director Golden noted that more detail on the potential plans for this space will also need to be
provided.
Mr. Foley stated that this request is only for the authorization to sign a non-binding letter of intent; he will
come back to the Board through this Committee for final approval. Upon approval of this authorization, he
will proceed to work with the County’s Department of Real Estate Management to get the necessary appraisals
and title review and put the justification together for the proposed acquisition of the property. During the
Committee’s discussion of the cost of the building, Mr. Foley noted that the building is currently listed for
$610,000; the appraisals will assist in determining the price the System will be willing to pay.
Board Chairman Batts suggested that Mr. Foley be authorized to proceed, with the acknowledgement that
management will return with a complete presentation on the proposal, to address the questions raised at the
meeting.
Director Muñoz, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved to approve the request for
authorization to enter into a non-binding Letter of Intent for the possible purchase of real
estate owned by Vision House, Inc., in an amount not to exceed $610,000. THE
MOTION CARRIED.
Director Golden abstained and voted PRESENT.

E. Request to enter into and execute proposed Amendment to the Intergovernmental Agreement between
CCHHS, Cook County Board of Commissioners and the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family
Services, to temporarily fund supplemental staff for the Illinois Department of Human Services, to
address the accumulated backlog of CCHHS eligibility applications for Medical Programs
Mr. Ayres and Randall Mark, System Director of Intergovernmental Affairs and Policy, provided an overview
of the item presented for the Committee’s consideration. The proposed Amendment is to address the issue
involving the State’s backlog in processing the System’s eligibility applications, by allowing the System to pay
the State to fund positions that will process System eligibility applications.
Mr. Ayres stated that the proposed Amendment is expected to cost the System approximately $1-1.5 million, of
which roughly 50% will be reimbursed by the federal government. It was stated that the staff will be
considered supplemental; the System will have the opportunity to review and agree upon the budget and
productivity expectations.

During the discussion of the item, Chairman Carvalho inquired regarding the procurement process used for the
selection of the specific brands. Helen Haynes, Associate General Counsel, provided an overview of the
process used to select the vendors, which includes the involvement of Supply Chain Management; she added
that a solicitation for quotations for equipment leases was developed for this purpose.
Director Muñoz, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved to approve the request to enter
into and execute Lease Schedules, pursuant to the Replacement Master Agreement with
Banc of America Leasing and Capital Corp., for the leasing of the equipment as set forth
in the memorandum. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
H. Any items listed under Sections III, IV and VI

Page 5 of 89

 Finance Committee Meeting Minutes
Friday, February 18, 2011
Page 6

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Electronic Health Records Update (Attachment #6)
Mr. Howard reviewed the information provided for the electronic health records update. Issues discussed
included those relating to deadlines for implementation, the System’s ability to provide patients with an
electronic copy of their medical records within three days, and the System’s progress in the implementation of
this initiative.
B. Notification of Emergency Purchases (Attachment #7)
In accordance with Part II, Section 2.8 of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System Procurement Policy
that states that emergency purchases be reported to the Finance Committee no later than at its next regularly
scheduled meeting, Ms. Stith notified the Committee that emergency purchases have been made. Also in
accordance with the Policy, a communication in writing was sent to Chairman Carvalho and Board Chairman
Batts on this matter.
V.

Report from System Chief Financial Officer
William Luallen, of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), provided a brief update on Performance Improvement
(Attachment #8). Additionally, Mr. Ayres reviewed the Revenue Cycle Benefit Tracker and CCHHS Budgeted
Patient Cash Summary (included in Attachment #8).
With regard to the CCHHS Budgeted Patient Cash Summary, Chairman Carvalho requested that when this
information is presented in the future, it should include accrued revenue.
A. FY2011 Budget Update
Mr. Ayres and Mr. Foley provided a FY2011 Budget update. The County Board’s Finance Committee
conducted its departmental review of the System’s budget last week; they are expected to approve the final
budget on February 25th. Mr. Foley stated that Director Butler has agreed to sponsor some amendments to the
System’s budget, including those relating to the Amendment to the Intergovernmental Agreement (approved
earlier in this meeting) and to clean up some of the Grade 24 position salaries for which the System is
recruiting.
Chairman Carvalho stated that a letter is being drafted to be sent to the County Board from himself and Board
Chairman Batts, regarding the backlog of revenues. He stated that the revenue shortfall occurred last year due
to the backlog; when the backlog came in, those revenues went to the County’s General Fund. He stated that
the System was not passive in responding to the shortfall - when the revenue shortfall was identified, the
System correspondingly decreased its expenditures. So the County did not suffer as a result of the shortfall in
revenue, because the System held back in expenditures. The letter will indicate that, when the County takes
those revenues when they actually accrue and do not provide an opportunity for the Health Fund to put them to
the purpose of providing health care, it creates an unfair situation for the System.

B. CareLink Update
Chairman Carvalho stated that he and Director O’Donnell have reviewed the draft CareLink policy containing
the most recent amendments; a revised draft policy is being prepared and will be brought back to the
Committee.

that Ms. Hall has committed to a five business day turn-around time for review of System contracts by
Contract Compliance.
D. Supply Chain Management Update
This item was deferred.

BIDDER I SUPPLIER? N/A
PURCHASE? Not Available on GPO
JUSTIFICATION:
This is a request to purchase the LeMaitre Valvulotome and Bovine Pericardium Vascular patches for use by the
Vascular Surgeons at Stroger Hospital. The Expandable Valvulotome will allow surgeons to do in-leg bypass grafting
procedures, requiring valvulotomy using one device that self-centers and self-sizes. This device is disposable and
requires no sterilization, while guaranteeing sharp blades and greater ease of use. This benefits the patient because
it allows the procedure to be done in less time using two small incisions, as opposed to long incisions and removing
of the vein. This device also helps to reduce length of stay, overall procedure time, wound necrosis and recovery
time. The Bovine Pericardium Patch is used in vascular reconstruction and surgical patching. This will save time and
costs for the Operating Room during vascular and trauma cases because it reduces suture line bleeding and has
many clinical benefits over synthetic patches, including, reduced infections, greater retention strength, and reduced
suture line bleeding.
LeMaitre Vascular is the sole manufacturer and distributer of the only self-sizing and self-centering valvulotome.
TERMS OF REQUEST:
This is a request to execute contract H10-25-017 for a period of 12 months from 03/01/2011 thru 02/28/2012 in the

 PROPOSED PROVIDENT HOSPITAL DIABETES CENTER 

The proposed Diabetes Center would stress self-lnanagemcnt and group education which has
been shown to save costs, improve outcomes and assist the patient with needed lifestyle changes.
In addition to medical providers, patients would have access to social work, nutrition and
physical therapy staff. The Diabetes Center would replicate a progratn at Fantus Health Center
on the Stroger campus, which has been in existence for more than 10 years. The Fantu's program
has a model grocery store to assist patients read food labels, treadmills and other exercise
equipment to encourage physical activity, social workers to help patients and their faniilies cope
with lifestyle changes and an education center with computers for patient education. Patients are
assigned a primary care provider; however, care often occurs in groups to allow patients to learn
frOln each other. The Fantus progranl has achieved Alnerican Diabetes Association recognition,
which will be a goal of the Provident program.
A building in foreclosure located at 515 50th Place owned by Vision House has been identified
as an ideal site for the Diabetes Center. Vision House was created through a unique partnership
between Interfaith Housing, Liberty Baptist Church, the Cook County Health & Hospitals .
System HIV Primary Care Center and Provident Hospital. Phase I developed 25 apart~eiItswith
.a full continuum of care for individuals and families affected byHIVIAIDS~ The Children's
Place Vision House wasto be the second phase of a prograntdevoted to children and families
impacted byHIVIAIDS, but the program wasnevet itnplementedand the building has ,been
unoccupied since completion of construction in 2004. The building sits on land owned by Cook
Countyanddonated for construction of the daycarecenter. The building ca~ be acquired for
$600K.Retrofittingwould be completed.in-houseby CCHHS staffat minimal cost. Plans would
be, to renovate the kitchen, create group-meeting space, construct· a.model. grocery store and
design a space for exercise equipment. '. Offices and exam room space would also be developed
in the facility. We are exploring with the University of Chicago Medical Center a potential
partnership.
Referrals to the Diabetes Center would .come fromP ederally Qualified HealthCenters(FQHCs)
on the South Side in addition to CCHHS sites. We would solicitreferrals from the Southside
Healthca.re:Collaboratlve, i.c.17 FQHCs andcomnlunity hospitals organized by Uniyersity of
Chicago to improve healthcare on the South Side. NearSouth,Wo()dlawl1,. Sengstackehnd
Englewood Health Centers,all CCHHS sites, would also refer to the Center. These sites
presently refer to the Fautus program which is often a burden for patients with transportation
issues.
While diabetes wouldbethe initial focus, plans are under consideration to expand the Center to
address other chronic illnesses common to South Side residents such as obesity, astluna, heart
failure and hypertension.

Action Items C. Lease Schedules

under replacement Master lease Agreement with Bane of America leasing and Capital Corp"
llC.

In August, 20101 pursuant to authorization by this Board, the CCHHS entered into a replacement Master
lease Agreement with Bane of America leasing and Capital Corp'l llC ("Banc of America") for purposes
of leasing up to $30 million in capital equipment beginning in 2010. Under the Master lease the parties
may enter into lease Schedules with respect to specific items of equipment to be leased.
Und'er the Master leasel the interest rate for each lease Schedule is based upon on the three·year
United States Treasury Maturity SWAP rate. The amounts payable under each lease schedule may
therefore vary monthly depending upon changes in this indicator.

Management does not find this

interest rate risk to be material.
We are requesting your authorization to enter into and execute
CCHHS to lease the following equipment:

 Elements to a MU Objective
Stated Objective

•Represents the overall goal or intent and will be what you
are ultimately attesting to.

Measure

•The method by which CMS looks to validate use of the
objective. It does not always directly align with intent but
identifies a measureable component of the objective.

Underlying Policy
and Process

•Some objectives call for a defined policy and process for
maintaining a certain level of discipline and compliance.

Defensible
Position

•Each objective should have a declared defensible position
in case of an audit. This should include discoverable data
that supports both the % adoption that is submitted
through attestation and alignment to the objectives goal
and intent.

Interpretation

•Several objectives are not as prescriptive as we would like
and will require organizational decisions to be made on
what interpretation to use. These all need to be assessed
on a risk scale so that the decisions are informed based on
risk level.

meet promised incentive expectations. Wanted to stress to the overall attendees that this is not
an “IT project” and will take an interdisciplinary team to meet and maintain all objectives.
Hospital
Cook County Hospital has been a leader in healthcare EHR systems for many years. The
attendees shared that due to budget constraints in the last few years they have delayed several
projects which now put them behind schedule for meeting Meaningful Use. Some key areas of
concern are around interoperability objectives and how the hospital is going to meet this within
given time frames. Also need to consider the patient population and concerns on appropriate
access. Need to review problem lists and medication reconciliation and revise current process to
capture data in all venues since this is a gap especially in the ED.
Provider
With multiple facilities and physician practices Cook County needs to evaluate and implement a
plan for provider attestation considering all factors of Medicare vs. Medicaid, standardization of
reporting objectives and timing. Given the burden of tracking multiple eligible providers the ability
to outline and maintain a standardized system will ensure greater success over the life of the
program.
Other areas of focus
Cook should also work quickly to establish formal Meaningful Use Task Force and assign a MU
Project Manager to drive MU projects, including policy and process creation. This will ensure
that MU does not get lost in all of the other projects that are occurring. The operational aspect of
MU also needs to be addressed. Who will monitor reports throughout attestation times, validate
reporting before attestation, submit actual attestation, and be responsible for archiving what is
needed in case of an audit later?

 SUMMARY REPORT
Key Concerns for Hospital
Record vital signs – Core – Red – Currently do not capture height and weight in ED.
Sometimes use estimated height and weight but do not use an estimate for BMI, need to
standardize this process. Currently no doing growth charts on patients 18 to 20.
Report hospital quality measures to CMS or the States- Core- Red- Need to include the
Meaningful Use Core measures, Lighthouse - NHQM; VTE; Stroke; ED Throughput content
PowerInsight Reporting.
Provide patients with an electronic copy of their health information (including diagnostic
test results, problem list, medication lists, medication allergies, discharge summary-H,
procedures-H), upon request (3 business days) - Core- Red- Need to evaluate current
procedures and length of time allowed for dictation, current process of 30 days puts Cook at risk
for meeting this objective.
Provide patients with an electronic copy of their discharge instructions and procedures at
time of discharge, upon request- Core- Red- Although this is part of the plan for the current
upgrade they do not have a process to provide this to patients. Need to define how they will
handle the depart process and if they continue to use a modified depart process with some
discharge Instructions, they will have to write their own reports.
Capability to exchange key clinical information (for example, discharge summary-H,
procedures-H, problem list, medication list, medication allergies, diagnostic test results),
among providers of care and patient authorized entities electronically- Core- RedCurrently do not have a plan on how they are going to handle this or partner with.
Eligible hospital or CAH who receives a patient from another setting of care or believes an
encounter is relevant should perform medication reconciliation- Menu- Red- Currently
using Med Profile but are not recording electronically that it was done.
Key Concerns for Eligible Providers
More than 40% of all permissible prescriptions written by the eligible provider are
transmitted electronically using certified EHR technology- Core- Red- Currently have
RxWriter. ePrescribing is not on the plan to implement.
Record vital signs (height, weight, blood pressure, calculates and display: BMI, plot and
display growth charts for children 2-20 years, including BMI.)- Core- Red- Not able to go
into this objective in detail due to time constraints although they stated they do not believe this is
happening consistently. Cook needs to review current practices and process and determine
gaps based on objective percentages.
Record smoking status for patients 13 years old or older- Core- Red- Not able to go into this
objective in detail due to time constraints although they stated they do not believe this is
happening consistently. Cook needs to review current practices and process and determine
gaps based on objective percentages.

Report hospital quality measures to CMS or the States- Core- Red- Not able to go into this
objective in detail due to time constraints although they stated they do not believe this is
happening consistently. Cook needs to review current practices and process and determine
gaps based on objective percentages.

Provide patients with timely electronic access to their health information (including lab
results, problem list, medication lists, medication allergies) within 4 business days of the
information being available to the EP- Menu- Red- Stated that they believe that 90% of their
patient population do not have access to utilizing electronic access. Need to consider how they
are going to handle this from a long term perspective as this objective increases in future stages.
Capability to exchange key clinical information (for example, problem list, medication list,
medication allergies, diagnostic test results), among providers of care and patient
authorized entities electronically- Core- Red- Not able to go into this objective in detail due to

is happening consistently. Cook needs to review current practices and process and determine
gaps based on objective percentages.
The eligible provider who transitions their patient to another setting of care or provider of
care or refers their patient to another provider of care should provide summary of care
record for each transition of care or referral. - Menu- Red- Not able to go into this objective in
detail due to time constraints although they stated they do not believe this is happening
consistently. Cook needs to review current practices and process and determine gaps based on

2) One-time third party account follow up placement; representing IP>$25K<365 days; OP>$300<365 days and weekly ongoing and placements representing IP>$25K>60 days; OP>$300>60 days.
3) Cash collected is defined as incremental cash where general account history reflected inactivity.
4) Note: This analysis excludes inventory of unposted payments which may represent a combination of payments posted to unapplied cash as well as payments that may not yet be posted.
5) Note: This analysis includes some takebacks: however, due to posting inconsistencies, they may not represent all takebacks incurred for the period (reconciliation in process).
6) Note: Credit balances are a result of adjustments equal to greater than the account balance and variances are being researched and resolved.

into Nebo on 12/20/10
• The first 5 business days were standard initial system bill hold days
• The additional 8 days were due to completion of Siemens and NEBO
program testing to support continuation of the “all
all inclusive
inclusive” claims
generation
• Softmed interface issue subsequently contributed to claims delay

•

1/1/11 Price Increase
•

First set of claims for dates of service beginning 1/1/11 were delayed to allow
for implementation of price increase effective January 1st

•

Claims were released 1/14/11 (10 business days, five of which represent
standard system bill hold days from date of discharge)

•
