be reached. The Contractor may not reject PCEs as being unqualified without sound reasons.
That there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using PCEs is not in itself
sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Goals, as long as such costs are
reasonable;
(7) Made efforts to assist interested PCEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies, materials, or
related assistance or services, where appropriate; provided, however, that such efforts shall not

PCEs that is enforceable and that, in the judgment of the CCD, has performance standards and
outcomes that are clearly established and effective in terms of assisting the PCE in acquiring
additional skills, experience, and relationships helpful to the long-term success of the PCE,
consistent with the provisions of Section 34-271(d).
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, Chapter 34 - Finance, Article IV Procurement, Division 8 - Minority and Woman-Owned Business Enterprises, Section 34-297 - Contract
Pre-Award Compliance Procedures is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 34-297. - Contract Pre-Award Compliance Procedures.
(a) For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer Contractor, Person, or Business shall submit a
Utilization Plan detailing all subcontractors from which the Contractor, Person, or Business
solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have been established, its achievement
of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan shall be due at the time the
bid/proposal is due. Any Contractor, Person, or Business requesting a partial or full waiver shall
submit a Good Faith Effort Transparency Report with its Utilization Plan when the Utilization
Plan is due. In the event a bid or proposal leads to a Contract with the County, the Utilization
Plan as approved, and any Good Faith Effort Transparency Report as approved and applicable,
by the CCD shall be incorporated as a material commitment on the part of the Contractor,
Person, or Business to each relevant PCE, and the contractor Contractor, Person, or Business,
and the County. Failure to include a Utilization Plan, and Good Faith Effort Transparency
Report, where applicable, shall render the bid or proposal not Responsive.
(b) Any agreement between a contractor Contractor, Person, or Business and a PCE in which the
Contractor requires that the PCE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is
prohibited.
(c) Where the contractor Contractor, Person, or Business cannot achieve the Project Specific
Goal(s), the CCD will determine whether the Contractor, Person, or Business has made Good
Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s), based upon the submission of a Good Faith Effort
Transparency Report by the bidding Contractor, Person, or Business and consideration of
additional factors by the CCD, pursuant to Sections 34-281 and 34-282. Parties A Contractor,
Person, or Business submitting bids or proposals for Procurements may in all instances request a
partial or full waiver of one or more established Project Specific Goal for PCE participation. In
making this determination, the Director will consider, at a minimum, whether the Contractor has:
the Good Faith Effort Transparency Report, pursuant to Section 34-281 and additional factors,
pursuant to Section 34-282.
(1) Solicited through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings,
advertising and written notices) the interest of all PCEs certified in the scopes of work of the
contract. The Contractor shall provide interested PCEs with timely, adequate information about
the plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow PCEs to respond to the
solicitation. The Contractor must follow up initial solicitations with interested PCEs.

19

 Board of Commissioners

March 21, 2019

Board of Commissioners

(2) Selected portions of the work to be performed by PCEs in order to increase the likelihood that
the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate, breaking out
contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate PCE participation, even when
the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces. It is the
Contractor's responsibility to make a portion of the work available to PCEs and to select those
portions of the work or material needs consistent with the availability of PCEs to facilitate their
participation.
(3) Negotiated in good faith with interested PCEs. Evidence of such negotiation includes the names,
addresses, and telephone numbers of PCEs that were contacted; a description of the information
provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and
why agreements could not be reached with PCEs. The Contractor may not reject PCEs as being
unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities. That
there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using PCEs is not in itself sufficient
reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as such costs are
reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the work of a contract with its own
organization does not relieve it of the responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all scopes of
work that could be subcontracted.
(4) Made efforts to assist interested PCEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or insurance as
required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.
(5) Made efforts to assist interested PCEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies, materials, or
related assistance or services, where appropriate.
(6) Used the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women community
organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government-sponsored minority/women
business assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the
recruitment and placement of PCEs.
(7) Maintains or commits to establish and maintain a mentor-protégé agreement with one or more
PCEs that is enforceable and that, in the judgement of the CCD, has performance standards and
outcomes that are clearly established and effective in terms of assisting the PCE in acquiring
additional skills, experience, and relationships helpful to the long-term success of the PCE
consistent with the provisions of Section 34-271(d).
(d)

In determining whether a Contractor, Person, or Business has made Good Faith Efforts, the
performance of other Contractors, Persons, or Businesses in meeting the Project Specific Goals may
be considered. For example, when the apparent successful Contractor, Person, or Business fails to
meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably questioned whether, with
additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor, Person, or Business could have met
the Project Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor, Person, or Business fails
to meet the Project Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average PCE participation obtained by
other Contractors, Persons, or Businesses, this may be evidence that the apparent successful
Contractor, Person, or Business made Good Faith Efforts.

(f) The CCD shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the scope of work and the
letters of intent from PCEs. The CCD may request clarification in writing of items listed in the

(g) If the CCD determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project Specific Goals have
been achieved or accepts the Good Faith Efforts Transparency Report submitted, made, with the
concurrence of the User Agency, the CCD and User Agency shall recommend award to Purchasing
Agent. The CCD must issue a report to the Board pursuant to Section 34-283 upon acceptance of the
Contractor’s Good Faith Effort Transparency Report no later than one week prior to the Board
meeting where the Contract seeks approval by the Board.

2nd PROPOSED SUBSTITUTE ORDINANCE AMENDMENT TO FILE #19-1965
AN AMENDMENT TO CHAPTER 74, ARTICLE II, REAL PROPERTY TAXATION
WHEREAS, vacant properties can devastate a neighborhood and block, undermine neighbors’ quality of
life, and diminish the value of nearby properties; and
WHEREAS, they also cause severe fiscal damage to local governments, reducing local tax revenues
while costing cities millions for policing, cleaning vacant lots, and demolishing derelict buildings; and
WHEREAS, most vacant buildings and houses are well maintained, but many are not and thousands can
sit empty for years, abandoned by their owners, deteriorating to the point where they cannot be reused
without major rehabilitation with many ultimately demolished, leaving vacant lots in their place; and
WHEREAS, besides their impact on social and economic conditions, vacant, abandoned properties have
a devastating effect on the fiscal condition of their cities, towns, and counties; and
WHEREAS, not only do they pay little in property taxes and generate little revenue for the city or county
when sold at tax sales, but they further reduce property tax collections by millions of dollars by devaluing
neighboring properties;

Board of Commissioners

NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter
74 - Taxation, Article II - Real Property Taxation, Division 2 - Classification System for Assessment,
Section 74-73, of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 74-73. - Suspension, Revocation or cancellation of incentive classification.
(a) The following Incentive Classifications are subject to suspension, revocation or cancellation
herein pursuant the provisions of this section: Class 6b; Class 6b (special circumstances); Class 6b
TEERM; Class 6b SER; Class 7a; Class 7b; Class 7c; Class 8; and Class 8 TEERM.
(b) The incentive may be suspended, revoked, or cancelled by the Assessor under the following
circumstances:
(1) By rule, as provided by the Assessor;
(2) By the County Board by Resolution or Ordinance, which is based on a report from the Bureau of
Economic Development that has been approved by the Economic Development Advisory
Committee of the County;
(3) By the County Board by Resolution or Ordinance at the request of the Municipality by
submission of a Municipal Resolution or Ordinance;
(4) By request of the taxpayer to cancel;
(5) Beginning in the 2019 assessment year and for all subsequent assessment years, upon
application of the municipality in which a property is located finding that the owner (s), which
has received a reduction in its assessed valuation due to receiving a property tax incentive as
classified in Sec. 74-73 (a) for two consecutive tax years and has not provided evidence to the
municipality that the owner has progressed in the leasing, development or sale of the property
as contemplated in the incentive classification application submitted by the owner (s), the
Assessor may suspend the property tax incentive relating to the property for a period not to
exceed two years, subject to a subsequent application to the Assessor by the owner (s) of said
property to restore the incentive, which application is supported by documentation of
development or occupancy. After a period of two years from the date of such suspension, if
said restoration application by the owner (s) is not received, the property tax incentive shall be
revoked.
(c) A basis for revocation pursuant to Section 74-73(b)(2) or (b)(3) above includes, but is not limited
to, the following:
(1) Failure to comply with the requirements of Section 74-71 or 74-72;
(2) Delinquency in the payment of any property taxes administered by Cook County or by a local
municipality; or

Board of Commissioners

(3) Inaccuracies or omissions in documents submitted by the taxpayer, including, but not limited to,
the application and the Economic Disclosure Statement.
(d) During such period as the Incentive Classification is suspended, the Assessor shall treat the
subject property as a Class 5 property for any tax year in which the suspension is in effect.
In case of revocation or cancellation, the Incentive Classification shall be deemed null and void for the tax
year in which the incentive was revoked or cancelled as to the subject property. In such an instance, the
taxpayer shall be liable for and shall reimburse to the County Collector an amount equal to the difference
in the amount of taxes that would have been collected had the subject property been assessed as a Class 5
property and the amount of taxes collected under the Incentive Classification as determined by the
Assessor.
Effective Date: This Ordinance Amendment shall be effective upon passage.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REQUESTING A HEARING OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION COMMITTEE TO
DISCUSS THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF VOLUNTARY REMOTE COURT
APPEARANCES
WHEREAS, audio and video appearances in courtrooms offer an enormous potential for savings,
revenue generation, environmental benefits, improved safety and remote access to justice which promotes
the administration of justice and equity in the courtroom; and
WHEREAS, remote court appearances allow attorneys and the public to appear in court for routine
matters involving Civil, Criminal, Family, Probate, Mental Health, Traffic, Juvenile, Bankruptcy and
other proceedings without leaving their homes or offices; and
WHEREAS, in 2016, In its Call to Action: Achieving Civil Justice for All, the Conference of Chief
Justices’ Civil Justice Improvement Committee set forth a convincing series of findings and
recommendations, which among them was the promotion of remote audio and video services for court
hearings and management; and
WHEREAS, the Center for Legal and Court Technology, a non-profit research organization that
improves the administration of Justice through the use of technology, progressively encourages the
utilization of remote and video court appearances throughout the United States to enhance the efficiency
of judicial administration and court proceedings for both attorney’s and the public; and
71

 Board of Commissioners

March 21, 2019

Board of Commissioners

WHEREAS, in 1992, the Supreme Court of Illinois adopted rule 185 to allow for telephonic appearances
in certain civil proceedings; and in 2017, the Supreme Court of Illinois amended its rules to also allow for
remote video conferences; and
WHEREAS, in Los Angeles Superior Court a system with approximately 494 judicial officers and
comparable to the Cook County Circuit Court, over 200 of those judicial officers allow for remote court
appearances with a volume of over 83,000 appearances in 2018; moreover, approximately $4.6 million in
revenue over a three-year period attributable to remote court appearances in Los Angeles was generated;
and
WHEREAS, in Illinois, approximately 20 counties spread over 12 Judicial Circuits utilize some form of
audio and video remote appearances with approximately 4,516 remote appearance being completed in
2018; more particularly, the following “Collar” county courts use remote court appearance technology:
the 16th Judicial Circuit - Kane County 3,305 appearances since 11/2011, the 18th Judicial Circuit Court DuPage County 1,379 since 9/2014, the 19th Judicial Circuit - Lake County 1,456 since 6/2016 and the
22nd Judicial Circuit - McHenry County 2,280 since 4/2014; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has been and continues to be a leader in technology through strategic
Countywide initiatives and collaboration with elected offices; thus, our existing applications and
resources will allow for a seamless integration of our existing technology platforms with audio and video
remote appearances; and
WHEREAS, the use of video and audio remote court appearances has the potential to offer key benefits
to the public, such as cost savings on attorney fees for lower-income citizens, increasing pro bono
assistance, availability of court interpreters, travel costs and work absences associated with attending a
court hearing can deter self-represented litigants from effectively pursuing or defending their legal rights,
thereby further promoting access to justice in courts.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby request a hearing of the Technology and Innovation Committee be convened to review and discuss
the potential feasibility, application, and access to justice that remote court appearances may have in
Cook County courtrooms; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a representative from the Chief Judge’s Office, Court of Clerk’s

DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS (DACA) AND
TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS (TPS) TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMIC AND
SOCIO-EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING OF IMPACTED YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES
WHEREAS, the separation of children from their parents is a violation of the human rights; and
WHEREAS, the rights of children should be protected so that they stay with their families; this is a core
value of the democratic ideals of this country; and
WHEREAS, the current situation is forcing many United States citizen children to leave their
communities and struggle to begin anew in their parents’ countries of origin. Often, they are placed in
situations in which their rights as United States citizens are denied as well as their universal rights as
children; and
WHEREAS, the five (5) million United States citizen children and two (2) million children brought to
this nation as infants, and raised here among United States citizens, should not be deprived of the sacred
right to family and parental guidance and support upon unnecessary separation; and
WHEREAS, President Obama issued executive orders which provided the deferral of deportation and the
provision of work authorization for undocumented individuals brought to this country as minors and
further established the practice of prosecutorial discretion to defer deportations until the Congress could
arrive at a permanent solution; and
WHEREAS, in spite of the continuing threat of injustice to children, the current administration has
cancelled those practices without Congress having established any alternative; and
WHEREAS, these provisions represented a just and much needed temporary relief and should be
maintained by act of Congress; and
WHEREAS, the children of those undocumented individuals are being forced every day to endure the
unimaginable pain and damage of family separation or deportation; and
WHEREAS, parents with United States citizen children who were given protected status through
prosecutorial discretion and who reported regularly to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as
they were required were among the first to be deported under this administration; and

73

 Board of Commissioners

March 21, 2019

Board of Commissioners

WHEREAS, there has been a 250% increase over the last year in deportations of those with no criminal
records, most of which have families and children, with the likelihood that these numbers will continue to
increase; and
WHEREAS, at least 325,000 Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, Hondurans, and Haitians have lived in this
country for many years and have established families with 273,000 United States born citizen children, as
well as other children brought here at an early age who have known no other country, now face the
cancellation of TPS and are being deported; and
WHEREAS, the psychological, educational, health, and economic effects of separation from their parents
have long-term effects on a child’s quality-of-life.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, the Cook County Board President and the Cook County
Board of Commissioners resolve this day that Congress should pass legislation that provides the right to
visas for the undocumented parents of United States citizen children or DACA eligible children, and of
TPS-recipient parents with United States citizen children or DACA-eligible children; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that these Visas should be renewable every three (3) years on proof of
the continued verification of the original conditions of issue; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urge our congressional
representatives to pass such legislation with all deliberate speed to immediately stop this violation of the
human rights of children and their rights as United States citizens.

Exhibit A
FIRST AMENDMENT TO REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT
THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (this “Amendment”) is dated
as of February __, 2019 (the “Amendment Effective Date”), between THE COUNTY OF COOK, ILLINOIS, a
body politic and corporate and home rule unit of the State of Illinois (the “County”) and BMO HARRIS

The definition of “LIBOR Quoted Rate” is hereby amended by adding the

If the LIBOR Quoted Rate is not available at such time for any reason, then the rate for

interest rates in a similar manner, as selected by the Lender. In order to account for the
relationship of the replacement index to the original LIBOR Quoted Rate, an additional
spread will be taken into account in the replacement rate as is necessary to ensure that
such alternate method will measure interest rates in a manner similar to the original
LIBOR Quoted Rate. Any successor rate or alternate methodology must be an interestbased index, variations in the value of which can reasonably be expected to measure
contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds in United States dollars.

rate.

Board of Commissioners

Consistent with the County Code, §1.9, the following proposal, which was approved by the Cook County
Assessor on 3/15/2019, will be effective on the date this rule revision is received and filed by the Rules
Committee of the County Board of Commissioners.
The Cook County Assessor’s Rules provide requirements, parameters and guidance to persons doing
business with the Assessor. Taxpayer assistance will be provided to individuals by Assessor personnel
during normal business hours.
FILING AN ASSESSED VALUATION APPEAL COMPLAINT
Rule 1 All complaints for an Assessment Appeal (Appeal) shall be originated by the taxpayer’s timely
filing of the official appeal form(s) prescribed and adopted by the Assessor, as set forth in these Official
Rules of the Cook County Assessor.
Rule 2 All attorneys or other parties acting on behalf of a taxpayer shall file an Attorney Authorization or
Authorization Form and the filing of the Form shall constitute a certification that the attorney or party has
been specifically authorized to file the complaint by the taxpayer, and is the only person so
authorized.
Only the Assessor’s original Attorney Authorization or Authorization Form may be filed. The Form
may not be altered in any way from its original format, or language, or in any other manner. References in
these Rules to the actions of a “taxpayer” include actions of an authorized attorney or practitioner on the
taxpayer’s behalf.
Rule 3 Failure to follow any rule of the Cook County Assessor’s Office or to provide complete
information is grounds for the denial of an appeal.
Rule 4 Each form required to be filed by these rules shall be filed with all applicable information
completed in its entirety.
Rule 5 Pursuant to Rule 1, complaints must be filed on the official appeal form prescribed and adopted
by the Assessor. All sections on the form must be completed. Once filed no other copy of this complaint
form will be valid. Except as provided in Rule 23, forms may not be filed by facsimile (fax). Forms can
be found on the Assessor’s website at www.cookcountyassessor.com/Appeals/Appeal-Forms.aspx
<http://www.cookcountyassessor.com/Appeals/Appeal-Forms.aspx>
Rule 6 The official application form for a Certificate of Error and supporting documentation must be
filed in triplicate. Generally, an application for a Certificate of Error generally must be filed during the
period when a taxpayer may file an appeal based on the Township schedule posted on the Assessor’s
website. If a taxpayer seeks a change in classification based on the exempt status or property, an incentive
classification, or due to the application of a homestead type exemption (such as homestead, senior, senior
freeze, veterans, disabled and disabled veterans), an application may be filed at any time. Please see
Assessment Calendar at: www.cookcountyassessor.com/Appeals/Appeal-Deadlines.aspx
http://www.cookcountyassessor.com/Appeals/Appeal-Deadlines.aspx
Rule 7 A complaint must be filed on or before the date established by the Assessor as the official appeal
closing date for the Township in which the property is located. The Assessor will post in its office and
will publish on its website the opening and closing dates for filing for each of the 38 townships in

182

Board of Commissioners

official appeal filing period as published on the Assessor’s website.
Rule 8 All complaints except individual residential complaints, must be filed in the office of the
Assessor, County Building, Room 301, 118 N. Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois 60602, either in person, or
by a courier or mail service. The date of a U.S. Postal Service postmark or the receipted date of shipment
via a courier or mail service will be considered the date of filing for a complaint received by the Assessor.
The Assessor is not responsible for complaints sent by courier or mail that are not received on time.
Appeals for individual residential taxpayers may be filed at any location of the Cook County Assessor’s
Office, filed online, or mailed in accordance with the above provisions.
Rule 9 If property that is the subject of an appeal consists of two or more contiguous or neighboring
Property Index Numbers (PINs) at one location, the PINs shall be listed on one complaint form. Multiple
PINs that are not contiguous or do not comprise a single property at a one location, shall be
filed
as
separate appeals.
Rule 10 If more than one complaint is filed for the same PIN, the first complaint filed will be considered
by the Assessor as controlling. All subsequent complaints will be disregarded, provided, however, that in
the event that more than one attorney or representative files a complaint on the same PIN(s), all parties
filing on the same property shall be notified by the Assessor and the Assessor will request a properly
executed Authorization or Substitution form. A party may substitute an appearance on behalf of a
taxpayer while the appeal is pending at the Assessor’s Office prior to the close of the Township filing or
review period, by filing with the Assessor a completed Withdrawal and Substitution form. The
complaint, the appeal Authorization or Attorney Authorization Form, and any Withdrawal
and
Substitution form shall be grouped separately from other documents filed with the appeal. All other
documents that provide substance in support of an appeal should include ONLY the attorney or
practitioner’s number and not identifying law firm, attorney or practitioner information. For

Board of Commissioners

Rule 19 Where the property that is the subject of appeal is an income producing property, in whole or in
part, the taxpayer shall file with the Assessor a copy of Schedule E of the taxpayer’s 1040 IRS form for
the three previous tax years (signed by the prepare), actual income and expense statements for the three
previous years, and the Assessor’s Real Property Income and Expense (RPIE) form, which can be found

must be in affidavit form signed by the affiant. The Assessor’s Real Property and Expense (RPIE) form
or data is required to be filed electronically via the Assessor’s website.
Income producing property is defined as non-owner occupied parcels of real property that generate
rental income, but does not include residential properties with 6 or fewer units. Whether or not hotels and
motels are owner occupied, they are considered income producing property for purposes of these Rules.
Except for apartment buildings with more than 6 units, the taxpayer shall file with the Assessor an
affidavit* setting forth any relationship (other than landlord and tenant) between the parties to any
submitted lease including, but not limited to, those existing by blood, or marriage to the second degree,
corporate parent-subsidiary companies, or ownership by virtue of non-publicly held stock. The Assessor
may request copies of fully executed leases.
Rule 20 If assessment relief is sought on the grounds of “vacancy” at a specific property, the taxpayer
shall file:
1. A Vacancy/Occupancy Affidavit on the form provided by the Assessor; (Occupancy shall
include all space actually occupied or for which rent is being paid or is payable, even though the
space may actually be vacant);
2. Dated photographs of the interior vacant space and/or units; and
3. An affidavit setting forth the duration of, and reason for the vacancy, the attempts made to
lease the vacant space with documents such as copies of listings and advertisements utilized in
such efforts attached. If no such effort was made, the affidavit must set forth the reason no
attempt to rent such space was made. The affidavit must comport with the form Affidavit found
on the assessor’s website.
4. If relief is sought on the grounds of “vacancy,” the utility bills for the term the vacancy is
requested must be filed.
5. As applicable, all documents required by Rule 19 also must also be filed. The
Assessor
is
charged with assessing property at a percentage of its fair cash value as defined in the Illinois
Property Tax Code, 35 ILCS 200/1 et seq. If vacancy relief is requested, market data will be
considered as well as specific property characteristics. The Illinois Property Tax Code authorizes
a reduction in a property’s assessed value on a limited basis during a period
for which buildings or improvements are destroyed, rendered uninhabitable or otherwise unfit for
occupancy or for customary use by accidental, unintentional means. See 35 ILCS 200/9-180; 35
ILCS 200/1-150.

 Board of Commissioners

March 21, 2019

Board of Commissioners

3. An original and clear photograph of the subject property before and after demolition. The date
of the demolition photograph must appear on the photograph.
Rule 22 An argument that a portion of a property should be treated as excess-vacant land shall be
supported by a plat of survey detailing the dimensions and locations of all buildings, parking areas, or
other improvements, any unimproved areas or storage used, and any ingress, egress or product or person
flow across the property. The actual use of the property shall be specified. A recent original and clear
photograph of the land claimed to be excess shall be filed with the Assessor.
REVIEW OF AN ASSESSED VALUATION APPEAL DECISION
Rule 23 A taxpayer dissatisfied with a decision of the Assessor may request a review of the case. The
review process is not to be employed to cure a failure to timely submit documents required by the
Assessor. Review requests should not simply dispute the Assessor’s capitalization rates, expense
ratios, and rulings of law without further detailed explanation and analysis. Nor should
requests
simply reiterate or resubmit previously advanced arguments and materials without new supporting
evidence or argument to justify reconsideration. Review requests must be made in writing and
delivered to the Assessor in person, via mail or facsimile. Review requests must meet the following
criteria:
1. be filed timely, within 5 days of the date of the letter from the Assessor informing the appellant
of the Assessor's decision;
2. identify the assessment, township and complaint number and the relevant PIN numbers of the
case; and,
3. state the specific grounds for the review request.
The only grounds for a review request which the Assessor will consider are:
1. newly discovered, obtained or received evidence, accompanied with documentation
demonstrating the previous unavailability of the documents;
2. changes in the law, setting forth the previous law and the relevant changes thereto;
3. an error or mistake in the Assessor’s previous application of existing law, setting forth the
alternative theory being advanced;
4. evidence provided in response to a request of the Assessor.
These rules shall be effective on the date of adoption by the Cook County Assessor.
