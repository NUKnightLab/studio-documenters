(Item A1)
In anticipation of issuing bonds to finance the cost of rehabilitating, redeveloping, demolishing
and/or improving public housing units, the Authority requested proposals from firms wishing to
serve as Issuer’s Counsel for its financing program for the next two years. The Authority’s
Capital Improvement Plan may involve the sale of between $50 million and $150 million of
Multifamily Revenue or Governmental Purpose Bonds over the next several years. Of the eleven
proposals received and evaluated on the bases of a pre-defined set of evaluation criteria, the
evaluation committee found Kutak Rock to have submitted the most responsive proposal.
Accordingly, the resolution of Item A1 approves award of contract to Kutak Rock.
RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA- 16
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated January 27, 2004 entitled “Approval of Kutak Rock to Serve
as Issuer’s Counsel”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approves the attached
Resolution authorizing Kutak Rock LLP to serve as the Authority’s Issuer’s
Counsel pursuant to Request for Proposal #01262. As the Issuer’s Counsel, and
on the direction of the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer,
Kutak Rock would assist the Authority on all bond transactions, as well as on
special projects that arise on a case-by-case basis over the next two-year period.

 (Item A2)
In anticipation of issuing bonds to finance the cost of rehabilitating, redeveloping, demolishing
and/or improving public housing units, the Authority issued a Request for Qualification to
procure a pre-qualified pool of law firms to serve as Bond Counsel for the next two years. Of the
fourteen responses received and evaluated on the basis of a pre-defined set of evaluation criteria,
the evaluation committee recommended the following five firms: Chapman & Cutler, Golen &
Associates, Hawkins Delafield & Wood, Holland & Knight and Mayer Brown Rowe and Maw.
While Kutak Rock was found to have submitted the most responsive qualifications, Kutak is
ineligible to serve in the pool because they were chosen to serve as the Authority’s Issuer’s
Counsel. All of the firms selected for the pool have extensive experience providing counsel on
housing finance transactions, and three of the selected five firms in the pool have served or are
currently serving the Authority in the capacity of Bond Counsel. Accordingly, the resolution of
Item A2 approves award of contract to the above stated firms.

for professional environmental consulting and testing services. Of the twelve proposals received,
two firms, EDI and GSG were found to be in the competitive range. Contracts with both firms
are needed to allow the CHA the flexibility to seek services of an alternate firm, if the firm
initially contacted is unable to promptly respond to a CHA work order and/or handle all of the
required work within the necessary framework. Accordingly, the resolution for Item B1
approves award of contract to EDI and GSG.
RESOLUTION NO. 2004-CHA-18

$500,000.00 for an aggregate total amount not-to-exceed $2,000,000.00.

(Item B2)
As part of the Capital Improvement Program, the CHA uses the services of Owner’s
Representatives to oversee the rehabilitation of senior and family housing units. The Owner’s
Representatives represent the CHA at construction sites and manages the activities of the
architect and the general contractor from design period through end of construction. In October
2003 a Request for Proposal was advertised, for Owner’s Representative services. Of the nine
