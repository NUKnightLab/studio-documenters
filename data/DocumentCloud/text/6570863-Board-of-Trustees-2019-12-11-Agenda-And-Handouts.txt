Trustee Sherman thanked the applicants and CAC staff for their diligent work and thanked the Cuyahoga
county residents for their generous support.

6. FINANCE REPORT
Ms. Harris’ financial report can be found here. Trustee Mendez requested clarification around forecasting
and how that guides us moving forward, especially as lower tax receipts will necessitate significant

11 of 38

 decreases to future GOS allocations. Ms. Harris stated that in 2017 CAC created a 10-year budget model
in order to anticipate tax receipts and estimated corresponding expenditures for the full 10-year time period
of the second levy. The forecast is updated annually in order to reflect current and more accurate revenue
forecasts. Ms. Harris noted that while the 2017 model anticipated a GOS allocation for 2022-2023 of $9.2
million, CAC now anticipates future allocations will be lower than that amount due to accelerated decreases
in tax revenue. As CAC has done in past cycles, decreases in allocation and the impact on grants to
organizations will be consistently communicated to grantees as far in advance as possible.
7. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SEARCH

 Interim Executive Director’s Report
Regular Meeting of the Board of Trustees
11 December 2019

Welcome to our final CAC Board meeting of 2019.
Congratulations on a productive and positive year! I thank each Board and staff member for your ongoing
support and commitment to our mission.
We did all this by working together – alongside the nearly 300 groups we fund and the thousands of
residents we reach every month. To see a more complete picture of CAC’s 2019 accomplishments, please
review the Staff Report in this packet.
For today’s meeting, you will be asked to take several actions, including the approval of:
 three Support for Artists grants;
 Neighborhood Connections grant and contract;
 ioby grant;
 downtown orchestra concert grant;
 our 2020 budget; and
 several administrative matters, including contracts for 2020 that will help us achieve our
programmatic and communications goals.
While not an action item at this meeting, know that our strategic alliance work with Arts Cleveland and the
Arts & Culture Action Committee continues. By the time we meet on the 11th, the strategic alliance working
group will have met again to continue exploring ways that our three organizations can work together to
serve our arts community and all residents. I look forward to having every Board member contribute to this
work in 2020.
Finally, while this meeting wraps up key work for 2019, we’re already deep into planning for next year.
Our team formalized its 2020 team objectives and will share progress with and seek feedback from each of
you throughout next year.
As always, I thank you in advance for spending time in the materials and preparing for a positive meeting.

 CAC Board Meeting December 11, 2019
Updates from Staff: 2019 Highlights

Each year, Cuyahoga Arts & Culture staff members identify team objectives to guide our work that are
mindful of the staff team agreements that we have made with one another, and grounded in CAC’s Mission,
Vision & Values. Once again, our team objectives fell into three areas: 1) grantmaking – connecting with
artists and organizations; 2) communications – connecting with residents; and 3) effective teamwork and
operations. What follows is a summary of the work the team accomplished in 2019.

1. GRANTMAKING: Connecting with artists and organizations
Our 2019 objectives were to 1) continue to build strong working relationships and connections with the 282
groups we fund; 2) build community by co-hosting Arts and Culture Network Nights; 3) seek feedback and
work with grant recipients to increase equitable access to and improve our grant programs; 4) offer racial
equity learning opportunities for our grant recipients to spark change; and 5) continue our Support for Artist
initiatives.
Managed the Portfolio and Built Stronger Relationships. To better understand our grant recipients’ work
and steward public funds, CAC:


Managed a portfolio of 282 grant recipients in its two primary grant programs (PS19 and GOS19),
offering personalized customer service.



Held five workshops for new Project Support grantees in early 2019. These meetings were held at
our grantees’ locations, which allowed them to highlight their work, their communities and their
neighborhoods. Over 50 people from 36 organizations attended.



Conducted in-person meetings with over 100 grant recipients, including technical assistance,
report feedback meetings and site visits. Attended hundreds of cultural events – a vital step in
understanding our grant recipients and informing our work.



Trained approximately 100 people at in-person workshops for our 2020 Project Support program
to allow for success at all levels of our process. Our workshops included an updated section
highlighting the importance of respecting the communities that our grant recipients are serving,
along with some tips to begin to implement this work.



Continued to offer in-person “office hour” sessions, through a revised approach, in order to
provide personalized support and feedback to applicants.



Conducted strong outreach and consistent technical assistance to existing grant recipients and new
applicants, in both PS and GOS, resulting in a 2020 portfolio of 277 grant recipients.



Developed new working relationships with 20 first-time grant recipients. We look forward to
sharing their stories on our digital platforms and introducing thousands of residents to new
organizations.



Continued our investment as presenting sponsor of The Cleveland Orchestra’s Star-Spangled
Spectacular for the 12th consecutive year. At the board’s December meeting, CAC will bring before

15 of 38

 the board a recommendation to renew support of this community concert for the 13th year in 2020.
See the contracts table at the end of this packet for more details.

Expanded Our Technical Assistance Offerings. In response to requests, and in an effort to be of service
to our grant recipients, CAC:


Worked with SMU DataArts to present “Data + Stories”, a workshop for arts & cultural
organizations to learn how to connect Cultural Data Profile data to stories about their mission
and impact. Representatives from 23 arts organizations attended, learning how to use the DataArts
system as a powerful tool to help tell their stories.



Built upon our work with racial equity training expert Erica Merritt to revise and continue offering
“The Power of Words” – an addition to our applicant workshop that stressed the importance of
respecting the communities that our grant recipients are serving. This information was also shared
with General Operating Support grant recipients.



Building upon positive results from last cycle, and responding to previous applicant feedback
seeking online options for technical assistance, staff created a series of four technical assistance
videos that covered both Project Support and General Operating Support application processes and
included a video version of “The Power of Words”. Technical assistance videos were viewed more
than 150 times on CAC’s YouTube channel.



Continued to offer “Cultural Partner Connection,” a newsletter for our grant recipients (12 issues
sent in 2019 to more than 800 individuals each month), that responds to the interest of the groups
we fund, connecting them to resources, additional funding opportunities, trainings and trends in the
field. This newsletter continues to receive higher than average open and click ratings.

Conducted Public Panels. In order to review and recommend grants in a transparent and impartial manner,
CAC staff recruited 25 panelists from around the country. Staff trained panelists in the review process and
funding criteria, and stressed the connection between respecting community and public benefit. Panelists
read, reviewed and scored 221 Project Support applications in September. Staff worked to prioritize panelist
diversity across age, race, gender and discipline. What follows is a self-identified breakdown by
race/ethnicity, gender, and age of our 2020 panelists:

o 7 people attended the in-person review at Idea Center, 100 listened to the online audio
livestream.
o Panel was a full-team effort, with Luis, Heather and Dan chairing the panel proceedings
while India and Allison managed day-of logistics and communications.



The smaller Project Support II panel was conducted completely online, as it has been in previous
years.
o 15 panelists reviewed 155 applications in late September recommending 151 for funding.
o Panelists wrote comments, along with their scores, which have been shared with applicants
as feedback and as an educational tool for future applications.
o Though this panel was conducted online, it still represented a team effort. India managed
technical assistance to panelists using the FluidReview online system, while Luis, Heather
and Dan monitored and managed panelist feedback. Jake and India finalized the creation
of the comments/scoring documents.

Highlighting 20 New Grant recipients. 20 Project Support II grant recipients will be receiving CAC
funding for the first time in 2020. CAC will work to promote their work through a social media campaign
in December. Luis, Heather, Dan and India will lead new grant recipient meetings early in 2020 to help
ensure our newest grant recipients are successful during the grant period.
These new organizations (listed below) and their projects cover a range of programming that reflects the
arts & cultural ecosystem of Cuyahoga County.

Continued Grantmaking Partnership with Neighborhood Connections. In 2013, CAC formed a
partnership with Neighborhood Connections, a grassroots grantmaking program affiliated with the
Cleveland Foundation. Since then, CAC has funded over 340 resident-led arts and culture projects in
Cleveland and East Cleveland. In 2019, our $75,000 investment helped co-fund 24 neighborhood
projects. Through our investment in Neighborhood Connections, CAC co-funded grants of up to $5,000
twice a year in May and November to groups of residents in Cleveland and East Cleveland who organize
projects to improve the quality of life in their neighborhoods. Groups are encouraged to work with their
neighbors to propose creative solutions to challenges in their community.
This year, Dan worked closely with Neighborhood Connections throughout its Round 33 and Round 34
grantmaking processes. Dan met with newly co-funded organizations to help introduce them to CAC and
served as a liaison on Neighborhood Connections Round 34 grantmaking committee. In this role, he helped
to focus the committee on the criteria and purposes of the grant program.
At the December meeting, CAC will bring before the board a contract to continue our work with
Neighborhood Connections to co-fund arts and culture, resident-led, grassroots projects in 2020. This work
is in addition to the Arts & Culture Network Nights that we will continue to co-host with Neighborhood
Connections. See the contracts table at the end of this packet for more details.
Supported Resident-Led Arts & Culture Projects with ioby. In early 2019, the board approved a $60,000
grant to ioby, which created the Cuyahoga Arts & Culture Match Fund. In its first year, 18 resident project
leaders from across Cuyahoga County were able to make use of the match funds as well as take advantage
of ioby's crowdfunding platform and fundraising coaching to raise a total of $102,580 for resident-led arts
& cultural projects. The CAC Match Fund launched in April and was drawn down by August.
Building off of a successful first grant to ioby, CAC will bring before the board at its December meeting a
contract to continue to match the crowdfunding efforts of resident-led arts and culture projects throughout
Cuyahoga County. For 2020, CAC is recommending a modest increase to its grant to ioby of $72,000, with
the goals of keeping the matching campaign open longer and increasing the number of supported projects.
See the contracts table at the end of this packet for more details.
Offered Opportunities to Bring Together the Arts & Cultural Community. Working with
Neighborhood Connections, CAC offered quarterly opportunities to convene our grant recipients, artists
and residents:


In 2019, CAC continued to work with Neighborhood Connections to offer four Arts & Culture
Network Nights (February, June, August and November). These events were well attended by
representatives from CAC-funded organizations, individual artists and residents engaged in the arts

18 of 38

 & cultural community. The goal of these quarterly organizing events is to spark connection and
inspire collective action among our arts and cultural community. Each Network Night was attended
by 50-60 participants and fostered inspiring conversations and connections. A few “communitybuilding wins” include:
o

Collective Express, Summer of Sisterhood, and Mama Fasi Cultural Experience, all
Neighborhood Connection and/or CAC grant recipients performed at Network Night. Their
performances provided our event with live music but also exposed participants to their
organizations and artists.

o

Based on conversations hosted by participants, we identified three themes that ran through
all of the four events hosted in 2019: building racial equity in arts and culture; economic
development through the arts; and a need for support with grant-writing and access to
funding. Through follow-up and network weaving we were able to push one of these topics
toward action. Make Art Talk Race: Decolonizing Wealth is a book discussion group that
will culminate in an art piece created collectively by participants

o

Multiple individuals made connections that assisted them with furthering their arts and
culture project or programming. Participants helped one another with grant writing,
donations, transportation, collaborations and much more.

Racial Equity Institute for Grant Recipients. CAC continued to raise awareness about the need for racial
equity in the arts by fully funding the participation of CAC-funded organizations in Racial Equity Institute
(REI) learning sessions, in partnership with Cleveland Neighborhood Progress and ThirdSpace Action Lab.
As of September 2019, over 130 individuals have participated in the two-day Phase I session or the halfday Groundwater session. We look forward to continuing to offer this opportunity to our grant recipients.
Visit our equity page to see the list of organizations who have attended REI through our offer.
Moving Toward Equity. CAC hosted a series of four racial equity workshops facilitated by Erica Merritt
of Equius. These workshops were offered to General Operating Support grant recipients to help them move
from learning to action and implement racial equity strategies and practices in their organizations. Each
session sold out and addressed different topics including 1) assessing and implementing racial equity
strategies 2) equity competent leadership 3) tools for evaluating challenges within your organization 4)
based on the feedback of participants.
Race Forward. CAC hosted a 1.5 day Building Racial Equity training on October 17-18 by Race Forward,
a national organization leading innovative approaches to help people take effective action towards racial
equity. The training was open to all CEOs and Executive Directors from organizations receiving General
Operating Support funding. In all, 53 executive leaders from 46 grantee organizations attended the training.
The interactive training connected attendees to racial equity concepts especially as they pertain to the arts.
In addition to exploring core concepts about race and racism, the training provided space to explore how
implicit bias affects institutional practices, provided tips for cultural leaders as they plan to create
organizational equity commitments, and share tools for advancing racial equity in day-to-day activities.
The majority of the attendees rated the training as excellent to very good. Attendees also noted that the
training created a safe place for people to talk about the impact of racism and implicit bias. Other general
evaluation comments included:


Clearly defined the difference between equity, diversity and inclusion and that diversity and
inclusion doesn’t equal equity.

Participants gained a lot of new information that opened up their eyes.
Trainings and staff where very knowdlegable in the topic of diversity, inclusion and equity.

Made Seven Grants to Provide Support and Funding to Over 150 Local Artists. Throughout 2019,
Cuyahoga Arts & Culture staff worked with seven nonprofits to provide a range of support and funding
opportunities for Cuyahoga County artists. These included fellowships, project-based funding, access to
physical spaces to create and display artworks, professional development, relationship-building and
collaboration between artists and nonprofit organizations, and more. In all, more than 150 artists connected
with a CAC-funded program or funding opportunity in 2019.

COMMUNICATIONS: Connecting with residents

Our 2019 objectives were to: 1) Develop and grow our calendar and events and artist calendar/directory
ClevelandArtsEvents.com to connect residents with the groups we fund; 2) utilize earned media, media
partnerships and social media to build community and promote groups we fund, using a racial equity lens;
3) serve as a marketing resource for our partners; and 4) build positive awareness of CAC and promote
transparency with all of our stakeholders.
Showcasing our Grant Recipients and Connecting with Residents. In 2019, staff aimed to tell the stories
of our grant recipients in meaningful and compelling ways, in conjunction with the promotion of
ClevelandArtsEvents.com. In partnership with Compelling Communications, staff continued to connect
with CAC’s two audiences: the nonprofit organizations we support as part of the broader arts and cultural
community, and the residents of Cuyahoga County. Key projects in 2019 to support this objective included:
2018 Annual Report. At the April 2019 meeting, we released the annual Report to the Community in print
and online at cacgrants.org/2018.
Focusing on shared experiences and the unifying power of arts and
culture, the report summarizes Cuyahoga Arts & Culture’s annual
activities and highlights a number of CAC-funded organizations across
our grant programs, including support for artists. Key results include:




In addition to the online version, staff mailed hard copies to more
than 550 grant recipients, key community leaders, media and
elected officials.
The report has been viewed online more than 1,000 times since
its release.
An additional 15,000 subscribers read about the report via e-mail
and hundreds connected with the stories and data through an
engaging social media campaign on our Twitter, Facebook and
Instagram.

Media Partnerships Highlight Grantees, Connect Residents to CAC. As part of our media partnership
with Fresh Water Cleveland, twelve features were issued to raise awareness of CAC’s grant recipients and
other initiatives. Each piece shared a unique perspective on CAC-funded activities and invited the public
to connect with CAC to learn more. These stories received over 5,000 views on Fresh Water Cleveland’s
website. In addition, CAC ads are featured prominently on their website, driving nearly 1,000 additional
visits to our events calendar.
In addition, CAC continued its successful digital media with Raycom Media, managed by CBS/Channel 19
Cleveland and launched a new partnership with WKYC Channel 3. In addition to creating a high-quality
promotional video, we reached new audiences and markets through both locally-aired commercials and
monthly appearances alongside CAC-funded groups on Live on Lakeside.

Digital Presence Continues to Build Connections. CAC continued its efforts to maintain a bold and
engaging digital presence in 2019, bolstered by our summer communications intern and varied campaigns
to raise awareness of the Cleveland Arts Events brand. Again in 2019, we grew or maintained participation
across all our social platforms.

 From June through August, staff implemented a summer campaign to drive awareness of and engagement
with our online events calendar and brand: www.ClevelandArtsEvents.com. The campaign included paid
and earned media, a robust social media plan, and online ads. The campaign resulted in:
 More than 35,000 website visitors (an average 3,000 active visitors per week),
 nearly 100,000 pages viewed on the website,
 visitors stayed for an average of 90 seconds, on par with industry average.

Promoted the Portfolio and Public Events of Regional Artists.
Throughout 2019, we have promoted and curated our Artist Calendar
and Directory portion of our website at ClevelandArtsEvents.com.
Artists have the opportunity to be viewed by thousands of visitors,
share events and find opportunities all on ClevelandArtsevents.com.
Our directory currently has over 170 artist profiles and as of December,
we have sent out 172, $25 cash cards, totaling in over $4,000 in thanks
to artists for sharing their profiles and work with the residents of
Cuyahoga county. We are continuously thinking of ways we can
connect residents to artists, and at the end of 2019, we added an Artist
spotlight to our bi-weekly event newsletter. We look forward to
collaborating with existing artist networks/directories, sharing artist
events, and promoting this resource further in 2020.

 Media Placements. Cuyahoga Arts & Culture continues to see steady and broad-reaching traditional media
coverage in print, radio, and on broadcast media.
CAC Media Exposure in 2019, by Month

In addition to consistent crediting for Cuyahoga Arts & Culture in the media by our partners, below are a
sampling of the hundreds of media placements focused on or mentioning CAC’s work or support in
2019, that contributed to continued awareness of CAC:


Racial equity trainings aim to build awareness about structural racism “…Cuyahoga
Arts and Culture challenges [implicit] bias by paying for its grantees to attend the REI
workshops. Since the scholarships began in 2018, 282 people have participated, Paulsen
says…” (July 25, 2019) – Fresh Water Cleveland



Arts and Culture Night Offers NE Ohio’s Creative Community the Chance to Meet
and Mingle “…The event is an informal networking evening for artists and creatives,
people involved with arts organizations and those just interested in furthering the arts in
northeast Ohio…” (August 20, 2019) – CoolCleveland



CAC, ioby collaboration raises money for grassroots artistic endeavors “When
Cuyahoga Arts & Culture and ioby Cleveland put their heads together, they support some
great individuals doing some inspiring projects in Cleveland.” (August 29, 2019) – Fresh
Water Cleveland



A changing Cuyahoga Arts and Culture makes few changes in organizational grants
“Cuyahoga Arts and Culture keeps going through changes, but not in its main work:
funding operations and projects of local arts groups.” (November 13, 2019) – Cleveland
Plain Dealer



Arts Groups Share $11.8M In Funding From Cuyahoga Arts & Culture “Just under
$12 million in grant funding is going to area orchestras, dance groups and other cultural
organizations in 2020 from the cigarette tax revenue distributed by Cuyahoga Arts and
Culture (CAC).” (November 15, 2019) – ideastream

EFFECTIVE TEAMWORK AND OPERATIONS

Our 2019 objectives were to: 1) continue our commitment to professional development for all team
members and use our new CRM to its fullest, ensuring good customer service and share agency knowledge;
2) consistently use our racial equity primes to guide our decision-making; 3) continue to steward public
funds in a responsible and transparent manner; 4) expand CAC’s capacity by offering internship
opportunities.


India was chosen for AFTA’s Arts and Culture Leaders of Color Fellowship, one of four from
Cleveland. CAC was pleased to recognize India’s leadership, contributions and increased
responsibility with a promotion to Senior Associate – grant programs + communications.
Congratulations and thank you, India.



We also said goodbye to Roshi Ahmadian in early January when she moved to Chicago to take on
a great opportunity at the Pritzker Traubert Foundation. Her role has been folded into the existing
team members’ work; we are grateful for staff flexibility and willingness to go above and beyond
to cover key grants management and communication functions.



Set and Measured Goals. All CAC staff members tracked progress against their personal
professional development plans each quarter, concentrating on ways to work smarter, not just
harder, resulting in a team that stayed focused on key objectives.



Maintained a Commitment to Learning, with a Focus on Racial Equity. Internal Equity
Team. CAC has been on continuous journey of learning and action around our organizational
value of equity. This year we hosted a capacity building program for our General Operating Support
grantees called Moving Towards Equity. As participants in these sessions, CAC staff completed an
internal assessment using the “Continuum on Becoming an Anti-Racist Multicultural
Organization.” We identified ourselves as between Stage 3 (Symbolic Change) and Stage 4 (An
Affirming Institution). As a result, CAC formed an Internal Equity Team (IET) of three staff
members; India Pierre-Ingram, Luis Gomez and Heather Johnson-Banks; who volunteered to
further this effort.
The IET will guide the full staff through next steps and ensure accountability to continuing our
racial equity work. We welcome the Board’s feedback regarding where you think we are on the
“Continuum on Becoming an Anti-Racist Multicultural Organization,” and looking forward to
continuing this work as a full board and staff team.



Implemented new CRM system: Akoya. CAC continues to refine its use of its new CRM Akoya
to automate notifications and track its entire grant process. The system continues to increase
efficiency around reporting and application deadlines and provide grant program analytics.



Received the Auditor of State Award. Once again, CAC received the highest opinion that the
Auditor of State gives: no findings and no material weaknesses for our 2018 financial audit, which
led to CAC once again receiving the Auditor of State Award, an award received by fewer than 5%
of public agencies in Ohio. Thanks to Meg for her longstanding attention to this work.

 FINANCIAL UPDATE
2019 YTD
Revenue. Tax revenue through November 30 was $12,681,718. This is $399,642 (3.3%) below budget
year-to-date and $1,081,386 (8.5%) below revenue for the same period in 2018. Interest revenue through
November was $325,995. This exceeds YTD forecast by $75,000.
As of November 30, CAC investment of inactive monies were as follows:
 RedTree Investment Group: $15,741,196 (target yield 2.1%)
 STAR Ohio: $2,998,875 (yield 1.88%)
Expenditure. Expenditures through November were $13,737,320 and are tracking under budget by
$663,000 primarily due to open positions and timing of expenditures.
2019 Year End Outlook
As noted above, revenue to date is $1,081,386 (8.5%) below revenue for the same period in 2018. This
decline in tax receipts is significantly below revenue projections for 2019 and we do not expect December’s
tax receipts to make up this difference. Expenses have also been below budget which is primarily related
open staff positions and lower spending across several grant programs. We will finish the year with
expenses approximately $650,000 below budget and will draw $961,000 from the reserve to balance the
expenditures vs revenue for the year.

2020 Support for Artists second round of grant recommendations

Board Action Requested: At the December 11 meeting, staff recommends three grants to nonprofits
(totaling $202,000) to provide support to Cuyahoga County artists in 2020. This is the second of
multiple Support for Artists grant recommendations for 2020; staff will present the remaining
recommendations in Q1/2 next year.

Background
At its February 2018 meeting, the Board unanimously approved a workplan to develop and deliver support for
individual artists in Cuyahoga County. The plan was informed by the Board-approved key elements for support
for artists and the Support for Artists Planning Team’s extensive recommendations from December 2017.
Informed by hundreds of residents and artists, this work led CAC to launch a public “call for partners” in May
2018 to identify nonprofits to provide funding and support for artists. During this time, the Learning Lab was
also launched through a grant to the Center for Performance and Civic Practice to meet the needs of artists. In
total, CAC funded seven (7) nonprofits through the Support for Artists grant program in 2018-19, with some
projects flowing into 2020.
For more information about this process, the recommendations and funded programs, visit cacgrants.org/artists.

Progress Report
In 2019, CAC rolled out its Support for Artists grants to fund nonprofits to provide funding, support and services
to artists in Cuyahoga County. Through these grants, more than 150 artists have directly benefitted through
fellowships, project-based funding, access to physical spaces, professional development, and more. By
prioritizing funding for artists who foster artistic expression and identify as historically marginalized or
underrepresented, CAC has furthered its commitment to racial equity. In fact, an estimated 70% of artists who
received funding and 55% of overall participants in the Support for Artist programs and events identified as
people of color.
During the last year, staff assessed and monitored the Support for Artists grants through regular reports and site
visits to each nonprofit. For the projects that are flowing into 2020, staff are in regular communication and plan
to attend the remaining events and exhibitions. All of the grant recipients report that this new approach for
Support for Artists funding advanced their missions, expanded their artist networks and increased their
understanding of how to effectively support the needs of Cuyahoga County artists.

29 of 38

 In addition to an online survey of more than 110 artists, staff conducted interviews with each Artist Network
Leader to better understand how the projects address the needs of artists. In all, through the varied methods of
evaluation staff have concluded that artist awareness of the Support for Artists opportunities continues to grow
and that the programs are addressing the diverse needs of artists. We will continue to gather feedback formally
and informally through our Arts & Culture Network Nights and our e-mail list of nearly 900 artists, which
receives regular updates from staff.
The table below represents Support for Artists grants and resources that are part of CAC’s ongoing work and
approved for action in 2020 at an earlier meeting of the Board.

 Budget & Next Steps
Upon Board approval, staff will finalize grant agreements and develop plans to promote the CAC-funded
programs and services. In addition, we will continue to bring grant recommendations to the Board’s future
meetings to round out the services and offerings for 2020.
CAC budgeted $400,000 for this program in 2020. This includes the continuation of the CPCP Learning Lab
program, a grant for which was approved in February 2019, and resulting project funding. We look forward to
finalizing our 2020 Support for Artists offerings in the new year.

2020 Budget Appropriation

Summary
At the December 11 board meeting, Trustees will be asked to approve the 2020 operating budget for CAC
in the amount of $13,940,000.
Objectives
Our objectives in creating the operating budget for 2020 are to:
1. Provide financial and technical support to more than 277 arts and culture organizations in Cuyahoga
County so they may offer arts and cultural experiences to the residents.
2. Promote and encourage the participation in the breadth of arts and cultural programming which
will take place in Cuyahoga County to residents and visitors.
3. Invest in programs that will provide a range of support to artists living in Cuyahoga County.
4. Ensure that 2020 team objectives are supported by the operating budget, while limiting expenses
wherever possible.
5. Invest appropriately in staff, to encourage employee retention.
Revenue
Excise tax revenue projections for 2020 are $12,021,000. This projection is based on a three-year rolling
average of the decrease in tax receipts seen over the last three years (2016/2015 and 2017/2016 and
2018/2017). Interest revenue is forecast to be $295,000, net of investment fees, based on projections
provided by our investment advisor.

Expenses
We anticipate that our expenses, detailed below, will be approximately $13,940,000, the majority of which
is already committed to grants and grant programs approved by the Board at the November meeting. We
will utilize the cash reserve to meet our approved grant commitments for 2020; using the cash reserve is an
intentional part of CAC’s budgeting and expenditure model. This practice allows the agency to strive to
provide predictable, funding over multi-year periods, with adjustments as needed, typically every two to
three years, to address annual decreases in revenue.
