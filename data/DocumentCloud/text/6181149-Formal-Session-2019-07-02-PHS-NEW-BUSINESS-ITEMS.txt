Therefore, we respectfully recommended that the demolition order be deferred for a period of six months subject to the following

1. A permit for rehabilitation work shall be applied for within Log (10) business days from the date of the City Council

At the end of the deferral period, the owner must contact this department to arrange an inspection to evidence that eoaditions of the deferral
have been satis?ed and that there has been substantial progress toward rehabilitation. Ifdic building becomes open to trespass or if conditions

Metro Detroit freeway guard rails linked to driver
injuries, deaths in other states

Three lawsuits filed about X-Lite guardrails

By Karen Drew - Reporter/Anchor, Derick Hutchinson


Posted: 11:24 PM, June 24, 2019
Updated: 8:08 AM, June 25, 2019

DETROIT - As the summer travel season begins in Metro Detroit, there's a growing concern
among drivers about a potentially deadly hazard on the roads.

Three lawsuits have been filed claiming a certain type of guardrail can spear into vehicles on
impact, causing injury and maybe even death.

. There are 77 X-Lite guardrails in total along the l-275 corridor between l-96, l-696 and Five Mile
Road.

The Local 4 Defenders did some digging and discovered the X-Lite guardrails in question are being
used in Michigan. The majority of them are found in Metro Detroit.

One incident involved a former Detroit school teacher who died when his car hit an X-Lite
guardrail.

William Byrd, 69, was headed to a funeral and driving through Chattanooga, Tennessee, in his SUV
when it veered off the road and crashed into an X-Lite guardrail.

?All I see is metal going straight out the back of my dad's vehicle," his son, Malcolm Byrd, said.
"They told me my dad was dead on arrival."

Malcolm isn't the only family member mourning the death of a loved one killed after hitting
an X-Lite guardrail.

6/2612019 Metro Detroit freeway guardrails linked to driver 
Gonzalo Martinez, 23, was driving with his brother in Southern California when he swerved off
the freeway and wiped out 60 feet of guardrail posts before stopping. Martinez wasn't wearing his
seat belt, officials said.

"It was a bad accident," his father, Sergia Martinez, said.

Investigation photos show a guard rail pierced Martinez's windshield, ripping out the headrest of
the driver's seat, and came out the back window.

According to California Highway Patrol officials, the guardrail was an X-Lite end terminal made by
Lindsay Transportation Solutions.

The X?Lite guardrail was linked to another crash in Tennessee, involving 17?year-old Hannah
Eimers.

Eimers' car went off the road and collided with an X-Lite guardrail.
guardrail pierced her car and she was killed instantly," her father, Steve Eimers, said.

When a car hits a guardrail, the end terminal, or cap, is supposed to act like an accordion and
absorb the car's impact. Video obtained from the Federal Highway Administration shows safety
test footage of a vehicle crashing into 3 Lindsay X-Lite guardrail and what is supposed to happen
during a collision.

Investigator photos show something else happened in the crashes involving Byrd, Martinez and
Eimers.

The Local 4 Defenders contacted Lindsay Transportation Solutions.

"The X-Lite guardrail end terminal successfully passed crash and safety tests in accordance with
Federal Highway Administration standards," a company statement said, in part. "No guardrail and
terminal system can prevent every tragedy."

think it should be addressed," Malcolm said.

The lawsuit X-Lite end terminal and rail system failed to perform its intended
safety function 60 feet of guard rail pierced through the vehicle, where Wilbert was sitting,
violently striking and causing him to suffer fatal injuries."

The Local 4 Defenders obtained records from the Michigan Department of Transportation
(M DOT) showing there are 90 X?Lite terminals statewide, the majority of which are in Metro
Detroit.

According to state records, there are 77 in total along the l-275 corridor between l-96, l-696 and
Five Mile Road.

"So we're talking about less than of our total inventory consists of the X-Lite guard ending,"
said MDOT development director Brad Wieferich.

The Defenders also obtained an MDOT document dated in February 2018 stating that effective
immediately and until further notice, damaged X-Lite guardrail terminals must not be replaced
with another X?Lite guardrail terminal.

"If that is MDOT's ruling, then why not just get rid of the 90 X-Lite terminals we have now that are
mostly here along l?275?? Defender Karen Drew asked. "Why take the chance?"

is in the process right now of reviewing the performance of our X-Lites,? Wieferich said.
"We understand that other states have had issues. We're being very cautious of this. We are, but
we need to complete our review to make sure we know what our next move is."

As the state remains cautious, Malcolm said every driver needs to be cautious, as well.
"All I can say is I wouldn't wish what I'm going through right now on my worst enemy," he said.

There are many pieces to the investigation. You can view the lawsuits filed against Lindsay
Transportation Solutions, a list of other companies named, documents obtained from MDOT and a
map of the location of Michigan's X-Lite guardrails below.

Lindsay Transportation Solutions released a statementjust before this story aired Monday night:

"The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has examined and re?examined the X-Lite and
its in-service performance and has gathered input from state departments of transportation
across the country. In FHWA's evaluations, the X-Lite has performed consistently with other
end terminals on US. roads and highways."

Lindsay Transportation Solutions shared a link to a 2017 memorandum from the Federal Highway
Administration. Click here to view it
