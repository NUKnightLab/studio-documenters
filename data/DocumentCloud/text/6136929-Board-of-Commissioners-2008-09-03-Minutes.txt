BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF COOK COUNTY
PRESIDENT
SELECTION COMMITTEE’S CHOICE FOR INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR GENERAL
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 31, 2008 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
The correspondence from the Independent Inspector General Selection Committee (the “Committee”)
transmits the identity of its selection for the Office of Independent Inspector General. The Committee has
selected Mr. Patrick Blanchard.
As stated in the Committee’s correspondence, the Committee interviewed the three (3) candidates, set
forth in the Cook County Bar Association/Chicago Bar Association Joint Search Committee’s (the “Joint
Search Committee”) Candidate List, on Wednesday, July 30, 2008, and selected Mr. Patrick Blanchard by
a majority vote of the Committee. The Committee’s correspondence also notes State’s Attorney Devine’s
abstention from the voting process.
Pursuant to § 2-282(b)(1)(b) of the Independent Inspector General Ordinance (the “Ordinance”), I hereby
submit the Committee’s selection for the office of Independent Inspector General for your consideration
at the County Board meeting scheduled for Wednesday, September 3, 2008.

7023

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 3, 2008
Pursuant to § 2-282(b)(1)(c) of the Ordinance, the Board of Commissioners must call a vote for Mr.
Patrick Blanchard’s appointment to the office of Independent Inspector General no later than Wednesday,
September 17, 2008.
Please note that the office of Independent Inspector General is not a Presidential Appointment; rather, the
Committee has recommended Mr. Patrick Blanchard to you, the Cook County Board of Commissioners,
according to the independent selection process set forth in the Ordinance.
As you will recall, in an effort to bring about transparency and accountability, I voluntarily removed
myself from the appointment process set forth in the Ordinance which I sponsored. The appointment and
selection process required the Cook County Bar Association and the Chicago Bar Association to submit,
to me, a Candidate List naming three (3) duly qualified candidates. The bar associations conducted a
national search with the assistance of Hudson Recruitment and Talent Management; Hudson reviewed
greater than three hundred twenty-eight (328) applications and résumés, from which Hudson created a
subgroup of one hundred sixteen (116) highly qualified candidates. Hudson conducted additional
screening and interviews of the highly qualified subgroup and created a slate of eleven (11) extremely
qualified candidates from which the bar associations selected the members of the Candidate List.
Upon my receipt of the Candidate List from the bar associations, and in accordance with § 2-282(b)(1)(b)
of the Ordinance, I publicly submitted the Candidate List to the Committee, at the July 22, 2008 Board
Meeting, for the Committee’s review, interview, and selection of a candidate to be submitted to the full
Board of Commissioners.
Lastly, I am grateful to the members of the Committee: Commissioner Jerry Butler, Commissioner John
P. Daley, Commissioner Peter N. Silvestri, Commissioner Gregg Goslin, State’s Attorney Richard A.
Devine, and Marynic Foster, Esq., Acting Director of the Cook County Board of Ethics, for promptly
convening and fulfilling their important role in this independent selection process.
_________________________
In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(z)(1) Amendment on Suspension of rules,
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved to suspend Section 2-108(g)(1) Order
of business. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that Communication be referred to the
Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental & Veterans Relations. (Comm. No. 295880). The motion
carried unanimously.

unlawful political discrimination in connection with hiring or any aspect of government employment with
Cook County, including but not limited to the hiring, promotion, termination, award of overtime, or other
disciplinary action, prior to the date of final approval of the SRO had the opportunity to file a claim with

7057

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 3, 2008
WHEREAS, in 2007, Representative Mark Kirk introduced H.R. 14: Congressional Integrity and

Congress to forfeit their pension; and
WHEREAS, even though, in the Cook County Pension Code (40 ILCS 5/9), the word “officials” is listed
under the definition of “employee”, the Code makes a distinction throughout between “employees” and
“officials”, including its title “County Employees’ and Officers’ Annuity and Benefit Fund - Counties
Over 3,000,000 Inhabitants”; and
WHEREAS, Section 40 ILCS 5/9-235, of the Code, which requires the forfeiture of Cook County
Pensions when an employee is convicted of a felony, includes Cook County elected officials; it is

INITIATING PERFORMANCE-BASED BUDGETING
WHEREAS, governments across the board are continually being asked to do more with less and
government officials and taxpayers continue to demand that public programs be delivered effectively and
efficiently; and
WHEREAS, utilizing performance measurements as a component of performance-based budgeting is an
extremely effective tool in determining how a program is accomplishing its missions, goals and objectives
by measuring the delivery of products, services or processes; and
WHEREAS, the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) and the National Advisory Council
on State and Local Budgeting (NACSLB) recommend all governments use performance measurement as
an important component of long-term strategic planning to identify financial and program results, assess
past program performance and facilitate future program service and delivery; and
WHEREAS, to incorporate performance measures in the budgeting process we must develop indicators
to evaluate and monitor programs and services and integrate them into the budget framework; and
WHEREAS, past Cook County budgets have gone as far as delineating each department’s mission, goals,
objectives and accomplishments, all important steps in developing performance measures; and
WHEREAS, further development of balanced evaluation techniques or performance measures are
necessary to convert to a performance-based budget, there are additional factors that must be explored to
ensure Cook County can accommodate the budget modifications and technology requirements.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Chief Financial Officer, in conjunction with the
Budget Director and the Chief Information Officer, will prepare a report examining what steps are needed
so that Cook County’s general ledger and budget can accommodate the necessary modifications required
to integrate performance-based budgeting and whether current information technology capability can
monitor program inputs, outputs, and outcomes necessary for performance measures adequately and in a
timely manner; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this report be tendered to the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners by October 15, 2008.

Holden-Casewell Properties, LLC d/b/a Outsource Fleet Services, and Resolution No. 08-006 from the
Village of Bedford Park, Illinois for an abandoned industrial facility with special circumstances located at
6363 West 73rd Street, Bedford Park, Cook County, Illinois, Cook County District #11, Property Index
Number 19-29-100-061-0000; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has defined “abandoned property” as buildings and other structures that, after
having been vacant and unused for at least 24 months, are purchased for value by a purchaser in whom
the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has defined an exception to this abandoned property definition shall be, if the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, finds that special circumstances justify finding that the
property is “abandoned” for purpose of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value by a disinterested
buyer, the County may determine that special circumstances justify finding the property is deemed
“abandoned”; and
WHEREAS, Class 6b requires a Resolution by the County Board validating the property is deemed
“abandoned” for the purposes of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that the building was abandoned
for 12 months at the time of purchase, and that special circumstances are present and indicate the Class 6b
necessary to encourage the expansion of existing industrial facilities and the property is located in the
vicinity of several vacant buildings where the Village of Bedford Park authorities have been actively
marketing said area and Outsource Fleet Services has indicated to the Village of Bedford Park authorities
that it will expend approximately $1.2 million dollars to improve the Subject Property; and
WHEREAS, the re-occupancy will retain 30 full time jobs and create 30 new full time jobs along with
10-15 construction jobs, and increase the tax assessment from vacant to full occupancy, thus potentially
generating additional property taxes even with the incentive; and
WHEREAS, the applicant acknowledges that it must provide an affidavit to the Assessor’s Office
stipulating that it is in compliance with the County’s Living Wage Ordinance prior to receiving the Class
6b incentive on the subject property.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the
County of Cook, State of Illinois, that the President and Board of Commissioners validate the property
located at 6363 West 73rd Street, Bedford Park, Cook County, Illinois, is deemed “abandoned” with
special circumstances under the Class 6b provision; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to forward a
certified copy of this Resolution to the Office of the Cook County Assessor.
Approved and adopted this 3rd day of September 2008.
