have on call qualified asbestos and lead-based paint abatement and mold remediation contractors
to perform abatement in dwelling and non-dwelling units of the CHA, in accordance with current
laws and regulations governing such removal and disposal. In order to address routine and
emergency environmental remediation projects Authority-wide, CCD will issue task orders to the
environmental remediation contractors based on the primary region where the remediation site is

developments, or as a result of an emergency response condition. These contracts are needed to
replace the current contracts for these services which will expire on September 30, 2012.

housing program. That process consists of: 50% of the referrals will come from CHA’s general
waiting lists as well as households whose right of return under the Relocation Rights Contract
has not yet been met; 50% will come from CHA’s Community Area waiting list for Lakeview /
surrounding communities. Heartland was selected by the City of Chicago as part of a competitive
procurement process in 2011. Financing will be provided by City of Chicago Low Income
Housing Tax Credits and HOME funds, Investor Equity, Historic Tax Credits, and grants from
the Federal Home Loan Bank and the State of Illinois.

There being no questions or discussion, Chairwoman Scott thereupon declared said Motion
carried and said resolution adopted.
Commissioner Sandra Young, Chairwoman of the Tenant Services Committee, then presented
her report. Per Commissioner Young, the Tenant Services Committee Meeting was held on
Wednesday, September 12, 2012 at the CHA Corporate Offices at approximately 1:00 p.m.
Commissioner Young then presented a Motion for approval of the resolution for Item A1
discussed, voted and recommended for approval by the Tenant Services Committee members.
(Item D1)
The resolution for Item D1 approves contract with the Central Advisory Council (CAC) in an
amount not-to-exceed $298,244 for a one year base term, with one (1) one-year option period to
provide outreach and engagement services to more than 400 CHA families. In 2009, the CAC
received a Resident Opportunity and Supportive Services (ROSS) grant directly from HUD to
engage hard-to-reach residents and encourage participation in CHA services. Upon receipt of the
grant award, the CAC hired staff to implement the scope of work required by the grant. The
outreach and engagement services provided by the CAC during this period were executed
successfully and proved beneficial to the resident population. During the grant period, CAC’s
outreach and engagement staff worked closely with CHA’s Resident Services Division to identify
families who lived in the Scattered Site portfolio who were not engaged in services. The CAC
submitted a proposal to CHA to continue the engagement services that had been provided during
term of the ROSS grant, and worked with CHA to enhance the scope of work and metrics of the
grant based on the needs of CHA. The CAC has a unique capacity to provide these services, as the
CAC outreach and engagement team is comprised fully of CHA residents, which helps to foster
trust and positive relationships with CHA families, who are reluctant to engage in CHA’s
continuum of social services. The CAC’s outreach service for those who are hard to reach is
important to ensure all families have an opportunity to engage in services, particularly in light of a
changing service model and reduced resources in the future.
