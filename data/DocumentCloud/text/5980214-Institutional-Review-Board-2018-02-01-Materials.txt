Administrative data

Recruitment

X

A list of e-mails for all sheriff's and probation directors will be obtained from The Illinois
Probation and Court Services Association and the Illinois Sheriffs Association. ICJIA staff will
use those lists to generate an invitation e-mail asking one person who is the appropriate
representative from each agency to answer the survey questions and participate in the study
(see attached e-mail recruitment language). Subjects will then be given a link to the online
survey. Follow-up calls will be made to increase response rates.

5. Identify the criteria for inclusion/exclusion of subjects and provide a clear rationale for
them.
The study’s research questions focus on the practices in Illinois’ county jails and probation
departments. Researchers will attempt to include all probation department directors and
sheriffs in Illinois in the study. Only these departments will be examined as the purpose is to
learn more about current use, barriers to use and training needs of medication assisted
treatment in probation departments and jails.

D. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT

A list of all sheriffs and probation directors will be compiled using an excel spreadsheet. That
spreadsheet will be used to create an electronic mailing list to send out the initial request for
participation. Staff will track response to the request and use the spreadsheet to track
participation and follow-up efforts.
The online survey data will be collected using Qualtrics. Qualtrics safeguards all customer
data and uses secure data centers to ensure the highest protection as per HITECH
requirements. HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act)
complies with HIPAA rules to ensure that data are properly protected and best security
practices followed. Once the data have been collected, it will be downloaded from Qualtrics
to either excel or SPSS, which will be kept on secure, password protected servers and

IMPORTANT
For this survey, Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) is defined as the use of medications
(buprenorphine, methadone, and/or naltrexone), generally used in conjunction with evidencebased therapies, as part of the recovery and rehabilitation process for individuals with opioid
use disorders.
This does not include medical detoxification. Some of these medications may also treat alcohol
use disorders (naltrexone); however, for the purpose of this study we are asking about their use
for MAT with opioid use disorders.

For the survey, researchers will be using the following terms:
Buprenorphine: This is any buprenorphine/buprenorphine-naloxone medication used for
individuals with opioid use disorders.
Buprenorphine brand names include Suboxone®, Subutex®, Zubsolv®, Bunavail®,
Butrans®, Buprenex®, Probuphine®, Belbuca®.
Naltrexone: This is a full antagonist medication used for those with opioid use disorders.
Brand Name: Vivitrol®, ReVia®.
Naloxone: This is the revival medication used for individuals who are overdosing on opioids.
Brand Names: Narcan®, EVZIO®
Page 3 of 36

1.) Please explain in detail what changes you plan to make to the study design or protocol (such
as changes to instruments used, data collection, recruitment procedures, or compensation).
Proposed change #1: Data collected: In the initial design study, ICJIA researchers were
examining Wells Center Treatment files including:
• Names and dates of birth of program participants
• Names and dates of birth of individuals on the program waiting list who did not receive
the program
Researchers would like to examine the following:
• IDOC #
• Date of admission/ date of interview for the program
• Mandated for treatment
• Date of discharge
• Type of discharge
• Race
• Age at admission (not DOB)
• Marital Status
3

•
•

Primary & Secondary Drugs of choice, Methods used
Age of first use
# of treatment episodes
Education level

Proposed change #2: Method of data collection: Researchers would like to conduct the staff
interviews (n=3) by phone rather than in person.

2.) Please explain in detail the rationale for the above change(s). What prompted the
investigators to propose the amendment? Is the amendment the result of an adverse/negative
event?
Proposed change #1: Researchers learned from that the Wells Center files contained
additional variables that were available to examine. Examining additional variables will offer a
richer understanding of client characteristics that impact outcomes. This change is not due to
any adverse/negative events.
Proposed change #2: Researchers would like to conduct phone interviews in order to
accommodate the schedules of the staff and researchers. In order to use time at the correctional
center wisely, researchers will spend five days focusing on conducting in person interviews
with clients, rather than staff. The same questions will be asked but only not in person. This
change is not due to any adverse/negative events.

3.) Does this amendment alter, in any way, the assessment of potential risks described in your
approved protocol?
Yes

X

No

4.) If you answered yes to question 3, please explain in detail how this alters the assessment of
potential risk and whether the benefits of the study outweigh the risks.

already approved IRB statement (e.g., the cost section, or phone number change)
Revising the consent form to reflect what was already approved in the protocol
Defining a phrase(s) more clearly in lay language
Incorporating in the consent form updated IRB-mandated language
Minor editorial changes to the consent form which do not alter the meaning or procedures
(e.g., spelling changes, revising a statement)
Removal of questionnaires or instruments that required consent forms
Other (please specify):
8.) Please explain in detail how you will alter the consent documents.

9.) Please explain in detail the rationale for the above change(s). What prompted the
investigators to propose the change? Is this change the result of an adverse/negative event?

 63

XI. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT
30.) Discuss how these proposed changes may affect the risks posed to human subjects.
This research is minimal risk.
The changes made by adding additional data variables collected or method of data collection
(phone interview rather than in-person) will not affect risks posed to human subjects.

31.) Discuss how these proposed changes may affect the potential benefits of the project to
subjects and or society.
Examining additional variables will offer a richer understanding of client characteristics that
impact outcomes.
Conducing phone interviews will help ensure that the input of staff is collected. This will utilize
the limited resources of researchers and program staff wisely.
Both proposed changes will help aid in the understanding of the program and can help offer
suggestions to improve this and future programs.

III. PROTOCOL CHANGE

X

Changes

No changes

1.) Please explain in detail what changes you plan to make to the study design or
protocol (such as changes to instruments used, data collection, recruitment
procedures, or compensation)
Researchers are conducting an evaluation of the PERC program. PERC offers entrepreneurial
training and coaching to formerly incarcerated/returning citizens and the opportunity to
receive a business loan to start their own business. The initial IRB application was approved
for researchers to administer an informed consent form to participate in the study. Only those
who consented to participation in the research study will be in the program. Two components
of the study will be added at this time to further understand and evaluate the program. They
are detailed below and related forms are attached to this application.
Component 1: Intake form (n=125)
a.)

Time involvement of subjects: 15 minutes

b.)

Location(s) the study will be conducted with subjects, including a description, if
applicable: At one of the five training agency locations. All agencies in the PERC
program are non-profit, community agencies in the City of Chicago. Training staff from
the five training agencies will be asked to use this intake form. They will share the forms
with researchers.

c.)

Amount of payment to subject, if any (consent form must note plan for payment if they
withdraw voluntarily): None

d.)

What subjects will experience or do: Subjects will be asked questions about themselves
including demographics and information related to entrepreneurial experience and needs.
The program focuses more narrowly on entrepreneurial training rather than broader
general business training.

Component 2: Pre- and post-test (n=125)
a.)

Time involvement of subjects: Total 60 minutes—30 minutes at the beginning of the
training course and another 30 minutes at the end of the training course.

b.)

Location(s) the study will be conducted with subjects, including a description, if
applicable: At one of the five training agency locations. All are non-profit, community
agencies in the City of Chicago. Training staff from the five training agencies will be
asked to use and administer the pre- and post-test. They will share the paper forms with
researchers.

c.)

Amount of payment to subject, if any (consent form must note plan for payment if they
4

 69

withdraw voluntarily): None
d.)

What subjects will experience or do: Subjects will be given a consent form outlining the
purpose of the pre- and post-test and their rights as a research participant. The test will ask
questions to gauge entrepreneurial knowledge.

2.) Please explain in detail the rationale for the above change(s). What prompted the
investigators to propose the amendment? Is the amendment the result of an
adverse/negative event?
This amendment was proposed to add study components of the evaluation to further
understand and evaluate the PERC program. There have been no adverse or negative
events with the research study to date. The rationale for each additional component are
below.
Component 1: Intake form
Rationale: To collect base-line data on all program participants to know more detailed
information on who participated in PERC.
Component 2: Pre- and post-test
Rationale: To measure program effectiveness by learning changes in entrepreneurial knowledge
before and after the training course.

3.) Does this amendment alter, in any way, the assessment of potential risks described in your
approved protocol?
Yes

X

No

4.) If you answered yes to question 3, please explain in detail how this alters the assessment of potential
risk and whether the benefits of the study outweigh the risks.

5

 70

IV. CONSENT PROCEDURES

X

Changes

No changes

5.) If you are changing your consent procedures, please explain these alterations in detail.
The pre- and post-test will have a consent form (attached). Researchers are requesting to obtain
verbal consent by reading a consent form which serves as a detailed script.
a.) Who will obtain consent? ICJIA researchers will provide consent forms to the five PERC
training agencies who will obtain consent.
b.) How will consent be obtained? Research staff with instruct the PERC training agencies to
read the consent form. Subjects will not be asked to sign the consent form. Completing the
survey and providing it to the trainer will indicate consent.
c.) How often will consent be obtained (e.g., longitudinal or long-term field studies)?
Twice total—once for pre-test and once for post-test.
d.) How will you verify the subject fully understands the consent? The consent form is written in
a 9th grade or lower reading level. The consent form will provide contact information for the
principal investigator, the Authority’s attorney/IRB secretary to request further information
about the studies, their rights as a research participant, and PERC.
e.) How will your investigators be trained to use the informed consent process?
The trainers will be provided instruction on reading the consent form. Researchers have
periodic meetings with trainers to describe the research study procedures.
6.) Please explain in detail the rationale for the above change(s). What prompted the
investigators to propose the change? Is this change the result of an adverse/negative event?

6

 71

The rational is to have consent for the pre- and post-test that is being added with this amendment.
Since the pre- and post-test is a research tool, as well as programmatic tool, it will explain about
the test and their rights as a research participant. This is not due to an adverse/negative event.

V. CONSENT DOCUMENTS

Changes

X

No changes

Note: researchers are adding forms not changing exiting forms.
7.) What types of changes are being made to the consent documents/forms?
Adding or removing information from the consent form so that it is consistent with an
already approved IRB statement (e.g., the cost section, or phone number change)
Revising the consent form to reflect what was already approved in the protocol
Defining a phrase(s) more clearly in lay language
Incorporating in the consent form updated IRB-mandated language
Minor editorial changes to the consent form which do not alter the meaning or procedures
(e.g., spelling changes, revising a statement)
Removal of questionnaires or instruments that required consent forms
Other (please specify):
8.) Please explain in detail how you will alter the consent documents.

7

 72

9.) Please explain in detail the rationale for the above change(s). What prompted the
investigators to propose the change? Is this change the result of an adverse/negative event?

10.) Please submit the original and altered consent documents and highlight the changes. If filing

XI. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT
30.) Discuss how these proposed changes may affect the risks posed to human subjects.
There is minimal risk.
Individual identifiers will be collected on the forms (intake and pre- and post-test) which are
needed to link to other program and outcome data. Once the data have been linked, the data will
be stripped of the identifiers. Only the unique study ID number will remain. Only the final, deidentified dataset will be used to analyze the data.
The master list containing the personally identifying information and study ID will be
maintained on secure, password protected servers and computers accessible only to the research
staff. The final de-identified dataset will also be kept on secure, password protected servers and
computers accessible only to the research staff separate from the master list.
31.) Discuss how these proposed changes may affect the potential benefits of the project to
subjects and or society.
These changes will enhance the potential benefits to subjects and society. These additions make
the evaluation more rigorous and informative. They will allow researchers to answer additional
research questions to understand which training programs/curriculums affect outcomes.
Researchers can offer elements associated with successful outcomes and help enhance current
and future programming. The knowledge gained can help better serve clients of this and similar
programs in the future.
