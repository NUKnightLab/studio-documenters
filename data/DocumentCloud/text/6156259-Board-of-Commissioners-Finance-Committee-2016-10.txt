PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AN AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY AMUSEMENT TAX
WHEREAS, it is the intent of the County Board to recognize and encourage both the artists who add to
our cultural identity as well as the venues that allow them to display their talents to crowds from around the
County and around the world by exempting them from the City and County’s amusement tax for live
performances; and
WHEREAS, it is not the role of government to restrictively decide and define what is and is not ‘music’;
and
WHEREAS, to single out one or any type of music genre performed at these types of venues as not
applicable to the small venue exemption clause is not in the spirit or purpose of the exemption clause nor
the expansive definition of music;
WHEREAS, as the recording industry and music genres have evolved, the National Academy of Recording
Arts and Sciences has recognized although sometimes more slowly than society at large, that new music
genres evolve and form, such as Rock, Rap, Reggae, Metal, Roots, Electronica, New Age etc.; and
WHEREAS, DJ’s have been considered an art form for many years now and in fact the National Academy
of Recording Arts and Sciences’ Grammy Awards created the Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year,
Non-Classical at the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998 to recognize an individual(s) who takes previously
recorded material and adds or alters it in such a way as to create a new and unique performance; and
WHEREAS, the first Grammy Award for such category was presented to Chicago’s very own Frankie
Knuckles whose key role in developing and popularizing House music into an internationally recognized
musical genre during the 1980s led to him being referred to as the "The Godfather of House Music."; and
WHEREAS, in 1998, the Cook County Board created an exemption to the Amusement Tax for small
venues with a maximum capacity of not more than 750 persons, and in 1999 the County Board further
amended said ordinance by defining live performances by examples giving several genre examples and art
forms including live musical performances, but does not restrict it to only those examples by including the
encompassing term “music”; and
WHEREAS, the current language contained in the County Code has created unintended and unnecessary
confusion as to what constitutes ‘music’ and has created undue burdens on venue operators who are being
required to comply with inconsistent definitions, restrictions and exemptions by the County and the City of
Chicago; and

Page 45 of 64

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter

or otherwise modified.
2. The DJ is paid substantially above the rate that would be paid solely for the service
of playing the pre-recorded material of other artists. The Department will assume
that the payment of $2,000 or more for a single performance qualifies the event for
this provision.
b. Where the activities of a DJ do not qualify for the provision set forth in Subsection
(d)(1)a. 1. and 2. of this section, they may nevertheless qualify as a live cultural
performance if at least four of the five following factors apply:
1. The DJ is featured in advertisements for the venue.

(2) Initiation fees and membership dues paid to a health club, racquetball club, tennis club
or a similar club or organization, when such club or organization is organized and
operated on a membership basis and for the recreational purposes of its members and
its members' guests, shall be exempt from the tax imposed in subsection (a) of this
section. This exemption shall not be construed to apply to any fees paid or based upon
a per-event or a per-admission basis.

Page 50 of 64

 (3) Fees or other charges paid by a patron for the privilege of witnessing, viewing or
participating in an amusement, solely within the confines of such patron's home, shall
be exempt from the imposition of the tax imposed in subsection (a) of this section. For
purposes of this exemption, the term "home" means the permanent dwelling residence
of the patron. For patrons who live in condominium buildings, apartment buildings or
other multiple-unit structures, the individual dwelling unit the patron occupies shall be
considered the patron's home.
(e) For the purpose of determining the amount of the amusement tax due under this article,
admission fees or other charges shall be computed exclusive of:
(1) Any Federal, State or municipal taxes imposed upon the amusement patron.
(2) Any amounts subject to other Cook County taxes (with the exception of County
Retailers' Occupation Tax), provided such County taxes are separately listed on the
ticket of admission and the corresponding Cook County tax has been paid on that
separately stated amount.
(3) Any separately stated optional charges for nonamusement services or for sales of
tangible personal property.
(f) It is unlawful for any person to produce, present or conduct any amusement without
collection of the tax, except as provided in this article.
(1) The rate of the tax imposed in subsection (a) of this section shall be one percent of the
admission fees or other charges to witness in person live theatrical, live musical or other
live cultural performances that take place in any auditorium, theater or other space in
the County whose maximum capacity, including all balconies and other sections, is
more than 750 persons and less than 5,000 persons.

admission fees or other charges to witness in person live theatrical, live musical or other
live cultural performances that take place in any auditorium, theater or other space in
the County whose maximum capacity, including all balconies and other sections, is
5,000 persons or more.
(g) It shall be presumed that all amusements are subject to tax under this article until the
contrary is established by books, records or other documentary evidence.
(h) It is unlawful for any person to produce, present, conduct, or resell tickets to, any
amusement without collection of the tax, except as provided in this article.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE

ESTABLISHING EMPLOYER PAID SICK LEAVE FOR RESIDENTS OF COOK
COUNTY
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of government pursuant to the 1970 Illinois
Constitution, Article VII, Section 6 (a); and,
WHEREAS, pursuant to their home rule powers, the Cook County Commissioners may exercise
any power and perform any function relating to their governments and affairs, including the
power to regulate for the protection of the public health, safety, morals, and welfare; and,
WHEREAS, employees in every industry occasionally require time away from the workplace to
tend to their own health or the health of family members: and,
WHEREAS, paid sick leave has a positive effect of the health of not only employees and their
family members, but also the health of fellow workers and public at large and the most
comprehensive national survey of U.S. restaurant workers found that two-thirds of restaurant
wait staff and cooks have come to work sick; and,
WHEREAS, paid sick leave reduces health care expenditures by promoting access to primary
and preventative care and reduces reliance on emergency care; and,
WHEREAS, nationally providing all workers with paid sick leave would result in 1.1 billion in
annual savings in hospital emergency department costs; and
WHEREAS, over 20 municipalities including New York City, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland
and Jersey City have passed legislation requiring employers within their jurisdictions to provide
paid sick leave; and,
WHEREAS, a cost model developed by the Civic Consulting Alliance found that a paid sick
leave framework similar to the one reflected in this ordinance would result in only a small, 0.7 to
1.5 increase in labor costs for most employers; now therefore
