RECEIVED AND FILED
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 31, 2010 from
JOHN P. DALEY, Chairman, Committee on Finance
I am requesting that the following letters from the Chief of Staff for President Stroger, Board of Review,
Assessor, County Clerk and Treasurer be placed on the Agenda for the April 6, 2010 Board meeting for
discussion purposes. The members of the Board of Review, County Assessor, County Clerk and County
Treasurer are requested to attend the April 6, 2010 Board Meeting.
LETTER FROM THE CHIEF OF STAFF
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 30, 2010 from
JOSEPH M. FRATTO, Chief of Staff
Pursuant to Cook County Board Resolution, representatives of the Office of the President, Assessor,
Board of Review, Treasurer and County Clerk have met to discuss the Second Installment Property Tax
Billing process. Please accept this correspondence as a report of the matters addressed and status of the
parties involved as it relates to issues surrounding property tax assessment, appeals and billing.
First and foremost, it is important to note that President Todd H. Stroger and the Office of the President
has extended the County’s OPTIMA program as well as the services provided by EKI to assist the above
listed offices in better understanding its workflow processes as it relates to the property tax process,
including but not limited to, assessment, appeals and billing. Taking advantage of these services should
assist the above listed offices in streamlining their processes and understanding and increasing
productivity which could result in a streamlined, cost effective and timely process. It is anticipated that
the above listed offices will take advantage of this opportunity to improve its operations.
In addition to efforts to streamline, reduce costs and improve the assessment, review/appeal process and
timeliness of Second Installment Property Tax Bill issuance, the parties have discussed increasing the
number of property tax installments, engaging the services of outside professionals to conduct hearings
and serve as hearing examiners, developing a training program for hearing examiners in order to engage
qualified outside hearing examiners to conduct hearings when dealing with a high volume of appeals,
conducting additional hearings to reduce the time period that is necessary to address the appeals and
engaging in statutory review to determine whether legislative amendments can assist in the streamlining
of the property tax assessment, appeal and/or billing process.

ITEM #8 cont’d
In addition to the above, the Office of the President has requested information regarding the anticipated
completion dates of processes required by the Assessor and Board of Review in order to complete the
second installment property tax bills and has requested that that the Board of Review and Assessor
provide any requests/justification for additional revenue that may be needed in order to complete the
second installment data/property tax bills in a timely fashion.
The parties have met and are in the process of addressing the above listed issues and strategizing as to
ways to provide for the timely issuance of the 2009 Second Installment Property Tax Bills; however it is
important to note that the Board of Review has sent “Notice” to the Board of Commissioners that the
Board of Review anticipates a delay in the 2009 Second Installment Tax Bills and that it anticipates a due
date later than December 1st. This March 25, 2010 correspondence from the Board of Review alleges
various causes for the anticipated delay including, but not limited to timeliness of the Assessor’s Office
completing the 2009 assessments. In response to the Board of Review’s letter, the Assessor
communicated with the Board of Commissioners on March 29, 2010 to address its assessment process
and valid implementation of the 10/25 Ordinance.
While it is anticipated that the parties will continue to work together to timely issue the 2009 and future
second installment property tax bills and take advantage of the data that can be compiled and understood
from engaging the services of EKI to improve the overall workflow and assessment, appeal and billing
processes, it is imperative that the Board of Commissioners hear from both the Board of Review and
Assessor and have the opportunity to discuss the respective positions of the Board of Review, Assessor
and Board of Commissioners.
Submitted herewith, please find copies of the Board of Review’s March 25, 2010 correspondence and
Assessor’s March 29, 2010 correspondence for Board of Commissioner review and discussion. The
Office of the President will request the attendance of the Assessor, Commissioners of the Board of
Review, the County Clerk and the County Treasurer at the April 6, 2010 Board Meeting in order to
provide the Board of Commissioners an opportunity to discuss the timeliness of the 2009 Second
Installment Property Tax Bills and the issues raised by the respective parties.

ITEM #8 cont’d
Please let this correspondence serve as formal notice from the Commissioners of the Cook
County Board of Review that we have every indication that the 2009 Second Installment Tax Bills will
have a due date later than last year’s due date of December 1st. The cause of the delay is attributable to
(1) the Assessor’s significant delay in finishing the 2009 assessment and sending completed townships on
a timely basis to the Board of Review; and (2) the dramatic increase in appeals caused by the Assessor’s
erroneous implementation of the 10/25 Ordinance.
Attached for your reference are several documents that may help to shed light on this matter.
[See back-up material previously distributed for footnote information]. The attachments include:
a. November 3, 2009 BOR correspondence responding to Hon. John Daley, Chairman of the
Finance Committee;
b. January 12, 2010 BOR correspondence to the Assessor requesting information regarding
increases in Non-triennial market values;
c. February 26, 2010 Assessor’s response to the BOR’s January 12, 2010 correspondence;
d. Legal motion tendered by taxpayers to void non-triennial market value increases as a matter of
law; and
e. Summons issued to Assessor and senior personnel to appear at a hearing before the Board of
Review relative to the motion to void non-triennial market value increases as a matter of law.
I.

The Assessor’s delayed processing and turnover of townships to the Board of Review will cause
tax bills to be late.

As of March 24, 2010, the Assessor has not turned over the following seventeen (17) townships
to the Cook County Board of Review (*indicates reassessment township):
Wheeling
Palatine
Proviso
Lyons
New Trier
Orland

Worth
Hanover
Bloom
Lemont
Thornton
Schaumburg

Northfield
West Chicago*
South Chicago*
North Chicago*
Lake*

Representatives of the Assessor have stated that the Assessor will not conclude his 2009 assessment
process by May 2010. The Assessor has also made representations that his process will not conclude
before July 2010. For context, the Assessor completed his process of sending all 38 townships to the
Board of Review for the 2008 reassessment by April 15, 2009. The Board of Review’s entire process
including its filing period, hearings, review, and balancing takes approximately 2 ½ to 3 months from the
date a township is opened for filing. If the Assessor closes by July 1st this year, the earliest the Board of
Review could conclude its review would be the middle of September or beginning of October. From the
date the Board of Review certifies completion of its appeals, it takes approximately 3 additional months
until the tax bill due date. In 2008, however, the Board of Review certified completion of its appeals on
July 30, 2009 and the tax bill due date was December 1, 2009. Clearly, when the Assessor adds several
months to complete his process the impact on a late Second Installment bill is undeniable.

ITEM #8 cont’d
II. The Assessor’s failure to equitably implement the 10/25 Ordinance will (a) cause tax bills to be
late; and (b) will cause a tax shift from non-residential property owners to residential property
owners.
As the enclosed attachment of the Board of Review’s January 12, 2010 correspondence to the
Assessor details, the 10/25 Ordinance has been misapplied as it artificially increases the market values of
non-triennial properties. Consequently, this erroneous implementation of an otherwise lawful Ordinance
has created the basis for tens-of-thousands otherwise baseless appeals to the Board of Review. The
Assessor has failed to support his increased market values in disregard of the Board of Review’s formal
request to provide that specific data. No reports, methodology, market data, property sales, property
income, nor other meaningful data has been provided in response to the Board of Review’s formal
request. Moreover, no representative of the Assessor has appeared to defend a single assessment at
hearing despite the Board of Review’s formal request that the Assessor participate and defend increases in
non-triennial market values.
Unfortunately, there are also significant legal contentions before our agency regarding the
constitutionality and legality of the notice provided by the Assessor to taxpayers in conjunction with the
10/25 Ordinance. Nearly all triennial reassessment notices indicate that the assessment has been lowered
from the previous year or has stayed the same with no increase. None of the notices of assessment
disclose what the prior level of assessment was compared to the new 2009 level of assessment. None of
the notices of assessment identify that the market value has increased in 2009. All of the assessment
notices to homeowners include a press release indicating, “Due to this first-ever downward market
adjustment, residential properties in each suburban township will receive adjustments of their assessed
values.” The press release goes on to state, “These market reductions come as the Assessor’s Office is
implementing the 10/25 Ordinance.” In sum, the legal challenges before us boil down to whether a
reasonable person reading their notice of assessment in conjunction with the enclosed press release would
have notice that their market values increased substantially. We are concerned because the terms
“downward market adjustment” and “market reductions” used by the Assessor certainly would appear to
lead a homeowner to the conclusion that their property’s market value has decreased in the absence of
anything to the contrary on the face of the notice or the accompanying press release. The Assessor states
in his correspondence responding to the Board of Review’s request for support of increased market
values, “While there may be some initial challenges, the Ordinance will offer the transparency that
taxpayers need to make well informed decisions related to their property tax assessments.” We disagree.
There is a valid argument that most taxpayers will not realize that market values have increased until after
there is a shift in tax burden and it is too late for them to exercise their right to appeal. Lawyers
representing taxpayers however face malpractice suits if they do not appeal an artificial increase in market
value. Based upon our review of appeals this session, we anticipate that virtually every commercial
property of significant value will appeal the increase in market value caused by the Assessor’s application
of the 10/25 Ordinance. The 10/25 Ordinance as implemented is misleading, it is not revenue neutral, and
it does make the Assessor’s value transparent.

SECOND INSTALLMENT TAX BILLS continued
ITEM #8 cont’d
As you are aware, the Board of Review is a quasi-judicial body. We have made every effort to
respect the Assessor’s role and authority, the lawfully enacted “10/25 Ordinance”, and to avoid any
influence in the Assessor’s implementation of the “10/25 Ordinance”. Subsequently, we have reviewed
thousands of matters, conducted hundreds if not thousands of oral hearings, which create the
overwhelming presumption that the Assessor’s implementation and applications of an otherwise lawful
Ordinance is materially flawed and will cause far reaching undesirable consequences.
We are available to discuss these very important matters in greater detail at your convenience.
LETTER FROM THE COOK COUNTY ASSESSOR
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 29, 2010 from
JAMES M. HOULIHAN, Cook County Assessor
On Friday March 26, Joe Fratto convened a meeting of representatives of the Cook County Board
President’s Office, the Commissioners of the Board of Review, and the Assessor’s Office to review issues
regarding the timing of tax bills. Later that day, the Board of Review sent you a letter highly critical of
the Assessor’s Office, having said nothing at the Fratto meeting pertaining to the concerns expressed in
the letter.
First, the letter accused our office of being wholly responsible for what the BOR predicted will be a delay
in 2010 second-installment tax bills.
Remember, this is the same Board that testified at their budget hearing that the Assessor’s Office was
responsible for the delay in 2009 tax bills. As you will also recall, the Board of Review admitted at that
same budget hearing in October that they had received completed townships from the Assessor’s Office
which they had not even opened for processing. The Board opened those townships the following day.
To date, the Board of Review has not closed and returned any of the 21 completed townships received
from the Assessor’s Office. Six of the more recent townships we have sent them have not even been
opened at the Board of Review.
Second, the Board accused the Assessor of improperly implementing the 10/25 Ordinance, which the
Board of Commissioners passed in 2008. After ignoring prior opportunities to present information to the
Cook County Board of Commissioners regarding the ordinance, the Board of Review now, at the 11th
hour, raises objections to its implementation.
Passing the 10/25 Ordinance was the correct thing to do. As Civic Federation President Laurence Msall
said when speaking in support of it at the Board’s September 2008 Finance Committee Meeting, the
ordinance “will be a positive step in providing transparency.”

It is difficult to understand the Board of Review’s thinking in presenting these irresponsible, reckless
accusations. With regard to their assertions and their seriousness, I suggest that the Board of
Commissioners put this matter on the agenda for the April 6 meeting so that the Commissioners can
evaluate these purported concerns in detail. We, for our part, will have the chance to refute these claims.
LETTER FROM THE COOK COUNTY CLERK
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 31, 2010 from
DAVID ORR, Cook County Clerk
In light of the correspondence from the other tax offices, let me add a brief comment regarding the timing
of second installment tax bills. The clerk’s office plays a small but critical role in the process—analyzing
taxing district levies and deriving tax rates from the levies and the total district equalized assessed value.
Our work focuses on processing local government ordinances, levies and bonds until the moment when it
culminates in the rate calculations. This happens only when assessments are finalized, all exemptions
applied and final taxable values for each district are set. Once the district values are set, we begin
calculating tax rates.
Since tax caps were enacted for Cook County, this calculation process has taken about three weeks each
year. This is three weeks out of an overall process that takes many months.
I am keenly aware of the importance of getting the tax bills out on time to minimize trouble for the taxing
bodies. This is especially important given the incredible state deficit, which means many of these taxing
bodies’ state money will be delayed and/or reduced.
LETTER FROM THE COOK COUNTY TREASURER
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 15, 2010 from
MARIA PAPPAS, Cook County Treasurer
We cannot get bills out unless we have figures. When we get figures we will advise you.
Please consult elected officials who are part of the avalanche of appeals.

WHEREAS, this year the Jewish Holy Day and Festival of Pesach (Passover) is honored beginning at
sunset on Monday, March 29, 2010 and continuing through Tuesday, April 6, 2010 at sundown; and
WHEREAS, Passover commemorates God’s sparing of the Israelites, their liberation from slavery, and
their exodus from Egypt; and
WHEREAS, in the Biblical story of Exodus, God inflicted ten plagues upon the Egyptians before the
Pharaoh would release his Israelite slaves; the tenth plague was the killing of firstborn sons; the Israelites,
however, were instructed to mark the doorposts of their homes with the blood of a Spring lamb and, upon
seeing this, God passed over these homes, hence the origin of the name, “Passover;” and
WHEREAS, Passover is also called “The Festival of Unleavened Bread,” for when the Pharaoh freed the
Israelites, it has been said that the Israelites left so quickly that they had no time to let their bread rise;
therefore, the unleavened matzoh became one of a number of symbolic foods eaten during Passover and,
as the primary symbol of the holiday, is eaten instead of bread throughout the eight days of Passover; and
WHEREAS, during Passover Jewish families gather in their homes at a ceremonial feast called the
Seder; at the Seder, Jews read aloud the story of the Israelites’ journey to the Promised Land from the
traditional book known as the Haggadah.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Todd H. Stroger, President of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners, along with the Cook County Board of Commissioners, on behalf of the more
than five million residents of Cook County, do hereby recognize the Jewish Holy Day and Festival of
Passover, and do urge all residents to be cognizant of this Holy Day and Festival, which are deeply
cherished and almost universally observed by members of the Jewish faith.

RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Christianity’s most important holiday, Easter, falls this year on Sunday, April 4th;
sometimes referred to as a “moveable feast,” Easter does not fall on a set date each year; rather, Christian
churches in the West celebrate Easter on the first Sunday following the full moon after the vernal equinox
on March 21; and
WHEREAS, on Easter Sunday, Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ; according to
Christian scripture, Jesus Christ came back to life three days after his death on the cross; the Biblical
account of this can be found in the following passages: Matthew 27:27-28:8; Mark 15:16-16:19; Luke
23:26-24:35 and John 19:16-20:30; and
WHEREAS, the Friday just prior to Easter is called Good Friday; on this Holy Day the crucifixion of
Jesus Christ is commemorated; and
WHEREAS, in Western Christianity, Easter marks the ending of Lent; Lent, which begins on Ash
Wednesday 40 days prior to Easter, is a period of fasting, repentance, and spiritual discipline during
which one prepares for Easter; and
WHEREAS, Christian scripture teaches that through his death, burial and resurrection, Jesus paid the
penalty for human sin, thus providing eternal life for all who would believe in him.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Todd H. Stroger, President of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners, along with the Cook County Board of Commissioners, on behalf of the more
than five million residents of Cook County, do hereby recognize April 4, 2010 as the Christian Holy Day
of Easter, and do urge all residents to be cognizant of this Holy Day, which is deeply cherished and
almost universally observed by members of the Christian faith.

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
ITEM #31
REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & AUTOMATION
#305993, AS AMENDED
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 11, 2010 from
R. STEVE EDMONSON, Chief Information Officer, Bureau of Technology
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $425,000.00 from Account
545-260, Professional and Mangerial Services to Account 545-441, Maintenance and Repair of Data
Processing Equipment and Software for the coverage of a contract for ground imagery maintenance which

The transfer is needed to cover funding that was originally budgeted for 2009, but due to
contract processing, the contract period was moved to 2010.

545-260

Professional and Managerial Services

Total

$425,000.00

Maintenance and Repair of Data Processing
Equipment and Software

Total

$425,000.00

To Account:
545-441
1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On February 22, 2010, it became apparent that the Maintenance and Repair of Data Processing
Equipment and Software Account 545-441 would require an infusion of funds in order to meet
outstanding maintenance obligations. At this time, the balance of the account had $422,812.00, not
including the outstanding contract expenditures of $475,650.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 545-260 was identified as the source of transferred funds because of the reduction of some
of the geospatial projects which was realized via the Request for Proposal process and cooperative
acquisitions on a regional level.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 545-260 Professional Services.
Savings in the account will occur in two ways:
1) Since the County Board authorized us to participate in a regional aerial orthoimagery project with
the seven neighboring counties, the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning and the United
States Geological Survey, we realized a projected savings of over $300,000.00.
2) The department will postpone the upgrade of an existing application, Mapviewer that County
agencies use internally to quickly produce map displays.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The funding for the contract was originally planned to be incurred as part of fiscal year 2009.
However due to the lengthy process of contract review and negotiations and the end of the year
account closeout, the contract funding was carried into the 2010 fiscal year budget. The timing of
the contract processing was too late to add the contract into the 2010 fiscal budget and not finalized
enough to have the funds encumbered from 2009.

ITEM #32
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 19, 2010 from
BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to advertise for bids for a design-build contract for the
new air cooled chiller at the Ruth M. Rothstein Core Center.
The existing chiller at the Ruth M. Rothstein Core Center is reaching the end of its useful life. The chiller
has been in place since the building was constructed. It is the opinion of the Cook County Health &
Hospitals System Board that this work is of an urgent nature.
While the chiller is still in operation, it is not operating as efficiently and effectively to meet the designed
cooling loads of the building. With the Ruth M. Rothstein Core Center primarily handling infectious
diseases, the unit needs to be replaced in order to ensure that the Core Center can maintain a safe
temperature controlled environment.
This is categorized as an HVAC upgrade project.
Bond Issue (28000 Account).
This project was included in the 2010 Capital Improvement Program projects approved by the Board of
Commissioners on November 19, 2009.
The Cook County Health & Hospitals System Chief Operating Officer will submit this item to the Cook
County Health & Hospitals System Board for their approval.

($2,785.00) to the contract with Broadway Electric, Inc., Elk Grove, Illinois, for the Countywide Fire and
Life Safety System Upgrade Project, Package Number 5. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable
Body approve this request.
Reason:

This change order includes an increase to the contract to allow the Contractor to work during
second shift (3:00 P.M. to 11:00 P.M.) at the Skokie Courthouse, so as not to disrupt court
operation. It also includes a number of credits such as, a conductor type change from firepower limited (FPL) cable to thermoplastic high heat resistant nylon (THHN) wire, the
deletion of smoke and heat detectors in the elevators which are not required by applicable
codes. This is due to the fact that the elevator shafts are made of non-combustible
construction, therefore detectors are not required.
