 A motion was made by Mayor Michael Gammella to approve Resolution 2019-039. The
motion was seconded by Commissioner John Hamercheck. The motion passed by voice vote.
Resolution 2019-040: Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission Membership
Mr. Jonathan Giblin stated that the Governance Committee recommended at its meeting in
August an ex-officio NOACA Board membership for the Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure
Commission (OTIC).
Mr. Giblin stated that pending Board approval, the Executive Director/Chairman of OTIC will
become an ex-officio member of the NOACA Board and no further action will be needed.
However, the Code of Regulations will need to be amended to formalize this action.
A motion was made by Commissioner Lundy to approve Resolution 2019-040. The motion
was seconded by Dr. Floun’say Caver. The motion passed by voice vote.
Resolution 2019-041: Code of Regulations Amendment: NOACA Board Membership
by Population
Mr. Giblin provided background on previously proposed changes to the Code of Regulations
and attempts to get the document ratified by all five counties. Mr. Giblin stated that the
Governance Committee proposed the following recommendations at its meeting in August
2019:
•

Mandate a minimum of three Board members per county.

•

Add two Board seats, to be distributed according to the 2020 Census results, in order
to correct a math error.

•

Adopting a formula to appropriately adjust Board membership each decade according
to Census data.

•

Making these changes effective when results are released from the 2020 Census.

Mr. Giblin stated that pending Board approval, staff will distribute this amendment to Section
4.2 of the Code of Regulations to the five counties for ratification prior to January 1, 2020.
A motion was made by Commissioner Lundy to approve Resolution 2019-041. The motion
was seconded by Mayor Hunter.
Councilman Dale Miller asked why the previous proposal was not approved by all five counties
and how is the new proposal different.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the previous proposal was approved by the full Board and sent out to
the counties to be ratified. The first time, the document was ratified by 3 of the 5 counties and
the second time, it was approved by 4 of the 5 counties. Ms. Gallucci noted that one county
was not comfortable with the math allocating seats to one jurisdiction based on the current
Census performed in 2010. The revised proposal assigns the seats proportionately to the
appropriate jurisdiction based on the results of the next Census.

3087b

1-4

 Mayor Michael Dylan Brennan asked which county was over or underrepresented on the
NOACA Board and if the additional seats are intended to correct versus take away seats from
the overrepresented county.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the issue had been discussed over the past 6 years. She explained
how the error of the seats was discovered in 2013.
President McCall stated that regardless of the outcome of the next census, NOACA would not
have to keep ratifying the Code of Regulations since adjustments would be made accordingly.
Ms. Gallucci talked about the formula developed by NOACA staff that determines the number
of seats for each county. She said the formula would ensure there would not be a math error
in the future.
Ms. Nancy Griffith stated that the intention of the amendment is to reflect the population by
the 2020 Decennial Census and then adjusted every 10 years.
The Board voted and the motion passed by voice vote.
Resolution 2019-042: Project Planning Reviews (PPRs)/Intergovernmental Review and
Consultation (IGRC); 2nd Quarter State Fiscal Year 2019
Mr. Ed May provided background on PPR and presented information on the following projects:
•

CUY-43-1.98 (Widening Aurora Road from Solar Shopping Center Drive to Liberty
Road)

•

CUY IR 480 06.47/VAR Paint PID 22131 (Bridge Painting on IR-480 and SR-10 in

through ODOT. Mr. May stated that with Board adoption, the amendments will be
incorporated into the NOACA Plan and/or statewide TIP amendment in October 2019.

one parcel (1.0 acre) from the Lorain County FPA to Avon Lake/LORCO Phase I FPA. He
noted that the affected parties are Lorain County, LORCO, City of Avon Lake and Columbia

approval, staff will transmit copies of the Resolution to the appropriate federal, state and local
agencies.
A motion was made by Mayor Hunter to approve Resolution 2019-044. The motion was
seconded by Commissioner Lundy. The motion passed by voice vote.
Resolution 2019-045: SFY 2021-2024 TIP Projects Recommended for NOACA Funding
Mr. Randy Lane stated that the SFY 2021-2024 TIP contains road, bridge, public transit and
other transportation projects scheduled for implementation and includes projects supported
by federal funds through NOACA, ODOT and other governmental units. Ms. Gallucci provided
clarification that this action only represented the NOACA funded projects within the TIP,
because ODOT moved the completion of their STIP until next year.
Mr. Lane stated that approximately 700 projects were identified through a comprehensive
planning process and more than $1 billion is needed for implementation, which far exceeds
the $119 million available. Mr. Lane mentioned that projects recommended for NOACA
funding in the TIP represent the priorities in the LRTP and align with asset management and
performance measures initiatives. Mr. Lane reviewed the following:

•
•

•

Project evaluation approach
Funding recommendations
Draft NOACA STBG and TAP Programs Budget Summary
NOACA funding by general project type
Impact of recommended projects
Alignment of resource allocation by County

schedules and fiscal constraint for inclusion in the SFY 2021 – 2024 TIP. He noted that the

recommendation on January 17, 2020, and to the Board of Directors for approval on March 13,
2020.

Mr. Jim Thompson stated that NOACA received 10 applications requesting more than $30
million for various transportation-related projects. Mr. Thompson reviewed the project
evaluation and 2024-2025 project recommendations. He noted that approximately $28.9
million in transportation projects will be recommended to the Ohio Statewide Urban CMAQ
Committee (OSUCC), which will review and provided final funding recommendations in
October 2019.

NOACA Board of Directors

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

December 6, 2019

RE:

Resolution 2019-047: NOACA’s 2020 Legislative Agenda

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to adopt the 2020 NOACA Legislative Agenda. The Executive
Committee recommended the proposed Legislative Agenda at its meeting on November 8,
2019, and the External Affairs Committee recommended it on October 11, 2019.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The 2020 NOACA Legislative Agenda is comprised of a platform of basic principals and specific
priorities for advocacy efforts in Washington D.C. and Columbus. The 2019 NOACA Legislative
Agenda was approved by the NOACA Board in December 2018. Similarly, the 2020 Legislative
Agenda will be used to inform audiences of the values and priorities of the NOACA region as
they relate to state and federal policy.
The basic principles in the Legislative Agenda do not change much from year to year, as they
are statements that reflect the core policy ideas of the Agency and are representative of
fundamental NOACA values articulated in the NOACA Regional Strategic Plan. At this time, the
2020 Legislative Agenda remains identical to the 2019 Legislative Agenda.
However, the Board may wish to give consideration to articulating more specific Initiatives for
Action that address policy priorities highlighted in the Legislative Agenda. These Initiatives
would require significant planning and coordination to achieve, either through legislative or
administrative means. To this end, NOACA will engage the Board in a discussion regarding
potential advocacy initiatives to augment our 2020 Legislative Agenda. For your reference, a
copy of the proposed 2020 Legislative Agenda is attached, along with proposed Initiatives for
Action.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
The NOACA 2020 Legislative Agenda will guide advocacy efforts during calendar year 2020.

 Resolution 2019-047: 
2020 Legislative Agenda

ABOUT NOACA
The Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency (NOACA) is the federally designated metropolitan
planning organization for Northeast Ohio responsible for transportation and environmental planning. NOACA
prepares the region’s long-range transportation plan and short-range transportation improvement program,
which prioritizes and schedules federally funded transportation projects for the region. NOACA works with the
Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), project sponsors and other stakeholders to help address
Northeast Ohio’s transportation, air quality, and water quality needs.
Funding for NOACA’s transportation and environmental planning programs are derived from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Transit Administration (FTA), ODOT, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) and annual dues paid by local governments throughout the region.

ABOUT OUR AGENDA

DRAFT

2020
FEDERAL & STATE
LEGISLATIVE AGENDA

The Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency (NOACA) Board of Directors and staff are proud to
present the 2020 Federal and State Legislative Agenda.
Transportation infrastructure empowers Ohioans to reach jobs, access healthcare, education, recreational
opportunities and see family and friends. Ideally, each of these destinations should be accessible by multiple
modes. Furthermore, the optimal alignment of infrastructure and economic activity is the foundation of regional
competitiveness. Uncertain funding impacts project delivery, increases congestion, jeopardizes safety, and
reduces economic throughput.
The basis for these requests is NOACA’s Long-Range Transportation Plan (LRTP), AIM Forward 2040. AIM
Forward 2040 directs investment of all forms of transportation over the next 20 years. With the year 2040 as
the planning horizon, NOACA will invest approximately $15.8 billion in the region’s transportation over the life
of the plan.
The NOACA Vision Statement is a fundamental touchstone that will be applied to regional programs, priorities,
and projects. It is critical that we develop relationships with our delegation and stakeholders. We look forward
to working with you and greatly appreciate your support.

The Legislative Agenda represents consensus-driven principles that have been approved by
NOACA's 45-member Board of Directors in Northeast Ohio. It is intended to guide policy analysis
and advocacy on infrastructure issues. While NOACA's principles endure, the national
conversation and agenda on transportation infrastructure will change. In this way, NOACA can
assist public officials by advocating emerging issues with a non-partisan view.

5-5

 FEDERAL PRIORITIES

PRIORITY 1
Strengthen the MPO’s
local control of core
transportation
programs

This would include the Surface Transportation Program, Congestion
Mitigation Air Quality Improvement Program, and the Transportation
Alternatives Program. Directly allocating funding to MPOs and local
communities would create a more predictable revenue stream for
locally implemented priorities of air quality, improvement in mobility,
and investments in economic growth. Direct allocation would also
facilitate the ability of local communities to precisely define their funding
priorities such as funding for multimodal transportation strategies and
funding for transit.

PRIORITY 2
Promote asset
management as a
funding priority

PRIORITY 3
Incorporate safety,
sustainability,
multimodalism in
planning & funding

NOACA advocates that Congress should both revise the federal
funding formula to create a more equitable distribution of funds to local
communities and strengthen and expand local control to metropolitan
planning organizations by allocating more money directly to
regional/local authorities for core planning programs.

NOACA advocates that Congress should recognize the preservation of
transportation assets as an equal or greater economic priority as
compared to the development of new infrastructure. Regional
authorities similar to NOACA allocate as much as 90 percent of
available funding toward asset preservation. U.S. DOT has already
recognized this priority by mandating asset management programming
at the state level. NOACA advocates that the Congress should create
funding streams for asset management implementation – for transit,
road and bridge – at the regional/local level.

STATE PRIORITIES

PRIORITY 1
Improve the region’s
rate of return from
state allocated funds
to meet
regional asset
management needs

PRIORITY 2
Advocate for the
inclusion of multimodal
transportation within
state programs &
funding

NOACA advocates that the Ohio General Assembly review and amend
the state funding formula such that the NOACA region would receive an
equitable amount of State gas tax dollars as compared to what is
contributed by gas tax payers from the NOACA region.
The NOACA Board advocates a redress of this condition through the
creation of State programs that would allocate more funding to priorities
that are the sole responsibility of MPOs and local communities.
Formation of new programs or supplementing existing programs that
contribute funding to local and regional planning priorities such as asset
management programs would help create a more equitable rate of
return.
NOACA advocates that the Ohio General Assembly provide sufficient
funding for both capital and operating costs to support the development
and preservation of non-automobile transportation, particularly public
transit.
The Ohio Department of Transportation performed a comprehensive
assessment of current needs and long-term demands for transit in the
state. NOACA supports the findings and recommendations of the ODOT
study, which includes funding to bring Ohio’s public transportation
network into a state of good repair; and doubling statewide investment in
public transit, with the State of Ohio investing 10 percent of the
operating and capital costs of the needed service.

NOACA advocates that Congress should include safety, sustainability
and multimodalism as specific priorities within state and local MPO
planning requirements.
A specific focus should be to include public transit and hyperloop
funding programs.

WORKING TO ACHIEVE NOACA'S VISION:
NOACA will STRENGTHEN regional cohesion, PRESERVE existing infrastructure, and
BUILD a sustainable multimodal transportation system to SUPPORT economic
development and ENHANCE quality of life in Northeast Ohio.

 2020 FEDERAL AND STATE

LEGISLATIVE AGENDA INITIATIVES FOR ACTION
FEDERAL
Background: The Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act is set to expire in September 2020. This funding
and authorization law was enacted in 2015 to govern United States federal surface transportation policy and spending. A
reauthorization bill was recently approved by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, but still needs
approval by the Senate Commerce, Banking, and Finance Committees before going to the full Senate for a vote. This bill
maintains the existing structure of the federal transportation program, with some minor changes and new programs. On the
House side, a reauthorization bill will be considered by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, as well as the
House Ways and Means Committee. With the Federal Highway Trust Fund nearly insolvent, the funding committees need
to find ways to pay for our nation’s transportation programs. NOACA is advocating the following actions in connection to
the FAST Act.

Recommendations for advocacy with Northeast Ohio’s congressional delegation:
Increase the portion of the Surface
Transportation Block Grant Program
(STBG) that is provided directly to
local areas through their metropolitan
planning organizations (MPOs).

Local communities, working through their MPOs, are in the best position to
decide how transportation dollars should be spent in their regions. The bill
approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee keeps
this share at 55%. NOACA advocates for an increased share going directly
to the Agency and other MPOs.

Increase and index federal fuel taxes,
and encourage the search for new and
additional revenue sources – such as a
vehicle-miles-traveled user fee – to
provide sustainable and predictable
funding into the future.

The current federal gas tax, 18.4 cents for gasoline and 24.4 cents for
diesel, hasn’t been raised since 1993, and hasn’t kept pace with need due to
inflation and increased vehicle fuel efficiency. The gap between anticipated
Highway Trust Fund revenues and needed spending levels is approaching
$100 billion or more, requiring subsidies from general Treasury funds and/or
spending cuts elsewhere – neither of which is sustainable in the long-term.

Authorize and appropriate funding
for Hyperloop technology.

Support funding for Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS), such as
autonomous vehicle infrastructure and
technology, to improve the safety and
efficiency of transportation.
Thank NOACA’s congressional
delegation for their support for
NOACA’s recent competitive grant
awards from U.S. DOT.

Through a public-private partnership with Hyperloop TT, NOACA is
developing one of the nation’s first Hyperloop corridors: Great Lakes
Hyperloop, connecting Northeast Ohio to Chicago and Pittsburgh. Ask
Congress to fund the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (U.S. DOT’s)
Non-Traditional and Emerging Transportation Technology (NETT) Council,
to create a regulatory framework to ensure that Hyperloop projects can
move forward.

NOACA is updating its regional ITS architecture and strategic plan, and
more ITS funding will help our region improve traffic flow, air quality,
safety, and travel time reliability.

In the past year, NOACA received a $9.6 million BUILD (Better Utilizing
Investments to Leverage Development) grant from U.S. DOT for Geauga
County roadway safety, and a $9 million INFRA (Infrastructure for
Rebuilding America) grant to stabilize Irishtown Bend in the Cuyahoga
River. NOACA appreciates their support for these and future competitive
5-7
grant applications.

 2020 FEDERAL AND STATE

LEGISLATIVE AGENDA INITIATIVES FOR ACTION
STATE
Background: Earlier this year, the Ohio General Assembly and Governor DeWine approved the 2020-2021 Ohio
Transportation Budget, H.B. 62, which increased the Motor Fuel User Fee (gas tax) to 38.5 cents per gallon for gasoline,
and 47 cents per gallon for diesel. NOACA’s Board successfully advocated for several provisions included in the new law,
including increased motor fuel user fees to fund transportation investments, increased funding for transit, a greater share
of funds to local governments, and a study of future funding options. The NOACA region (including all municipalities,
townships, and counties) will receive an additional $46 million annually for transportation.

Recommendations for advocacy with Northeast Ohio’s statehouse delegation and Governor:
Support a requirement that ODOT
must maintain all state routes within
municipalities.

Advocate for an equitable return of
state transportation dollars to
Northeast Ohio.

Advocate for increased funding for
transit.

Currently, ODOT does not maintain state routes inside municipal
boundaries. ODOT could make this change administratively, or the General
Assembly could mandate such a change. This simple change would vastly
improve the NOACA region’s rate of return on its state user fee dollars, and
help local communities struggling to keep their heavily used roadways in a
state of good repair.
Ask legislators to support a distribution formula that sends user fee dollars
back to the regions and communities where they were collected, in the true
spirit of a “user fee”. In 2020, the NOACA region will pay much more than it
receives in gas tax dollars, to the tune of approximately $44 million annually.
Allocating dollars based on vehicle-miles-traveled (VMT) would result in a
more equitable distribution of funds, as opposed to current formulas. One
especially egregious inequity in the current system: each of Ohio’s 88
counties receives an equal share of funds intended for county governments,
regardless of population or roadway usage. Reach out to local legislators
who were appointed to a study committee created by the new law (H.B. 62)
to study long-term transportation issues in Ohio. Local members of the
“Ohio’s Road to Our Future Joint Legislative Study Committee” include: Rep.
Dave Greenspan (co-chair), Rep. Stephanie Howse, Rep. Michael Skindell,
Sen. Nathan Manning, and Sen. Nickie Antonio. As they analyze the use of a
vehicle-miles-traveled approach to transportation funding, it would be logical
to consider distributing dollars in the same manner.
Although H.B. 62 doubled transit funding in Ohio to $70 million annually,
Ohio still lags behind most states in per capita transit dollars, and historical
disinvestment has left GCRTA and other Ohio transit systems in financial
straits. Remind legislators that transit investments help improve local
economies, attract new employers, connect workers to jobs, and improve air
quality. In September 2019, the TRAC declined GCRTA’s request for funds
to help replace its outdated rail fleet, saying that rolling stock (rail cars)
doesn’t qualify as fixed assets. Ask legislators to create a dedicated, longterm source for transit funding.

NOACA Board of Directors

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

December 6, 2019

RE:

Resolution 2019-048: PNC Bank Depository Agreement and Collateralized Line of Credit

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve Resolution 2019-048 which would authorize the Executive Director
to sign a depository agreement with PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC Bank”) and to approve collateral
of local revenues and other charges for services on a revolving line of credit. The line of credit is pending
PNC Bank credit approval.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Board approved the procurement of a revolving line of credit and a related policy at the March 2019
Board meeting (Resolution 2019-011) following an extended Federal government shutdown (see attached
policy). According to the policy, any collateral must be approved by the Finance and Audit Committee and
the Board of Directors.
Currently, NOACA’s bank accounts are with Citizens Bank, N.A. (“Citizens Bank”) However, Citizens Bank
was unable to offer NOACA a revolving line of credit. Consequently, NOACA issued an RFP for primary
banking services and a revolving line of credit on June 5th, 2019. The July 6th deadline was extended to July
31st for those institutions expressing interest. The RFP was advertised on the agency’s website and mailed
to various area banks.
The only responding bank was PNC Bank, which has provided a term sheet for a revolving line of credit for
$750,000 secured by local revenues and other charges. PNC Bank is a local institution with an outstanding
CRA rating from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 2018. The bank’s senior debt is rated as
follows:

5-9

 PNC Bank is offering an earnings credit of 1.0% to offset the cost of their services and deposit collateral
through the Ohio Pooled Collateral System in accordance with Section 135.182 of the Ohio Revised Code.
PNC has qualified for 50% collateral but have agreed to collateralize NOACA deposits at 102%. The
depository agreement and an amendment regarding collateral coverage are attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact of changing bank depository accounts would be negligible monthly charges based on an
earnings credit of 1.0% and the current schedule of fees for services. The cost of the revolving line of credit
would be documentation fees under $1,000. The interest rate on any drawdowns would be LIBOR + 1.4%.
LIBOR is the London Interbank Offered Rate and a common interest rate benchmark used for loans. At this
writing the LIBOR rate is 1.96% so the rate on the borrowing would be 3.36%.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, staff will work toward transferring its primary bank accounts to PNC Bank contingent
upon credit approval of the revolving line of credit by PNC Bank and determination of acceptable terms in
the loan agreement by NOACA’s Executive Director.

 NOACA Revolving Line of Credit Policy
PURPOSE
• The purpose of the revolving line of credit is to provide a contingency plan in the event of an
extended federal government shutdown or other unusual or unexpected event that impairs liquidity.
• The Policy provides the Executive Director the ability to obtain the revolving line of credit based on
the acceptability of the terms.
AUTHORIZATION
• The Executive Director can authorize the opening and closing of a revolving line of credit, which
would preferably be from a commercial bank, in the amount not to exceed $1,000,000.

approved by the Finance and Audit Committee and Board of Directors.
DRAWDOWNS
• Drawdowns can only be executed when the Agency has inadequate liquidity for operating purposes
(payroll and/or to pay vendors and contractors) where non-payment would be detrimental to the
Agency
• The amount of a drawdown must be limited to the amount required to meet the above-described
obligations.
• Drawdowns require signatures of the following individuals:
o NOACA Board President
o Executive Director and
o Comptroller
(In the event that the Executive Director or Comptroller is not available, the Director of Administrative
Services can serve as one of the signers.)
• The drawdowns can only be deposited electronically directly from the bank into the Agency’s primary
checking account.
• The drawdowns shall not exceed $100,000 per week.
REPAYMENT
• The loan must be repaid within 5 business days to the extent possible once the replacement funds
(grant or other reimbursements) have been received.
The source of repayment is the grant reimbursement in the event of a Federal government shutdown.

NOACA Board of Directors

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

December 6, 2019

RE:

Resolution 2019-049: Agency Procurement - NOACA Signal Timing & Optimization
Program FY2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve Resolution 2019-049 which would award a contract to Albeck
Gerken Inc., Transportation Engineers for NOACA’s Signal Timing & Optimization Program in the not to
exceed amount of $439,438.
The Finance and Audit Committee recommended this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
Today, there are more than 272,000 traffic signals in the United States. They play an important role in the
transportation network and are a source of significant frustration for the public when not operated efficiently.
As the era of freeway building draws to a close, urban arterials are being called upon to carry more users
than ever before at a time when the users of these facilities are growing more complex (older drivers, more
distractions, larger vehicles, etc.) and the demand for such use continues to outpace transportation supply.
Traffic signal timing efficiency degrades over time as volume patterns and magnitude change, development
occurs, or infrastructure changes. Outdated or poor traffic signal timing accounts for a significant portion of
traffic delay on urban arterials, and traffic signal optimization is one of the most cost effective ways to
reduce emissions, improve mobility, reduce delays and improve corridor safety.
NOACA’s approach to address the issues related to inefficient traffic signal timing was to develop a Signal
Timing Optimization Program (STOP), and in June 2016, the Board of Directors adopted resolution 2016-015,
which approved a consultant firm to develop a pilot STOP project for two corridors.
STOP projects in fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019 have been successfully implemented. The STOP for
fiscal years 2020 and 2021 proposes to continue retiming regionally-significant corridors to provide significant
benefits.
NOACA released a Request for Proposals (RFP) on September 9, 2019 with proposals due on October 8,
2019; six proposals were received. Vendors were scored on three criteria: project approach, experience and
qualifications. After evaluating the proposals, the NOACA review team determined that the firm with the
highest scores was Albeck Gerken, Inc.
Since the time Albeck Gerken was selected for this contract, it was announced that Iteris, Inc. has acquired
one hundred percent of the stock of Albeck Gerken, making Albeck Gerken a wholly owned subsidiary of
Iteris. Iteris will be assuming all contractual relationships on the same terms as originally bid by Albeck
5 - 17

 Gerken. As a result, NOACA’s agreement for the FY2020-FY2021 STOP project will be with Iteris, Inc., the
parent company of Albeck Gerken. As for all of the recommended corridors, staff developed
recommendations for project corridors utilizing a transportation operations and emissions reduction
framework and criteria. The criteria, as well as the potential corridors were presented to the Safety and
Operations Council, the Air Quality Subcommittee and the Transportation Subcommittee for information and
input.
The FY2020-FY2021 STOP project consists of Part I and Part II with Part II being “if authorized”.
Part I consists of two corridors:
•
•

Bagley Road (from Lindbergh Rd. to Pearl Rd. 3.56 miles, 25 signalized intersections) in the cities of
Berea and Middleburgh Heights.
Ridge Road (from Pearl Rd. to Denison Ave., 3.47 miles, 20 signalized intersections) in the cities of
Parma, Brooklyn, and Cleveland.

Part II, if authorized, will consist of two corridors/grid of similar length and number of intersections, with the
scope to be developed by NOACA, to begin after Part I has been finalized.
NOACA will administer and manage the STOP program, but the projects will not be implemented without
the approval of the agencies that own, operate and/or maintain the project signals. NOACA will work closely
with the project sponsors and consultants to successfully complete the STOP projects.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Part I of the proposed contract will be executed for one year commencing on or around January 2020 and
ending on or around March 2021; at a cost not to exceed $439,438. $440,000 was budgeted in the FY2020
OWP for a consultant. Part II, if authorized, will also take place over approximately one year after Part I is
finalized at a cost negotiated by NOACA. This project is funded through NOACA’s CMAQ funds.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, staff will work with the local communities involved and the consultant team to implement
the signal timing optimization program.

RE:

Resolution 2019-050: Agency Procurement – NOACA Net Zero Cool Project

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve Resolution 2019-050 which would award a contract to F. Buddie
Contracting, Ltd. for NOACA’s Net Zero Cool project (Design Build) in an amount not to exceed $888,000,
which reflects current estimates of total project costs, pending appropriate funding.
The Finance and Audit Committee recommended this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (NEORSD) supports the strategic implementation and long-term
maintenance of green infrastructure projects. NEORSD funds green infrastructure projects within the
combined sewer area through its Green Infrastructure Grants (GIG) Program. Green infrastructure protects,
preserves, enhances, and restores natural hydrologic function. Such stormwater control measures (SCMs),
increase resiliency of infrastructure; reduce stress on wet weather drainage and collection systems; and
support healthy environments and strong communities.
The GIG Program is open to member communities, governmental entities, non-profit organizations 501(c)(3),
or businesses working in partnership with their community. These entities can propose water resource
projects that keep stormwater out of the combined sewer system and reduce capacity overflow problems.
The objectives and outcomes for Net Zero Cool are embodied in its name. “Net Zero” refers to NOACA’s
ambition to capture stormwater runoff from its impervious surface area and eliminate its contribution to the
combined wastewater/stormwater conveyance system. “Cool” refers to NOACA’s ambition to showcase its
green infrastructure elements with eye-catching, water-themed design; mural and green wall on the sides of
the building; educational placards along the sidewalk, adjacent to a proposed bioretention system; and
outdoor classroom space on the green roof for lectures, tours and public meetings. Net Zero Cool would make
NOACA a true vanguard for NEORSD-funded green infrastructure implementation; a marquee to illuminate
the tremendous benefits of green infrastructure in Downtown Cleveland.
On September 6, NOACA submitted its proposal for “Net Zero Cool,” a three-phase, comprehensive suite of
measures to reduce stormwater runoff from its 100% impervious Downtown Cleveland site and mitigate
runoff’s harmful impacts on the Frontal Lake Erie-Doan Brook Watershed.
Project phases submitted to NEORSD include (with engineer’s estimates of build costs):

5 - 21

 PHASE I (BUILDING) ($360,000)
Project A (One-story extensive green roof system with usable outdoor space accessible via second floor) $210,000
Project B (Roof water collection with bioretention) - $150,000
PHASE II (PARKING LOT) ($350,000)
Project A (Parking lot porous paving/center drive aisle) – $140,000
Project B (Carport structures with extensive green roof) - $210,000
PHASE III (WALLS: “THE RIBBON THAT WRAPS THE PACKAGE”) ($95,000)
Project A (One-story building extensive green wall system) - $35,000
Project B (Three-story building mural) - $60,000
The total project cost is estimated at $900,000. In addition to the $805,000 of estimated build costs outlined
above, NOACA estimates $83,000 in design costs and has already spent $12,000 on a design/engineering
team to explore opportunities through site visits, preliminary design proposals and stormwater modeling.
NOACA committed to a 20% match in its application to NEORSD, or $180,000, while NOACA requested
$720,000 in funding from NEORSD.
NOACA released a Request for Proposals (RFP) to hire a design-build firm, conditional on NEORSD (and
any potential future) funding, on September 21st, 2019. Proposals were due on October 21st, 2019; NOACA
received two proposals. NOACA staff evaluated both qualifications (project understanding and approach,
design build project team and design build capabilities) and technical proposals (design management,
proposed design, construction management, construction, quality management, and schedule). After
evaluation, the firm with the highest scores was F. Buddie Contracting, Ltd.
ABOUT THE VENDOR
F. Buddie Contracting, Ltd. is a certified CSB (Cleveland Small Business) and a Cuyahoga County SBE (Small
Business Enterprise) located in the City of Cleveland. They have over 55 years in general contracting
experience. Their design team consists of Osborn Engineering, headquartered in Cleveland, and MKSK,
headquartered in Columbus.
TIMING
On November 21st, 2019, the NEORSD announced NOACA’s award of $185,000 to fund construction of
Phase I-Project B (Roof water collection with bioretention) and Phase III-Project A (One-story building
extensive green wall system). NOACA will move forward with these projects and will continue to pursue
funding for the remainder of Net Zero Cool.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Proposed contract will be executed for approximately two years commencing on or around January 2020 and
ending on or around March 2022; at an amount currently estimated not to exceed $888,000. This action would
also amend the NOACA Budget and OWP as appropriate, including the NEORSD award and other potential
funding.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, staff will work with the NEORSD, potential future funders, and the design build team to
design and build all or parts of NOACA Net Zero Cool.

RE:

Resolution 2019-051: LAK – Stevens Boulevard, Village of Lakeline,
Project Funding Request

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve additional funding for the City of Eastlake’s Stevens Boulevard
project to expand the project area into the adjacent Village of Lakeline.
The Finance and Audit Committee recommended this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The City of Eastlake Stevens Boulevard Resurfacing Project is programmed in SFY 2020 of the current
2018-2021 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), with a NOACA commitment of $2,022,300 of
Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) program funds. The current project scope and funding
commitment addresses the deficient pavement in the City of Eastlake from SR 91 to the north at the
Eastlake/Village of Lakeline corporation line. The project was identified as a need for SFY 2018-2021 TIP
funding through the NOACA Transportation Asset Management (TAM) plan and tool. The tool projects
pavement deficiencies and recommends corrective work based on ODOT Pavement Condition Ratings
(PCR) for each segment of the federal-aid roadway network. Roadway segments that are less than .5 lane
miles are either filtered out or adjoined to larger adjacent segments if they are alike in both condition and
recommended corrective work.
The Village of Lakeline maintains approximately .08 miles (400 feet) of Stevens Boulevard, from the current
project limits at the Eastlake corporation line to Lakeshore Boulevard (SR 283). The PCR for this segment
is 63, matching the average PCR and recommended resurfacing of the Eastlake segment that was
prioritized for funding (see attached map). However, in development of the 2018-2021 TIP the Lakeline
segment was inadvertently filtered out for funding consideration because of its length. Rather, the segment
should have been adjoined to the Eastlake Stevens Boulevard segment and prioritized for funding.
As such, the Village of Lakeline is requesting consideration for a NOACA STBG program funding
commitment of $176,000 to expand the project across communities to provide maximum project benefit. A
local match of $44,000 (20%) has been committed from Lakeline for a total cost of $220,000. Pending
approval of funding, the City of Eastlake has agreed to incorporate the segment into its design plans and its
funding agreement with ODOT. The projects is currently scheduled for sale in early 2020.

5 - 25

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
The request would increase the NOACA funding commitment to the City of Eastlake Stevens Boulevard
project by $176,000 from $2,022,300 to $2,198,300. The increase would be funded utilizing existing
savings from STBG projects coming in under estimate. Therefore, there is no impact to other planned and
programmed TIP projects.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, the TIP will be amended to incorporate the additional scope and funding for the
project.

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

December 6, 2019

RE:

Resolution No. 2019-052: Programming Grant Funds for an Update to the E 66th Street
Corridor Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Plan

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve the addition of the E 66th Street Corridor Update Project to the
2020 TLCI program, amend the fiscal year 2020 budget, and award the contract to the selected consultant;
funded through a Cleveland Foundation Grant, in the amount of $150,000.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
In 2010, NOACA approved funding for the League Park Neighborhood District Plan, sponsored by the City
of Cleveland, through the Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) program. The study was
completed in 2012, which established a strategy for future investment in the Hough neighborhood,
specifically the League Park District.
Since the completion of the original plan in 2012, there have been significant undertakings within and
beyond the immediate study area. In addition to investments made by the residents and community
stakeholders, several recent catalytic announcements have tipped the momentum toward the need to revisit
the plan for a comprehensive update, including:
•
•
•

the recent decision by The Cleveland Foundation to move its headquarters to E. 66th and Euclid;
the new location of the Hough Branch of the Cleveland Public Library at the corner of E. 66th and
Lexington;
the development plans for Allen Estates single and multi-family housing; and the plans for an
innovation district between Euclid and Chester along E. 66th Street.

An immediate update to the original plan, both in content and expanded geography, is needed to best guide
known and planned future investments in the corridor. The study update will address the following areas of
focus:
• Conduct new community outreach and involvement;
• Expand the original study area along E. 66th Street from Chester to Euclid;
• Integrate the updated land uses adjacent to the E. 66th Corridor study area;

5 - 31

 •
•
•
•

Consider the planned Cleveland Foundation Head Quarters, Innovation District campus plans,
proposed housing developments, and updated vacant land mapping;
Align with existing or identified future planning efforts;
Update of infrastructure plans providing for green and complete streets to provide seamless
transportation access for all modes;
Update the implementation schedule and general cost estimates.

City Architecture has been selected to develop the E 66th Street Corridor Update Project in accordance with
standard TLCI procurement procedures. This is the firm that completed the original 2012 TLCI study as
well.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total cost of the project is $150,000, funded by a Cleveland Foundation Grant award. This action will
not impact any funding for the current TLCI solicitation.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, the budget will be amended and staff will work with the project sponsor to program
and develop the project.

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

December 6, 2019

RE:

Resolution No. 2019-054: Project Planning Review for 2nd Quarter State Fiscal Year
(SFY) 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve projects proposed for 2nd Quarter SFY 2020 to acknowledge
that the projects have successfully completed project planning review (PPR).
The Transportation Subcommittee and the Planning and Programming Committee have recommended
this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federalaid transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and
federal requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff; Board (including committees, subcommittees, and
councils, which provide intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC)) and public involvement. The
end product of PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing
the project to proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
The second quarter PPR covers roadway and transit projects in Cuyahoga County sponsored by the Ohio
Department of Transportation and GCRTA. A project sponsored by the City of Brecksville, involving the
completion of the partial diamond interchange at I-77 and Miller Road, in Brecksville, was referred to the
Policy Committee for further evaluation.
Detailed information about the projects can be found at:
•
•

Roadway Projects in Cuyahoga County
RTA Fiscal Year 2020 Capital Grant Program

5 - 41

 As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPRs is
included on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained
from the public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed
projects are posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, the project sponsors will be notified that their project has completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with project sponsors to address any planning issues identified during PPR prior to
amendment to the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).

 NORTHEAST OHIO AREAWIDE COORDINATING AGENCY
MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Board of Directors

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

December 6, 2019

RE:

Resolution No. 2019-055: Plan and TIP Amendments for 2nd Quarter State Fiscal
Year (SFY) 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve the amendments to NOACA’s Long-Range Transportation
Plan (Plan) and the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) to include the proposed projects as
indicated.
The Transportation Subcommittee and Planning and Programming Committee support this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The proposed amendments to the Plan and the state fiscal year (SFY) 2018 – 2021 Transportation
Improvement Program (TIP) include projects being processed through project planning review (PPR).
The projects include roadway and transit projects sponsored by the Ohio Department of Transportation
(ODOT) and GCRTA.
The proposed amendments also include a project sponsored by ODOT, which was processed through
project planning review (Resolution 2018-038) and amended to the TIP (Resolution 2018-039), in
December 2018. The project (CUY SR 176 - 10.13: PID No. 101941) involves improvements at the
SR-176 and IR-480 interchange, in Cleveland and Brooklyn Heights. The project’s construction cost
was originally estimated at $12,000,000. The sponsor reports that the construction cost estimate has
increased 23 percent ($2,713,000) to $14,713,000, which requires amendment of the project in the
TIP.
NOACA’s Regional Transportation Investment Policy states that projects already on the TIP that
request a significant change of scope or cost (greater than 20 percent) must go through PPR again.
However, project sponsors may appeal this 20 percent requirement if it can be shown that the cost
increases were a result of an increase in material costs or inflation.
The project’s revised construction cost is the result of an increase in material costs attributable to
more complicated maintenance of traffic and more extensive undercut, which affects the underdrain
system. The costs associated with these activities and materials is consistent with NOACA policy.
The proposed amendments also include a project sponsored by Laketran processed through project
planning review (Resolution 2019-014) and amended to the TIP (Resolution 2019-015). The project
(LAK WICKLIFFE PARK & RIDE LOT RECONSTRUCTION: PID No. 108885) involves reconstruction
of the park and ride lot in Wickliffe to accommodate electric charging infrastructure. The cost of the
reconstruction of the park and ride lot site was originally estimated at $750,000. The estimated cost is
being revised to $2,350,699 to reflect the construction of a facility with an indoor passenger waiting
5 - 47

 area, restrooms, a gear room to house the fast charge charging infrastructure and the creation of three
individual loading zones, providing equal access to the passenger waiting area. The project will be
funded with $1,880,559 in Section 5307 funding. Laketran will provide the remaining $470,140. The
increase is over the maximum allowable threshold for a project this size.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost of the proposed projects being amended to the Plan and TIP is $236.8 million. Funding for
these projects is committed and/or planned from a variety of federal, state, and local sources. Federal
funding is provided by the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration and
administered through the Ohio Department of Transportation.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, the amendments will be incorporated into the NOACA Plan and/or statewide TIP
amendment in October 2019.

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

December 6, 2019

RE:

Resolution No. 2019-056: Functional Classification Amendment
Recommendations

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve Resolution 2019-052, which approves the functional
classification amendment recommendations.
•
•
•
•

E 30th St., in the City of Cleveland, remove from the I-90 WB intermodal connector
Prospect Ave., in the City of Cleveland, add to the I-90 WB intermodal connector
E 14th St., in the City of Cleveland, from a principal arterial to a major collector
Shaker Blvd., in the City of Cleveland, add to the OH-82T intermodal connector

The Planning and Programming Committee and Transportation Subcommittee support this
action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Ohio Department of Transportation has requested the following functional classification
amendments:
•
•
•
•

Remove E 30th, from I-77 WB exit ramp to Broadway; Broadway (SR 14), from E 30th to
E 14th; and E14th Street, from Broadway to Orange Ave., from the I-90 WB Intermodal
Connector OH 56T (Tower City).
Add Prospect Ave., from the I-90 WB exit ramp to Tower City to the I-90 WB Intermodal
Connector OH 56T (Tower City).
Revise 500 feet of E14th Street, from Broadway Ave. to Orange Ave., from a principal
arterial to a major collector.
Add 210 feet of SR 87 – Shaker Boulevard in both directions to Connector OH 82T from
the RTA station at approximately E 130th Street to the east leg of the Shaker Square
Loop (CR 62) which will also join with Connector OH 84T.

5 - 63

 Functional Classification is the grouping of roads, streets, and highways in a hierarchy based on
the type of highway service they provide. Streets and highways are part of an interconnected
network, and each one plays a role in moving traffic throughout the system. Generally, streets
and highways provide either traffic mobility or land access and can be ranked in terms of the
proportion of service they perform.
In June 2014 the NOACA Board of Directors approved Resolution Number 2014-025, which
created a NOACA functional classification policy for the review of proposed functional
classification revisions. The policy requires all proposed functional classification revisions to be
evaluated thoroughly prior to making a recommendation to the Ohio Department of
Transportation. Evaluation is based on guidelines suggested by the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) and the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) with some criteria
refined to reflect local conditions. Criteria evaluated includes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Lane widths
Shoulder widths
Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT)
Access
Speed limit
Parallel spacing of routes
Area type
Percentage of mileage by functional classification (by region, by county)
Functional classification density analysis

Based on the NOACA Functional Classification Amendment Policy, Staff recommends the
proposed ODOT amendments.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact, but approval of the functional classification recommendations could add
additional mileage to the federal-aid network.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, these recommendations will be forwarded to ODOT and FHWA for
further review and implementation.

RE:

Resolution No. 2019-057: Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with
Disabilities (Section 5310) Program Projects

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve the SFY20 Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with
Disabilities (Section 5310) Program Project Recommendations.
The Planning and Programming Committee and Transportation Subcommittee recommend this action.
BACKGROUND
The Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities (Section 5310) Program addresses the
special transportation needs of seniors and individuals with disabilities. NOACA seeks to eliminate barriers
and improve transportation options in Northeast Ohio for older adults, individuals with disabilities, and
people of low income through the coordination of resources and efforts of public transit operators, human
service agencies, and other transportation providers. Furthermore, NOACA encourages the efficient and
effective use of resources by eliminating gaps and redundancies in transportation services.
The total amount apportioned to the region for federal fiscal year 2019 was $ 1,809,255, of which $ 180,925
(10%) will be retained by NOACA for program planning and administration. The remaining $ 1,628,330 is
available to be programmed for new projects. NOACA has designated at least 60% of funding for transit
agency project proposals and up to 40% for non-profits, for-profits, and government agencies awarded
through a competitive application process. There are also carryover funds from previous years totaling
$ 53,424 which will be applied to this program of projects. The total funding available to be programmed for
new projects this year is $1,681,754. Capital projects are funded at 80% with a 20% local match from
awardees. Transit agencies are eligible for operations funding at 50% federal funding with a 50% local
match.

non-profits, for-profits, and social service agencies requesting $1,520,371. Project proposals and
applications have been evaluated against program eligibility and prioritization criteria contained in the
Program Management Plan. Project recommendations are attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is $ 1,809,255 in FTA funds available to the Cleveland Urbanized Area from Federal Fiscal Year
2019. $ 180,925 will be used by NOACA for program administration. There is an additional $53,424 in
carryover funds from previous years to be added to the available funding for projects, totaling $ 1,681,754.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA will manage the SFY 2020 program to ensure the expenditure of available
funding during the fiscal year, including the advancement of additional projects as approved by the Board
should funding become available.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Board of Directors

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

December 6, 2019

RE:

Resolution No. 2019-058: Facility Planning Area (FPA) Modification Request: Transfer
of one (1) parcel from the Willoughby-Eastlake FPA to the Lake County FPA in City of
Willoughby

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve the facility planning area (FPA) modification request by Lake
County Department of Utilities (LCDU). Specifically, the item will transfer one (1) parcel (5.4 acres) from the
Willoughby-Eastlake FPA to the Lake County FPA in the City of Willoughby.
The Water Quality Subcommittee unanimously voted to support this recommendation, but lacked a quorum
to take official action. The Planning and Programming Committee recommended this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Ridgewood Green Subdivision is proposed at the former Johnnycake Ridge Golf Course in the Cities of
Mentor and Willoughby. The majority of the 55.2-acre development will be within the City of Mentor and the
Lake County Facility Planning Area (FPA), but 5.4 acres will extend into the City of Willoughby and the
Willoughby-Eastlake FPA. Both municipalities have approved the project.
The approved subdivision plan calls for Lake County Department of Utilities (LCDU) to provide sewer
service. However, the portion of the development within the City of Willoughby is not within the Lake
County FPA (Attachment A). With the current FPA boundary location, LCDU future sewer connections
within the City of Willoughby are inconsistent with NOACA’s Clean Water 2000 Plan (208 Plan). All sanitary
sewer connections must be within the FPA of the WWTP that treats the wastewater. Under the federal
Clean Water Act, Ohio EPA cannot issue a Permit-to-Install (PTI) for a project that conflicts with NOACA’s
208 Plan.
The FPA boundary modification is needed so the entire subdivision can be served by gravity sewers that
will flow to the LCDU sanitary sewer line along Mentor Avenue in the City of Mentor (Attachment B). The
developer investigated the extension of the City of Willoughby sewers to serve the portion of the subdivision
within the City of Willoughby. However, the nearest sewer along Johnnycake Ridge Road would require a
pump station for the homes to connect to the sewer. This option was determined not to be feasible due to
the small number of homes planned for that portion of the subdivision. The Willoughby sewer line along
Gardenside Drive to the west of the subdivision has limited capacity and the Willoughby City Engineer
recommended against adding additional flow to that sewer.

5 - 73

 The affected jurisdictions are the City of Willoughby and Lake County. The City of Eastlake is a co-owner of
the Willoughby-Eastlake Water Pollution Control Center (WPCC) which serves the Willoughby-Eastlake
FPA. All three (3) jurisdictions submitted letters of support for the FPA modification request, which fulfills
the notification requirements in Policy 4-6 of the 208 Plan.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA’s approval of the boundary change will not result in any financial impact to NOACA.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA staff will submit the updated FPA boundary to Ohio EPA.

RE: Request for Proposed Faciltiy Planning Area (FPA) Amendment
Ridgewood Greens Subdivision - Willoughby Mentor
Bedados. LLC
Letter of Support

Dear Ms. Schwickerath:

Reference is made to your letter with attachments dated 'April 24, 2019. detailing a new subdivision
located in the Cities of Mentor and Willoughby and in specific, the proposed point of connection
for the new sanitary sewers to service the subdivision.

It is understood from the documents provided that of the 119 lots in the subdivision, 112 lots exist
within the Lake County Utilities Department FPA while the remaining 7 exist in the
Willoughby?Eastiake FPA. It is further understood that having considered several alternates, the
best and most effective way to service the 7 lots would be to have them connected to sewers in the
LCUD FPA. To effect the best alternative requires that the 7 lots be placed under the auspices of
the LCUD FPA.

As a community within the Willoughby-Eastlake FPA, The City of Eastlake by copy of the letter
offers its support in favor of the proposed change in FPA for the aforementioned 7 lots. Should
additional documentation or legislation related to this matter be required, please contact me.

Thank you for your consideration.

Mayor Dennis Morley

 Staff Comments:
A new residential development, Ridgewood Greens Subdivision, is planned for the
former Johnnycake Ridge Golf Course in the Cities of Mentor and Willoughby. The
majority of the development, 112 out of 119 single family lots, is within the City of
Mentor. The remaining seven (7) lots will be in the City of Willoughby. Both
municipalities have approved the subdivision.
The approved development plans show the homes served by gravity sanitary sewers
connected to the existing Lake County Department of Utilities (LCDU) sewer line along
Mentor Avenue. This sewer line is within the Lake County FPA. However, the portion of
the proposed subdivision within the City of Willoughby is in the Willoughby-Eastlake FPA
and not the Lake County FPA. Under the federal Clean Water Act, sanitary sewer
connections must be within the FPA of the plant that treats the sewage. Therefore, the
portion of the development within the City of Willoughby needs to be transferred into the
Lake County FPA in order to be served by LCDU sewers.
Alternative sewer plans to maintain the existing FPA boundary were considered.
However, the existing City of Willoughby sanitary sewer along Johnnycake Ridge Road
is not deep enough to serve the seven (7) proposed lots within the City of Willoughby. A
pump station would be needed to connect these parcels to the sewer along Johnnycake
Ridge Road, but would not be cost effective with so few lots. The City of Willoughby
sewer line along Gardenside Drive to the west is not a viable sewer option because of
existing capacity issues, according to the Willoughby City Engineer.
The current Prescriptions for Wastewater Treatment (Prescriptions) allow for sanitary
sewer connections to the proposed site, so no change is required.
The affected jurisdictions are Lake County and the City of Willoughby. Both jurisdictions
support the proposed FPA modification. The City of Eastlake co-owns the WilloughbyEastlake Water Pollution Control Center (WPCC) and is also in support of the request.
The FPA modification notification requirements in Policy 4-6 of NOACA’s Clean Water
2000 Plan (208 Plan) have been fulfilled.
Staff Disposition:
The staff recommends approval of the proposed FPA boundary modification between
the Lake County FPA and Willoughby-Eastlake FPA. The Lake County sanitary sewer
line along Mentor Avenue can serve the entire proposed subdivision with gravity sewers.
The nearest sanitary sewers within the City of Willoughby are either not deep enough to
provide gravity sewer service to the new lots or do not have the capacity for additional
flow from the subdivision.
Water Quality Subcommittee Disposition:
Voted unanimously to support the request, but lacked a quorum for official action

Supports FPA modification request

RE:

Resolution No. 2019-59: Facility Planning Area (FPA) Modification Request: Northeast
Ohio Regional Sewer District (NEORSD) – Heights Hilltop FPA Boundary and
Prescriptions Modifications in the Village of Moreland Hills

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve the facility planning area (FPA) modification request by the Village
of Moreland Hills. Specifically, the item will:
•

Add four (4) parcels (6.9 acres) currently not within an FPA to the NEORSD – Heights Hilltop FPA;
and

•

Change the Prescriptions for Wastewater Treatment (Prescriptions) for the parcels within the
proposed modification area to make sanitary sewer connections consistent with the Clean Water 2000
Plan (208 Plan).

The Water Quality Subcommittee unanimously voted to support this recommendation, but lacked a quorum
to take official action. The Planning and Programming Committee recommended this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
An area on the southeast corner of State Route 91 (Som Center Road) and Hiram Trail in the Village of
Moreland Hills has been subdivided twice since 2014 to create four (4) lots. Three (3) of the lots are along
Hiram Trail and are undeveloped residential properties. The fourth lot has an existing home that is served
by an on-site sewage treatment system. A condition of the lot splits imposed by the Village of Moreland
Hills was any new development would connect to sanitary sewers. However, NOACA’s 208 Plan shows the
four (4) lots are not currently within an FPA and have a Prescription that does not allow for sanitary sewer
connections (Attachment A). The extension of sanitary sewers to these lots is not consistent NOACA’s
current 208 Plan. Under the federal Clean Water Act, Ohio EPA cannot issue a Permit-to-Install (PTI) for a
sanitary sewer extensions that conflicts with NOACA’s 208 Plan.
The Village of Moreland Hills requested an FPA modification to transfer the parcels into the NEORSD –
Heights Hilltop FPA and change the Prescriptions within the modification area to “sewers expected within 20
years” (Attachment B). The proposed changes would make sanitary sewer connections for all four (4)
parcels consistent with NOACA’s 208 Plan and fulfill the lot split approval condition for the three (3)
undeveloped parcels along Hiram Trail.

5 - 87

 The affected jurisdictions are the Village of Moreland Hills and NEORSD. Both support the proposed FPA
modification request which fulfills the notification requirements in Policy 4-6 of the 208 Plan.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA’s approval of the boundary change will not result in any financial impact to NOACA.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA staff will submit the updated FPA boundary to Ohio EPA.

Re: Facilities Planning Area (FPA) Modification - Moreland Hills
Hiram Trail Sanitary Sewer Extension

Dear Ms. Gallucci:

On August 7, 2019, the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (NEORSD) received a request
seeking support for the proposed modification of the NEORSD Heights-Hilltop Facilities Planning
Area (FPA) with the addition of four (4) parcels along Hiram Trail and SOM Center Road in
Moreland Hills (see attached parcel list and map).

Based on the information submitted with the request, Moreland Hills is proposing to extend a
sanitary sewer along Hiram Trail in order to facilitate new development on three (3) of the
parcels. The area tributary to the Hiram Trail Sanitary Sewer extension is already within
service area. Therefore, we concur with the proposed FPA modification.

If you have any questions or if you should need additional information, please contact Mary
Maciejowski at (216) 881-6600, ext. 6466.

Sincerely,

Agar/Lat

 Staff Comments:
The Village of Moreland Hills requests an FPA Boundary and Prescription modification in
order to allow four (4) parcels along State Route 91 and Hiram Trail to connect to
sanitary sewers. The area was originally a single parcel that was split into four (4)
parcels in 2014 and 2018. The three new parcels along Hiram Trail are not yet
developed. A condition of the lot split approval from the Village of Moreland Hills was
that newly constructed homes would connect to sanitary sewers. The proposed FPA
modification area is currently not within an FPA and has the Prescription of “area served
by on-site systems” which does not allow for extension of sanitary sewers.
The FPA modification area is within the sanitary sewer service agreement area between
the Village of Moreland Hills and NEORSD. Both entities support the proposed transfer.
Staff Disposition:
Staff recommend approval of the proposed FPA modifications to extend the NEORSD –
Heights Hilltop FPA along State Route 91 and Hiram Trail. The FPA Boundary and
Prescription changes will allow for sanitary sewers to serve three newly split parcels
along Hiram Trail. Both the Village and NEORSD are in support of the FPA modification.

NOACA Board of Directors

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

December 6, 2019

RE:

Resolution 2019-060; Safety Performance Target Setting for CY 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to adopt safety-related performance targets for calendar year 2020 for
inclusion in the AIM Forward 2040 long-range plan and the 2018-2021 Transportation Improvement
Program (TIP).
This action updates safety performance targets approved by the Board of Directors (Resolution 2019-022)
for the current 2018-2021 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) and the AIM Forward 2040 Long
Range Transportation Plan.
The Policy Committee recommended this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
Safety Performance Management (Safety PM) is part of the overall Transportation Performance
Management (TPM) program, which FHWA defines as a strategic approach that uses system information to
make investment and policy decision to achieve national performance goals. It establishes safety
performance measure requirements for the purpose of carrying out the State’s Highway Safety
Improvement Plan (HSIP) and to assess fatalities and serious injuries on all public roads.
The federal Safety PM Final Rule established five performance measures as the five-year rolling averages
to include:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Number of Fatalities
Rate of Fatalities per 100 million Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)
Number of Serious Injuries
Rate of Serious Injuries per 100 million VMT
Number of Non-motorized Fatalities and Non-motorized Serious Injuries

The Safety PM Final Rule also establishes the process for State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and
Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to establish and report their safety targets.
State DOT’s are required to adopted targets annually. MPOs are required to establish targets within of 180
days and shall represent the anticipated outcomes for the same calendar year as the State DOT target (23
U.S.C. 134(h)(2)). MPO targets can be established through one of two options:

5 - 97

 1. Agree to plan and program projects so that they contribute toward the accomplishment of the State
DOT safety target for a safety performance measure, or
2. Commit to a quantifiable target for a safety performance measure for the metropolitan planning area.
ODOT has established a 2% reduction for each of the five performance areas for calendar year 2020, an
increase from 1% versus last year. A rate of 2% reflects a more aggressive approach toward reducing
crashes that reflects the 2% reductions recommended for emphasis areas in NOACA’s SAVE Plan. Staff
recommends that NOACA adopt ODOT’s target of a 2% reduction for calendar year 2020 to support state
targets for safety performance.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA’s approval of the boundary change will not result in any financial impact to NOACA.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the AIM Forward 2040 plan and 2018-2021 TIP will be amended to reflect the
2020 adopted safety targets. Staff will support these targets by working to implement the recommendations
and strategies outlined in “SAVE: NOACA’s Regional Safety Action Plan.”
