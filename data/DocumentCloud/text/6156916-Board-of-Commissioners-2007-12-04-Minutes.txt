Subdivision I. In General
Sec. 54-121.

Gun shop employee background checks.

Before any person may be hired as an employee at a gun shop licensed under this article, the
holder of that license shall perform a background check to determine whether the potential employee
possesses the requisite character and fitness to deal in firearms unless the licensee employs 25 or more
individuals in which case, the licensee need only perform a background check on those employees that
will be involved in the transfer, sale, handling, assembly, shipping, packing, receiving, display or
demonstration of firearms or ammunition in the gun shop, or who could obtain access to firearms or
ammunition in the gun shop. No deadly weapons dealer licensee with fewer than 25 employees may
employ a person to work in the gun shop licensed under this article, and no licensee with 25 or more
employees may allow an employee to be involved in the transfer, sale, handling, assembly, shipping,
packing, receiving, display or demonstration of firearms or ammunition in the gun shop, if the licensee
knows or reasonably should know that person could not qualify to obtain legally an Illinois firearm
owner's identification card, or if the licensee is otherwise in possession of information that would lead a
reasonable person to conclude that the potential employee does not possess the requisite character and
fitness to deal in firearms.

owner's identification card, or if the licensee is otherwise in possession of information that would lead a
reasonable person to conclude that the potential employee does not possess the requisite character and
fitness to deal in firearms.

JOAN PATRICIA MURPHY and ROBERTO MALDONADO, County Commissioners
Co-Sponsored by
WILLIAM M. BEAVERS, JOSEPH MARIO MORENO and DEBORAH SIMS, County Commissioners
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
THE HOMEOWNER AND BANK PROTECTION ACT
WHEREAS, the onrushing financial crisis involving home mortgages, debt instruments of all types, and
the banking system of the United States threatens to set off an economic collapse worse than the Great
Depression of the 1930s; and
WHEREAS, millions of Americans are faced with foreclosure and loss of their homes over the coming
months according to studies released by RealtyTrac, and Reuters; and
WHEREAS, the hedge funds which spread this financial collapse among markets worldwide, by
dominating speculation in all those markets, are now going bankrupt and demanding government bailout
of their securities and derivatives, and the nominal value of the derivatives based on mortgages alone is
the size of the combined GDP of the nations of the world; and
WHEREAS, this financial crisis threatens the integrity of both Federal and State chartered banks, as
typified by the run on deposits of Countrywide Financial Corporation in California on August 16, which
could wipe out the life savings of too many American people and drastically undermine the economic
stability of our states and cities; and
WHEREAS, under similar circumstances in the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt successfully
intervened to protect banks and homeowners, addressing Congress with a "declaration of national policy"
on April 13, 1933, which stated "that the broad interests of the Nation require that special safeguards
should be thrown around home ownership as a guarantee of social and economic stability, and that to
protect homeowners from inequitable enforced liquidation in a time of general distress is a proper concern
of the Government.”
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners calls upon
Congress to take emergency action to protect homeowners and banks by enacting a Homeowners and
Banks Protection Act specifically to:
1.

Establish a Federal agency to place Federal and State chartered banks under protection,
freezing all existing home mortgages for a period of time, adjusting mortgage values to
fair prices, restructuring existing mortgages at appropriate interest rates and writing off
speculative debt obligations of mortgage-backed securities, financial derivatives and
other forms of financial pyramid schemes that have brought the banking system to the
point of bankruptcy; and

4443

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 4, 2007
2.

Declare a moratorium on all home foreclosures for the duration of the transitional period,
allowing families to retain their homes. Monthly payments, the equivalent of "rental
payments", shall be made to designated banks, which can use the funds as collateral for
normal lending practices, thus recapitalizing the banking system. These affordable
monthly payments will be factored into new mortgages, reflecting the orderly deflating of
the housing bubble, the establishment of appropriate property valuations and reduced
fixed mortgage interest rates. No homeowner shall be evicted from his or her property,
and the Federal and State chartered banks shall be protected so that they can resume their
traditional functions, serving local communities and facilitating credit for investment in
productive entities; and

3.

Authorize the state government to assume the administrative responsibilities for
implementing the program, including the "rental" assessments to designated banks, with
the Federal government providing the necessary credits and guarantees to assure the
successful transition.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution be delivered to the President of
the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and to each member
of the Illinois congressional delegation and that this text be spread upon the official proceedings of this
Honorable Body.

HONORING THE LIFE OF HAROLD WASHINGTON
WHEREAS, November 25, 2007, marked the twentieth (20th) anniversary of the death of The Honorable
Mayor Harold Washington, Chicago's first African American mayor and one of the great figures in the
history of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, Mayor Harold Washington was born on April 15, 1922, at Cook County Hospital, now
Stroger Hospital of Cook County. Mayor Harold Washington was the son of Roy Lee Washington, Sr.
and Bertha Jones. Mayor Washington attended St. Benedict the Moor Grammar School, Milwaukee and
Forrestville Elementary School and DuSable High School. After leaving high school, Mayor Washington
worked in a meat packing company until 1942, when he joined the United States Army; and
WHEREAS, called to active duty on February 8, 1943, Mayor Harold Washington was assigned to the
1887th Engineer Aviation Battalion, where he rose to the rank of First Sergeant. His battalion received
the Meritorious Service Unit Award for building a bomber landing strip on the Pacific Island of Anguar in
only twenty days, and Mayor Washington was decorated for bravery; and
WHEREAS, following his honorable discharge from the Army on January 20, 1946, Mayor Harold
Washington enrolled in Chicago's Roosevelt College, now Roosevelt University. Elected Class President
in 1948 and a member of Phi Beta Sigma, Mayor Washington received his B.A. degree from Roosevelt
College in 1949 and, in 1952, earned his J.D. degree from Northwestern University School of Law; and
WHEREAS, Mayor Harold Washington and former President John H. Stroger, Jr. served together as
aides to former United States Congressman Ralph Metcalf; and
WHEREAS, admitted to the Illinois Bar in 1953, Mayor Harold Washington worked as an Assistant
Corporation Counsel for the City of Chicago from 1954 until 1958, and as an arbitrator for the Illinois
Industrial Commission from 1960 to 1964. Politically active during these years, in 1954, Mayor
Washington followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a precinct captain in the City's Third Ward,
where he and former President John H. Stroger, Jr. helped organized the Young Democrats into a
powerful organization for minorities; and
WHEREAS, Mayor Harold Washington was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives (26th
District) and served for over 10 years; and
WHEREAS, Mayor Washington also served in the 80th and 81st General Assembly as a State Senator
(26th District) alongside Cook County Commissioner Earlean Collins (21st District); and
WHEREAS, in 1980, Mayor Washington was elected to the United States House of Representatives (1st
District); and
WHEREAS, Harold Washington decided to run for Mayor of the City of Chicago on November 10,
1982. He was elected Mayor of Chicago in 1983, and re-elected on February 24, 1987, Mayor Harold
Washington presided in office with style and grace, a reformer committed to breaking down barriers and
creating opportunities for all citizens. Mayor Washington was able to find the common threads uniting not
just Chicagoans, but citizens throughout Cook County; and

4456

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 4, 2007
WHEREAS, as a legislator, he advocated for the passage of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday in
Illinois, he was a strong supporter of keeping Provident Hospital of Cook County open as a provider of
health care for the economically disadvantage on the south side of Chicago. As Mayor of Chicago there
were many accomplishments in his administration, such as the creation of an Ethics Commission, the
increase in minority business contracts, he encouraged many neighborhood festivals, and lead the
movement toward transparency in government; and
WHEREAS, affectionately known as "the people's mayor" and revered for his many accomplishments in
office, Mayor Harold Washington was equally well-regarded for his strength of character, love of life and
unquestioned devotion to the citizens of not only Chicago but throughout Cook County. Mayor
Washington's unique blend of personal warmth, steadfastness, good humor, and the determination to
succeed, made a lasting impression on all the people of Cook County and earned him a special place in
their hearts; and
WHEREAS, Mayor Harold Washington died of a massive heart attack at his desk in City Hall on
November 25, 1987. As we mark the twentieth anniversary of the death of a beloved Mayor, a citizen of
Cook County and a truly remarkable man, it is fitting to remember that Mayor Harold Washington's
dream of a tolerant, compassionate, diverse and just society will never be forgotten.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board President and the Cook
County Board of Commissioners, assembled this fourth day of December 2007, do hereby acknowledge
and pay tribute to the enduring achievements and legacy of Mayor Harold Washington; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we call upon all residents of the County of Cook to join us in
honoring the life and memory of Chicago's first African American Mayor Harold Washington.

Also Present:

Antonio Hylton – Chief Information Officer, Bureau of Information Technology and

Systems; Darlena Williams Burnett – Deputy Chief Recorder, Office of Cook County

IBM; and Bill Nigh – Z Series Sales Specialist, Enterprise Server Sales, Central Region,
IBM

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Information Technology & Automation of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County met pursuant to notice on Tuesday, November 20, 2007 at the hour of 1:00 P.M. in the Board
Room, Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and, upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:

4502

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 4, 2007
289806

DEPARTMENT FOR MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS, by Stanley A.
Molis, Director, transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into two (2) related contracts
with INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (IBM) AND
IBM CREDIT LLC, Chicago, Illinois, to lease a Z900 Series Model 2094-702
Enterprise Server in order to acquire software, equipment, maintenance and support
services for the Data Center. The cost includes delivery, installation, training, all
software updates, hardware maintenance on the new processor and existing equipment,
support line and on-site support. The existing IBM 2084-302 will be returned to IBM as
per the current lease agreement.
Reason:

Only the IBM Z-Series Enterprise Server is compatible with all existing
operational software and peripheral hardware.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $11,660,959.00 Contract period: December 1, 2007 through
November 30, 2010. (714/012-579 Account). Requisition No. 80120001.
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.
The Chief Information Officer has reviewed this item and concurs with this
recommendation.
*Referred into the Committee on Information Technology & Automation on
October 16, 2007.
Antonio Hylton, Chief Information Officer, Bureau of Information Technology and Automation, stated
for the record that “Z Series” refers to the main frame environment and “I Series AS 400” refers to the
operating environment, as opposed to a purely server-based environment.
Mr. Hylton continued, stating that having reviewed the analysis and reports provided by several privatesector clients, he endorses his staff’s recommendation that, based on the amount of work and number of
transactions the County performs (27 million and 30 million CICS transactions per month), it should
continue to exist in a dual environment.
Mr. Hylton introduced James T. Lautenbach, Client Director, Government/Education, IBM.
Commissioner Moreno inquired whether County transactions that are currently run on Z Series could be
run on I Series, at a cost savings.
Mr. Lautenbach replied that this is possible, but that the I Series was not intended for this purpose. He
introduced Bill Nigh, Z Series Sales Specialist, Enterprise Server Sales, Central Region, IBM, to further
comment.
Mr. Nigh stated that the Z series would be the more appropriate system for the County to use, given the
high availability requirements as well as the type of processing conducted. He knows of no operation as
large as Cook County that operates on an I Series system. Main frame technology has evolved in recent
years, and many of those organizations that have been operating on the I Series are converting back to
main frame technology.

4503

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 4, 2007
Commissioner Moreno inquired as to when Mr. Hylton will be reviewing alternative platforms that might
yield cost savings.
Mr. Hylton replied that the contract with IBM consists of three 12-month options. He further stated that in
the first quarter of 2008 he will submit a proposal to the Board for funding and approval to assess how
much it will cost to do a comprehensive study.
Commissioner Peraica inquired of Stanley A. Molis, Director, Department for Management of
Information Systems, how many professionals in the IT Department work with the I Series.
Mr. Molis replied several.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to whether Mr. Molis believes that the County would do better using
an I Series system.
Mr. Molis replied that the I Series system is more appropriate for mid-sized organizations.
Commissioner Peraica urged against converting to an I Series system.
Commissioner Daley stated that it is highly unusual to have a private company such as PIR Group
Corporation, which might have a vested interest, commenting on a contract such as this. He is not sure
from where funding for a study would come. This item should be passed.
Chairman Beavers asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speaker.
1)

Christian Schneider – PIR Group Corporation

Vice Chairman Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved to approve Communication
No. 289806. The motion carried unanimously.
290359

RECORDER OF DEEDS, Eugene “Gene” Moore, transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with ACS
Government Records Management, Dallas, Texas, to provide the upgrade for the
hardware storage area network. The current network has reached the maximum storage
limit.
Reason:

As the developer of the software ACS Government Records Management
(ASC) is uniquely qualified to provide the services and configure 40 terra
bytes redundant storage area network with upgrade software integration for
the cashiering database cluster.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $648,618.00. Contract period: October 1, 2007 through
September 30, 2008. (527-579 Account). Requisition No. 75270046.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2007 funds.

4504

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 4, 2007
The Chief Information Officer has reviewed this item and concurs with this
recommendation.
*Referred to the Committee on Information Technology & Automation on
November 6, 2007.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether the cashiering program that was purchased in recent years
contains a database.
Darlena Williams Burnett, Deputy Chief Recorder, Office of Cook County Recorder of Deeds, replied in
the negative.
Commissioner Schneider inquired whether the Z Series can store this information.
Ms. Burnett stated that the Recorder of Deeds Office operates on the Citrix system. She further stated
that this technology is the best technology for an office that maintains a database of this quantity.
Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Commissioner Schneider, moved to defer Communication No.
290359. The motion carried unanimously.
290360

BUREAU OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND AUTOMATION, by Antonio
Hylton, Chief Information Officer, transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $1,815,000.00 and
extend from December 1, 2007 through November 30, 2008, Contract No. 05-41-651
with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Chicago, Illinois, for Phase 3
of a state-of-the-art interoperable mobile video and data network system for first
responders for the Homeland Security Public Safety initiative, as part of the Homeland
Security grant.
Reason:

As a result of the existing U.S. Department of Homeland Security funding
regulations, the current maintenance coverage ends November 30, 2007.
This extension of time and contract amount will cover the maintenance that
is needed for the Project Shield installed equipment between the period of
December 1, 2007 and the award and implementation of the Phase 3 contract.
The expiration date of the current contract is November 30, 2007.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant funded amount: $1,815,000.00. Contract
extension: December 1, 2007 through November 30, 2008. (769-570 Account).
*Referred to the Committee on Information Technology & Automation on
November 6, 2007.
Vice Chairman Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to approve Communication No.
290360. The motion carried unanimously.
290361

BUREAU OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND AUTOMATION, by Mary Jo
Horace, Deputy Chief Information Officer, transmitting a Communication:

4505

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 4, 2007
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to renew Contract No. 06-45-251 with
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Chicago, Illinois, to provide
Passport Advantage software support, Advanced Datacenter support and Microsoft Data
Center software maintenance for the countywide geographical information systems
(GIS).
Reason:

The software upgrades and subscriptions are only available through the
manufacturer, International Business Machines Corporation and the
Advanced Datacenter software support and maintenance, which are tightly
integrated with the IBM software, require Microsoft certification which IBM
maintains.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $228,244.00. Contract period: January 1, 2008 through
December 31, 2008. (545-441 Account). Requisition No. 85450001.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2008 funds.
The Chief Information Officer has reviewed this item and concurs with this
recommendation.
*Referred to the Committee on Information Technology & Automation on
November 6, 2007.
Vice Chairman Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved the approval of
Communication No. 290361. The motion carried unanimously.

concerning these parcels and their intended use.
Ken Pilota, Esq., Law Offices of Ken Pilota, replied that the Village of Riverdale is acquiring these

VILLAGE OF NORTHLAKE (NO CASH BID REQUEST).
Transmitting a
Communication, dated November 5, 2007 from Deborah Sims, Chairman, Tax
Delinquency Subcommittee, submitting a request from Jeffrey Sherwin, Mayor, Village
of Northlake.
Re:

No Cash Bid Request Package for the Village of Northlake.

I am writing to you on behalf of the residents of the City of Northlake in order to
participate in the Cook County No Cash Bid Program.
The City is seeking to obtain title to a vacant and irregular shaped parcel of property
commonly known as 27 King Arthur Court, Northlake, Illinois, and further described, as
follows:
Volume: 070

PIN:

12-30-402-039-0000

It is the intent of the City, as part of its overall economic redevelopment program, to
acquire this underutilized property and redevelop it into an economically beneficial use to
the citizens of the City. Acquisition of this property by the City will also serve to
eliminate its current blighted use while simultaneously strengthening ongoing City efforts
to enhance the value of all property in the area surrounding this parcel.

4509

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 4, 2007
Please be advised that the City’s request package contains one permanent index number
and that no third party requester is associated with the application. The City has secured
legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and is prepared to assume all cost associated in the
acquisition process. The City agrees to adhere to the Cook County Office of Economic
Development, No Cash Bid Report form requirements documenting the status of the
property for a period of five years or until development is complete.
*Referred to the Tax Delinquency Subcommittee on November 6, 2007.
Commissioner Peraica requested that a representative of Northlake deliver a status update in regards to
the above PIN.
P. Joseph Montana, Attorney at Law, Odelson & Sterk, Ltd., representing the Village of Northlake,
delivered the following status update: These parcels are in the King Arthur Court Condominium and
Apartment Complex. The Village of Northlake has been using CDBG money to repair the sewers and
water mains in the area and to repair the streets. They would like to pave the area and alleviate parking
problems. Over the next five-to-ten years, as the rest of the buildings are converted into condominiums,
the Village of Northlake would sell these properties to the condominium association so that these
properties could be used for parking purposes. It is the goal of the Village of Northlake to clean up these
properties, pave them, and maintain them with the goal of returning them to the tax rolls.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether this parcel is in a residential area.
Mr. Montana replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved the approval of Communication
No. 290376. The motion carried unanimously.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 4, 2007
Commissioner Peraica inquired of Linda Granderson, Deputy Commissioner, Department of Planning and
Development Real Estate, City of Chicago, where the parcels are located.
Ms. Granderson stated that these properties are located throughout the City of Chicago. She further stated
that the City of Chicago submitted to Chairman Sims a memo which stated the intended use for each
parcel.
Chairman Sims inquired whether the City of Chicago will still need some of these parcels in order for
development to take place. She further inquired as to what happened to the parcels that are not being
recommended.
Ms. Granderson replied that the City of Chicago received a report from the Cook County Department of
Planning and Economic Development that included due diligence work stating that 39 PINs were not on
the preliminary list, and 13 or 14 PINs did not have a title commitment. Stephanie Milito, Planner,
Department of Planning and Economic Development, informed the City of Chicago that only two PINs
on the list were eligible. There were also occupied structures that the Department of Planning and
Development Real Estate, City of Chicago, should not have submitted.
Ms. Milito stated that the Department of Planning and Economic Development’s due diligence consists of
reviewing photos, descriptions, sidwells and title reports. Some of these PINs were incomplete and some
PINs were not listed in the Ordinance. The cover letter to Chairman Sims states all of the reasons that the
Department of Planning and Economic Development recommends or does not recommend these PINs.
Cross-checking was done utilizing the Treasurers’ List, which was published after the City of Chicago
submitted its application. The Department of Planning and Economic Development works with the
Treasurer’s Office and the City of Chicago to prevent sale in errors, mainly based on property that is
currently City-owned, and/or tax exempt or has some other issue. One PIN actually is part of the Cook
County Forest Preserve District; they will work with the Treasurer to determine whether it will be a sale
in error.
Chairman Sims stated in a conversation with the Treasurer, the Treasurer indicated that she is going to go
through the list, scrub it and fix it, and will also do so for future lists.
Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved the approval of Communication
Number 290378 as amended, (all PIN Numbers were withdrawn except for 20-03-309-017-0000, 2525-210-049-0000, 20-33-306-060-0000, 16-10-331-034-0000, 16-22-224-007-0000, 20-03-402-0020000, 20-18-309-019-0000, 25-16-328-009-0000, 16-11-211-027-0000 and 16-23-313-021-0000). The
motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Peraica moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Murphy. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

*Referred to the Committee on Workforce, Job Development & Training Opportunities
on 11/06/07.
Chairman Collins stated that the Re-Entry Employment Incentive program provides an incentive for those
persons with contracts with the County of Cook to hire ex-offenders and hardcore unemployables. One
serious problem is that Cook County Jail and the correctional systems become revolving doors for many
ex-offenders. President Stroger basically led the initiative to come up with a program that would allow
ex-offenders job training and the opportunity to make an honest living.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 4, 2007
Alvin Rider, Chief of Community Affairs, Public Defender’s Office, stated that the program would allow
for incentives to be given to construction companies that do business with the County of Cook to hire
men and women with criminal backgrounds. The companies will get an earned credit of ½% to 1% to
employ or train ex-offenders. Also, a committee would be put together with seven (7) representatives
from the Bureau of Human Resources, Capital Planning and Policy, President’s Office of Employment
Training (P.O.E.T), Contract Compliance Office, Non-for-Profit Organization, and President Stroger
would select two (2) representatives from the labor unions. The Office of President Stroger and his staff
are working in partnership with Kennedy King College/Dawson Technical Institute to facilitate classes in
plumbing and electrical training for fourteen weeks.
Commissioner Sims inquired as to the selection of applicants, and how are they appointed.
Commissioner Sims further asked if the ordinance language will stipulate that “one of the appointments
come from a representative of the Cook County Board of Commissioner’s Office and one from an outside
source”.
Mr. Rider stated that President Stroger will appoint a member of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners and select qualified candidates from the pool of applicants in the pilot program.

*Referred to the Committee on Workforce, Job Development & Training Opportunities
on 11/20/07.
Chairman Collins asked Karen S. Crawford, President’s Office of Employment Training (P.O.E.T.),
Administrator, for an overview of the program.
Karen S. Crawford, Director of the President’s Office of Employment Training stated that the Workforce
Investment Act (WIA) has over a couple of generations evolved into the Workforce Act. It started in
1962 as the Manpower Development Training Act. It later became the Comprehensive Employment
Training Act (CEDA) in 1973, and then became the Job Training Partnership Act in 1982, which later
became the Workforce Investment Act of 1998.
The Job Training Act started as a national incentive in 1962 as part of the government’s response to
increased automation and the development of technology. The program was later designed to help lowincome citizens obtain entry-level jobs in the labor force. The Department of Labor actually sets policy
for the Workforce Investment Act funding and distributes funds directly to the State. The State gives the
funds to local areas in Illinois. There are twenty-six workforce areas which represent south and westsuburban Cook County.
The local area requires that there is a chief elected official, which is President Todd H. Stroger, as the
grant recipient. The Board of Commissioners has legal responsibility for receiving grant funds. The
President’s Office of Employment Training is appointed as the grant administrator by the chief elected
official, so our responsibility is to the Cook County Board and the local workforce investment board. The
chief elected official is also responsible for the appointments to the local Workforce Investment Board
and for administrative oversight.
Chairman Collins asked if the contractors had gotten the information in time to adjust their programs to
comply with the changes.

4522

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 4, 2007
Ms. Crawford stated that the County Board approved receipt of a technical assistant grant from the State
of Illinois. The State provided mandatory performance training to all of the providers. In addition to the
one-stop service delivery system, we provided on going technical assistance to the agencies currently
working in the program. In the past our performance was graded on increasing people’s wages. So if a
participant returned to President’s Office of Employment Training without employment and left the
system in an entry-level position or minimum-wage job the reality is under common measures and
negotiated wages we met our performance. It doesn’t matter what the participant made before they came
into the system. What matters is when they leave the system you are securing them wages that met a
minimum wage of eleven dollars and forty cent for adults and fourteen dollars and fifty cents for
dislocated workers.
Commissioners Sims voiced concern regarding agencies working with individuals that are not high school
graduates and individuals without a General Equivalency Diploma.
Ms. Crawford stated under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) the General Equivalency Diploma
programs are allowed and people can do training in a six-month program.
Vice Chairman Schneider asked whether the administrators are providing a service and interacting with
the clients.
Ms. Crawford replied in the affirmative.
Chairman Collins asked how many agencies are prepared to do the skilled training of the participants
going out into the labor force.
Ms. Crawford responded that part of President’s Office of Employment Training responsibility was to
look at the agencies that could actually perform the service and evaluate proposals based on this. The
recommendation is for an agency which has committed to facilitating skilled training or training for
people to get employment at the performance level.
Chairman Collins asked for the number of agencies and agencies with equipment for training.
Ms. Crawford responded there are thirty-nine providers. She further stated that she recognizes that the
provider agency does not necessarily have to do the actual training. The provider agency has a client to
come for services and the provider agency refers the client to a junior college or another program if they
are training-suitable.
Commissioner Sims asked how the provider agencies get their certification.
Ms. Crawford replied the provider agencies go before the State Board of Education for certification.
Commissioner Sims asked about the provider agencies forming collaboration to get more funding dollars.
Ms. Crawford replied if one provider agency decides to collaborate the responsibility lays with the
agencies. The President’s Office of Employment Training provides the funding for recruiting, training
and placing. The training the provider agency offers collaborates with the other provider agency or
whoever they reasonably procure to do the services.
Commissioner Sims asked why the provider agencies were offered less funding when they were requested
to provide more manufacturing positions in a Request for Proposal.

4523

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 4, 2007
The local workforce investment board represents members of the business community as well as
mandated partners, education and trade. They are responsible for setting the strategy to supply the skilled
workforce in suburban Cook County. They are responsible for the workforce investment program
oversight and for making funding recommendations to service providers.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to the effectiveness of the Oversight Committee.
Ms. Crawford replied the Oversight Board has been very effective.
Commissioner Peraica commented on the lack of labor unions reaching out to minorities, African
Americans and Hispanics in specialized trades.
Ms. Crawford replied fifty-one percent of the grant monies are geared toward low-income residents of
south and west-suburban Cook. It is unfortunate the demographics of those areas identify those
individuals as minorities.
Mr. Albert Pritchett, Chairman of the Workforce Investment Board, stated we have the responsibility to
get jobs and training for people. I had hoped for them to add the Section 8 to Cook County which truly
should happen. The purpose of the Workforce Investment Board is to get provider agencies willing to
work with us. The State of Illinois has reserved the right to overrule the President’s Office of
Employment Training and the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

PROPOSED CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication from
ROBERT R. SIMON, M.D., Chief, Bureau of Health Services
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Respiratory Health
Association of Metropolitan Chicago (RHAMC), Chicago, Illinois, (previously named the American
Lung Association of Metropolitan Chicago), for the Bureau of Health Services Smoke Free Lung Health
Programs. This is a 5-year initiative utilizing Cook County tobacco tax dollars to reduce the harmful
impacts of tobacco and asthma on the health of Cook County residents.
As Chicago’s lung health leader since 1906, RHAMC is a natural partner for this project. RHAMC has
been actively fighting the asthma and tobacco epidemics within metropolitan Chicago through a wide
range of programmatic efforts. RHAMC has been a leader in the delivery of tobacco cessation services in
the community and training of individuals to deliver tobacco cessation. RHAMC participates in or leads
numerous local asthma initiatives in Cook County, including: Addressing Asthma in Englewood;
Controlling Pediatric Asthma through Collaboration and Education; and the Stakeholders Collaboration to
Improve Student Health.
An estimated 690,000 adults in Cook County over 24 years of age smoke cigarettes, with increased rates
among individuals in the lowest socio-economic strata. Research indicates that cessation programs
directed at smokers in in-patient, out-patient, and community settings are effective in reducing smokingrelated morbidity and mortality, and they are cost-effective because they reduce the burden of tobaccorelated illness upon the community and the County.

4539

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 4, 2007
The rates of asthma and hospitalizations due to asthma in Cook County and Illinois are reported as nearly
double the national rates, especially among African-American and Puerto Rican communities. National
and local studies have shown improved childhood asthma outcomes can be achieved through education
delivered by health care organizations and Community Health Educators.
Program Outcomes Over 5 Years

clinic/community-based tobacco cessation counseling interventions in Cook County clinics or other
community sites.
15,000 new contacts by people calling the Illinois Quitline and subsidized nicotine replacement
therapy for 11,400 people, through the tobacco cessation media campaign.
13,000 smoking quits reported among program participants.
Among Cook County Bureau of Health Services patients, decreased smoking rates, increased quit
attempts, and increased use of aids to cessation (telephone or group counseling and/or medication).
Asthma self-management education to 3,260 individuals with an 80% program completion rate.
Improve self-management skills, environmental changes or avoidance of asthma triggers and
demonstrate decrease in asthma severity.
Decrease hospitalizations and emergency department visits for asthma by 50% among program
participants.

Program Implementation
The Smoke Free Lung Health Steering Committee will oversee the program. The physician leadership
team from Stroger Hospital of Cook County will direct the Steering Committee, provide organization,
supervision, technical expertise and evaluation support to the program. The Respiratory Health
Association of Metropolitan Chicago (RHAMC) will employ all program staff and assist with their
training and supervision. RHAMC will conduct the media campaign. Thirteen (13) Tobacco and Asthma
Health Educator staff will be hired and trained in phases over the first 18 months of the program. The
media campaign will be conducted in Year 1 and Year 2.
This new contract will supersede a previous three-year contract, Contract No. 06-41-750 with the
American Lung Association of Metropolitan Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, as authorized by the County
Board on September 7, 2006.

DEPARTMENT OF RISK MANAGEMENT
ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS FY 2006
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 20, 2007 from
LISA M. WALIK, Director, Department of Risk Management
Re: Actuarial Analysis FY 2006
The Department of Risk Management respectfully submits a copy of the Actuarial Analysis for the fiscal
year ending November 30 2006, prepared by ARM Tech, a subsidiary of Aon Corporation. I am
requesting that the report be referred to the Audit Committee for further consideration.

OFFICE OF THE SHERIFF
APPROVAL OF PAYMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 6, 2007 from
THOMAS J. DART, Sheriff of Cook County
by
THOMAS K. DONAHUE, Executive Director, Chicago HIDTA
requesting approval of payment in the amount of $26,409.61 to Canon Business Solutions, Schaumburg,
Illinois, for maintenance and overage charges for the period of January 30, 2005 through July 19, 2007.
Reason:

This copier was purchased with HIDTA funds and does not fall under the countywide
maintenance contract. The office was unaware that the 2005 unpaid charges existed and that
the office was operating without a 2007 contract. This situation recently came to light when
the office was refused service and informed of these outstanding charges.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant funded amount: $26,409.61. (655-440 Account).

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Quigley, moved that the communication be

CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication from
JOHNNY C. BROWN, Chief Operating Officer, Stroger Hospital of Cook County
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with the University of Illinois at
Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, for neuropathologist consulting services for the Department of Pathology.
Reason:

The University of Illinois at Chicago will provide neuropathologist consulting services on a
rotating basis (0.5 FTE) to interpret neuropathology frozen sections during neurosurgical
operative procedures, permanent section analysis and final diagnosis. While these services
are essential in providing the patients with real time diagnostic services, the need for a full
time physician is not required. Placing this service on a contract rather than employing is a
significant savings to the hospital. In addition, this agreement will allow for resident and
fellow training programs in pathology and neurology. The expiration date of the current
contract was November 30, 2007.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $105,000.00. Contract period: December 1, 2007 through November 30, 2008.
(897-272 Account). Requisition No. 88970034.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2008 funds.

Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the County Purchasing Agent be

OFFICE OF THE COUNTY TREASURER
CONTRACT ADDENDUM
Transmitting a Communication from
MARIA PAPPAS, Cook County Treasurer
by
MICHAEL J. SHINE, Chief Deputy Treasurer
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to extend for one (1) two (2) years, Contract No. 03-42465 with Optical Image Technology, Inc., State College, Pennsylvania, to provide a document
management system (imaging).
Reason:

The request is to continue DocFinity support for the software the Treasurer’s Office uses to
scan and process refund applications and support other critical office processes. Only
DocFinity supports and updates its proprietary software. This will insure this critical software
continues to function as Microsoft patches its operating system software and that critical bugs
are fixed. Not continuing this contract puts the ability of the Treasurer’s Office to process
refunds in a timely manner at risk. The expiration date of the current contract was November
30, 2007.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract extension: December 1, 2007 through November 30, 2009.
_________________________
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the request of the Chief Deputy
Treasurer be approved, as amended and that the County Purchasing Agent be authorized to extend the
