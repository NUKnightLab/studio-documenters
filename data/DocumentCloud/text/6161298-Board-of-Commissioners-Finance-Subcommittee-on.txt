financial burden of approximately ten million dollars for the cost of, including but

and
WHEREAS, we can no longer afford to pay the cost for unfair employment

political influence and ensure greater transparency and public trust.

Board of Commissioners create an ad hoc committee made up of one

Commissioner from the Finance Committee and representatives from the

Resources, Cook County Recorder of Deeds and industrial engineers, to retrieve
information from all departments on current expenditures pertaining to the cost
associated with remaining under the Shakman Decree, including but not limited to
monitoring, lawsuit payouts, cost of investigations, staffing and salaries.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the ad hoc committee conduct an in-house
feasibility study for the following: (1) cost analysis of entering into an agreement
with an independent recruiting agency either on an as needed basis or
contractually, (2) comparative analysis of the cost of hiring an independent
recruiting agency verses the cost of remaining under the Shakman consent
decree, and (3) an estimate of future workforce needs taking into account
retirement, budgetary constraints, and other factors that influence the size of the
workforce. The findings from the feasibility study shall be tendered to the Cook
County Board of Commissioners no later than September 1, 2010.
