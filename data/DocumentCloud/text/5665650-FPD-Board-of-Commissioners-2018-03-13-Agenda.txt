Request: Receive and File
Report Title:

Walking Green: Developing an Evidence-base for Nature Prescriptions in the Forest

Preserve District of Cook County
Report Period: July 2015 - January 2018
Summary:

principal

Dr. Teresa Horton, Department of Anthropology at Northwestern University, was the
investigator

for

the

study

“Walking

Green:

Developing

an

Evidence-base

for

Nature

Prescriptions.” The study was partially funded by the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (the
“Forest Preserves”) and compares the health effects of walking in the Forest Preserves property as
compared to walking on a suburban sidewalk.
The purpose of the study was to gather data essential for the development of nature prescriptions, which
can be recommended by doctors to patients to encourage them to get outdoors, connect to nature, enjoy,
and support the Forest Preserves. The study demonstrates that the benefits of exercising in nature exceed
those of an equivalent amount of exercise in other conditions, such as walking on a suburban sidewalk.

The study also shows that there are significant mental health benefits including improved mood, reduced
anxiety, and reductions in perceived stress that can be gained from taking a 50-minute walk on a Forest
Preserve trail.
This study advances the Forest Preserves’ Next Century Conservation Plan’s priority to provide programs
that emphasize health benefits and inspire the people of and visitors to Cook County to seek out the Forest
Preserves for discovery, renewal, and fun.

services for Phase 1 Engineering Services to identify and complete preliminary design of an acceptable
solution over, under or across the Union Pacific Railroad for Forest Preserves’ Des Plaines River Trail

subcontractors and capacity to do the work.
The Forest Preserves has been awarded a grant from the Cook County Department of Transportation and
Highways through the Invest in Cook program in the amount of $100,000.00 for engineering services. The
Invest in Cook program helps cover the cost of planning and feasibility studies, engineering right-of-way
