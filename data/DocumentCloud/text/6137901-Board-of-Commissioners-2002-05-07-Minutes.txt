The Assessor's Office is in the midst of completing the first year of mailing and processing a
new combined exemption booklet. In the past, reminder notices have been sent to taxpayers
not responding to initial exemption mailings. Because initial mail delivery problems may
have caused a delay in the receipt of booklets for some taxpayers who might have otherwise
responded, the additional amount requested will allow the printing of additional reminder
notices to make certain that all taxpayers receive appropriate information.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $28,000.00. (040-240 Account).
A poll of the Cook County Board of Commissioners has been taken and they indicate their concurrence.

 JO URNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 7, 2002

SECTION 3
Your Committee has considered the following item and upon the adoption of this report the
recommendatio n is as follows:
RE: Proposed rezonings pursuant to adopted Cook County Comprehens ive Land Use Plan
Chairman Silvestri reported that the only remaining component of the Board 's commitment and adoption
of the new Comprehensive Land Use Plan and Zoning Ordinance is consideration of 13 proposed
rezonings in seven townships.
Please review the attached list of sites listing the township, general location of the site, zoning under our
prior ordinance and the proposed zoning pursuant to the adopted Land Use Plan and Zoning O rdinance.
You will also note the ZBA pos ition, w hich is their initial opinion, and "Comments," which is a
perfunctory reason for the change.
In order to complete this remaining item, I believe the fo llowing should occur:

Items l, 2
These s ites are s ubj ect to annexation, e ither pending or completed. No action is necessary except to
receive and file the information in committee.
Items 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
These s ites are mobile home parks. T he adopted ordinance class ifies these types of residentia l areas to be
in R-6, R-7, or R-8 zones, s ubject to special-use req uirements. They are not a permitted use in any zone.
(U nder the prior o rdinance, mobile home parks were allowed as special uses in R-7, C-6, and C-8 zoning
districts, resulti ng in these residences often being placed near business or factory use areas.)
These sites should be referred to the Zoning Board of Appeals to conduct hearings in the respective
townsh ips to consider and review their zoning in li ght of the adopted ordinance.

Items 5, 6, 8
The new zon ing ordinance provides a new " public" classification for public or open land uses. Item 5 is a
county maintenance facility. Items 6 and 8 are the result of public hearings regarding the Comprehens ive
Land Use Plan and are the res ult of municipal requests.
Items 5, 6, and 8 s hould be referred to the Zoning Board of A ppeals for hearings to consider changes in
zoning pursuant to the Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
