Report from Chief Quality Officer (continued)
B. Metrics (Attachment #2)
Dr. Wyatt provided an overview of the metrics. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Additionally, he provided a sample of the draft dashboard of metrics that is currently being created and
refined (included in Attachment #2).
During the discussion of the Stroger Hospital safety measure on falls with injury, Director Driscoll
inquired whether root cause analyses are done when these occur. Dr. Wyatt responded that he was not
certain, but will take a closer look at that.
During the review of the draft dashboard, Director Driscoll requested that when the Committee receives
this type of safety information, they should also receive information on what the organization is doing to
move towards zero events occurring. Information should include whether root cause analyses have been
done and the outcomes of those analyses, and what the corrective action plan is.
During the review of the measure on Depression Screening Referral Management, it was noted that the
graph will be revised to a more reader-friendly version.
Director Driscoll requested that, from time to time, the Committee receive a deeper dive into the major
quality initiatives of the different clinical departments and other areas. Additionally, she reiterated her
request made at a previous meeting to receive copies of the minutes of the hospitals’ internal quality
committee meetings. Dr. Shannon indicated that he will work to determine the best way to address her
request regarding the internal quality committee meeting minutes.
Director Junge requested that the Committee begin receiving regular reports of quality indicators for the
correctional area. Dr. Shannon noted that the Committee had sporadically received those reports in the
past; at that time, because it involved the subject of litigation, reporting was limited.
Director Suleiman Gonzalez recommended that a schedule and plan for the year be developed for deep
dive presentations as referred to earlier in the meeting by Director Driscoll. Additionally, given that the
organization in the process of completing the activities relating to the survey by representatives of TJC,
the Committee should continue to monitor the status of matters that emerged from the survey until the
Committee sees the progress needed to meet compliance.
