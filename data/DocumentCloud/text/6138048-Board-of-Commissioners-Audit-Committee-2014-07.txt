The Honorable John P. Daley
Chairman, Audit Committee

Cook County Board of Commissioners
118 N. Clark Street

Chicago, IL 60602

Dear Chairman Daley,

Pursuant to the Audit Committee's request, attached is the annual matrix of our audit ?ndings.
The FY-2013 matrix continues to include our corrective actions, when we plan to complete the
corrective action plan, and when the ?nding is eliminated. As noted below, during 
seven audit ?ndings, including one material weakness, were eliminated. Our strategic plan
implemented a number of process improvements that reduced the number of year?end reporting
errors and improved quality controls in the areas where the ?ndings are repeated.

 

Fiscal Year Findings 

2.93. 
Total 4 10 1 1 12
Non-repeated Material Weaknesses 2 3 2 3

The remaining ?ndings will be addressed through implementation of a new ?nancial reporting system
(ERP) as well as additional process improvements.

We are continuing to implement corrective actions because the new system will only be as good as
the information that goes in it and will depend upon users applying best practices. The most critical
corrective action continues to be an updated ERP financial reporting system. The Bureau of Finance
is working with the Bureau of Technology to recommend and select a software vendor during this
?scal year. We plan to begin the implementation of such a system during FY-2015. As a result, the
four remaining ?ndings have targeted completion dates between FY-2014 to FY-2017, with those that
are targeting FY-2017 truly reliant on an updated ERP system. Our goal however, continues to be
improving on our systems and processes in advance of the new system implementation and,
accordingly, to further reduce ?ndings in coming years.

We appreciate the input of the Board of Commissioners in these initiatives, and look forward to
brie?ng you further in the future. Please contact me directly should you have any questions
regarding the Of?ce of the Comptroller's plan to address County audit findings in coming years.
Sincerely, 7%

Lawrence L. Wilson, Comptroller

Chairman John P. Daley, Chairman of the Audit Committee
Cook County Board of Commissioners

118 Clark, Suite 567

Chicago, IL 60602

Honorable Chairman John Daley:

Thank your for your letter dated July 22? We appreciate the ability to address your speci?c
questions regarding the 2013 Independent Audit; our responses follow:

1. Finding 2013-01 states that expenditures within certain Special Purpose Funds are
not properly classi?ed and contain insuf?cient detail. Is providing this detail the
responsibility of the using department, or the Budget Department? Please explain.

Special Purpose Funds are used to account for the proceeds of specific revenue sources that are
restricted or committed to expenditure for specified purposes.

The Budget Department assists departments in developing their budget plan and ensuring items
are budgeted for in the proper accounts but the department is responsible for the special
purpose fund and is responsible for maintaining detailed information on transactions throughout
the year.

Each department/agency that has a special purpose fund is responsible for ensuring that:

0 Expenditures in these funds meet the Fund?s purpose restrictions;
0 They maintain sufficient detail supporting any transactions that take place in that fund and
to ensure proper accounting treatment and record keeping. The Budget Department may
request detailed transactional information on an as needed basis.
0 The Comptroller?s Of?ce will assist the using agencies Budget on the proper accounting
treatment for financial reporting purposes.

Please note that Commissioner Fritchey recently introduced a resolution related to this ?nding.
We will be working with him and the rest of Board regarding the best way to identify and
record the information that would address the finding.

2. Finding 2013-02 describes additional coordination between Risk Management and the
State?s Attorney?s Office to better assess the value of future Workers Compensation
claims. Are additional fraud prevention measures included in this new method for
predicting the cost of future claims?

The issues highlighted in this ?nding were first identi?ed by Risk Management. By the close
of and as reflected in the Management Response, Risk Management had already
taken steps to mitigate the effects of this self-reported issue.

Fiscal Responsibility Innovative Leadership Transparency Accountability Er Improved Services

These steps include:

0 Comprehensive and systematic review ofall cases including determination of case status (open or closed);

Assignment of a Risk Management Adjuster (?Adjuster?) to monitor and manage cases with the State?s Attorney?s
Of?ce;

I A record of all workers compensation claims are now maintained in Risk Management Department?s electronic
claims system; and

0 Risk Management and the State?s Attorney?s Of?ce are engaged in on-going efforts to review outstanding claims
and establish appropriate indemnity and medical reserves.

As the claims are managed, any indication of fraudulent activity is appropriately documented in the claim ?le which is
shared between the Adjuster and assigned Assistant State?s Attorney. Response to fraud is also included in the Workers
Compensation Policies and Procedures Manual, ?rst prepared by Risk Management in October 2013. This document is in
the process of being updated to include additional process and documentation requirements between Risk Management
and the State?s Attorney?s Of?ce. In 2015, an integrated Risk Management Information System will allow both Risk
Management and the State?s Attorney?s Office to review claims for trends and other additional analysis that will further

our efforts in regards to continued fraud prevention measures.

3. Finding 2013-03 involves a long standing problem of capital asset tracking and inventory. Will the
implementation of a new ERP system solve this repeated problem, and what is the target date for ?nal go-live

of the new 

Yes, implementation of a new ERP system, along with process improvements including County?wide uniformity and
physical inventory surveys, will establish an ef?cient and fully functioning capital asset accounting, inventory and
reporting process that will solve the capital asset tracking and inventory ?nding. We plan to implement initial modules of
a new ERP system during ?scal year 2017; however we will also be working to address some of the process
improvements in advance of that date. We do not anticipate that a new ERP system will in of itself solve this repeat
?nding, however we will be working on process improvements to ensure that when the Capital Assets Module of a new
ERP system is rolled out that the ?nding is addressed and removed .

As a further response to your question regarding our response to the ?ndings identi?ed by the independent auditor, please
?nd a matrix of ?ndings related to the 2012 ?ndings that were removed and our targeted plan to remove and address the
four remaining findings through a multi?year plan. Please contact myself or Lawrence Wilson should you require any
additional information on any of these matters.
