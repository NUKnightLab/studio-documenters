DCFS requesting approval of an agreement amendment with Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court to extend
time from 4/1/19-3/31/20 for $0.00.
Original Agreement – BC2018-206 for $205,000.00 4/1/18-3/31/19
Juvenile Court will provide a daily community-based treatment program alternative for youth who are
displaying behavioral and/or mental health challenges in the home environment and the community.
Youth are referred to the CBIC program by DCFS. Youth referred will be actively involved with the court
and will be under the supervision of a court probation or home detention officer during their stay in the
CBIC program. All youth referred will be identified as moderate to high risk on the Ohio Youth Assessment
System (OYAS) Dispositional Tool.
Two tracks are available, full-day and half-day, to allow for treatment programming options to best meet
the needs of the youth. The “dosage” or intensity level is based on the youth risk level and protective
factors and will be identified at the time of referral.
29

 CBIC Full-Day Program – This track is for youth who are moderate to high risk to re-offend and are not
engaged in an educational setting. These youth may be disenrolled due to non-attendance or expulsion.
Youth will be picked up from home beginning at 8:00 a.m. and will be dropped off at home by 8:00 p.m.
CBIC Half-Day Program – This track is utilized by youth who are moderate to high risk to re-offend and
actively engaged in their educational program. This schedule does not disrupt youths’ current school
setting and preserves the protective factor of education.
Saturday Program – The Saturday program option may be included in either the full-day or half-day
program for youth who need additional support and supervision and who do not have weekend protective
factors in place. Youth will be picked up from home beginning at 8:00 a.m. Transportation home is not
provided on Saturdays. The youth will be provided RTA bus passes or will be picked up by their
parent/guardian.
Youth will be picked up from school after dismissal and will be dropped off at home by 8:00 p.m.
The anticipated start-completion dates are 4/1/19-3/31/20
The primary goals of the project are:
85% of youth admitted to the program will successfully complete the program, as demonstrated by
completion of all program modules.
75% of youth participants will remain in a community setting during the 12 months post termination from
the program.
75% of youth will not re-offend within 12 months after successful program completion of the program.
75% of youth admitted to the program will demonstrate a reduction in their criminal thinking at the time
of discharge, as measured by pre and post Criminal Sentiment Scale scores.
In previous years, Applewood held the contract. Their rates became too high, so Juvenile Court stepped
in and offered to run the CBIC in-house. They established the CBIC at a much more reasonable rate.
