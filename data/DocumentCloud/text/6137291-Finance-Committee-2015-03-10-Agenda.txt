authorized facsimile signature of the Secretary of the District.
In case any of?cer whose signature, or a facsimile of whose signature, shall appear on any Bond shall cease
to hold such of?ce before the issuance of the Bond, such Bond shall nevertheless be valid and suf?cient for
all purposes, the same as if the person whose signature, or a facsimile thereof, appears on such Bond had not
ceased to hold such of?ce. Any Bond may be signed, countersigned, sealed or attested on behalf of the
District by any person who, on the date of such act, shall hold the proper of?ce, notwithstanding that at the
date of such Bond such person may not have held such of?ce. No recourse shall be had for the payment of

any Bonds against any of?cer who executes the Bonds.

Each Bond shall bear thereon a certi?cate of authentication executed manually by the bond registrar. No
Bond shall be entitled to any right or bene?t under this ordinance or shall be valid or obligatory for any

amount, series, maturity and interest rate as the surrendered Bond. The Bonds, upon surrender thereof at

duly executed by the registered owner or his attorney duly authorized in writing, may be exchanged for an
equal aggregate principal amount of Bonds of the same series, maturity and interest rate and of the
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof.

For every such exchange or registration of transfer of Bonds, the District or the bond registrar may make a
charge suf?cient for the reimbursement of any tax, fee or other governmental charge required to be paid
with respect to such exchange or transfer, which sum or sums shall be paid by the person requesting such

exchange or transfer as a condition precedent to the exercise of the privilege of making such exchange or

Page 19 of 38

provisions of the Illinois Bond Replacement Act, 30 Illinois Compiled Statutes 315, shall govern the

replacement of lost, destroyed or defaced Bonds.

registered upon the registration books as the absolute owner of such Bond, whether such Bond shall be
overdue or not, for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal of, redemption
premium, if any, or interest thereon and for all other purposes whatsoever, and all such payments so made to
any such registered owner or upon his order shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability
upon such Bond to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, and neither the District nor the bond registrar shall

be affected by any notice to the contrary.

Limitation Law, 35 Illinois Compiled Statutes 200/ 18-1 85 through 18-245. The District covenants that it
will not issue any bonds, notes or other obligations if the issuance thereof would cause the anticipated tax
extension for any tax levy year for limited bonds of the District to exceed the debt service extension base of
the District less the amount in items and of the applicable de?nition of ?aggregate extension?
contained in the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law, for non-referendum obligations, except
obligations initially issued pursuant to referendum.

principal of and interest on the Limited Tax Bonds. The Limited Tax Bonds shall be direct and general

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

AUTHORIZING THE CHICAGO BOTANIC GARDEN TO INCREASE SEASONAL PARKING

Cook County; and

WHEREAS, in 2005, the Garden attracted a total of 697,000 guests; and

WHEREAS, in 2014, attendance at the Garden surpassed the one-million-visit?benchmark with
1,058,000 Visits, an increase of 6% over 2013 and a 52% increase since 2005; and

WHEREAS, although the number of guests have increased, the Garden has never charged an admission
fee; and

WHEREAS, the Garden is one of the only major cultural institutions in the Chicagoland area to not
charge an admission fee; and

WHEREAS, while the Garden is extremely proud of the increased attendance numbers, this success
frequently becomes a detriment to the visitor experience and Garden-wide commitment to outstanding
customer service; and

WHEREAS, weekend visitorship has increased, guests waiting to enter the garden experience 
delays and the Garden?s 1,200 parking spaces are quickly ?lled; and

WHEREAS, in an effort to meet this challenge and encourage guests to visit the Garden on days other
than weekends the Garden requests support for a seasonal parking rate increase of $5.00 for
non-members on the weekends and holidays from April 1st through October 31st; and

WHEREAS, members of the Garden do not pay a parking fee; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of the Cook County
Forest Preserve District authorizes the Chicago Botanic Garden to increase its parking fee for

Non-Members by $5.00 on weekends and holidays from April to October 3 lst.
