OFFICE OF THE CHIEF JUDGE
GRANT APPLICATION
Transmitting a Communication, dated December 12, 2006 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization to apply for a grant in the amount of $200,000.00 from the U.S. Department of
Justice, Office of Justice Programs. This grant would expand funding for gender-responsive treatment
services to felony offenders that have significant mental illness and substance abuse disorders which are
referred to the court’s Mental Health Treatment Court.
In April 2004, the Circuit Court of Cook County launched the Mental Health Treatment Court pilot
program in the Criminal Division to enhance court supervision of mentally ill offenders by improving the
delivery of mental health care. The ultimate goal of the program is to reduce incarceration of mentally ill,
nonviolent felony offenders. In its first two years of operation, the program has received 124 referrals
and has 44 active participants, both male and female. Most participants have substance abuse disorders in
addition to chronic mental illness and other health concerns, such as positive tests for HIV. Early
program results are encouraging, with recidivism for participants substantially reduced. The grant funds
will be used to increase the participant capacity of the program by an additional 25 offenders, or 75 per
year.
Funding for this program would be effective for a two-year period beginning in early 2007. The grant
requires an in-kind match of $55,180.00 in the first year and $57,832.00 in the second year which is
provided in the form of contributions of time from existing staff.
The Budget Department has reviewed this item, and all requisite documents have been submitted.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award: $200,000.00. Funding period: March 1, 2007 through
February 28, 2009.

283653

OFFICE OF THE STATE’S ATTORNEY, by Dennis Manzke, Chief of the Administrative
Services Bureau, transmitting a Communication, dated November 28, 2006:
requesting authorization to renew a grant in the amount of $1,207,856.00 from the Illinois
Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA). This grant provides continued and
combined funding for the Complex Drug Prosecutions Initiative as well as the West Suburban
Expansion Program. The Complex Drug Prosecutions Initiative focuses on implementing
strategies that have proven to be effective in combating drug enterprises and networks
operating in the city and suburban Cook County. This program initially funds the salaries of
ten (10) assistant state’s attorneys, seven (7) investigators, three (3) administrative assistants
and two (2) support positions. However, due to a reduction in grant funding, after one (1)
month, three (3) investigators and all five (5) support staff will be taken off the grant leaving ten (10) Assistant State’s Attorneys and four (4) investigators.
This grant requires the office match one dollar for every three dollars of federal funding. The
match commitment for this program is a cash match and covers a portion of the salaries, all of
the grant- funded personnel fringe benefits and the independent audit.
The authorization to accept the previous grant was given on February 15, 2006 by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners in the amount of $825,542.00 with a cash match of
$287,872.00.
The Budget Department has reviewed this item, and all requisite documents have been
submitted.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $403,702.00 (Required Match: $402,619.00 and Over Match:
$1,083.00). (250-818 Account). Grant Award: $1,207,856.00. Funding period: October 1,
2006 through September 30, 2007.
*Referred to the Committee on Finance on 12/19/06.

Room, Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following item and, upon adoption of this report, the
recommendation is as follows:

445

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 9, 2007
283662

COOK COUNTY CLERK, David Orr, by Clem Balanoff, Director of Elections,
transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with
CATALYST CONSULTING GROUP, INC., Chicago, Illinois, to provide database
assistance, programming support, and IT infrastructure support services.
Reason:

Catalyst Consulting Group, Inc. has worked with the Cook County Clerk’s
office for over three years and developed the www.voterinfonet.com and
www.cookctyclerk.com websites. The company has gained a thorough
understanding of the general operation and the special information technology
needs of the Elections Division. Catalyst Consulting Group, Inc. is familiar
with the office’s hardware and software and its special security and
redundancy requirements.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $98,580.00. Contract period: December 1, 2006 through
November 30, 2007. (524-260 Account). Requisition No. 75240009.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2007 funds.
*Referred to the Committee on Information Technology and Automation on
December 19, 2006.
Brandon Neese delivered the following remarks: This contract pertains to day-to-day operations in the
Election Division of the County Clerk’s Office. The vendor, Catalyst Consulting Group, Inc., has worked
with the County since 2002. Their technology currently supports the voter registration application
system, additional applications, and the Local Area Network. Catalyst Consulting Group, Inc. also hosts,
designs and maintains the County’s Voter Infonet website and the cookctyclerk website.
Chairman Beavers stated that he was under the impression that there would be a representative from the
company that supplied the County with its newest election equipment, and that this representative would
be providing an explanation as to the recent malfunctioning of the equipment at election time.
Mr. Neese replied that this contract is a separate issue; it has nothing to do with the tabulation and
transmission of election data.
Commissioner Daley inquired as to what databases the vendor would be working on.
Mr. Neese replied that they would primarily work on the Voter Registration Management System, which
also involves the applications which operate the websites.
Commissioner Daley inquired how the poll sheets are edited to reflect deaths.
Mr. Neese replied that he is provided, on a monthly basis, with death records from the Vital Records
Department the database is adjusted accordingly.
Commissioner Schneider inquired as to what the effects would be if this contract were not approved.

446

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 9, 2007
Mr. Neese replied that given their small information technology staff (only three at the senior level), the
Office of the County Clerk would not operate as efficiently on a day-to-day basis without this contract.
Further, this contract offers a number of enhancements. For example, one of the applications would
significantly improve the search function in the current websites, making these websites more userfriendly for the public. Mr. Neese further stated that working with this vendor would be more costeffective than hiring junior programmers.
Commissioner Steele inquired as to who would maintain these systems after the contract expires.
Mr. Neese replied that he expects maintenance through this vendor to cost approximately $25,000 per
year, as it has historically.
Scott Hilkert, Managing Principal and Chief Operating Officer, Catalyst Consulting Group, Inc., stated
that it is his company’s goal that this technology be self-maintaining. He further stated that the two
information technology professionals in the County Clerk’s Office are being trained to maintain the
technology.
Commissioner Peraica asked when Catalyst Consulting Group, Inc. was formed.
Mr. Hilkert replied that it was formed in 1992.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether this technology would address the issue of lag time in updating
election information on County websites.
Mr. Hilkert replied that the proposed technology would preclude the need for manual transfer of
information into the database, and that this would cut lag time.
At Commissioner Peraica’s request, Brandon Neese agreed to confer with the State’s Attorney’s Office
regarding any investigations they are conducting into voter fraud, and to submit this information to the
Chair.
Commissioner Peraica asked Mr. Hilkert to clarify the enhancements.
Mr. Hilkert clarified that the chief enhancement contained in the contract consists of a “read-only”
election-management system, which would remove much of the strain from the now struggling database.
Geetha Lingham, Information Technology Director, Cook County Clerk’s Office, stated that one of the
major applications being offered by the vendor involves duplicating the database contained in the server
onto a web service. This is a one-time application which the Information Technology Department will be
able to maintain. This application will lead to less down time for the database.
Offering her recommendation of the item, Catherine Maras O’Leary, Chief Information Officer, Bureau
of Information Technology and Automation noted that the proposed technology would integrate well into
the County’s overall information technology structure, and that Department of Office Technology
personnel would be able to perform the necessary maintenance.
Chairman Daley inquired whether eventually these operations will be completely in-house.

447

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 9, 2007
Ms. Maras O’Leary replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Schneider inquired as to what opportunities for cost savings through consolidation exist
pertaining to information technology contracts.
Ms. Maras O’Leary replied that the County is in the first stage of the Portal Project; one of the objectives
of this Project is cost consolidation. Recently, cost consolidations have been achieved with the State’s
Attorney’s Office and also with the Office of the Chief Judge. The Bureau of Information Technology
and Automation reviews items before they are submitted to the Cook County Board, looking for
opportunities for cost saving through consolidation.
Chairman Beavers asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speaker.

FEE-BASED PARKING INITIATIVE
WHEREAS, Cook County government is once again faced with a challenging budget process for
FY2007; and
WHEREAS, one of the tasks of each department and elected official, as well as this government is to
identify and implement new revenue producing measures; and
WHEREAS, new revenue streams will not only aid in reducing the projected $500 million budget deficit,
but also make the goal of presenting a balanced budget without the unattractive alternative of raising taxes
more attainable; and
WHEREAS, currently the County has not implemented fee-based parking for all of its parking lots; and
WHEREAS, creating fee-based parking that would emulate pricing used by similar metropolitan parking
lots would represent a substantial revenue source for the County; and
WHEREAS, the Department of Facilities Management supervises County parking lots and should be
involved in any fee-based parking system planning; and
WHEREAS, the Department of Revenue is in charge of collecting fees for the County and would have
the power to enforce parking violations, and consequently should also take part in planning a fee-based
parking system.

deficit; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 9, 2007
WHEREAS, in the interest of Cook County Government, the employees of the government and the
citizens of the County, it is the desire of this government to consider all ideas to help resolve this crisis
and balance the budget, which is required by State Law; and
WHEREAS, it has been consistently shown that empowering all employees of an organization, be it in
the private or public sector, to participate in employee suggestion programs has yielded tangible results
through generation of ideas for cost saving measures, improved efficiency, process improvements,
identification of new revenue streams and elimination of wasteful spending; and
WHEREAS, meritorious ideas know no boundaries and can be produced by any level of employee in an
organization; and
WHEREAS, active engagement by employees gives an organization a competitive advantage and is
instrumental to its success.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby request the formation of an employee suggestion program enabling all Cook County employees to
