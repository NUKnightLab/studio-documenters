ARTICLE IV. REGULATION OF BUSINESS AND ADVERTISING SIGNS

7

DIVISION 1. GENERALLY

8
9
10
11

Sec. 4-4-1. Purpose.
(a)

The sign regulations of this article are set forth in lieu of those regulations contained

in Appendix H of the 2015 Michigan Building Code, under authority of Section H101.1.1.
(b)

The sign regulations of this article are intended to balance public and private

12

interests. The purpose of this article is to promote provide for a safe, well-maintained, vibrant, and

13

attractive City, while accommodating the protected rights of individuals and entities need for signs

14

to inform, direct, identify, advertise, advocate, promote, endorse, and otherwise communicate

15

information through signs, among multiple alternative channels for communication.

16

regulations contained in this article are narrowly tailored to serve multiple significant

17

governmental interests, including those listed in this section. In furtherance of these significant

18

governmental interests, this article regulates various structural and dimensional standards of signs,

19

including their construction, material, area, height, projection, illumination, location, and spacing,

20

as well as their use and operation in specified locations, but does not regulate the message, content,

21

or communicative aspect of signs, or distinguish between commercial and noncommercial speech.

22

While these regulations allow for a variety of sign types and sizes, they do not necessarily ensure

23

every property owner or business owner's desired level of visibility. It is not the intent or purpose

31
9-30-19

The

 1

of this chapter to regulate the message displayed on any sign or the content. The objectives of this

2

article are:

3

(1)

General protection of public welfare: To ensure that signs are located, designed,

4

constructed, installed, and maintained, in a way that and operated so as to protect

5

protects life, and preserve the public peace, health, morals, safety, and property and

6

the public welfare of the people of the City;

7

(2)

Public safety: To protect public health and safety by prohibiting signs that are

8

structurally unsafe or poorly maintained, or that cause unsafe traffic conditions

9

through distraction of motorists confusion with traffic signs, or hindrance of vision;

10

and that impede safe movement of pedestrians or safe ingress and egress from

11

buildings or sites for nearby pedestrians, motorists, and properties. Signs that are

12

poorly maintained or are otherwise structurally unsound pose physical dangers to

13

the surrounding area and its occupants. Signs, through excessive number, size,

14

illumination, or dynamic operation can create unsafe distractions. Signs can be

15

confused with traffic signals, create unwarranted distractions, impede clear

16

roadway sightlines, or otherwise create unsafe conditions for motorists, bicyclists,

17

pedestrians, and others traveling along the public right-of-way. Signs that overly

18

impact or encroach into public spaces through inappropriate sizing, projection,

19

elevation, or illumination, among other aspects of their construction or operation,

20

can impede the safe circulation of pedestrians, including their safe ingress and

21

egress from buildings and other structures;

22
23

(3)

Protect aesthetic quality of neighborhoods Neighborhood aesthetics and
environment: To Prevent blight and protect aesthetic qualities by preventing visual

32
9-30-19

 1

clutter and protecting views and preventing intrusion of commercial messages into

2

noncommercial areas protect aesthetic values of the City’s neighborhoods and

3

natural environments. The City’s neighborhoods are characterized by their unique

4

residential, commercial, and industrial uses, their architectural themes, and their

5

historic legacies. Signs that do not comport with such unique characteristics can

6

significantly impair the surrounding neighborhood’s aesthetic value. Moreover,

7

many of the City’s neighborhoods contain outdoor public recreational spaces and

8

natural environments. Signs that overly encroach upon such spaces through their

9

construction or operation can significantly impede access to public outdoor

10
11

recreation opportunities and undermine protection of the natural environment;
(4)

Free speech Facilitation of protected speech: To ensure that the constitutionally

12

guaranteed right of free speech is protected and to allow signs as a means of

13

communication facilitate the conveyance of constitutionally protected speech

14

through the use of signs as a means of communication;

15

(5)

Reduce conflict Reduction of conflict: To reduce conflict among signs and light and

16

between public and private information systems reduce the potential for conflict

17

among signs, buildings, and other structures that seek to occupy, utilize, or access

18

limited light, air, and open space resources. Signs that are excessive in size, scale,

19

or intensity can interfere with other signs, thereby impairing their communicative

20

value. Such signs can also interfere with neighboring buildings’ access to air and

21

natural light, and can interfere with their safe operation and the activities of their

22

occupants; and

33
9-30-19

 1

(6)

Business identification and promotion of local commerce: To allow for adequate

2

and effective signage for business identification and other commercial speech, non-

3

commercial speech, and dissemination of public information, including but not

4

limited to, public safety information and notification as may be required by law

5

facilitate the identification of businesses and to promote local commerce at such

6

places of business. Signs that effectively identify the presence of local businesses

7

and that generally promote the products and services provided by such businesses

8

can facilitate commercial activity and stimulate economic development.

9

Additionally, wayfinding and other directional signage can facilitate the efficient

10

flow of vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic. Conversely, signs that are

11

excessive in size, scale, or intensity, or that conflict with each other or their

12

surroundings, can impede such business identification and hinder local economic

13

activity.

structure, such as wall signs and projecting signs, is computed as the difference in

11

vertical elevation between the lowest point of the sign face, including its frame and

12

support structure, if any, but excluding the building or structure to which the sign

13

is affixed and supported, and the established grade of the sign.

14
15

Sec. 4-4-6. Computing the area of business signs.
(a)

The area of a business sign shall be computed as the entire area circumscribed by a

16

parallelogram, triangle, circle, or semicircle, or any combination of these figures, which includes

17

all of the display area, any window sign, as defined in section 4-4-2 of this Code, and any building

18

number that is larger than ten inches in height. Because they are integral to understanding the

19

message of display of a business sign, the blank areas between letters, words, illustrations,

20

graphics, and the like shall be included in the computation of the area of a sign or the area of a

21

message, letter, word, or graphic that is part of a business sign.

22
23

(b)

Where the sign faces of a double-face sign are parallel, or the interior angle formed

by the faces is 45 degrees or less, only one display face shall be counted in computing sign area.

42
9-30-19

 1

Where the two faces of a double-face sign are of unequal area, the area of the sign shall be the area

2

of the larger sign face. In all other cases, the areas of all faces of a multiple-face sign shall be added

3

together to compute the area of the sign.

4

(c)

The height of a business sign shall be the distance between the highest part of the

5

sign and the grade of the nearest sidewalk. REPEALED.

6

Sec. 4-4-6. Computing the measurement of spacing.

7

(1)

Radial spacing between two points is computed as the length of the shortest straight

10

line connecting the perimeters of the premises at which each point is respectively

11

located, drawn without regard to any property lines, rights-of-way, or other

12

features, whether natural or constructed, that such line may cross.

13

(2)

Linear spacing between two points is computed as the length of the shortest line

14

connecting the perimeters of each premises at which each point is respectively

15

located, following the centerline of the right-of-way connecting each premises,

16

without regard, unless expressly stated, to the side of the right-of-way on which

17

each such premises may be located.

Sec. 4-4-7. General restrictions on maximum business sign area.
(a)

Except for businesses regulated under sections 4-4-8(e) and (f) of this Code, each

20

business is entitled to a minimum of 32 square feet of business sign area, regardless of the business'

21

building frontage elevation or street frontage. Except for businesses within developments that

22

require City Council approval of plans, the maximum total area of all business signs for each

23

business shall be the greater of 20 percent of a business' building frontage elevation or one square

24

foot per each linear foot of business street frontage, not to exceed a total of 500 square feet.
43
9-30-19

 1

Buildings or businesses shall be allowed one professionally-prepared window sign not exceeding

2

ten square feet in size and adhered to the inside of the window for every 30 feet of building or

3

storefront width, provided that any such sign shall not require a permit and shall not count toward

4

the maximum allowed sign area. For the purposes of this article, the building frontage elevation is

5

calculated by multiplying the length of the front facade of the building of which the signage is to

6

serve by 13 feet. There can be only one building frontage for each street faced by a building.

7

Portions of facades visible from more than one street, such as those containing curves cylindrical

8

shapes, or angles, shall only be measured once when determining building frontage.

9

(b)

Except as specified in section 4-4-10 of this Code, there is no restriction on the

12

area of the sign or signs does not exceed the maximum business sign area allowed. Roof signs that

13

serve as business signs, and are not otherwise prohibited in section 50-6-52 of this Code, are

14

18

street frontage.

19

(d)

For multiple-tenant, multiple-story buildings where tenants do not have clearly

20

separate building frontage of their own, the 20 percent of building frontage calculation shall be

21

based upon the portion of the building occupied by the respective business.

22
23

(e)

Where multiple buildings are occupied by the same institutional use, as on the

campus of a hospital or educational institution, the permitted business sign area for each building

44

surrounding area, the Entertainment District is structured in multiple zones, such that the most

19

intense signage is contained in the District’s core areas, which are most effectively screened from

20

properties outside of the District. For zones in which signage is anticipated to be more visible

21

from outside the District, signage regulations are relatively more restrictive.

DIVISION 5. REGULATION OF ADVERTISING SIGNS LOCATED IN THE

5

CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT

6

Sec. 4-4-121. Purpose.

7

The Central Business District is characterized by a degree of density, height, scale, and

8

diversity in the built environment, a concentration of historic and otherwise architecturally

9

significant buildings and structures, and an intensity of vehicular and pedestrian traffic and activity

10

that is unique within the City. The Central Business District also features continuous and extensive

11

evolution in its built environment, through the development and redevelopment of new and

12

existing buildings, structures, open spaces, and rights-of-way, such that the potential suitability of

13

particular spaces for advertising signage over time is necessarily limited.

14

furtherance of the significant governmental interests set forth in Section 4-4-1 of this Code, the

15

regulation of advertising signs in the Central Business District merits heightened standards and

16

stricter requirements, as well as the ability to revise the implementation of such standards and

17

requirements on a periodic basis, than might be necessary in other areas of the City. The purpose

18

of this division is to set forth such standards and requirements for advertising in the Central

19

Business District.

2

such permit in good standing.

17

Sec. 4-4-132. Mitigation of harmful visual aesthetics created by Super Advertising Signs

18

through promotion of public art.

19

(a)

In acknowledgment that:

20

(1)

The City has a significant governmental interest in protecting its aesthetic values

21

and in mitigating instances of visual blight;

118
9-30-19

 1

(2)

Signs, by their very nature, wherever located and however constructed, can be

2

perceived as an aesthetic harm through their imposition of negative visual

3

aesthetics;

4

(3)

Because of the Central Business District’s role as the City’s primary hub of activity,

5

the aesthetic harm created by signs in the Central Business District is imposed on

6

all businesses and individuals who may live, work, do business, recreate, or visit

7

therein, or travel through the Central Business District, and compromises their

8

overall aesthetic experience of the City on a citywide basis;

9

(4)

The magnitude of any given sign’s negative visual aesthetics can depend on various

10

dimensional and operational parameters, such as its area, construction,

11

illumination, and dynamic operation, that serve to increase its visibility;

12

(5)

The negative visual aesthetics of a sign can, based on such dimensional and

13

operational parameters, become so great as to outweigh any positive consequences

14

that the sign might provide, including the facilitation of protected speech and the

15

promotion of local commerce; and

16

(6)

The City may, through the exercise of its legitimate police powers in furtherance of

17

its significant governmental interests, mitigate the particularly negative visual

18

aesthetics of the most visually impactful signs without compromising the positive

19

consequences of such signs by promotion, construction, and maintenance of

20

elements that serve to improve visual aesthetics to a proportionate degree, including

21

the public display of art murals and other forms of public art;

22

the Department is authorized to evaluate each application for a permit for a super advertising sign

23

and determine whether such proposed sign will, by its nature, impose negative visual aesthetics of

119
9-30-19

 1

such magnitude that mitigation through the display of one or more art murals and other public art

2

may reasonably be necessary.

3

(b)

Upon its determination that mitigation of the negative visual aesthetics imposed by

4

a proposed super advertising sign for which a permit is applied will be necessary, the Department

5

may request payment of a monetary contribution by the applicant, in an amount to be determined

6

by the Department in accordance with the limitations set forth in this section, as a prerequisite to

7

issuance of a permit for such sign. Such contribution need not be submitted prior to the

8

Department’s evaluation of the application for a super advertising sign permit, but must be

9

submitted prior to the Department’s issuance of such permit.

10

(c)

The Department may make any determination pursuant to its authority established

11

in Subsections (a) and (b) of this section in consultation with the City’s Director of Arts and

12

Culture, and the director of any department or agency that it may desire, or any such director’s

13

designee.

14

(d)

To ensure a reasonable nexus between the proposed super advertising sign’s

15

negative visual aesthetics and the City’s mitigation thereof, the Office of the Chief Financial

16

Officer shall establish a special purpose account for contributions made pursuant to Subsection (b)

17

of this section. The Department shall deposit all such funds directly into such account promptly

18

upon receipt. All funds must be disbursed from such account solely for purposes of the

19

commission, construction, siting, display, and maintenance of art murals and other public art that

20

is fairly anticipated to improve overall visual aesthetics in the City, and no funds in any amount

21

may be disbursed from such account for any other purpose, except if reimbursement of such funds

22

shall be made in accordance with Subsection (g) of this section.

120
9-30-19

 1

(e)

To ensure rough proportionality between the proposed super advertising sign’s

2

negative visual aesthetics and the City’s mitigation thereof, the contribution associated with any

3

sign shall not exceed an amount equal to the greater of:

4

(1)

An amount, equal to two dollars if the super advertising sign is proposed to be

5

internally illuminated, one dollar if the super advertising sign is proposed to be a

6

wall sign, and 80 cents if the super advertising sign is proposed to be a wall sign,

7

for each square foot of the proposed super advertising sign, for each year of the

8

term of the permit for which application is made; or

9

(2)

An amount equal to the expected cost, as the Department may reasonably

10

determine, for the commission and installation of an art mural of an area equal to

11

(i) 200% of the area of the proposed super advertising sign if such sign is proposed

12

to be internally illuminated, (ii) the area of the proposed super advertising sign if

13

such sign is proposed to be constructed as a wall sign, or (iii) 80% of the area of

14

the proposed super advertising sign if such sign is proposed to be constructed as a

15

painted sign, as well as the cost of the maintenance thereof for a period equal to the

16

term of the super advertising permit for which application is made.

17

(f)

The Department shall cause all contributions made pursuant to this section for the

18

purpose of mitigating the aesthetic harm of any super advertising sign to be disbursed for a purpose

19

allowed by this section no later than the termination date of the permit for such sign.

20

(g)

If the Department denies an application for a super advertising sign permit for

21

which a contribution has been made, the Department shall refund such contribution to the

22

applicant. If a permit for a super advertising sign has been issued and a contribution for such sign

121
9-30-19

 1

has been made, and such permit has been suspended or revoked in accordance with Section 4-4-

2

131 of this Code prior to the completion of its term, no refund of such contribution may be made.
