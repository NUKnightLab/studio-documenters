Ladies and Gentlemen:

Your Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental and Veterans Relations of the
Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on Tuesday, May 13,
2008 at the hour of 10:00 AM. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118 North
Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.

Your Committee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report.
the recommendations are as follows:

293931

CANDIDATES FOR THE INTERIM BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
COOK COUNTY BUREAU OF HEALTH (APPOINTMENTS). Transmitting
a Communication from Todd H. Stroger, President, Cook County Board of
Commissioners, dated May 2, 2008.

I would like to thank the members of the Nominating Committee for the
work they have done and most importantly for putting together a list of 20
excellent candidates. This has been a difficult process, in that, all of the

LEGISLATION, INTERGOVERNMENTAL AND VETERANS RELATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT
MAY 13, 2008

PAGE2

candidates offered have certain skills that make them viable candidates to
enhance this Independent Board. In putting together this list, I have
attempted to look at the following two key factors:

(1) I want a balanced board with diverse skill sets needed to
address the problems we face in a large complex public health
network such as ours; and

(2) I want a board that reflects the cultural, gender and racial
diversity of our County.

Additionally, I attempted to the best of my abilities. to be certain that there
were no potential conflicts of interest in the members have selected.

As stated above, I feel all of the candidates provided are excellent; thus. I
will not address any questions that relate to why I did not select a particular
individual. Instead, would recommend to any person that wishes to offer
someone else to consider, who they would remove from the list I have put
forth.

Before I give you the names I recommend, I call upon the Cook County
Board of Commissioners to improve the ordinance drafted on the night of
the budget meeting because such language fails to address critical issues
such as Procurement. how Human Resources will function as it relates to
this new board and the County, what occurs when there is a vacancy on
the board or whether the Inspector General will have jurisdiction over the
new board.

Provided for below are my recommendations that I will offer to the Board of
Commissioners for their approval:

Recommended List

David Carvalho
Jorge Ramirez
Heather O?Donnell
Norman Bobins

Chairman Suffredin noted that the ninth proposed nominee, Norman Bobins, had written a

During Ms. O?Donnell?s presentation and question and answer session,
Commissioner Butler requested leave to ask a question of David Small, Chief
Operating Officer of the Bureau of Health Services, pertaining to a statement made
by Ms. O'Donnell that the County does not collect for Medicaid.

Chairman Suffredin ruled Commissioner Butler?s request out of order.

of staffing and systems, does make every attempt to bill for every patient for which
Medicaid eligibility is determined. He added that the Bureau has made improvements
within the past eighteen months, by reducing the number of rejections and getting the bills
out the doors much quicker.

Presentation to the Cook County Board
Re Stroger Hospital
May 13, 2008

Good morning. My name is Lester Crown and I am
Chairman of the Civic Committee of The Commercial
Club of Chicago. Thank you for allowing me a few

minutes this morning.

We believe, as you do, that Stroger Hospital, and
the entire Cook County Bureau of Health, are essential
to the future health and well-being of the residents of

Cook County.

The Hospital and Bureau constitute a very large,
complex entity operating within a complex web of
laws and regulations. To operate effectively, it needs a

Board which is experienced and independent.

The Board you select should be balanced and
should include a preponderance of people with
expertise in ?nance, regulation and law ?people with
experience in how such large, complex organizations

should be governed and managed.

The Board?s recommendations do not have a
suf?cient number of experienced, senior-level business
people who have served on Boards of large institutions

or have been CEOs of such institutions.

Our judgment is reinforced by your own ordinance.
Because you recognized that this is a large, complex
entity, your ordinance requires that the nominees
include persons with the (quote) ?requisite expertise
and EXPERIENCE in areas pertinent to: the

GOVERNANCE and OPERATION of a large and complex

healthcare system? (unquote). We agree with your
ordinance - which is why we think you need more
people who have served on Boards or have been CEOs

of such large organizations.

What will happen if you do not get a more
experienced, better-balanced Board? One thing that
may very well happen is that you will find it difficult to
attract the kind of highly-qualified CEO you need to
manage the Hospital. Candidate CEOs typically
consider carefully the makeup of the Baard. Without a
Board that includes experienced business leaders, many
of the candidates you would like to recruit will have

serious reservations.

We recognize it is your responsibility not ours 

to pick the Board. We are not suggesting that only

those we suggested are quali?ed. But as you review
President Stroger?s list, please consider the

quali?cations identified in your ordinance.

You need a Board that has the necessary
experience one that is independent and which will

act in the best interests of the citizens of Cook County.

With respect, I suggest that President Stroger?s
list, taken as a whole, does not meet the requirements

of experience and independence.

 ATTACHMENT #2 

May 13, 2008

Good morning. I am Eden Martin, President of The
Commercial Club of Chicago and its Civic Committee. Thanks fer
the opportunity to appear this morning.

Thanks also, Mr. Chairman, to you and others for recognizing
that Lester Crown was at the forefront of those working to create a
new Stroger Hospital for Cook County.

In response to several questions asked of Mr. Crown, I?d like
to emphasize that the issue today is not about the list of 20 which
were submitted to President Stroger. The issue is about whether the
list of nine chosen by President Strog-er taken as a whole - has the
necessary experience and independence to: serve as'the Board of
Health Services.

A. Mr. Crown "5 remarks go to the question of whether as a

whole the proposed list of members of the Board of Health

Services has the neceSSary experience and independence.

Looming above that is the more fundamental issue: do you
want a board that has the necessary experience and

independence?

B. It seems to me there are two alternatives, and which one
you select depends on What you want the mission of the

hospital and bureau to be.

1. If you believe the mission of the hospital is to provide
?rst class health care in a professional way with
efficiency and sound- man-a'ge-ment then there is no
question that you will want a board and CEO with the
necessary experience and independence to govern and

manage a very large, complex organization.

2. But if. the mission of the hospital is to provide job's, 

contracts, and political bene?ts to people then the

It says the Board is to pick a Chief who will have
?independent managerial authority for all entities within

the Key word is ?independent.?

3. But if your objective is not high?quality service and.
efficiency but rather jobs and contracts then the last

thing you will want is an experienced and independent

Board and CEO.

So what I think this comes down to is what do you want? A
Beard and CEO that will do everything they can achieve high.-
quality professional medical service and ef?cient use of

resOurces?

Or a board that cares more: about jobs and contracts 1- and

political muscle?

April 17, 2008

I?d like to express my appreciation for your support of the Cook County Bureau of Health
Services Ordinance and the work of the Nominating Committee in recommending candidates for

the Interim Board of Directors.

As you know, one of the?key recommendations of the Bureau of Health Services Review
Committee was that Cook County?s health care system requires top professional management.
Given the nature of the problems facing the Bureau of Health Services, we strongly believe that the
Board should include members with expertise managing large, complex organizations in dif?cult

environments.

To that end, we would highly recommend the following candidates for the Interim Board
of Directors: Warren L. Batts, Norman R. Bobins, Lester B. Knight, James J. Stukel, and Andrea
L. Zopp. Each of these candidates possesses management skills and experience that will be vital to
leading the Bureau of Health Services during this challenging time.

Having worked with your father to gain business community support for the construction
of the new Stroger Hospital, I ?rmly believe that only through the creation of a truly professional
Board of Directors will the promise of that earlier endeavor be ?il?lled.

Again, thank you for all of your work in supporting this effort.

Cook County Board of Commissioners
118 North Clark Street, Suite 567
Chicago, IL 60602

Re: Selection of Interim Board of Directors, Cook County Bureau of Health

Dear Commissioner Silvestri:

Stroger Hospital and the entire Cook County Bureau of Health are essential to
the health and well-being of the residents of Cook County. The hospital cannot be allowed
to close or deteriorate. However, if its ?nancial problems are not recti?ed and its loss of
critical personnel not stemmed, its situation will become even more precarious.

A strong, independent board land an experienced, knowledgeable CEO are
indispensible to stabilizing and strengthening Stroger Hospital and the Bureau. On April
17, 2008, Lester Crown wrote to President Stroger on behalf of the Civic Committee of
The Commercial Club of Chicago to recommend candidates for the Interim Board of
Directors. (Copy enclosed.) On May 2, 2008, President Stroger announced his selections,
rejecting three of the Civic Committee?s nominees. It is now the responsibility of the
Cook County Board of Commissioners to review the selections and con?rm or reject them.

Stroger Hospital and the Bureau of Health together constitute a very large, complex
organization. Knowledge of the communities served is obviously important, as is
diversity of board membership. It is also essential that the members of the new Board have
the necessary experience, expertise and independence to provide direction and guidance,
and to select senior executive leaders of the institution. This experience includes
knowledge of how complex corporations are organized and how they govern and manage
themselves. The needed areas of expertise include ?nance, accounting, law and regulation,
management and human resources, as well as health care and medical knowledge.

The ordinance passed by the County Commissioners recognizes and underscores the
importance of having these areas of experience represented on the new board:

The slated nominees shall include persons with the requisite expertise and
experience in areas pertinent to the governance and operation of a large and
complex healthcare system. Among these areas shall be expertise and experience
in the ?elds of ?nance, legal and regulatory affairs, healthcare management,
employee relations, public administration, and clinical medicine.

The nominees selected by President Stroger do not as a group satisfy these
requirements for a balanced, experienced board. Norman R. Bobins and Andrea L. Zopp are
excellent appointments. Although some of the other designees have expertise in areas of
healthcare management and medicine, there appear to be too few members with the necessary
experience in how large organizations work at the board level how boards should function,
how they are organized, and how authority and responsibility are allOcated between a board and
the executives operating a very large, complex business. Also, apart from Norm Bobins and
Andrea Zopp, the group selected by President Stroger although having some expertise in the
areas of politics and unionized labor relations lacks the balance of strong expertise required in
the areas of ?nance, legal and regulatory affairs, employee relations, and overall corporate
direction and management.

As pointed out in Lester Crown?s letter of April 17, 2008, the Civic Committee highly
recommended three candidates not selected by President Stroger. These are; Warren L. Batts,
Lester B. Knight, and James J. Stukel. (Their resumes are enclosed.) Two of these are
experienced senior business leaders, and one was President of one of the largest not-for-pro?t
entities in Illinois, which operates both a medical school and a Chicago-area hospital. 
have signi?cant experience in the health care industry. All three know how boards operate.
They would bring needed balance to the new board.

Unless this imbalance is corrected by the Board of Commissioners, two unfortunate
consequences may occur. One is that some of the members proposed by President Stroger may
decline to serve. Board members rely on each other, and therefore consider very carefully the
areas of experience and expertise represented by other board members before agreeing to serve.
The second is that the new board may ?nd it dif?cult to attract the top-level CEO and other
executives needed to lead and manage the Bureau. Just as board members typically consider the

makeup of a board before agreeing to serve, for the same reasons candidate CEOs typically
consider the balance and experience of a board before assuming senior executive responsibilities.

No one can disagree with the proposition that the Bureau of Health Services and
Stroger Hospital are Vital to the health of the people of Cook County; nor can anyone disagree
that it is vitally important to attract the very best, experienced CEO (along with his or her team)
that can be recruited for Cook County. A well-quali?ed, balanced, independent board along
the lines described in your ordinance is indispensible to such a successful recruitment. On the
other hand, an under-experienced and non?balanced board lacking independence or signi?cant
expertise in many areas identi?ed in the ordinance will make such recruitment dif?cult, if not
impossible.

We strongly urge that members of the Board of Commissioners consider carefully the
need for experienced board leadership as it reviews the recommendations of President Stroger.

The opportunity to ?x the Hospital may not come again. An independent, experienced,
balanced board is the key to getting it ?xed.

Sincerely yours,
