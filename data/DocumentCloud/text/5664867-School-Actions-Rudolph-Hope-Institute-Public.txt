Good evening, Everybody.

First I'd

like to take this opportunity to welcome everybody for

Hope Institute and Rudolph High School Co-location Plan.

8
9

This plan was formally proposed on
December 1st, 2017, following months of community

10

engagement meetings up to the announcement.

11

Brian Medcalf, and I am the chief of schools for the

12

Chicago Public Schools.

17

We're here today on behalf of our interim

18

CEO Dr. Janice Jackson to share some basic information

19

and hear from you about this specific proposal.

20

As I mentioned a moment ago, the purpose of this

21

meeting is to allow CEO Jackson and the Board of

22

Education to hear feedback from you about this specific

23

proposal under discussion.

24

I will start by running through a brief

In addition, meeting summaries for each

3

community meeting will be available online at

4

cps.edu/transitions within five days of the meeting.

5

At this time I'm going to introduce

6

Cheryl Nevins, who will take us through the proposed

7

action.

MS. NEVINS:

Hello, Everyone.

Welcome.

So as you all know, this process here is part

10

of a broader legal process, and here are some of

11

highlights:

12
13
14

On October 1st CPS published draft guidelines
for school actions.
And on December 1st, CPS announced those

15

proposed actions and sent notice letters of the actions

16

with draft transition plans.

17

And now we're here in January 2018 where we

18

will hold two community meetings, one of which is

19

tonight, and another one is one week from tonight here

20

as well, as well as one public hearing on January 29th,

21

which is at 4:30 p.m. at Central Office.

22

And the earliest that the Board may vote on

23

this action is at the February board meeting.

24

time, if CPS makes a recommendation through the CEO to

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

At that

 January 10, 2018
Page 8

the Board after the input from these community meetings

2

and hearings, the vote -- the Board can vote on the

3

recommended action.

4
5
6

Here's a few slides that relate to the overview
of the proposed school action:
Rudolph Learning Center, currently located

7

across the street, would be located with Hope Learning

8

Academy at 1628 West Washington.

9

Rudolph would continue to design and implement

10

their high-quality program for students with significant

11

disabilities who require a significantly modified

12

curriculum.

13
14
15

Professional development will be centered
around supporting these transitioning students.
As well, a climate and culture team will be

16

developed to plan and promote the school-wide policies

17

and practices that are already in place and will

18

continue to support the already welcoming and supportive

19

school environment that both schools have.

20

If this proposal is approved by the Board, the

21

administrative teams would begin planning logistics

22

around schedules, room usage and afterschool activities

23

this March.

24

We would also be exploring the best drop-off

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 10, 2018
Page 9
1

and pick-up locations, exploring North Paulina or West

2

Maypole.

3

And as well, the students would have access to

4

100 percent ADA accessible building, potentially

5

including the following list:

6

Engagement up to this point:

7

In October of 2017, Rudolph's community renewed

8

their recommendation that Rudolph co-locate with

9

Hope Learning Academy to support its mission in

10

fostering a safe and supportive learning environment

11

using evidence-based strategies for its students and

12

nurturing the development of the whole child to support

13

these students.

14

Some of the key facts and figures:

15

Rudolph currently serves Grades pre-K through

16
17
18
19

fifth grade, current enrollment of 98 students.
Rudolph continually enrolls students throughout
the year based on supports written into their IEP's.
Rudolph will remain a school with no boundary

20

as all of its students are assigned to the school based

21

on the reports written into the IEP's.

22

And with respect to Hope Learning Academy, it

23

is a contract school with no boundaries, it serves

24

Grades K to 5.

Hope Learning Academy currently serves 355
students.
No change will occur to Hope Learning Academy.

and continue to remain a contract school.

MR. MEDCALF:

Thank you.

Now we're getting ready to enter into the
public comment section.
Before we begin, we'll clarify a few rules as
it relates to public comments.
So during this time, each member that has

12

signed up will get two minutes to speak.

13

our team will give you a one-minute warning mark as well

14

as when you have 30 seconds remaining and a final when

15

your time is up.

16

A member of

We ask that speakers come to the front, and

17

while the speakers are speaking, we ask that we give the

18

speakers respect so that our reporter, who is taking

19

notes, can hear because these do go public, and we do

20

post them, and so we want her to be able to catch

21

everything that is being said.

22

The meeting is scheduled to end promptly at

23

8:00 p.m.

24

scheduled end time of the meeting.

The comment period will last until the

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

Page 11

So if we get through all of our presenters that

2

have signed up for public comments and we're done before

3

8:00, we will still be here until 8:00, but we will also

4

have opportunities for other people that have not signed

5

up that might want to consider or re -- or again to go

6

to the registration table and have an opportunity to

7

speak.

8
9

At this time I would like to call to the podium
Speakers Number 2, 4 and 6.

10

So if you have Number 2, Speaker Number 4 and

11

Speaker Number 6, before you begin, can you state your

12

name and your affiliation with either school?

13

before you begin speaking, can you state your name so

14

that the reporter can capture your name and your

15

affiliation with either Hope or Rudolph?

16

Thank you.

THE AUDIENCE:

19

MS. SMITH:

20

Again,

Hello, Everyone.
Hi.

Thank you.

My name is Alexis Smith, and I went to school

21

at Wilma Rudolph 14 years ago, and I am for the proposal

22

because I have learned through reading information

23

online that if when Rudolph can come in this building

24

the students will be able to have a lunchroom.

And when I was a student there, that wasn't the

2

case for me.

with my classmates and eat lunch off of a cart.

4

always thought that that was sad because I had friends

5

from other classes that I couldn't see, and I wish that

6

I could have done that.

7

endure something that I did it.

I would always sit in the classroom only
And I

So I want students not to

8

And I also think that it would be a great idea

9

for students to have an art room because, again, when I

10

was a student there, Ms. Anna --

11

Raise your hand, please.

12

-- she would come to different classes with the

13

cart with all of her munchies on it, and I was like that

14

has to be a lot of work because she had all this school

15

munchies and everything, and it was so much fun.

16

pretty sure she's still great.

17

I'm

And I was wondering what it would be like to go

18

to a different room to do art, you know, and interact

19

within a different setting, and I feel like, if people

20

have the extra space, it will be a good environment, and

21

this is something that they would be able to resource

22

within going to a different school, once they complete

23

this grade, they'll be able to be exposed to

24

transitioning from class to class.

and community members have been working together with

12

other facilities in order for -- for Rudolph to be

15

The relocation would ensure Rudolph students

16

having a safe learning environment and to access

immediate facilities as well as access to general

There are multiple reasons that this relocation

Title 1 funding.

for parents or community members to meet privately.

20

Currently there is no dedicated space

Additionally, because space is so limited, it

21

is difficult to provide privacy for students who require

confidential nursing support as well as designated and

separated confidential space for IEP meetings and other

24

consultation services.

relocation to the Spaulding campus would also have a

positive impact on student academic, independent and

functioning skills.

In a fully rehabbed building, the school would

be able to increase the use of technology, furthering

As well as a large financial impact, there is

There's also been an issue with windows, air

Thank you very much.
MS. GALATI:

Good evening.

I'm Dana Galati.

I'm

the assistant principal at Wilma Rudolph.
And this was not planned this way, but I think

22

it is very fitting that I went after a former student

23

and a current parent because that is what I live for

24

every day and Holly and I live for every day, our

TOOMEY REPORTING

students and our parents.
And that's why we're here tonight; is to
support them and their students.
With the most significant disabilities, I

5

wholeheartedly believe that this proposed co-location is

6

not only needed but it is essential for building our

7

students' independence.

8
9

Our vision is to create a learning environment
that ensures our students with the most significant

10

disabilities and the families receive access to the same

11

educational experiences that their typically developing

12

peers receive.

13

In order to fully engineer this type of

14

environment, we need more strategically designed space

15

and opportunities for collaboration with the students

16

and staff faculty.

17

This space will allow for a richer and

18

educationally appropriate setting for our students that

19

would further enhance our educational experiences.

20

Together with Hope, we would continue our

21

collaboration with reading buddies and socioemotional

22

learning time that we've already established together.

23

It will allow for a richer and educational appropriate

24

setting for our students that would allow us to

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 10, 2018
Page 18
1

differentiate our services and supports to meet the

2

unique needs of our student population.

3

This move would be just a starting point for us

4

to provide our students and families with what they

5

deserve; that typical educational experience that we

6

cannot stress enough.

7

start of that.

TOOMEY REPORTING

He's in second

 January 10, 2018
Page 19

grade, and he attends Hope, and he's been here since the

2

school year of 2014-2015.

3

He is on the spectrum.

He's on the spectrum.

4

When he first came here, he had difficulties in class.

5

He would run out of the classroom, just a difficult time

6

getting acclimated to the school.

7

I've worked with him.

The school has been

8

great.

9

this project is, I want this school to go to the eighth

10

grade because it would help my child and others like my

11

child to have a place they feel like home.

12

They have worked with him.

And my concern about

If another school comes here, later on the

13

Board might say there's not enough room to move to the

14

eighth grade.

15

have.

So that's the biggest concern that I

16

I want my child to be here to the eighth grade

17

because he feels comfortable, and if anyone knows about

18

being on the spectrum, they need to feel comfortable,

19

they need to feel at home, and if you change them to a

20

different school, chances are you're going to regret it,

21

chances are they're going to act out, and I don't want

22

that for my son.

23
24

As I stated earlier, he loves his school, he
feels at home.

He comes home and tells me about the

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 10, 2018
Page 20
1

teachers, he tells me about the principal or the

2

principal and the assistant principal, and I love that.

3

And I feel at home when I come here.

4

imperative, and I can't say that enough, that this stays

5

his home.

6

the sixth grade, the seventh grade, and the eighth

7

grade.

8
9
10
11

So it's very

And that means he goes to the fifth grade,

So I don't want to cry up here because I'm a
big cry baby, but I just want him to feel at home, and
that's my biggest concern.

20

opportunity of Hope and Rudolph sharing one building.

21

The benefits for our students are easy to see.

22

Hope is a fully accessible building that provides our

23

students access to a great variety of spaces, large

24

classrooms, library, physical education space as well as

things that physical therapists look at; wide hallways,

2

stairs for those students that are able to transition on

3

stairs equal to their peers, but also to have access to

4

elevators and the ramps for those students that are

5

learning to walk or they are relying on a wheelchair.

6

This building will give our children access to

7

a school building that provides real life opportunities

8

and places for learning.

9

access to the best educational environment for all our

10

And don't we all want to have

kids?

11

Other benefits that might not be as easy to see

12

is the opportunity that arises for all students when the

13

kids are together in one building.

14

be a setting of two separate schools under one roof that

15

will function independently from each other in regards

16

to meeting the educational needs for the kids, you

17

cannot help but to run into each other in and around the

18

school.

19

Even though it will

I have seen firsthand how mingling of children

20

and the staff provides opportunities for learning that

21

extend way beyond the classroom.

22

We live in a world where we are all present and

23

we are around people that might have different needs

24

than ourselves, but in the end, we are all just people

Being around students that have different

needs, and the needs of our students can be challenging,

4

will provide an environment for acceptance, caring,

5

empowerment and possibly service.

know of within the district within the Chicago Public

5

For a general education

Our citywide enrollment model and sibling

policy allows diverse learners and their siblings to

attend the same school, which, in turn, attracts many

families to our school.

We do have questions that arise within our

The lack of parking available for Hope and
Rudolph staff.
Safety and security during arrival and dropoff
on Washington Avenue, Maypole and Paulina.
If you look up, in terms of our current
facilities, lights out, paint peeling off ceilings.
Those are current needs that we have as Hope.

So I don't want to co-share a facility if our current

needs aren't going to be addressed as a current

situation.

the lights off whether the Hope or Rudolph students.

14

those needs, there needs to be a deep dive in the

15

current needs of the current building of what we're

16

actually utilizing before you look at expanding, and

17

those needs to be met and mixed.

Kids don't deserve to walk in a place with

community students as well.

I do think the

There's a lack of a full-sized gymnasium as

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

well for physical education.

2

Lastly, Hope families and students are

3

discouraged when they have to step away from school

4

after fifth grade and walk across the stage and find a

5

new school, some of the parents have addressed.

6

Our current stress and major request if the

7

co-location is approved is an area of a section of the

8

building remains left open for the potential addition

for Hope's fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grades for

10

the future years.

3

specs are for Hope and what it would take for us to get

4

over here, but I believe both schools could benefit.

5

I'm not sure what the

My daughter, I have two daughters, she has a

6

big sister, and she loves to be included in what her big

7

sister does, and her big sister is considered the normal

8

kid, okay?

9

Let's just say that.

I don't think our kids have disabilities.

I

10

think they are just differently able, and if there is a

11

place where they can learn and grow even more than what

12

we have over in our small space at Rudolph, I think that

13

would be a blessing to both sides.

14

It is nice for other children to learn that

15

there are people that are different than them and that

16

they can do things that they might not be able to do but

17

they can help them learn how to do those things.

18

My daughter has come such a long way, and I

19

probably would not have been where we are without the

20

compassion that all the teachers have at Rudolph.

21

believe and I'm sure the teachers at Hope have just the

22

same compassion.

23
24

And I

Like the principal said, there are about 22
percent of kids at Hope that are diverse learners just

TOOMEY REPORTING

like our children.

2

how beneficial this could be, especially due to this

3

phase, and if we do come together, how much more a

4

collective group of people can make things happen.

5

So I'm hoping that everyone can see

4

is our school, what do we do next when you came on

6

need -- you have what you need and that the kids do,

13

too, and I promise that I'll always listen to you.

in each of us, and our students deserve the opportunity

families, amazing students who just need to have the

5

18

you guys totally recognize, legitimately, you need new

19

space.

20

like your building is falling apart.

21

don't want that for kids either.

We understand that.

We hear that.

It sounds

That's awful.

We

22

I think it would be really helpful in future

23

meetings, we need to hear a plan, like an actual plan

24

how is this going to work.

6

That won't work.

You

So that plan will have to

We don't currently have a functional pool so,

7

if you want a therapy pool, there probably would need to

8

be some money for that, and we don't money for that.

9

So things like that, it sounds great, that

10

sounds like we -- I think our parents need to hear the

11

plan and also how this benefits us because I hear how it

12

benefits your kids, and I think your kids deserve it,and

13

I'm not saying -- none of us are saying your kids don't

14

deserve that -- kids -- that's great, but we also need

15

to hear how it's going to benefit our kids, too, because

16

this is going to be -- there's going to be growing

17

pains, there's going to be stretching, and it's

18

difficult -- when you do something like this, there's

19

difficulties so we need to now how this is beneficial to

20

the families who have been here for a long time, too.

21

And how -- what -- I hear what you're saying,

22

you want an eighth grade, too, but we are desperate to

23

be able to have our kids be able to stay here.

24

will be a hot mess if he has to go to a different eighth

So if there's a way that we can grow and do

3

that together, that's awesome, let's figure out how to

4

do that, but I think for the Hope parents, we really

5

need to hear how this is good for all of us and not just

6

our neighbors, which we want to be about our neighbors,

7

too, but just we need to do this together.

Thank you.
MS. GUILLORY:

Hi.

My name is Margaret Guillory.

I

10

have twin daughters, nine-year-olds, Sophia and Delilah,

11

both of whom are in the autism spectrum and are

12

attending Hope Learning Academy.

13

And this school has been just the most amazing

14

environment for us, and we want to share that

15

environment with you.

16
17
18

So in terms of pro-con, I'm pro, I'm for it,
but my comments are actually directed at CPS.
CPS, I love that you came here with the

19

information, but you -- it's all the same information we

20

already had in the letter, and it doesn't tell us

21

anything more.

22

thought about how we could expand again.

23
24

We don't get any sense of have you

We have actually put forth an application for
expansion, and we had it pushed back and pushed back and

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 10, 2018
Page 41
1

pushed back by CPS until it was like, oh, well, look at

2

that, we're not going to do it, oh, by the way, we're

3

co-locating.

4

Now, I don't think that there's anything

5

conspiratorial about that, but CPS has not really

6

treated Hope as an entity in this discussion.

7

got a letter, it was a wonderful letter about what

8

Wilma Rudolph needs.

Great.

Welcome.

When we

Please come in.

9

But it was not, hey, look at these two schools

10

and how much they can be together and grow together and

11

collaborate and be a part of each other.

12

guys move over, we've got more important people coming

13

in.

14

It was, you

We don't want that, and I don't think you guys

15

do either.

16

want to see CPS treat Hope and Wilma Rudolph as two

17

amazing schools that have a great deal to offer their

18

children together, and I want you to look at the school,

19

the physical building, and tell us what you're going to

20

do to make it happen because we can't do it alone,

21

Rudolph can't do it alone and together even.

22

deal with a lot of issues.

23
24

I think we want to be collaborative, but I

Wilma Rudolph is a CPS school.

We have to

We pay to be

here because we're not -- we are CPS, but we're contract

so we pay to be here.

2

are we putting -- You know, how are we going to make

3

this work so that two great schools can grow, not just

4

grow for where they are right now with their kids and

5

their space, but grow beyond, both schools, together.

6

So I am pro, please come in, we welcome you.

7

CPS please give us a better plan.

He has been since his

And I decided to speak today, I wanted to tell

13

you guys about my experience, and, hopefully, that will

14

be something that would be encouraging to the move and

15

impetus to maybe to help us get it started.

16

But now, listening to people from the Hope

17

Institute, I want to say to you guys, thank you, first

18

of all, for welcoming us.

19

was like to get the letter saying that this is what's

20

going to happen with you guys, no thought or -- no

21

thought or any words to the displacement of your

22

students or how is this going to affect you guys.

23
24

I can only imagine what it

The only thing that I can offer you guys as a
parent of a Wilma Rudolph student is the opportunity to

collaborate.

2

are a lot stronger in the face of CPS.

3

really big, but as parents, as parents of children with

4

special needs, as parents of children who have needs

5

that are not being met, as parents of children who need

6

to be able to function into society one day, I think

7

it's better for us to be together collaborative, you

8

know.

9

We are stronger together as a force.

We

CPS is really,

There's strength in numbers, and I would

10

volunteer myself as a parent advocate to kind of, if

11

need be, be a liaison between parents and Hope and

12

parents at Wilma Rudolph so that we can all get together

13

and try to get this done for the benefit of our babies,

14

of all of our babies.

15

Thank you.

19

Good evening.

Thank you.
Good evening.

My name is

20

Darrell Brackenridge, and I'm a parent of April, a

21

Rudolph student.

22

and --

My son's name is Keela Brackenridge

23

Yes, you are, you are my son.

24

And I just want to speak on behalf of pro, pros

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 10, 2018
Page 44

2

of Wilma Rudolph and us working together.
Wilma Rudolph is a small school with children

3

who are just wonderful, they're absolutely wonderful and

4

would be a blessing to have in any facility, especially

5

Hope facility, and I pray that we all can come together

6

and work together so that these needs can be met as the

7

other parent has said.

8
9

And my son has been at Wilma Rudolph ever since
he was in pre-K, ever since we found out about his

10

disability.

11

with a disability is, it's extremely difficult to

12

release your child into the atmosphere of what we call

13

the world when we're used to our own world, our own

14

home, we're around, and we take care of them, and we

15

have to trust individuals to care for them while we're

16

still out in the world making money or making other

17

things so that they can survive in this world.

18

it can be done in a collective atmosphere, in a positive

19

atmosphere, we are for that.

20

And what I can say as a parent of a child

And if

And we're not here to bully or to rush.

We're

21

here to speak on behalf of those who cannot speak for

22

themselves, who cannot advocate for themselves, and we

23

want to do that on a positive note.

24

I also wanted to recommend something, not to

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 10, 2018
Page 45
1

just come in and say this, but to recommend and

2

volunteer my services as a parent who is -- I'm very

3

active in my children's lives, and I like to be their

4

voice, but I like to revise them.

5
6

So if we need parents to come together to help
in any way, I'm that.
Thank you so much, and have a great evening.
MS. SPICER:

Good evening.

Good evening.

I'm a

parent for Andrew Lockhard who is a student at
Wilma Rudolph, and I came out to support both schools.

11

I belive they stand on one accord, and I think

12

this would be, you know, a great experience for Rudolph

13

to get more room.

14

classrooms, you know, which is still a blessing.

15

You know, like they said, kids eat in

But I -- me as a parent, I believe that, you

16

know, have more, and I think about coming over here to

17

Hope, you know, it will be a blessing, and I want each

18

parent for each side to be on one accord, you know, just

19

don't look at no other child like I don't think this

20

would be a perfect school because of one person -- you

21

know, everybody thinks different.

22

I think this will be a good call so I just wish

23

everybody the best.

Thank you.

I am grateful for the opportunity to speak
tonight.
I think that the transition -- Well, actually,

I'll say this.

8

We don't like it, it doesn't feel good.

9

Change is a curse word to most people.

But guess what?

Life goes on.

You must do it.

10

We all have been doing it from birth even until this

11

very moment.

12

probably should stop living at all.

that great when we have to do it so let's move forward.

14

I would love to collaborate with Hope parents,

So if you don't like change, well, you

faculty, staff and see what it actually looks like to

She's

 January 10, 2018

2

I understand, I hear a lot of fear coming from

3

both sides, not knowing exactly what to expect with a

4

collaboration like this.

5

I think that like, in a form like this,

6

everyone can air out their concerns and parents can come

7

together and voice and build something better.

8
9

Wilma Rudolph doesn't want to come in as
bullies and take over.

We really don't.

We are all

10

about our children and providing the best things for our

11

children and speaking up for our children.

12

understand that Hope also has children here, and they

13

have needs also.

14

But I

I think that, with the two schools combined,

15

maybe it will be a great thing.

16

maybe the school can get everything that it actually

17

needs.

18

Maybe with two budgets,

And I know from being a Wilma Rudolph parent,

19

we will do everything we need to do to get our kids what

they need.

transition a positive for everyone.
And I understand being a parent of a

3

four-year-old and being new to this process, but just

4

being a parent and talking to other parents who have

5

kids on the autism spectrum, we're all in this together,

6

we want what's best for your children, and we're going

7

to speak on it.

8

The more voices that come together, be it from

9

a charter school or from CPS, we're going to be a loud

10

force to be reckoned to let you know that our kids are

11

here, we want what's best for them, we pay our taxes, we

12

pay for charter schools, we're not going to go quietly.

13

And that's not just for Hope and Wilma.

We may

14

be the start of something new, something that maybe CPS

15

never thought of before, something charter never thought

16

of before.

17

beginning as to help kids with disabilities be it on the

18

autism or medical.

19

we're going to strive for it.

20

This would be an awesome thing as a

We want what's best for them, and

I really think that this should be looked at as

21

a positive thing.

22

smoother this transition will be because you guys want

23

what's best and we're going to give our kids what's best

24

be it if we have to fight for it to make sure that

The more we talk to each other, the

TOOMEY REPORTING

that we all should try to come together and make it a

good transition.

MS. O'BRIEN:

Hi.

My name is Isabella, and I'm

13 years old.

6

And at my school here we're required to do

7

20 hours of service each year, and I've been lucky

8

enough to go volunteer at Wilma Rudolph School, and it's

9

great, and I always look forward to volunteering here

10

because seeing the students and working with them just

11

brightens up my day and like it makes me feel like so

12

happy to be there helping them.

13

Also, the staff is really welcoming to me, and

14

it just feels like a big family and community there, and

15

it's like so amazing.

16

And I think that if -- that Wilma Rudolph is a

17

really special place and if this school starts sharing a

18

campus, it will make a bigger better community.

two of my own, it's hard, right, it is tough, but it's

Amy, it was really moving to hear you say

12

welcome.

Thank you.

welcome.

It's all very genuine.

We would like you

all to be in a great space.
Principal J. and I are open to having
conversations about how we can work together, too.
I think, at the end the day, we all have to

22

agree we do what's best for kids.

23

Some kids are typical.

my vocabulary as principal at Rudolph, what is typical.

I

3

think it takes guts to get up here and let us know what

4

we're afraid and what we're not afraid of, and that's

5

something you have a fabulous AP that we talk about all

6

the time that fear of the unknown and that change,

7

right, I know I got to keep doing it, but what does that

8

look like.
