West Cortland Street from North Pulaski Road to North Lawndale Avenue; Single
Direction - Southerly. Not Recommended. West Cortland Street is a two-way local
road between North Pulaski Road and North Lawndale Avenue. West Cortland is an
east-west street; therefore, CDOT does not recommend this one way conversion
ordinance -- (18-01731940) [02018-4305]

West Lemoyne Street from North Kildare Avenue to North Tripp Avenue; Single
Direction - Easterly. Not Recommended. West Le Moyne Street operates as a two-way
local road east of North Kildare Avenue and as a one-way eastbound local road west
of North Kildare Avenue. North Tripp Avenue operates as a two-way local road south
of West Grand Avenue and dead-ends into West Le Moyne Street. Southbound
motorists on North Tripp Avenue would reach a dead-end at West Le Moyne without a
turnaround location if West Le Moyne Street, east of North Kildare Avenue, was
converted to a one-way eastbound road. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend
converting West Le Moyne Street to a single direction eastbound street east of North
Kildare Avenue (18-01731922) [02018-4308]

TRAFFIC WARNING SIGNS SIGNALS:

West 59th Street and South Komensky Avenue; Two Way Stop Sign. Not
Recommended. West 59th Street is a major collector roadway with significantly higher
traffic volumes than South Komensky Avenue, a one way northbound residential
street. Stop signs on streets with higher volumes such as West 59th Street tend to
increase rear?end crashes, increase congestion, and create a false sense of security
for pedestrians that every vehicle will stop. Stop compliance is particularly low at 
intersections. Additionally, due to this intersection's proximity to the traffic signal at
West 59th Street and South Pulaski Road, a stop sign at South Komensky Avenue will
be unexpected for drivers. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend an All Way Stop
Sign at this intersection -- (18-01731514) [Or2018-254]

South Wolcott Avenue and West 43rd Street; All Way Stop Sign, Stopping All

West 95th Street and South Eggleston Street; Stop Sign, Stopping east and
westbound traffic on West 95th Street. Not Recommended. West 95th Street is a
major arterial roadway with significantly higher traffic volumes than South
Eggleston Avenue, a local street. Stop signs on streets with higher volumes
such as West 95th Street tend to increase rear-end crashes, increase
congestion, and create a false sense of security for pedestrians that every
vehicle will stop. Stop compliance is particularly low at T?intersections.
Additionally, there is an existing pedestrian refuge island on West 95th Street
at the south leg of South Eggleston Street that allows pedestrians to cross
traffic one direction at a time. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend an All
Way Stop Sign at this intersection -- (18-01381289) [Or2018-189]

West 5th Avenue and South Whipple Street; All Way Stop, Stopping All Approaches.
Not Recommended. CDOT does not recommend stop signs on the main line of T-
intersections due to low stop compliance. Additionally, due to the intersection's
proximity to the traffic signal at West 5th Avenue and South Sacramento Boulevard,
motorists will likely speed to catch the green light and disregard the stop sign
(18-01131889) [Or2018-154]
