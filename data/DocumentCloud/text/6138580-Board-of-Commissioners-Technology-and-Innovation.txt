RECORDER OF DEEDS, Eugene “Gene” Moore, transmitting a Communication,
dated September 30, 2009:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with
Fidlar Technologies, Inc., Rock Island, Illinois, for the property Fraud Alert system,
the Disaster Recovery System and the Tapestry/Laredo Data Sales program. The
Property Fraud Alert system will serve as an early notification for Cook County
property owners, allowing them to intervene in the event of fraudulent transactions.
The Disaster Recovery System will allow the office to resume operating within
hours of any interruption of service, whether natural or otherwise.
The
Tapestry/Laredo Data Sales program is expected to increase revenue from the
sale of Recorder of Deeds information beyond the current levels.
Reason:

Fidlar Technologies, Inc. provides the industry's only proactive land
fraud notification system that functions in harmony with third party
recording systems. The system requires no additional modifications to
existing Recorder of Deeds operation. The Fidlar Disaster Recovery
system feeds the Tapestry/Laredo Data Sales program with recorded
information, which provides an additional level of network security for
the Recorder of Deeds office.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $322,000.00 (FY 2009: $131,613.00; and FY 2010:
$190,387.00). Contract period: November 1, 2009 through October 31, 2010.

BUREAU OF TECHNOLOGY, by R. STEVE EDMONSON, Chief Information
Officer, transmitting a Communication, dated March 11, 2010:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into an
intergovernmental agreement with U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY (USGS) and
NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL-INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (NGA) for urban areas of
Chicago and Urbana, Illinois, for the acquisition of orthoimagery photography for
the Chicago, Illinois footprint defined as part of the Federal 133 Urban Areas
Program.
Reason:

As part of a regional project for the acquisition of aerial imagery for data
acquisition and sharing at county borders, regional partners, Cook,
DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will Counties as well as
the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning and the United States
Geological Survey have agreed to contribute financially for the cost of
the project. This project also supports the National Spatial Data
Infrastructure (NSDI) by advancing USGS and Federal Geographic
Data Committee (FGDC) efforts related to Geospatial One-Stop, The
National Map, and Imagery for the nation. Since Cook County has the
largest, most complex territory in the region composed of dense urban
areas, airports and shore line environments, it is acting as the lead
government project manager for the initiative. The joint purchasing
agreement with U.S Geological Survey and National GeospatialIntelligence Agency will allow us to receive their $200,000.00 funding
for the project.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Estimated Revenue generating: Geographic
Information System (GIS) will receive $200,000.00. Contract period: May 1, 2010
through April 30, 2011. (545-260 Account).
*Referred to the Committee on Information Technology and Automation on
04/06/10 as Amended.
Ms. Horace stated the following: The County Board approved a fly-over for part of a regional
GIS project with the following counties: DuPage, Kane, Kendall, McHenry and Will. As part of
that project, which will supply aerial photography over the northeastern geographic area, the
U.S. Geospatial Survey has contacted us and stated that they are willing to submit funding to
Cook County for the project as well. In order to comply, Ms. Horace needs to demonstrate that
she has the County Board’s support for applying and receiving funding for this project. After she
receives approval from the County Board she will complete the application process, and will
then return to the County Board for final execution of the contract with the U.S. Geological
Survey.
Commissioner Daley inquired as to what the goal of this project is.
Ms. Horace replied that the fly-over is done every year, and is utilized in the County’s map
making process.

BUREAU OF TECHNOLOGY, by R. Steve Edmonson, Chief Information Officer,
transmitting a Communication, dated March 11, 2010:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into an
intergovernmental agreement with LAKE COUNTY, ILLINOIS, for the acquisition
of orthoimagery for the Northeastern Illinois region.
Reason:

As part of a regional project for the acquisition of aerial imagery for data
acquisition and sharing at county borders, regional partners, Cook,
DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will Counties as well as
the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning and the United States
Geological Survey have agreed to contribute financially for the cost of
the project. Since Cook County has the largest, most complex territory
in the region composing of dense urban areas, airports and shoreline
environments, it is acting as the lead government project manager for
this initiative. The joint purchasing intergovernmental agreement with
Lake County will allow us to receive their 1st year funding for the
project.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Estimated Revenue generating: Geographic
Information System (GIS) will receive $100,346.64 for 2010. Contract period:
February 22, 2010 through August 21, 2011. (545-260 Account).
*Referred to the Committee on Information Technology and Automation on
04/06/10, as Amended.
Mary Jo Horace stated: This is the start of a contract with Lake County, Illinois in order to
receive $100,000 in funding from them this year toward the regional aerial project. Some
government agencies, including Lake County, require authorization from the County Board
before they will send a contract and agreement.
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved the approval of
Communication No. 305992 as amended. The motion carried.

BUREAU OF TECHNOLOGY – TRANSFER OF FUNDS. Transmitting a
Communication, dated March 11, 2010 from R. Steve Edmonson, Chief
Information Officer:
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling
$425,000.00 from Account 545-260, Professional and Managerial Services to
Account 545-441, Maintenance and Repair of Data Processing Equipment and
Software for the coverage of a contract for ground imagery maintenance which
includes acquisition of parcel images, ground control, data collection and Federal
Geographic Data Committee compliance metadata Board approved on December
15, 2009.
Reason:

The transfer is needed to cover funding that was originally budgeted for

 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND AUTOMATION COMMITTEE REPORT

PAGE 6
2009, but due to contract processing, the contract period was moved to
2010.
From Account:
545-260

Total $425,000.00

To Account:
545-441
1.

Total $425,000.00

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would
require an infusion of funds in order to meet current obligations? What was
the balance in the account on that date, and what was the balance 30 days
prior to that date?
On February 22, 2010, it became apparent that the Maintenance and Repair
of Data Processing Equipment and Software Account 545-441 would require
an infusion of funds in order to meet outstanding maintenance obligations.
At this time, the balance of the account had $422,812.00, not including the
outstanding contract expenditures of $475,650.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified?
List any other accounts that were also considered (but not used) as the
source of the transferred funds.
Account 545-260 was identified as the source of transferred funds because
of the reduction of some of the geospatial projects which was realized via the
Request for Proposal process and cooperative acquisitions on a regional
level.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations
that will be deferred, delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in
available spending authority that will result in the account that funds are
transferred from 545-260 Professional Services.
Savings in the account will occur in two ways:
1) Since the County Board authorized us to participate in a regional aerial
orthoimagery project with the seven neighboring counties, the Chicago
Metropolitan Agency for Planning and the United States Geological Survey,
we realized a projected savings of over $300,000.00.
2) The department will postpone the upgrade of an existing application,
Mapviewer that County agencies use internally to quickly produce map
displays.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this
account was originally budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated
surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

The funding for the contract was originally planned to be incurred as part of
fiscal year 2009. However due to the lengthy process of contract review and
negotiations and the end of the year account closeout, the contract funding
was carried into the 2010 fiscal year budget. The timing of the contract
processing was too late to add the contract into the 2010 fiscal budget and
not finalized enough to have the funds encumbered from 2009.
*Referred to the Committee on Information Technology and Automation on
04/06/10 as Amended.
Ms. Horace stated: The transfer of funds is needed to ensure that the GIS Department has
funding for all of its projects this year. One GIS Department project went before the County
Board in 2009, but the contract negotiations continued into 2010. The funding was initially for
2009. The GIS Department will have funding for this project because of the revenue which the
GIS Department will be receiving from other government agencies who are working with the GIS
Department.
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved the approval of
Communication No. 305993 as amended. The motion carried.
Commissioner Goslin moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner
Schneider. The motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.
