 Tobacco Use
Background
• Tobacco use is the largest preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the U.S.1
• Annual health care costs in Illinois directly caused by tobacco are $5.49 billion and $5.27 billion in
lost productivity2
• In suburban Cook County, 16.7% of adults identify as current smokers3
• E-cigarettes are currently the most used tobacco product among youths4
• In the last year, e-cigarette use in the U.S. has increased by 78% among high school students and
48% among middle school students5
• E-cigarette use increases the risk for using cigarettes among youths6

3

 Vaping
• E-cigarette liquid contains chemicals and carcinogens; +/- nicotine, +/- marijuana
• E-cigarette liquid can poison children through ingestion or skin absorption
• Youth who use e-cigarettes are more likely to use cigarettes or other tobacco products7, 8
• Major American professional societies (AAFP, AAP, APHA) urge tighter regulation and more
research
•

None support the use of e-cigarettes for quitting

• Recent large study demonstrated e-cigarettes were more effective for smoking cessation than
conventional methods9, however:
•

Of those who maintained abstinence at 52 weeks, 80% (n=79) were still using e-cigarettes

•

Another recent study demonstrated a higher risk of stroke and heart attack among e-cigarette users10
