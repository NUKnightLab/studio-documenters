 Revenue Assumptions
Uncompensated Care Payments
– Disproportionate Share (DSH) payments and Benefits Improvement and
Protection Act (BIPA) payments assumed to remain flat compared to
FY14 at $293M.

Medicaid Fee-For-Service (FFS)
– As a result of the state shifting from a FFS model to a managed care
model, the budget will reflect a $122M
$
decline in Medicaid FFS revenue.
– FFS reimbursement is now limited to the application period prior to
member assignment to a managed care health plan and special
populations.
populations

 Revenue Assumptions
p
CountyCare serves three Medicaid populations with
average monthly membership and reimbursement
rates
– ACA adult average monthly membership of 79,500 at $630 composite*
per member per month (pmpm)
– Family Health Plan (FHP) average monthly membership of 65,000 at
$250 composite* pmpm per enrolled family member
– Seniors and Persons with Disability (SPD) average monthly
membership of 4,700 at $1,571 composite* pmpm
– Actual pmpm rates vary by demographics, geography and category

FY15 CountyCare Projected Revenue

$915M

* Rates listed are reflective of the composite rates as calculated by the state actuary for the base medical package for 
each population. Additional rates apply for more medically complex members. Within each population, rates are adjusted 
for age, gender, complexity of case such as medically complex children, all deliveries, long term care support services, etc.

 Expenditure and Position Variances
Proposed FY15 budget increases by 9% compared to FY14 year-end estimate
•
•
•
•
•

Increase mainly due to increasing membership in CountyCare ($73M)
Additional costs allocated to mail-order pharmacy ($17M)
Increases in employee health benefits, malpractice premiums and property insurance ($14M)
Pharmaceutical supply and equipment increases ($14M)
Miscellaneous increases in supplies and services ($8M)

Proposed FY15 budget re-allocates existing costs and positions to improve cost allocation and
transparency
•
•
•

Decline in Health Administration expenses reflects realignment of pharmacy positions and supply
costs to Stroger, Provident and Cermak.
Decreased CountyCare positions reflect realignment of personnel to Ambulatory Services.
Decreased positions in Public Health reflects transition of services to Ambulatory Services to
improve coordination and service delivery.
