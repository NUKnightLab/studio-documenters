Ms. Boeckman updated the Board with respect to certain ongoing litigation matters involving the
Fund. Ms. Boeckman noted that Public Act 100-0023 included a provision titled “Assignment of
Receipts” revising the Municipal Code. Ms. Boeckman stated that this language provides homerule municipalities with the authority to transfer future tax revenue from the State to bondholders.

ownership over those tax revenues irrespective of any outstanding payments owed to the Pension
Fund.
Ms. Boeckman noted that the City of Chicago was sponsoring a Blue Cross Blue Shield group
healthcare insurance plan for eligible retirees for 2018. She also noted that Local 2 is sponsoring
