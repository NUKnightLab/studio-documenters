 III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Douglas Elwell, Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, provided additional information.
With regard to request number 9, Mr. Jones noted that there is an error on the transmittal. The correct contract period
is from March 1, 2018 through February 28, 2020.
Mr. Jones commented on the requests relating to the purchase of medical equipment for the Central Campus Health
Center (request numbers 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 17). He stated that, even though some of those requests reflect as
sole source, there was a series of design meetings held approximately eighteen (18) months ago with the chairs of the
departments, project manager, architect and equipment planner. Following that, his department and value analysis
director got involved with the chairs; they went through and worked with Dr. Claudia Fegan, Chief Medical Officer,
and the department chairs to make sure the organization obtained the equipment that was necessary for the new
building. He noted that there are over 90 vendors for between 1200-1500 line items of equipment that has to be
procured by next month, in order to meet the lead time to have equipment in place for when the construction reaches
substantial completion at the end of June.
With regard to request number 14, Director Richardson-Lowry commented on the sole source classification. She
stated for the record that this leaves her wanting. There are two (2) categories for sole source: 1) expertise, no one else
can do it, and 2) fact-based emergent circumstances. For this item, because the contract does not fit either category of
justification, and she does not have an adequate response, she will abstain.
With regard to request number 16, Mr. Elwell stated that this is a sole source because it is a proprietary matter.
Although the organization uses several companies like this one for recruitment, the company controls the website and
one can only use those services through them. Director Richardson-Lowry indicated that, by using the word
“proprietary” on the transmittal, then all will understand that there is an exclusivity there. She stated for the record that
this was not the case with the prior sole source contract that was discussed earlier (request number 14). Mr. Elwell
stated that, for request number 14, the administration will subject the contract to the value analysis process, to make
sure CCHHS is getting the best pricing and fit for the organization.
With regard to request number 18, Mr. Elwell stated that CCHHS continues to try to work with the City and others to
enhance what is available in behavioral health across the community. One of the challenges is that the City has had
difficulty in recruiting psychiatrists; at this point they only have one (1) permanent psychiatrist who only works in one
(1) of their clinics. CCHHS’ administration believes that CCHHS can provide more stability and bring those clinics
into the broader context of all behavioral health in the community; therefore, CCHHS is working with the City to
provide CCHHS psychiatrists, by either utilizing in-house staff or through a contractual manner. The plan is to
stabilize those clinics and eventually get them on CCHHS’ electronic medical record system so patients can be
coordinated throughout the community and at the different health sites.
Director Richardson-Lowry requested that the Contract Compliance outcomes for all of the requests be reported back
to the Committee through the Chair.
Director Reiter, seconded by Director Richardson-Lowry, moved the approval of
request numbers 1 through 18, as amended, and subject to completion of review by
Contract Compliance, where appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Director Richardson-Lowry abstained and voted PRESENT on request number 14.
C. Any items listed under Section III
Page 2 of 28

 IV. Report from Chief Procurement Officer
A. Report of emergency purchases (Attachment #2)
Mr. Elwell provided information on the two (2) emergency purchases made.
With regard to the emergency purchase with Batir-Evolve IV, Mr. Elwell stated that the vendor was selected
through a Request for Proposals process, and that the procurement followed the normal process. However, as the
contract was being prepared for Board approval, staff narrowly missed the timing to be able to get it on the Board
Agenda for approval on January 26th.
Because this is a time-sensitive and critical matter relating to the
construction of the Cook County Health Center, it was processed as an emergency purchase.
With regard to the emergency purchase with Evolent Health, Mr. Elwell stated that the administration has been
working for quite a while to be able to get into the Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) HMOI product. When BCBS
finally agreed, suddenly CCHHS had to be up and running to accept the plan members by January 1st. BCBS has
a lot of rules, so the administration looked to Evolent as probably the only way to get it up and running in that
time frame. He noted that the administration is also trying to leverage what it is already doing with Evolent, so a
lot of the setup fees would get waived and a lot of the costs per member would be lower. Following discussion,
Director Richardson-Lowry requested that the administration report back to the Committee within this quarter on
progress on this matter.

V.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer
• Metrics
• Financials through November 2017
Mr. Elwell stated that the administration anticipated having the November financials presented at this meeting, but
they are not yet ready. He reminded the Committee that CCHHS went onto the new Oracle system on December
1st; it is taking a little bit longer to reconcile the new system to the previous systems used. He expects to have that
reconciled and have the financials in time for the March 2nd Board Meeting. Chairman Estrada requested that the
new Finance Chair have a preview and conversation regarding the financials before they are sent to the Board. Mr.
Scheer recommended that the Committee should see those financials before the Board receives them.

VI.

Adjourn
As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman Estrada declared the meeting ADJOURNED.

Respectfully submitted,
Finance Committee of the
Board of Directors of the
Cook County Health and Hospitals System
