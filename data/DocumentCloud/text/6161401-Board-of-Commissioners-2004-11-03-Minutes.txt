Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

PUBLIC HEARING REQ UESTED FOR THOSE IMPACTED BY
SEVERE DISPROPORTIONATE UNEMPLOYMENT RATES
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article 7, Section 6a of
the Illinois Constitution of 1970 with power to regulate those matters which pertain to its government and
affairs; and

3019

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDI NGS OF NOVEMBER 3, 2004

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has demonstrated its commitment to understanding and
s upporting programs for Cook County constituents to become self-sufficient, law-abiding, tax-paying
citizens; and
WHEREAS, current statistics reflect a severe and highly disproportionate number of unem ployed
African-American males between the ages of seventeen ( 17) and thirty-five (35), many of who m have lost
hope in ever finding gainful employment; and
WHEREAS, drug trafficking and other underworld activities often arise as major "employment"
alternatives to fill the occupational void in depressed communities; and
WHEREAS, it is in the best interest of Cook County to prevent destructi ve acts that often occur when
large population groups feel disenfranchised, trapped and ignored.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County to sponsor
a public fo rum where concerns regarding job training/availability/retention can be directly expressed by
the impacted population; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the valid information retrieved will then be used to facilitate our
efforts to determine ways to maximize the use of existing employment and train ing dol lars, minimize
dup licity of effort and develop specific Workforce Investment programs that will result in job creation,
placement and long-term retention.
Commiss ioner Daley, seconded by Comm issioner Murphy, moved to suspend the rul es so that this matter
may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commiss ioner Collins, seconded by Commissioner Si lvestri, moved that the Proposed Resolution be

BUREAU OF FINANCE - CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
FY 2003 ACTUARIAL REPORT
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 25, 2004 from
THOMAS J. GLASER, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Finance
Re: FY 2003 Actuarial Report
As part of the County's external audit, the Bureau of Finance has received the final Actuarial Report from
PriceWaterhouseCoopers for the worker's compensation and self-insured liabilities for the fiscal year
ended November 30, 2003. The report estimates that the County's total liabilities were $402.7 million,
which represents a reduction in estimated losses of $46.6 million from FY 2002. The change in loss
estimate between FY 2003 and FY 2002 breaks down as follows:

Change

Change in Estimate

Medical Malpractice
Worker's Compensation
General Liability
Other Liability
Auto Liability
Total

($46,271 ,43 2.00)
5,415,371.00
(3 ,227 ,2~6.00)
(2, 746,586.00)
215,699.00
($46,614,214.00)

Further, based upon their analysis, the County should expect to pay out $51.8 million in loss payments in
FY 2005. This amount has been included in the FY 2005 budget.
Also, for your information, I have submitted schedules showing the comparison of projected loss
payments versus actual loss payments for FY 2003 - FY 1999. As you can see, we have been fairly
accurate in the estimates of projected versus actual losses.

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Sims, moved that the communication, as amended be

COOK COUNTY LAW LIBRARY ORDINANCE PROPOSED FILING FEE INCREASE
(PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT).
Subm itting a Proposed Ordinance
Amendment sponsored by Carl R. Hansen, County Commissioner.
The proposed amendment to the Cook County Law Library Ordinance will increase the Law
Library filing fee from $10.00 to $13.00. An increase in the price of books has rendered the
current $ 10.00 filing fee inadequate and believe it is necessary to amend the Cook County
Ordinance to utilize the maximum $13.00 filing fee amount currently allowed by State
statute.
It is estimated that said increase would result in an additional ni ne hundred thousand dollars
($900,000.00) of revenue per year. Said estimate is based on the average number of civil
case filings in the Circuit Court of Cook County, which has traditionally hovered around
three hundred thousand filings per year.

267835

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated September 27, 2004:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization for the Purchasing
Agent to advertise for bids for the Cook County Bui lding Exterior Renovation Project. It is
respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
This project provides for the major restoration of the exterior of the Cook County Building.
The restoration wi ll include repair and/or rep lacement of the exterior support structures; tuck
pointing and cleaning of the fas:ade, and repair and/or replacement of the windows, including
the light courts. This restoration is necessary in order to remain in compliance with C hicago
Building Code Chapter 13-196 minimum requirements for existing bui ldings and to add ress
the repairs cited in the critical examination report filed with the City.
Bond Issue (7000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

*Referred to the Committee on Construction on 10/19/04.
Commi ssioner Silvestri asked ifthe County had been cited by the City of Chicago for violations.
Michael LaMont, Director of Capital Planning and Policy, replied that it is a permanent exterior
restoration of the fas:ade and the windows.
Commissioner Silvestri asked Mr. LaMont what he meant by permanent.
Mr. LaMont repl ied that " comprehensive" would be a better word than " permanent."
C ha irman Sims stated that Kehar Soodan, PhD, P.E., Principal/Director of Engineering, Soodan &
Associates, was present. She requested that Mr. Soodan give the committee a brief overview of the
project.
Mr. Soodan, stated that Soodan & Associates are honored to work on the project. He further stated that
they will be changing a number of things on the exterior of the building, giving the exterior a brand new
look. The windows will be brand new and operable. Mr. Soodan stated that the original design of the
Cook County Building is excellent.
Paul Tsotas, Architect, Soodan & Associates, stated that the windows wi ll be steel with insulated glass.
They will meet the fire rating requirements for the City of Chicago Bui lding Code.
Comm issioner Hansen asked what is the duration of the project.
Mr. Tsotas replied that it will be a two-year construction process.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if the City of Chicago has plans for restoration of its building.

3115

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF NOVEMBER 3, 2004

Mr. LaMont replied that the City of Chicago has no plans for restoration of its building. The County has
had discussions with the City of Chicago in regards to doing the project j ointly; however, the City of
C hicago stated that they have not budgeted for the project.
Commissioner Moreno asked if it was legal to do a request for proposals.
Mr. LaMont replied that he wasn 't sure if it would alter what the Federa l Court has decreed. Further, Mr.
LaMont stated that the decree has nothing to do with how the County procures construction contracts. It
has to do with construction contracts.
Commissioner Collins asked ifthe contracts can be broken up.
Mr. Soodan replied that it is more costly when contracts are broken up, but it can be done.
Chairman Sims suggested that the committee have the State's Attorney's Office look at the contracts to
see if they can be broken up.
Mr. LaMont suggested that the County take extra efforts to encourage mi nority and women business
opportunities and seek out the potential bidders.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Vice C hairman Butler, moved approval of Communication
No. 267835. T he motion carried.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF NOVEMBER 3, 2004

Chairman Suffredin stated that Municipal Code Corporati on is not interested in changing the Code but in
putting into a manageable form.
Helen Haynes, Assistant State's Attorney, Civil Actions Bureau, State' s Attorney Office, stated that
codifying the Code will be useful for legislative efforts. The County has contracted with Municipal Code
Corporation, and they have provided the Table of Contents, and a draft of Chapter One to defi ne
definitions and rules for interpretation of ordinances. The Executive Summary explains the various
departments affiliated with the Codification Project. Jack Weinrauch, Liquor Commissioner, James
Eldridge, Chief Administrative Officer, Jerry Prey, Industrial Engineer, Bennie Martin, Executive Law
Librarian, Karen Griffin, Executive Assistant to the C lO, Hollis Hanover, General Counsel, Chainnan
Suffredin's Office, and Joy Wykowski , Clerk of the Board, have been essential in the project;
additionally, several attorneys with the State' s Attorney' s Office worked under the tutelage of Elizabeth
Reedy, Division Chief for Transactions, Municipal Litigation and Real Estate Taxati on Division, State' s
Attorney's Office, to reviewed chapters of the Code. Ms. Haynes stated that Chairman Suffredin
proposed not to make major changes. The goal is not to be a legislator. There is use of gender neutral
terminology, changes in titles and numbering of ordinances. For further infonnation please refer to the
backup pertaining to the Codification Project.
Chairman Suffredin asked James Eldridge, Chief Administrative Officer, to give a summary regarding
what the President ' s Office has been planning.
Mr. Eldridge stated the following: This project has been a need of the County's for a significant amount
of time and was made a priority by President Stroger. As directed through the amendment in the 1999
budget, the industrial engineers prepared a Legislative Reference Bureau Study in which the primary
recommendation was to codify the County Ordinance prior to establishing a Legislative Reference
Bureau. Codifyi ng the County code is a task this group was directed to accomplish. He emphasized the
task was herculean. This g roup worked together for over a year-and-a-half on this project and put in
hundreds of hours. This project wou ld not have moved forward without the tremendous efforts and
resources put forth by the State ' s Attorney Office and by other County staff members previously
mentioned.
Ms. Haynes described that there were outdated statutory references in the ordinances. They updated
statutory citations in the ordinances. They did not revi se the ordinances substantively but just brought
them up to date.
Commissioner Murphy stated that she would li ke to make a recommendation to add "cruelty to animals"
to Animal Control, Chapter Ten.
Ms. Haynes responded in the affirmative and stated that she would have to check the chapter to ascertain
if there are any references to it. The team could ass ist Commissioner Murphy in drafting an ordinance
and be making it a part of the codification.
Vice Chairman Silvestri stated the following: It was his understanding that this project codifies what the
County currently has. He agreed with Commissioner Murphy that the County needs such an ordinance.
He also agreed that the County needs a new building ordinance and that th is is a separate issue.
Regarding this contract, if the County asks them to do beyond what is in the contract it would cost
additional money. The building ordinance should go to the Zoning and Building Committee. It is not
that the animal ordinance is going to confuse the issue but rather that if the County adds too much it wil l
possibly turn into a never-ending process, given 17 Commiss ioners' input.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF NOVEMBER 3, 2004

C hairman Suffredin stated that the current law of the County is being ascertained. The problem lies in not
knowing and going to many sources to find such information. The goal is to provide all the
Commissioners with the work that the MCC has compiled. From there the Commissioners can uncover
gaps in the law and introduce new ordinances into codification instead of relegating the ordinances to
supplemental editions.
Commissioner Murphy stated that her question was not in reference to the new ordinance but was a
statutory reference in the Agricultural Code.
Commissioner Sims asked whether the County is mirroring the City's Building Code, and whether there
are provisions for the County to change the Code to fit its needs.
Ms. Haynes responded that updated provisions will be adopted. The Ordinances should be geared
towards the County's requirements rather than the City ' s, even if it provides an excellent framework for
legislati ng.
Ms. Haynes stated she can craft exactly what she wants for the County. The County's Building
Ordinance applies to unincorporated Cook County. The County can adopt whatever Building Code it
desires as long as the Comm issioners deem it appropriate for the citizens.
C hai rman Suffredin stated that the County Ordinance has to have language that is appropriate for its use
so that the County can control revisions.
Commissioner Hansen suggested that the term "Animal Control" be retained because that is the primary
concern. In reference to chapter 34, page 204, he suggested that " Revenue and Taxation" be broken into
two parts to include " Finance." He stated that he would like hard copies of this document in add ition to
the disk.
Chairman Suffredin stated that hard copies and internet copies will be available.
Vice Chairman Silvestri asked whether governments sometimes adopt by reference and include language
that the County may be stuck with if it adopts the Ch icago' s Electrical Code as amended.
Ms. Haynes responded that the Electrical Code is part and parcel of the Building Code. The County
adopted the C hicago Electrical Code. The Cook County Electrical Code is the same as the City of
C hicago' s. Roger Merriam , Municipal Code Corporation, who is also an attorney, is an extremely
knowledgeable person who deals w ith codificati on-municipal and county-and deals with th is on a national
level. He recomm ended elimination of any references that might represent an adoption into the future .
Ms. Haynes stated that she, along with others, was try ing to get to the root of the County's Bui lding Code
and where it came from because the recommendation is that the existing Building Code remai ns with
some revisions. The City of Chicago adopted a version of the National Electrical Code which is put forth
by the National Fire Protection Association. She stated that the recommendation from the Building
Department is that the County adopt a recent version of the National Electrical Code and make revisions
to that Code based upon the County's requirements and submit their revisions as a proposal to the
Comm issioners for consideration.
Vice C hai rman S ilvestri asked ifthe Code will include dates of adoption.
Ms. Haynes stated that historical notes will be retained.

3 120

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF NOVEMBER 3, 2004

Mr. Martin stated that hi storically the date of adoption has appeared in the ordinance. The documents will
have dates, but no legislative hi story in the sense that it exists in some other statutes.
Vice Chairman Silvestri asked if the document will be produced in loose-leaf form. Chairman Suffredin
commented that this document should be available in an electronic version of the ordinance; additionally
the codes are usually published in loose-leaf form.
Commissioner Murphy stated that the "Section on Vegetation: in Chapter 82 specifically addresses the
eradication of Dutch Elm disease. She inquired whether that could be broadened to include any other
dangerous or invasive species of vegetation.
Ms. Haynes responded in the affirmative.
Commissioner Sims asked if the County will be eliminating or substituting ordinances and will these
ordinances no longer apply.
Chairman Suffredin noted that the County won't be substituting unless the County passes something new.
There will be working sessions to examine items that are to be stricken.
Commissioner Gorman asked when this project will be up and running.
Ms. Haynes stated that the MCC will return to the group a set of proofs in marked and unmarked formats
to ensure that changes have been made as recommended. She anticipated that this process would take
about six weeks. From there the process will be in the Board' s hands. The MCC can revise very quickly .
Within the next 2-3 months the proofs will be released.
Commissioner Peraica asked whether the amount appropriated for this compilation process is adequate
and whether they are on budget or are seeking additional money. He asked whether there is any
indication as far as the cost is concerned.
Chairman Suffredin stated that $75,000 was appropriated and that they are on budget.

Commissioner Murphy moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Sims. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.
