STAFF REPORT: 7-10-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER: 2019-6313
ADDRESS: 4444 SECOND
HISTORIC DISTRICT: WARREN PRENTIS
APPLICANT: JOE GALLAGHER
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 7/6/2019

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

PROPOSAL
The building located at 4444 Second was erected in 1920 to serve as an automobile show room and service
station. The rear wing or “annex” was erected in 1966 IS SET BACK back approximately 50’-0” from the
building’s original/main mass. The building is one story in height and features brick exterior walls with cast
stone accents. The roof at the western-most bay of the building and at the rear 1966 addition is flat. An
arched roof which is constructed of timber bow trusses is located at the eastern portion of the original building.
A white PVC membrane covers the roof. The existing windows, added ca. 2009, are aluminum. The
2010 building rehabilitation also included the installation of solar panels at the roof of the 1966 rear
annex and the establishment of an open brick paver patio at the site. A 6’-0”-high metal fence with brick
columns encloses the parcel. A 4-story apartment building sits directly to the south of the building, while a 3story apartment building is to the north. Non-historic, one-story commercial buildings with large paved/concrete
parking lots are located to the west of the building/across 2nd Avenue. Commercial and multi-family uses
predominate within THE BUILDING'S immediate vicinity.

With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to install new solar panels at the
arched/brow truss roof at the original portion of the building. Specifically, the current application proposes the
following:
•

Mount 32 solar panels on the south face of the bow-truss roof. The panels will be mounted 8" above the
roof, and parallel to the angle of the roof, with no additional slope on the panel. The panels will be
mounted to aluminum racking adhered to roof using U-Anchor heat weld attachments. As per the
submitted renderings, the panels will be arranged in two rows which will run east/west along the roof
surface. The array measures 6’-8”x 90’-0” overall and will be pushed back approximately 7 feet
back/east from the roof edge/parapet.

STAFF OBSERVATIONS
As noted above, solar panels (approved by the Commission in 2009) currently exist at the building’s rooftop.
Please see the attached drawing, which indicates the existing array’s location. Though visible from the right-ofway, it is staff’s opinion that the current are compatible with the the building's historic character. The
applicant has submitted a rendering which indicates that the proposed new panels will be minimally visible
from the public right-of-way. The new array will be pushed back 7’-0” from the roof edge and will be located at
the south face of the roof. Note that the parapet at the roof/wall junction is approximately 3’-0” high. It is
staff’s opinion that the positioning of the proposed new array will mitigate/minimize any potential negative
visual impacts. Also, in staff’s opinion, the proposed new panels will not detract from the district's and/or
building's historic features or spatial relationships because the prevailing character of the immediate
environment is commercial in nature and the panels are compatible with the “…diverse physical appearance...”
of the adjacent architectural resources.
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(7)
Relationship of materials. The majority of residential buildings are faced with brick, often
combined with masonry and/or wooden trim, architectural elements and details. The house at
110 West Forest Avenue is the only wood frame building in the district. Many storefronts of brick
commercial buildings have large plate glass windows. The majority of roofs visible from
the street are covered in asphalt, but slate exists; the roof of Detroit Central High School (now
“Old Main”) is metal, while its balconies are bronze. Wrought iron balconets and railings

 (8)

(9)

ornament several apartment buildings. Tile is used on the Goodrich Building at 4809 Woodward
Avenue.
Relationship of textures. The major textural relationship is that of brick laid in mortar, often
juxtaposed with wood and/or smooth, carved or molded cast stone elements and trim. Textured
brick and brick laid in patterns creates considerable interest where it exists. Slate roofs have
particular textural values where they exist, as does the metal roof of Detroit Central High School
(now “Old Main”). Asphalt shingles generally have little textural interest, even in those types
which purport to imitate some other variety.
Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors (such as red, yellow, brown, buff) predominate in
wall surfaces. Natural stone colors also exist, including gray, beige, brown and red. Roofs, the
majority of which are asphalt shingle, are in natural colors (tile and slate colors, natural and
stained wood colors). Paint colors often relate to style. The buildings derived from classical
precedents, particularly those of colonial revival, neo-colonial and renaissance revival styles,
generally have woodwork painted white, cream, or in the range of those colors. Colors known to
have been in use on similar buildings of this style in the eighteenth or early twentieth centuries
may be considered for appropriateness. Buildings of vernacular English revival styles generally
have painted woodwork and window frames of a dark brown or cream color. Victorian buildings
display a broad color palette. Tile and stained glass, where it exists as decoration visible on the
front facade, contributes to the artistic interest of the building. The original colors of any
building, as determined by professional analysis, are always acceptable for that building, and
may provide guidance for similar buildings.

RECOMMENDATION
As noted above, the proposed new solar panel array will be minimally visible from the public right-ofway. However, it is staff’s opinion that the proposed installation will not result in the removal of historic
materials or the alteration of features and spaces that characterize the building or district. Staff therefore
recommends that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the work a proposed because
it meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, standard number (2) the historic
character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or
alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided number (9) New
additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible
with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the
property and its environment and number (10) New additions and adjacent or related new
construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and
integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.

Proposed location for new panels

 

This request is regarding installation of additional solar panels at the Green Garage, 4444 2nd
Ave, Detroit 48201.
The building underwent a restoration and renovation, completed in November of 2011. As part
of the energy upgrades undertaken at that time, solar panels were approved by the Historic
Commision and installed on the flat roof of the north annex to the building..
This application is for installation of 32 additional panels on the south face of the bow-truss roof.
The roof is a white Duralast pvc membrane.
Scope of Work
• Obtain building and electric permits from City of Detroit Building Dept
• Mount panels to aluminum racking adhered to roof using U-Anchor heat weld
attachments
• Run electric wiring in conduit to existing panel location, and from there to electric service
room
• Obtain final inspections from city of detroit
• Provide required documentation to DTE to obtain approved interconnection agreement
The panels will be mounted 8" above the roof, and parallel to the angle of the roof, with no
additional slope on the panel. Sketchup modeling of the building shows the panels will be
barely visible from any street level viewing. Additional equipment will be located inside the
building electrical service room.
Enclosed are photos of the building, and screen shots from the Sketchup model representing
the building and views of the roof after addtion of the panels.
I am hopeful this can be administratively approved, due to the low visibility and impact on the
surrounding neighborhood.
Respectfully,
