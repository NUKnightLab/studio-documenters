Trustee Wright called the meeting to order.
The first order of business was review and adoption of Board orders as submitted by the Board’s counsel.
Board counsel, David Kugler, discussed the matter of Allen Hall, which was a case before the Board
earlier this year. This case was before the Court on Administrative review. After the initial hearing, the
Judge sent it back and wanted more definitive findings to be made by the Board based upon the record that
was before him. The order was redrafted with the Judge's comments in mind and was presented to the
Trustees.
“Pursuant to 40 ILCS 5/5-227 and for all the reasons stated herein, Hall's annuity benefit shall terminate
effective December 4th, 2014, the date he was sentenced for the felonies he was convicted of.”
It was moved by Trustee Lappe, seconded by Trustee Avila that the Board approve the order on Allen Hall
as submitted.

In the matter of Thomas Varga, the Board finds "Pursuant to 40 ILCS 5/5-214 and for all of the reasons
stated herein, Varga has not established entitlement to the police pension service credit for the period
April 27th, 2016, through November 9th, 2016, at which time he was employed as a police officer for the
Village of Glenview. As the statutory provision of the Act does not grant police pension service credit for
such service, Varga's request for police pension service credit for all or part of the time period requested is,
therefore, denied."
It was moved by Trustee Lappe, seconded by Trustee Avila that the Board approve the order on Thomas
Varga as submitted.
