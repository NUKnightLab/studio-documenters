Summary: The Bureau of Economic Development respectfully submits the attached Community
Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Replacement Housing project loan
recommendation in the amount of $2,000,000 to UP Holdings, LLC and Kenneth Young Center. The
project loan will be utilized to support CDBG-DR-eligible project costs incurred during the new

The requested CDBG-DR funds would subsidize the project via two permanent loans based upon the
following terms: The first $1,000,000 will be lent to Kenneth Young Center for the acquisition of the
land at a 2.58% interest rate, 30 year loan, and payable $25,758 per year. Unpaid principal accrues and is
due on sale, refinance or term. The other $1,000,000 will be lent to the project partnership at 0% interest
rate, 30 year loan, payable $2500 per year, Principal accrues until sale, refinance or term. The loan will
be due on sale or transferrable with Cook County permission. A twenty (20) year affordability period
will also apply.

Summary: G4S provides security services to ensure the safety of residents and employees of the Cook
County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center. The G4S services are necessary to maintain the
appropriate staff to resident ratio (which varies according to the activity and time of day) when security
staffing levels drop due to unexpected absences, terminations, and resignations. G4S employees are
required to comply with the same educational and training requirements as for regular JTDC staff.
Contract security services include night watch, escorted movement and control, direct residential
supervision, and emergency staffing on a 24 hours per day, 7 days per week basis.
The extension would allow adequate time to complete a Request for Proposal (RFP) process. In
accordance with a prior federal court order authorizing the former Transitional Administrator to enter
into contracts, this contract was previously awarded as a Sole Source Procurement pursuant to Section
34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.
