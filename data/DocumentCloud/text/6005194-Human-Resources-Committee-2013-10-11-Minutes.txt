**Report from Chief of Human Resources (Attachment #1)
Gladys Lopez, Chief of Human Resources, presented her report, which included information on the following
subjects: Recruiting (Social Media, Career Fairs and General Recruiting Update); 2013 Fiscal Year Vacancies
Filled; Request for Data – Reports; and Labor Relations. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the update, Chairman Wiese inquired regarding job postings on the CCHHS website; she noted that the
website does not reflect whether there are multiple positions available under each job posting. Ms. Lopez
responded that she will review the matter, as the postings should reflect whether there are multiple positions under
each job posting.

**Report from Chief of Human Resources (continued)
During the discussion of the information presented on diversity of employees, Ms. Lopez noted that the System
and Cook County use the six antiquated categories, as opposed to the seven Equal Employment Opportunity
(EEO) categories; however, the System is moving towards the implementation of a new system (expected to be
completed in December) that will include the seven EEO categories. Director Velasquez referenced issues relating
to identifying certain groups of populations within data collected and reported to the federal government. For U.S.
Census reporting, and for the Uniform Data Systems (UDS) Report, which is a core set of information appropriate
for reviewing the operation and performance of health centers, which is reported to the Health Resources and
Services Administration, under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, they request population data
but do not allow an individual to identify themselves as Latino or Mexican. She stated that she has met with
Congressman Luis Gutierrez on this matter, as it is a major issue for her community.
Ms. Lopez stated that the EEO categories include the race and ethnic codes – because Hispanic/Latino is not
considered a race, there is no code for that, but it can be tracked with the ethnic codes.
Chairman Wiese added that the category of American Indian has been totally destroyed. She noted that
affirmative action did not work for that group at all, because people were self-identifying but were not legally
recognized as such; that category has become diluted even more, so data will not help to find and address issues
such as where there are huge gaps in employment for that race.
Kevin Frey, Senior Labor and Employment Counsel, reviewed the information provided regarding Labor
Relations.
