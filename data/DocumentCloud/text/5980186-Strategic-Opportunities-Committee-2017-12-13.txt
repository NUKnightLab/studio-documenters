To:

Strategic Opportunities Committee & Budget Members

From:

John Maki, Executive Director

Date:

Re:

December 13th Joint Strategic Opportunities and Budget Committees
Meeting Information

This memo provides a brief overview of the joint Budget and Strategic Opportunities Committee
(SOC) meeting on Wednesday, December 13th from 1:00-3:00 p.m at ICJIA’s office at 300 West
Adams, Chicago, Suite 200.
A Budget Committee meeting will precede the SOC meeting. Given ICJIA’s significant increase
in grant making, particularly with the new state-funded grants, staff needed to schedule this extra
Budget meeting to hear program recommendations. Members of the SOC will be appointed to the
Budget Committee for the duration of the October 25th meeting, so they may vote on the
actionable items. Budget materials will be included in the informational email.
After the Budget meeting, the SOC meeting will begin with an overview of three of the agency’s
top policy initiatives going into to 2018.
First, we will ask your guidance on ICJIA’s work to establish Criminal Justice Coordinating
Councils (CJCCs), which are local-level planning strategic planning bodies. This initiative, which
we discussed at our May, 2016 Quarterly Board meeting, combines many of the priorities
Members identified at our December Quarterly meeting, including increased collaboration with
local jurisdictions, building capacity within local government agencies to apply for funding, and
promoting ICJIA throughout the State. Currently, ICJIA is working with county-based CJCCs,
which include McLean, Lake, McHenry, Winnebago, and St. Clair Counties. To help oversee
ICJIA’s work, Chair Elizabeth Robb has decided to create an ad hoc committee that will combine
members as well as stakeholders at the state and local levels and community organizations. We
also have a draft of a state plan that will guide our work on this issue over the coming year, which
will be included in our meeting materials along with a description of the work to date which was
begun under a technical assistance award from the National Criminal Justice Reform Project.
Second, staff will present on a planning award the agency received from the Office of Victims of
Crime, Vision 21: Linking Systems of Care for Children and Youth. Beginning in 2018, this
award will support ICJIA’s work to formulate a state strategic plan coordinating care for children
exposed to violence. Many of your offices provided letters of support for this application, and we
would like to give Board members a more detailed look at the work to be done.

Third, we want to discuss our efforts to develop a four-year Violence Prevention Plan, in keeping
with a pending statutory obligation to “develop, publish, and facilitate the implementation of a 4year statewide violence prevention plan” that “[incorporates] public health, public safety, victim
services, and trauma recovery centers and services.” Staff are currently working on a timeline for
the assessment phase of the plan.
We look forward to your participation and guidance.
Thank you,
John Maki
