The average daily balance in the interest-bearing account in order to provide a
benchmark against which to evaluate the rate of return the elected and appointed
officials are earning on the funds.

(d)
Any public funds in the possession or custody of an elected or appointed public official

County within seven days of the opening of such account.
(e)
Any elected or appointed public official who invests any public funds in any approved
depository which are in excess of the insured limits of such depository shall require that such depository
provide at least 102 percent collateral or provide a surety bond in an amount of 102 percent on any funds
in excess of the insured limit of such depository, except as provided in Subsection (f) of this section.

REQUESTING A NO-COST PILOT PROGRAM FOR
REVERSE AUCTION E-PROCUREMENT SOLUTION
WHEREAS, the FY2009 budget process again saw substantial cuts, with an across-the-board 4% budget
cut for all departments and elected officials with the exception of court ordered programs, and a 2% cut
for the Cook County Health & Hospitals System; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County government must continue to undertake serious efforts to create
efficiencies in the delivery of its services, not solely because of the current difficult economic situation
the country is faced with, but because it is the duty of this Honorable Body to ensure that taxpayers’
money is invested wisely and that this government is doing everything in its power to continually identify
cost savings and streamlining opportunities in order to deliver quality services in the most efficient and
cost effective manner possible; and

WHEREAS, reverse auctions have evolved to be able to meet the public sector procurement
requirements, which leads to increased savings, more efficient operations and decreased expenditures; and
WHEREAS, in addition to the increased savings, online reverse bidding solutions enable a transparent
process capable of being monitored in real-time; creates increased competition; improves vendor
participation; reduces procurement time cycle and government administrative costs; creates an audit trail
and reporting efficiencies; creates a disaster recovery archive; and
WHEREAS, online reverse auction providers can deliver a real-time, secure, web-based electronic
bidding process with all of the above mentioned benefits all at no cost to the governmental entity, with
fees being paid by the successful bidder; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois is now considering using said bidding solution to streamline its
procurement process, with the passing of House Bill 379, which has now moved to the Senate for further
consideration; and
WHEREAS, the City of Chicago has already completed a similar pilot program and is currently seeking
to expand the service, allowing all City of Chicago Departments to participate, with the same goal of
streamlining its procurement process and saving taxpayer dollars.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, does
hereby request that the Purchasing Department conduct a no-cost to the County pilot program for a
reverse auction e-procurement solution with the goal of qualifying and quantifying the efficiencies
created using this procurement solution and the accompanying savings; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the pilot program should have a duration of 12 months and include
no less than six procurements using the online reverse auction solution with three of the six procurements
consisting of one each of the following categories: services, commodities and construction.

REQUESTING THE INTEGRATION OF ORGANIC ENHANCING PRODUCTS
TO TREAT ROAD SALT
WHEREAS, the Cook County Highway Department has the responsibility of designing and maintaining
over 573 center line miles of highways, many of which, are part of the major arterial network that leads to
and from area expressways and toll roads, including two-lane highways, and has maintenance
responsibilities for 1,478 lane miles of pavement and 132 bridges, 351 traffic signals and 7 pumping
stations from five maintenance garages throughout Cook County; and
WHEREAS, snow removal, anti-icing and de-icing applied measures on all highways, bridges and roads
under the jurisdiction of Cook County are the responsibility of the Cook County Highway Department;
and
WHEREAS, de-icing is a reactive snow and ice control strategy that involves the application of a
chemical, most commonly road salt, on top of a layer of snow, ice, or frost that has already bonded to the
surface of the pavement; and

 page 15
POST BOARD ACTION AGENDA
Meeting of May 5, 2009

COMMISSIONERS continued
RESOLUTIONS continued
ITEM #10 cont’d
WHEREAS, anti-icing is a proactive strategy in which snow and ice control materials are applied before
a snow, ice or frost event, preventing precipitation from bonding with the pavement surface; and
WHEREAS, rates of application of road salt vary from 25 lbs to 400 lbs per lane mile with more road
salt per lane mile used the lower the actual temperature or forecasted temperature and the heavier
precipitation type; and
WHEREAS, up to 80 percent of untreated road salt is lost with traffic action to the roadside environment,
while pre-wetting or pre-treating the salt with liquid chemicals has proven to help the material “stick” to
the roadway; and
WHEREAS, the Median Cost per Ton of road salt has increased from $36 USD in 2003 to $120 USD in
2008 in the United States, with a final cost to Cook County during the 2008 winter of $125 per ton, a total
expense of four million dollars over the estimated budget for road salt; and
WHEREAS, according to the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 577,
published in 2007 and sanctioned by the National Academy of Sciences, all snow and ice control
materials can affect the environment with roadway application being the primary source of runoff,
causing significant localized effects; and
WHEREAS, the same report states that Chloride-induced corrosion of reinforcing steel from the use of
road salt is the most widely occurring cause of concrete deterioration, posing the highest risk to structural
integrity because it causes a very localized attack on the steel, resulting in high cost for maintenance and
repairs. Chloride-induced corrosion is also the primary cause of bridge steel structural corrosion; and
WHEREAS, loss of capital related to corrosion damage from the snow and ice control chemicals on
water supplies, health, vegetation, highway structures, vehicles, and underground utilities exceed 15 times
the amount of money spent on purchasing and applying said chemicals; and
WHEREAS, according to the NCHRP report, snow and ice-control organic products used in conjunction
with road salt, have demonstrated significant corrosion inhibiting characteristics as well as increased
overall product performance; and
WHEREAS, the use of snow and ice-control organic enhancers in conjunction with road salt, has proven
to be a cost effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional snow and ice-control products
by improving the road salt performance, reducing overtime costs, preventing corrosion and reducing the
overall environmental impact; and
WHEREAS, several Counties in Illinois have seen at least 20% savings in their cost of road salt by
integrating organic enhancers, including Du Page County for the last two years, Lake County for the
last three years, McHenry County for the last seven years, Winnebago County for the last year, Jo Daviess
County for the last five years, Peoria County for the last two years, Henry County for the last four years
and Knox County for the last four years; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Highway Department currently does not use organic enhancers in
conjunction with road salt for snow and ice-control.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby request that the Highway Department start the process of integrating organic enhancing products
to treat road salt provided that said products lower the cost to Cook County for snow removal and icecontrol expenses related to road salt usage, and equipment and structural maintenance for FY 2009 and
future years.

1862; and
WHEREAS, lead by Mexican General Ignacio Zaragoza Seguin, a small, poorly armed militia estimated

national unity and pride; and
WHEREAS, according to a paper published by the UCLA Center for the Study of Latino Health and
Culture in 2007, about the origin of the observance of Cinco de Mayo in the United States, the modern
American focus on this holiday first started in California in 1863 in response to the resistance to French
rule in Mexico, and has since been celebrated continuously while virtually ignored in Mexico, where it is
celebrated mainly in the southern town of Puebla and a few larger cities, and has to this day not been

WHEREAS, the Cook County Highway Department was established in 1913 by the State of Illinois upon
approval of the first officially recorded County highway system maps; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Highway Department has the responsibility of designing and maintaining
over 573 center line miles of highways, many of which, are part of the major arterial network that leads to

hereby urge that the Illinois General Assembly, amend Chapter 35 ILCS 505/8 (e) (2) (B) as follows:
16.74% to the counties of the State having 1,000,000 3,000,000 or more inhabitants; and

RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, in 1987 the National Stroke Association received a Presidential Proclamation to celebrate
“National Stroke Awareness Month” annually in May; and
WHEREAS, strokes occur when blood clots impede the flow of blood to the brain, thereby damaging the
brain; two-thirds of the people who experience a stroke are left with a disability; and
WHEREAS, stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States; and
WHEREAS, there are a number of steps you can take to avoid experiencing a stroke; indeed eighty
percent of all strokes are preventable; and
WHEREAS, the following are treatable diseases/conditions/behaviors that increase stroke risk: high
blood pressure (hypertension), atrial fibrillation, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, excessive alcohol
use and excessive weight; and
WHEREAS, “transient ischemic attacks” are brief episodes of stroke-like symptoms that last from a few
minutes to twenty-four hours; while these attacks cause no damage, they are often serious warning signs
of an impending stroke; and
WHEREAS, it is important to be able to recognize when a person has just experienced a stroke, and to
get them immediate medical treatment; the acronym “FAST” stands for “Face” – Ask the person to smile;
does one side droop?/ “Arm” – Ask the person to lift both arms; does one arm drift downward?/”Speech”
– Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase; does the speech sound slurred or strange?/”Time” – If you
observe any of these signs, call 911.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Todd H. Stroger, on behalf of the more than five
million residents of Cook County, do hereby recognize May as “National Stroke Awareness Month” in
Cook County, and do urge all residents to be cognizant of the steps they can take to minimize their risk of
experiencing a stroke as well as the steps they can take to respond in a swift manner to another’s or their
own stroke.

WHEREAS, Sr. Therese DelGenio met a homeless man at the Damen exit on the Stevenson Expressway

doctors who are willing to work pro bono for her cause; and
WHEREAS, in an profound way, Sr. DelGenio feels compelled by the Gospel challenge to feed the
hungry and minister to the poor; and yet, Sr. DelGenio was trained as an addictions counselor, and her
love is a tough love; she realizes that people must be able to do for themselves if they are to survive; and
WHEREAS, in addition to helping with shelter/housing placement and employment, PADS offers the
following services on-site and through off-site referrals: Evening Warming Center from October through
April; Daytime Cooling Center from May through September; nutritious, hot meals in winter; bag lunches
year round; shower facilities; change of clothing; haircuts; medical care; mental health care; rehab; eye
glasses; cost-free prescription drugs; and referrals to agencies to meet additional needs; and

Board of Commissioners, do hereby express my deep gratitude to Sr. Therese DelGenio for her ardent
sense of mission, and do hereby commend her for all of the inspired work she has accomplished on behalf

ITEM #60 cont’d
Reason:

Gary Rycyzyn’s help preparing the Cook County ballots exceeded the time and dollar value
allocated under this purchase order. The consolidated election in Cook County is one of the
most complex elections in the country. This year, the job of putting together the ballot was
made more difficult by late ballot changes, some occurring after early voting had started. Mr.
Rycyzyn worked for the Cook County Clerk's Office for 30 years and served as the Director
of Elections for twelve years. His knowledge of the complexities of the voting districts, data,
and experience managing the certification of over 3,100 candidates and the layout of over 800
ballot styles was invaluable. The expiration date of the purchase order was April 8, 2009.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $3,250.00. (524-260 Account).
Sufficient funds are available in the County Clerk's Election Division Fund.

submitting a proposed Taxing District Debt Disclosure Ordinance that would provide transparency in

Taxpayers are entitled to have readily available to them full disclosure of all debts and liabilities of each
taxing district. With few exceptions, this information is prepared as a matter of course each fiscal year
and would not require additional accounting work from taxing districts.
This proposed ordinance creates a single electronic repository which would allow taxpayers to
electronically access the financial information they need to make informed decisions about the taxing
districts they support. The Treasurer's Office website would house and maintain the electronic
infrastructure where each taxing district would be able to upload their information and make that
information electronically available to taxpayers.
