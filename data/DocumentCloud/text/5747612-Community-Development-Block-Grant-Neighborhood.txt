HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: Overview of the Community Development Block Grant/Neighborhood Opportunity
Fund Public Service (PS) and Public Facility Rehab (PFR) recommendations for
2019?20

This report provides an overview of the 2019-20 Community Development Block Grant
Neighborhood Opportunity Fund (N OF) program.

The City Flaming Commission (CPC) has completed its review of the recommendations of the
Mayor for the 2019-20 program year and is forwarding its recommendations to the Your
Honorable Body for consideration. On January 18, 2019, a chart listing recommendations from
the Housing and Revitalization Department (HRD), the Mayor?s of?ce, and the CPC was
submitted to Your Honorable Body at the end of the Formal Session of January 22, 2019.

Similar to the past several years, on Monday, January 28, 2019, the City Council is scheduled to
hold a public hearing for the NOF program and an appeals hearing. City Council is scheduled to
vote on the OF 2019?20 allocations on Tuesday, February 5, 2019.

BACKGROUND

The Housing and Revitalization Department (HRD) is the City?s lead department in
administering the OF program. This review focuses on funding amounts allocated to
community based organizations for PS and PFR. In July 2019, HRD informed City Council of
its plan to shift the Homeless Public Service (HP S) application review to the springtime, in order
to coincide with the Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) application review timeline.

APPLICATION REVIEW PROCESS

imeline for the 2019-20 Review

The timeline for the 2019-20 OF review is similar to the past few years, except for a
few changes. This year, the application was available earlier on the City?s system -
from August 31, 2018 through October 1, 2018, rather than last year?s September 13, 2017
through October 16, 2017 submittal timeline. The NOF proposals were due on Monday, October
1, 2018 by 4:00 PM. This earlier submittal deadline gave City staff additional time to review the
applications.

Proposal Writing Workshops

HRD hosted two proposal writing workshops. The ?rst workshop was held Saturday, August 18,
2018 ?Focus Hope. The second workshop was held on Wednesday,
September 12, 2018 from 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM at the Samaritan Center. Also, to meet the
workshop requirement, groups were allowed to view a series of videos on the City?s YouTube

page.

Submittals and Review 

Similar to previous years, PS has ?ve sub?categories: education, health, public safety, recreation
and seniors. The total number of applications received this year for PS was 48 compared to 46
last year. The total number of applications this year for PFR was 10 compared to 13 last year.
HRD screened the proposals and determined that the PFR did not meet
threshold requirements listed in the application. A summary of the 10 proposals that did not meet
threshold are listed on page 4 of the chart.

HRD worked in cooperation with CPC staff, the Of?ce of Grants Management (OGM) and the
Of?ce of Contracting and Procurement (OCP) in reviewing the submitted OF
applications. During the months of October and November, CPC staff met with staff from HRD,
OGM, and OCP to conduct a joint review and scoring of each proposal. Each proposal was
scored separately ranging from 0 to 100 points using a scoring criteria grid; then the staff met to
discuss each proposal and develop a single consensus proposal ranking. It was agreed amongst
staff that proposals scoring less than 80 points would be not be recommended for funded due to a
low score. Afterwards, HRD reviewed the number of proposals, ?nal consensus data, and
anticipated entitlement amounts, in order to determine HRD recommended funding amounts.

CDBG FUNDING
The City of Detroit CDBG allocation, as well as the rest of the country, for 2019-20 from HUD

has not yet been released. The following table shows the amount of the Detroit CDBG allocation
for the past seven years, as well as the City?s projection for 2019-20.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Year Detroit CDBG Allocation Change From Previous Year
2019-20 $32,660,442 projected

2018?19 $34,379,413 increase $3,087,522 
2017?18 $31,291,891 decrease $80,494 
2016-17 $31,372,385 decrease $157,663 
2015-16 $31,530,048 decrease $579,123 
2014-15 $32,109,171 decrease $767,914 
2013-14 $32,877,085 decrease $476,424 
2012-13 $33,353,509

 

 

 

The table shows an allocation around $31 million for the past several years, with slight decreases
each year. However, last year for 2018-19, the City projected $29,727,296, but instead received
$34,379,413, a 9.9% increase. For 2019-20, HRD is projecting a 5% decrease from last year.

Public Service 15 Cap

Federal regulations require that no more than 15% of the entitlement funds (plus program income)
be allocated toward PS and HPS funding. The Administration is allocating $2,205,000 for PS for
2019-20 verses $2,065,000 that was originally allocated and then increased to $2,794,992 for

2018-19.

Threshold Criteria and Funding Priorities

Back in 1994, City Council first approved eligibility criteria for both funded
proposals. Since then, City Council has relied increasingly on the criteria to determine eligibility of
the proposals. In July of 2007, partly in response to concerns of HUD, the City Council adopted
Joint Threshold Criteria to be utilized by both the legislative and executive branches of
governinent. For this year, the Administration and City Council?s join tthreshold criteria was

listed in the application.

In June 2018, CPC staff asked each Council Member to identify and rank funding priorities for PS,
via a survey form. As a part of the 2019-20 application, the following priorities were listed:
1) Priorities for PS (Public Safety, Seniors, Education, Recreation, and Health)
2) Priorities for Non-Public Service (Economic Development, Housing, Public Facilities, and
Demolition).

CPC REVIEW AND RECOMMENDATION

At its meeting on December 6, 2018, the City Flaming Commission received the subject chart
with the recommended funding amounts. The CPC for its deliberations went through
each page of the chart discussing the various proposals. At its meeting on January 17, 2019, the
City Flaming Commission received the Mayor?s recommendations. The CPC discussed various
aspects of the scoring and threshold criteria. In conclusion, the CPC recommended acceptance
of the Mayor?s recommendations.

apartments buildings that will include approximately 149 apartments and 600 square feet
of retail space. The three buildings and the land under and adjacent to the buildings (the
?Condo Land?) are expected to be owned within a condominium that will have two or more
condominium units, one of which will be owned by the Developer or its af?liate and one
of which will be owned by the LDHA. Approximately 91 of the apartments will be within
the condominium unit owned by the Developer and the remaining 58 apartments will be
rented as affordable apartments with rents restricted and otherwise subject to various
requirements to assure their occupancy by residents who satisfy affordable housing criteria.

A portion of the remainder of the Property will be used for parking that will remain in place
inde?nitely for use by tenants of the new apartment buildings as well as additional parking
that will be available until alternative, permanent alternative parking becomes available
either on the east side of Brush or at other locations. It is expected that the alternative
parking will not be available for at least several years.

It is currently anticipated that construction, including eligible activities, will begin in the
Spring of 2019 and be completed by early 2021. The project description provided herein
is a summary of the proposed development at the Property at the time of the adoption of
the Plan. The actual development may vary from the project description provided herein,
without necessitating an amendment to this Plan, so long as such variations are not material
and arise as a result of changes in market and/or ?nancing conditions affecting the project

and/or are related to the addition or immaterial removal of amenities to the project. All
such changes, as determined by DBRA in its sole discretion, to the project description are
subject to the approval of the DBRA staff and shall be consistent with the overall nature of
the proposed development, its proposed public purpose, and the purposes of Act 381.

In large part due to the project?s importance to providing mixed income housing
opportunities in the reviving Brush Park area, the project has received extensive support
and approvals from the City of Detroit and its af?liates, including the City?s Housing and
Revitalization Department (HRD), the City?s Planning and Development Department
(PDD), the City Planning Commission, and the Historic District Commission; the
allocation of HOME funds and CDBG funds, and allocation of federal low income tax
credits.

Attachment provides a detailed description of the project to be completed at the Property
(the ?Project?) and Attachment includes letters of support for the Project.

B. Bags of Eligibility (Section and Section 203))

The Property is considered ?eligible property? as de?ned by Act 381, Section 2, because
it was previously utilized for a commercial purpose and/or public purpose; it is
located within the City of Detroit, a quali?ed local governmental unit under Act 381; and
it is a facility under Part 201 due to the presence of metals, PNAs, PCBs soil and ?ll or
adjacent and contiguous to a facility and the development of the adjacent or contiguous
parcels is estimated to increase the captured taxable value of the remainder of the eligible

property.

C. Summary of Eligible Activities ?u Description of Costs (Section 
The ?eligible activities? that are anticipated to be carried out at the Property for the Project
are considered ?eligible activities? as de?ned by Section 2(0) of Act 381, because they
include baseline environmental assessment activities, due care activities, additional
response activities, site preparation, infrastructure improvements, development and
preparation of a brown?eld plan and work plan, brown?eld plan implementation and
interest.

A summary of the eligible activities and the estimated cost of each eligible activity intended
to be paid for with Tax Increment Revenues from the Property are shown in the table
attached hereto as Attachment E. A response activity plan has been prepared for the
removal, disposal and back?ll of solid waste or impacted ?ll and soils together with any
encountered impacted groundwater, all of which will be disposed of off?site during
construction of the Project. Due to the historic ?ll and urban conditions on the Property,
the con?rmed presence of hazardous substances in a substantial portion of the soil borings,
and disposal facility requirements, the removed ?ll and shallow soils are expected to need
to be disposed at a Type II disposal facility. Deeper native soils (including that which may
be required to be removed for construction of underground detention and elevator pits) may
be disposed of as clean material, depending upon test results. Unknown quantities of
groundwater are expected to be encountered during dewatering and other construction

297054725

Brush Park South (Phase 1)
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

activities with resulting costs being expected to be incurred for collection, testing and
disposal of groundwater depending upon test results in accordance with law.

The eligible activities include response activities to properly manage contaminated soils
on the Property; geotechnical evaluations; removal and replacement of ?ll material; storm
water management features; and improvements in the rights of way of adjacent streets and
alleys. The eligible activities described in Attachment are not exhaustive. Subject to the
approval of DBRA staff in writing, additional eligible activities may be carried out at the
Property, without requiring an amendment to this Plan, so long as such eligible activities
are permitted by Act 381 and the cost of such eligible activities does not exceed the total
costs stated in Attachment E.

Unless otherwise agreed to by the DBRA, all eligible activities will commence within than
eighteen months after the date the governing body approves this Plan. All eligible activities
will be completed within three years after approval of the Michigan Strategic Fund work
plan, if applicable, or three years after execution of the Reimbursement Agreement (as that
term is de?ned below). Any long-term monitoring or operation and maintenance activities
or obligations that may be required will be performed in compliance with the terms of this
Plan and any documents prepared pursuant to this Plan.

The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities incurred by it or
its af?liates (including but not limited to the LDHA) and interest thereon as described
below. Some eligible activities may commence prior to the adoption of this Plan and to
the extent permitted by Act 381 shall be reimbursable pursuant to the Reimbursement
Agreement. Tax increment revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the
DBRA and used to reimburse the cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property
pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement to be executed by the DBRA and the
Developer after approval of this Plan (the ?Reimbursement Agreement?), to the extent
permitted by Act 381. In the event this Plan contemplates the capture of tax increment
revenue derived from ?taxes levied for school operating purposes? (as de?ned by Section
2(uu) of Act 381 and hereinafter referred to as ?School Taxes?), the Developer
acknowledges and agrees that obligation to reimburse the Developer for the cost
of eligible activities with tax increment revenue derived from Local Taxes, or Speci?c
Taxes that are considered Local Taxes (as these capitalized terms are de?ned by Act 381)
is contingent upon: the Developer receiving at least the initial applicable work plan
approvals by the Michigan Strategic Fund and the Michigan Department of Environmental
Quality, as may be required pursuant to Act 381, within 180 days after the date this Plan is
approved by the governing body, or such other date as the DBRA may agree to in writing;
or (ii) the Developer providing the DBRA with evidence, satisfactory to DBRA, that the
Developer has the ?nancial means to complete the project without the capture of, and
subsequent reimbursement with, the contemplated School Taxes.

The costs listed in Attachment are estimated costs and may increase or decrease
depending upon the nature and extent of environmental contamination and other unknown
conditions encountered on the Property. The actual cost of those eligible activities
encompassed by this Plan that will qualify for reimbursement from tax increment revenues

Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

of the DBRA from the Property shall be governed by the terms of the Reimbursement
Agreement. No costs of eligible activities will be qualified for reimt'nu'sement except to
the extent permitted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Reimbursement
Agreement and Act 381. The Reimbursement Agreement and this Plan will dictate the
total cost of eligible activities subject to payment or reimbursement, provided that the total
cost of eligible activities subject to payment or reimbursement under the Reimbursement
Agreement shall not exceed the estimated costs set forth in Attachment B. As long as the
total costs are not exceeded, line item costs of eligible activities may be adjusted after the
date this Plan is approved by the governing body, to the extent the adjustments do not
violate the terms of the approved MDEQ or MSF work plan.

D. Estimate of Captured Taxable Value and Tax Increment Revenues

use and upon any reimbursement of the expenses permitted by this Plan, will be provided
solely under the Reimbursement Agreement contemplated by this Plan.

Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Developer, the DBRA, and the State of Michigan, the

education tax, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, on a parcel of eligible property to
the Department of Treasury under Section l3b(14) of Act 381, the percentage of local taxes
levied on that parcel and used to reimburse eligible activities for the Project under this Plan
shall not exceed the percentage of local taxes levied on that parcel that would have been
used to reimburse eligible activities for the Project under this Plan if 50% of the taxes levied
under the state education tax, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, on that parcel were

Project Description

Brush Park South Owner LLC and its af?liate(s) (the ?Developer?) intends to redevelop
approximately 3.406 acres of land located west of Brush Street, north of Winder Street and
south of the east-west alley between Adelaide and Alfred Street from Brush Street to John 
Street, for the construction by it and RS Limited Dividend Housing Associates, LLP 
of three mixed-income apartments buildings that will include approximately 149 apartments
and 600 square feet of retail space. The three buildings and the land under and adjacent to the
buildings (the ?Condo Land?) is expected to be owned within a condominium that will have
two condominium units, one of which will be owned by the Developer or its af?liate and one
of which will be owned by the LDHA. Approximately 91 of the apartments will be within the
condominium unit owned by the Developer and the remaining 58 apartments will be rented as
affordable apartments with rents restricted and otherwise subject to various requirements to
assure their occupancy by residents who satisfy affordable housing criteria.

A portion of the remainder of the Property will be used for parking that will remain in place
inde?nitely for use by tenants of the new apartment buildings as well as additional parking that
will be available until alternative, permanent alternative parking becomes available either on
the east side of Brush or at other locations. It is expected that the alternative parking will not be
available for at least several years.

As project plans are subject to revision, the actual dimensions and capacities of all buildings
and improvements may vary from this description. The estimated total capital investment is
approximately $37 Million.

The Project is anticipated to create at least approximately 250 construction jobs during a 23
month construction period and an estimated 4 to 6 permanent full-time equivalent jobs related
to property management. An unknown number of jobs are expected to be created by one or
more businesses that located in the retail component of the project.

Preliminary eligible activities engineering, planning, etc.) started in 2016. Construction is

expected to start in February, 2019, be substantially completed by December, 2020 and be
completed by early 2021.

RE: Brush Park South Development Project
Dear Mr. Vosburg,

On behalf of Midtown Detroit, Inc. (MDI), I would like to express our support for the proposed
residential development project Brush Park South.

MDI understands that this project will be eligible for brownfield tax incremental reimbursements.
These reimbursements will provide a valuable financial benefit to support the completion of the
project, which will be a much-needed bene?t to the surrounding neighborhood.

This project will add 149 new residential apartments, 58 of which will be reserved as affordable
housing. 29 of the 58 affordable units will have project-based vouchers that will further support
housing affordability in the neighborhood. The addition of new units, both market rate and
affordable, will provide more housing options for an area facing 98% occupancy and rising rental
rates.

The overall activation of this site will build upon revitalization efforts taking place in the Brush
Park neighborhood and will continue to push the City of Detroit forward. It is for this reason that

MDI is pleased to offer its full support for this project. Should you have any questions, please feel
free to contact me at 313.420.6000.

Since rely,

parcels had elevated lead (above DC) in?ll along with mercury in excess of 600 ug/kg at multiple widespread locations.

RE: Request for LPD to Draft an emergency ordinance establishing a 90-day moratorium

on evictions of tenants with subsidies affected by the Federal Shutdown

 

In an effort to protect some of Detroit?s most vulnerable residents who, through no fault of their
own, may subject to eviction for non-payment related to the Federal Shutdown, I am requesting
that LPD draft an emergency ordinance establishing a 90-day moratorium on eviction of affected
tenants. The moratorium should remain in place 90 days from adoption or 30 days after the end
of the federal shutdown, whichever is sooner.

For tenants relying on federal programs, the Federal Shutdown has already created a signi?cant
amount of anxiety. Thus, eliminating the threat of eviction for those tenants could greatly
improve their quality of life during these dif?cult times.

Thank you.

RE: Analysis of Secondary Naming of Streets

 

On March 29, 2016, City Council adopted an amendment to Chapter 50 of the
Detroit City Code to modify the procedures by which secondary street signs are
established. Since that time, there have been several secondary street signs
established throughout the city consistent with the revised procedures. I am
requesting that the Historic Designation Advisory Board (HDAB) provide a
report outlining the number of requests received and granted for each calendar
from 2015 through 2018 along with general classi?cations of the historic
character of the requests scienti?c/technological contributions, religious
signi?cance, entertainment, etc.).

I am also requesting the HDAB and LPD prepare an amendment to the ordinance
that establishes a maximum number of signs that may be permitted annually. The
individual signs to be granted would be determined by resolution of City Council
after an annual review of all signs requested for that calendar year. Lastly, I am
requesting an amendment to create secondary street sign eligibility requirements
that include, at a minimum, a requirement that the honoree be deceased.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact DeAndree
Watson of my of?ce at (313) 224-0278. Thank you in advance for your prompt
