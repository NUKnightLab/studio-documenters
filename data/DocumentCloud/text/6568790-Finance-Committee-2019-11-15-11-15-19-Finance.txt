PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:

 
 

Contract number H17-25-019 was approved by the Cook County Health (CCH) Board of Directors on 12/1612016 in
the amount of $857,598.00, for the thirty-six (36) month period of 12/16/2016 thru 12/15/2019.

 
   
     
 

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
This request is for the continual provision of maintenance and support of the Bed Tracking and Pre Admit software

applications that helps prevent overcrowding and patient wait time. This software uses existing telephone and pager 3
networks to reach environmental service employees who then access all necessary information through an 
interactive Voice Response System. This communication and information flow helps reduce the number of
emergent cleaning requests, improves bed turnover, and helps streamline and optimize patient flow.

 
   
     
     
 
    

This request is a sole source due to the proprietary software that can only be maintained by Teletracking. To switch
to another Bed tracking and Pre Admit software solution at this time would be both cost prohibitive and disruptive to

operations.

 
    
   
   
 

TERMS OF REQUEST:
This is a request to extend and increase contract number H17-25-019 in the amount of $510,731.00, as needed, for

a period of twelve (12) month from 12/16/2019 through 12/15/2020.

Observations on Financials
Revenues
§  Net Patient Service Revenues - $562M, 6% unfavorable to target due to increasing and unsustainable
growth in charity care, some lower clinical activity and lower revenue cycle activity
•  System-wide uninsured numbers
•  Captured by Visits, held at 45%
•  Captured by Charges, held at 40%
§  CountyCare Capitation Revenues - $1.4B, 5% unfavorable to target due to lower than budgeted
enrollment as a result of lower State/County MCO enrollment. There is a corresponding reduction in
expenses as a result.
§  Other Revenues - $13M , trending to exceed FY2019 target

Expenses
§  Cost of Pharma - $69M, unfavorable by 3% compared to budget and closely monitored/managed to get to
