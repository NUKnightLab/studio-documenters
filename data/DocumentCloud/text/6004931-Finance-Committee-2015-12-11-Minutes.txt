III. Action Items
A. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, November 20, 2015
Acting Chairman Estrada noted that these minutes will be presented to the Board for approval at the December 18,
2015 Board Meeting. Typically when minutes are presented to the Committee they have already received Board
approval, but this meeting was held on the same day as the Board Meeting, so the minutes were not available for
approval at the November 20, 2015 Board Meeting.
Director Butler, seconded by Director Richardson-Lowry, moved to approve the
minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting of November 20, 2015. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Action Items (continued)
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration.
With regard to request number 5, regarding the purchase of reinsurance for CountyCare members, Director
Gugenheim asked what happens to those CountyCare members who are excluded from the contract because of
previous medical conditions. Mr. Elwell responded that the responsibility then falls to CCHHS to continue the
care and find the money through the process.
With regard to request number 6, Director Velasquez inquired whether nursing homes generally accept
undocumented patients. Mr. Elwell responded that it is his understanding that nursing homes generally accept
anyone who can pay for it or who has insurance; this is very different from the hospital industry, as there are
very few not-for-profit nursing homes, and most of those are based with a very specific constituency.
Mr. Elwell provided additional information on the subject of nursing homes and readmissions. He stated that,
at this point, CCHHS does not have a big Medicare population, but penalties relating to readmissions can grow
to $1-3 million over time. The federal government has shown that hospitals that work primarily in the safety
net are penalized more for readmissions than any other group of hospitals; he noted that the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) does not look at the distinction for people who are readmitted because
there is no other community option available. Mr. Elwell indicated that efforts are being made to address this
issue by identifying community resources and opportunities and connecting patients to them.
With regard to request number 8, Mr. Elwell stated that this request will give staff about seven (7) months to
reevaluate all of the temporary staffing services, to determine whether any of the contracted services can be
brought in-house or whether they should be kept on a contracted services basis. After the assessment is
completed, he will report those findings to the Board; the issuance of a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the
services that will remain on a contracted basis will follow.
Mr. Elwell provided information in response to previous requests from Director Wiese regarding the number
of contracted staff at CCHHS. He stated that there are approximately 223 temporary staff at CCHHS; this
number does not include nurses and lab staff.
Approximately 223 Temporary Staff - consists of:
• 1/3 are security (outlying clinics, Provident Hospital)
• 76 temporary staff – Information Technology
• 16 temporary staff - Clinical engineering
• 25 temporary staff - Temporary coders (should be gone by February)
• 8 temporary staff – Sterile Processing Department, Surgery (will eventually go away)
• 11 temporary staff – associated with linen contract
• 5 temporary staff - Supply Chain – (in process of bringing in-house)
• 3 temporary staff - interim leadership (while recruiting for positions)
• #__ temporary staff – Sodexo contract - providing managers relating to janitorial services
Agnes Therady, Executive Director of Nursing, indicated that, with regard to nurse staffing, on any given day,
she estimated that there are approximately 47 temporary staff relating to nursing services across the System;
she added that those temporary nursing services are not used unless the regular staff is not available.

Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Board Chairman Hammock inquired regarding accounting in Human Resources reports for positions that may
be vacant but are being filled with temporary staff; under those circumstances, are those positions reflected in
Human Resources reports as being not vacant? Mr. Elwell stated that it is divided into two (2) different
categories. The first category is what he calls “true temporary” - the position is reflected as vacant in the
reports, but for various reasons, while recruiting for the position, there may be temporary staff in that position,
performing those functions. The second category relates to services that have been provided contractually for
years, for which no budgeted positions exist; examples of contracted services under that category include those
involving security and Clinical Engineering - vacant positions do not exist relating to those services.
With regard to request number 9, Mr. Elwell stated that he will provide information on the number of patients
receiving care under this contract.
With regard to request numbers 10, 11 and 14, Mr. Elwell stated that these contracts were initially procured
under the Group Purchasing Organization (GPO). The extension of these contracts will allow the
administration time to analyze the competition amongst the suppliers under the GPO, and also to go through
the value analysis process for these products; this involves working with physicians in the evaluation and
selection of products, with the end goals of standardization and getting the maximum value from a safety and
cost perspective.
With regard to request number 12, Mr. Elwell stated that this originally was a GPO contract, but the vendor
recently dropped out of the GPO. The justification for sole source selection methodology is that this particular
vendor employs technology that is not available in any other micro-catheter; they are the only ones approved to
have this technology. Until other vendors have that technology, CCHHS need to remain with this vendor, in
the best interests of its patients. Director Richardson-Lowry commented that it is helpful that this information
on sole source justification is being read into the record; knowing that this is a highly specialized type of
catheter helps the Directors in terms of making an informed decision of whether or not this should be classified
as sole source.
With regard to request number 16, Director Richardson-Lowry requested that the reagents cost percentage be
provided. Mr. Elwell responded that he will provide that information. Additionally, he provided an update on
a possible collaborative project for laboratory services that is expected to reduce costs; under this
collaboration, CCHHS would provide the employees and laboratory services, and the partners would move
their lab work to CCHHS. Under this proposed contract, the more tests that are done on this type of
equipment, the more the cost goes down.
Mr. Elwell stated that he hopes to bring additional information on the return on investment (ROI) to the Board
Meeting on request number 16. Director Richardson-Lowry requested that, at the end of this contract period, it
is important that Mr. Elwell return and report to the Committee on the value add associated with this particular
contract, particularly given its length and breadth of service and supply categories.
Mr. Elwell stated that Acting Chairman Estrada has requested that information be provided to Directors when
they are considering contractual requests that indicates what percentage of the budget the contract covers and
how it compares to the budget. He stated that he will present that to the Finance Committee for all future
requests; he will provide a sheet that lists that information for each of the items, along with a running total for
the budget categories.

Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Acting Chairman Estrada stated for the record that, by chairing the meeting today, this has given him a very
different perspective on the meeting itself and the level of understanding; based on that observation, at some
point, it may be worth having a rotating co-chair.
With regard to request number 17, Mr. Elwell stated that this request relates to the current system that has been
in place for approximately fourteen (14) years; this is for software that reports out from the lab, among other
things, and it is considered as “first in class” internationally. The administration initially planned to issue an
RFP or convert it to Cerner; however, after discussing this with representatives from Cerner, they said it is not
the right time to bid this. They recommended that CCHHS complete the conversion to automation first, then
do a rational build and a rational competition; he predicted that this would not happen for at least 2-3 years.
The administration’s recommendation to the Board is to execute this sole source contract, and then issue an
RFP when competition is stronger.
With regard to request number 25, which was identified as a sole source contract, Mr. Elwell noted that, as part
of the review of potential products, the Compliance Department evaluated two (2) other potential compliance
systems; he added that those systems would have cost more money. CCHHS already has some modules from
this group, so this contract combines all of those pieces together. Director Richardson-Lowry stated that she
appreciates the clarification regarding sole source. She noted that the process followed by staff in providing
information via a memorandum dated December 10, 2015 that clarified the need for that sole source contract
was exactly the kind of hygienic process she prefers. By referencing that memorandum in this meeting, it
automatically becomes part of the record. Going forward, when a Director has that kind of question during a
pre-meeting briefing with staff, the kind of clarification like this in writing, which can be added to the record,
adds to the transparency and accountability of this organization, and is the right thing to do.
With regard to request number 26, Mr. Elwell stated that this relates to the nurse call system, which is a
thirteen (13) year old overhead paging system; it is original to the building. Originally the administration
planned to execute a three (3) year contract with parts to keep the existing system going; he noted that this is a
sole source contract because this is the only registered dealer in the County. However, the administration has
now decided to execute a one (1) year agreement and issue an RFP for a whole new system. If the new system
can be installed sooner, the administration can cancel this contract for convenience at any point in time time.
Mr. Elwell noted for the record that all CCHHS contracts contain clauses that allow CCHHS to terminate the
contract for convenience.
With regard to request number 27, Mr. Elwell stated that this is a sole source contract, as this vendor is the
only registered authorized repair company for these emergency generators. He noted that staff will be looking
into the question of what happens if an “unauthorized” vendor is used for repairs.
In response to questions raised previously, Mr. Elwell provided information on savings relating to the 340b
drug pricing program. He stated that the annual spend across the whole System for pharmacy is between $6465 million. Last year, CCHHS’s savings totaled $159,602,304.01 as a result of 340b pricing, so the savings is
greater than the expenditure by a margin of almost 2:1.
Director Gugenheim requested that an explanation regarding the pending status of requests relating to Contract
Compliance be included in the record. Mr. Elwell stated that, to date, the current process for this function
involves the review and confirmation by Maleya Edwards, from the Department of Contract Compliance, of
the vendor’s responsiveness to the County’s Ordinance on Minority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprises
(M/WBE). Ms. Edwards is working very hard to get this completed, and best efforts are made to make sure all
Page 4 of 63

 III.

Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
of the requests are reviewed and found to be in compliance before the Board Meeting; occasionally some are
approved by the Board in a pending status, but the contract does not move forward for execution until Contract
Compliance has indicated in writing that the vendor has been found to be responsive to the County’s M/WBE
Ordinance by either meeting the M/WBE goals or being issued a waiver by Contract Compliance.
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided an overview of request numbers 28, 29 and 30.
He stated that the requests relate to benefits management services; he anticipates that he will provide
information next month regarding costs of clinical payments that will be paid out to providers. These three (3)
requests total $19.4 million in administrative expenses; this represents a reduction in fees by about $7.6
million. Additionally, he clarified that the summary table for these three (3) contractual items reflects the
number of proposals for each of these requests; this differs from the transmittals, which reflect the number of
responders.
With regard to request number 29, Mr. Glass stated that First Transit is a broker of transportation benefits
management services; they hold contracts with the transportation providers directly, and require all of their
providers to be Medicaid-certified. They are also the transportation vendor for the State’s Medicaid fee-forservice program.
With regard to request number 28, it was indicated that a waiver was requested by the vendor in relation to
compliance with the County’s M/WBE Ordinance; Director Richardson-Lowry stated that, for the record, she
is incredulous that United HealthCare cannot find a way to meet the requirements under the M/WBE
Ordinance in all of the supply categories in which they will be engaged. This is a pattern with this type of
entity across many governmental bodies; she is going to trust that this will be made known during the
negotiations with the vendor - in their photocopying needs, messenger service needs, etc. there are ample
opportunities for them to consider women-owned businesses and other diverse groups for service categories.
This is a perennial problem with this particular entity, and she wants it stated on the record that this Board will
be asking questions of them with regularity, because they seem to not be able to find their way on this matter.
If the vendor cannot figure it out, then perhaps the Cook County Commissioners need to have a different kind
of discussion with them, because this is a pattern.
Mr. Elwell clarified that, as far as the component relating to Contract Compliance, the vendor has to negotiate
with staff from the Department of Contract Compliance, which is under the County’s jurisdiction. They are
the only ones who can sign off regarding Contract Compliance; CCHHS’ administration can make
recommendations to them, but at the end of the day, it is Contract Compliance making the decision on the
vendor’s responsiveness to the County’s M/WBE Ordinance.
Director Richardson-Lowry stated that, for DentaQuest (request number 30), who is also requesting a waiver,
she does not have as much information on their history, but she does find it incredible that they cannot find a
category in which women can provide services. If CCHHS is going to be in the business of having this kind of
spend with these kinds of entities, it has a duty to hold them accountable. These entities should anticipate this
being an ongoing question for them; if this pattern continues, what may need to happen is, as opposed to
having staff being subjected to being berated, perhaps representatives from the entity themselves will be
invited to show up and the Board can have a conversation with them. Board Chairman Hammock asked Mr.
Elwell to report back to the Board or Committee after the review by Contract Compliance is completed, to
explain what they used as justification for either finding the vendor responsive to the M/WBE Ordinance
(vendor meets the goals) or issuing a waiver. Mr. Elwell responded affirmatively; he noted that, if M/WBE

Page 5 of 63

 III.

Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
goals are set for a contract, compliance with those goals is monitored by Contract Compliance over the life of
the contract. If the those goals are not met, Contract Compliance may recommend termination of the contract.
Acting Chairman Estrada inquired as to the best way to communicate this Committee’s thoughts on this
subject to Contract Compliance. Mr. Elwell stated that Ms. Edwards is not present today, as she is working to
complete her work on the CCHHS contracts; normally she would be in attendance at this meeting. Acting
Chairman Estrada asked that Mr. Elwell invite Ms. Edwards to attend the next Finance Committee Meeting
and address this directly. Director Richardson-Lowry commented that, once a waiver is obtained by the
vendor, it would be very rare that compliance would be altered over the course of the contract; the vendor is
unlikely to step outside of “waived” status once a waiver is issued. If the Committee recommends moving
forward with this request, it has to do so with the caveat that the Committee has great concerns about the
vendor’s inability to meet those requirements. She stated that this Committee anticipates that those individuals
tasked with sitting with the vendor during the negotiations, since the only thing this Committee is approving is
the negotiation itself, that the caveat be that this Committee is expecting that there will be rigorous discussion
around their ability to meet these requirements, and is expecting a report back to this Body on the subject.
Acting Chairman Estrada stated that he would like to amend his recommendation to have Ms. Edwards report
to this Committee regarding the process and how that works; in addition to that, he asked Mr. Elwell to
communicate a message to her expressing how this Body feels about that specific contract.
In response to a question from Director Wiese regarding the amount spent on dental care and the types of
dental services provided under the CountyCare Health Plan, Mr. Glass stated that he will provide that
information.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Butler, moved the approval of request numbers
1 through 31, subject to completion of review by Contract Compliance, where
appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Director Richardson-Lowry voted PRESENT.

C. Any items listed under Section III

IV. Report from the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy (Attachment #2)
Mr. Elwell and Debra Carey, Chief Operating Officer, Ambulatory Services, reviewed the report on Specialty
Care: Days to 3rd Next Available New Appointment as of November 30, 2015. The Committee discussed the
information.
Mr. Elwell noted that the “third next available” measure is a standard measure used in managed care. In response
to a question from Director Velasquez regarding what happens if an appointment is needed immediately, Ms.
Carey responded that there is still same-day access availability, based on immediate need.
Director Wiese noted that long wait periods for appointments impact patient quality and satisfaction; she inquired
whether the delays are the result of physician shortages. Ms. Carey responded that the administration uses this
data to in fact determine whether more sessions need to be added at different locations.
Page 6 of 63

 IV. Report from the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy (continued)
A. Report of procurement and non-procurement matters for FY2015 – 3rd Quarter (Attachment #3)
Mr. Elwell reviewed the report. He noted that most of these contracts are GPO-type contracts; some are related
to the activities regarding the recent survey by The Joint Commission. He stated that some work needs to be
done to continue cleaning up the thought process regarding aggregation of the contractual requests to determine
total spend and to ensure compliance with the Procurement Policy.
B. Report of emergency purchases (Attachment #4)
Mr. Elwell provided an overview of the two (2) emergency purchases that have been recently made. The first
relates to the mobile CT unit at Provident Hospital. The other is for an emergency purchase relating to
Compass. The Committee received information on an emergency purchase last month in the amount of
$150,000 – that was basically relating to their initial assistance with activities relating to the survey by The Joint
Commission. The emergency purchase being reported to the Committee today is for a contract totaling
$699,500; this includes the originally reported emergency contract in the amount of $150,000 from last month,
plus an additional amount of nearly $550,000. Compass will be providing an interim Sterile Processing
Department (SPD) person to run that project; the vendor will also be running Stroger Hospital through a mock
survey process several times leading up to the expected re-survey that will take place in the next six (6) months.
C. CountyCare Update (Attachment #5)
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, reviewed the CountyCare Update.
discussed the information.

The Committee

Mr. Scheer noted that, on slide 3, he noticed that CountyCare and almost all of the other health plans had a
decrease in volume in October; he wondered if there was there something going on with enrollment. He added
that, if this is an across-the-board sort of phenomenon, all of the health plans are in the same boat. Mr. Glass
responded that he knows of other health plans who have created retention departments; they have been in
business for twenty (20) years and now have had to address this in a new way.
Mr. Glass stated that the State had an information system glitch in November; reinstatements were not
occurring as expected. Additionally, last week he was notified that the State had another glitch – certain
CountyCare members were dis-enrolled because they were deemed “out of area” which means that they do not
live in Cook County; however, they really do live in Cook County. Director Junge asked if information is
known regarding the universe of new enrollees. Mr. Glass responded that the State does not provide
information on a routine basis that indicates who are new members and who is leaving the plan – they provide a
net change; however, he can ask the State for this information.
Director Wiese stated that, while it may not be a large group right now, her feeling is that as people incur debt
here or in other places, they will then become eligible for CountyCare based on their bills, or the “spend-down.”
This could become a larger number in the future.
Director Wiese asked Mr. Glass to explain the aspect of choice when people are assigned to networks. Mr.
Glass stated that there is a lock-in process, with a 60 day window of choice. So, for example, Medicaid
beneficiaries who had selected HealthCura will have a 60 day window effective December 1 where they can
choose another health plan; if they do not make a choice within that window of time, then they will be assigned
to Blue Cross. He noted that the State has created a standardized format of benefits to help Medicaid
beneficiaries compare their options for selecting their health plan.

 IV. Report from the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy
C. CountyCare Update (continued)
Mr. Elwell stated that Mr. Glass has been working with the Medical Health Network (MHN) to look at what
additional benefit could be added to make CountyCare’s plan more attractive to prospective members. Potential
additional benefits that they are looking at involve additional dental services and “food as medicine,” which
involves obtaining fresh produce with a prescription from a physician.
Director Butler, seconded by Director Wiese, moved to receive and file the four (4)
reports under Section IV. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Re: 6?Month Purchase of Reinsurance for CountyCare Health Plan (01/01-06/30/2016)

Since the inception of CountyCare, the Cook County Health and Hospitals System has purchased
reinsurance to offset the risk of its high-cost members. Initially, reinsurance was focused only on members who
received transplant services. Beginning in 2015, general stop-loss reinsurance was secured with a threshold of
$750,000 per member. Claims costs incurred in excess of that amount are reimbursed to Coverage is
priced on a PMPM basis by population type FHP, SPD, ACA Adults). cost for reinsurance is estimated
at $1,269,500, with an estimated claims reimbursement of $1,740,000.

The policy is issued under a County-wide insurance brokerage contract with Mesirow Financial, managed
by the County's Office of Risk Management, which expires on June 30, 2016. The Office of Risk Management has
posted a new RFP for County?wide insurance brokerage services with an anticipated start date ofJuly 1, 2016.

Given the transition of the brokerage contract, recommends extending thet current stop- -loss policy
coverage for six months, through June 30, 2016, to be coterminous with th
only change in policy terms for this extension is the exclusion of blood factor pr Rwegg?and
anti-inhibitor coagulant complex for two additional CountyCare members. One 
effective January 1. All other terms remain the same, including:

 

- $750,000 per member deductible 

90% reinsurance once deductible is met; $2 million maximum benifi av BOMSD Of: a

to standard Medicaid rates) for services provided at 

- Blood factor products, blood derivatives and anti?inhibitor coagulant complex excluded for three
members

 

This memo requests the Board?s approval of payment not to exceed $500,000 for the purchase of re-insurance as
described above for CountyCare members. The coverage will again be provided by PartnerRe, as placed by Mesirow
Financial, the County?s insurance broker. will re-evaluate its stop-loss coverage later in 2016 once the new
vendor is selected, or issue an RFP to procure separately as needed.

Subject: ComplyTrack™ Software
‒ Activity and Event Manager™
‒ Audit Detail Manager™
‒ Document and Policy Manager™

Cook County Health & Hospitals System (CCHHS) Office of Corporate Compliance requires the ability to
securely document, track, report, and retain issues and projects. ComplyTrack™ is a web-based suite of
products offered by CCH Incorporated, also known as MediRegs, CCHHS Corporate Compliance has
used this software since December 2009. This secure, central repository currently houses over 2,600
unique reactive compliance issues and proactive projects along with significant collateral
documentation. ComplyTrack™ centrally manages and stores all communications, investigations, and
interactions. The tool also facilitates workflow through accountability and ownership of activities and
projects. The three (3) year cost for unlimited users throughout CCHHS (Provider and Health Plan) for
the Activity and Event Manager™ (AEM) and the Audit Detail Manager™ (ADM) is $104,430.
CCHHS Office of Corporate Compliance requests funds to continue the utilization of Activity and Event
Manager™ as described above and implement the Document and Policy Manager™ for CountyCare
Compliance.
Policy Manager™ is also a web-based module that is a critically important foundational element for the
CountyCare Compliance Program. This tool is designed to manage the life cycle of policies, to house
policies from its delegated vendors, and to publish policies related to CountyCare for viewing by employees,
delegated vendors, and state officials. In addition, as required by the Managed Care Community Network
contract between CCHHS/CountyCare and the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services,
CountyCare health plan will be audited at least every three years covering at least 17 standards. It is
imperative that operations and compliance have policies readily available for auditing staff.
As a fiscally responsible department within a public health, safety-net system, Corporate Compliance
reviewed not only ComplyTrack™ Policy Manager™ also two (2) other nationally recognized policy
management vendors. The factors considered are detailed above but can be summarized as security,
accessibility, features, cost, and implementation time.

ComplyTrack™ Policy Manager™ to the contract for a three (3) year period is $75,000 with a first year
implementation fee of $8,500 for a total of $83,500.
The Office of Corporate Compliance requests approval to fund this software package for an amount not to
exceed $187,930 for a three (3) year contract period.
