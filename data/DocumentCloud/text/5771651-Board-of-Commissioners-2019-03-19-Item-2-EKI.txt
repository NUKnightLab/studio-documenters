Background
In an effort to further expand the use one central document repository and improve business
processes, CHA will further enhance its current SharePoint Enterprise Content Management

 System (“ECMS”). The requested enhancement of the current ECMS is referred to as iFile Phase
II.
In February 2015, the Chicago Housing Authority replaced its legacy document management
solution by implementing a new Enterprise Content Management System (also known as iFile
Phase I). This solution leveraged the Microsoft SharePoint platform and today consists of
additional integrated systems and modules from KnowledgeLake, including its Imaging, Capture
Server Pro, Unify and Advance Capture systems. This effort included the migration of over ten
(10) million documents from the legacy system into iFile. The solution increased customer
service delivery and operational efficiencies by providing rapid, intuitive records search and
retrieval capability as well as providing an integrated means to scan, capture, store, manage
and retain information assets across departments in the Authority.
With iFile Phase II, CHA will upgrade to the most current versions of KnowedgeLake and
Metalogix StoragePoint software, expand the use and capabilities of CHA’s iFile system, identify
and create new document types and document libraries for selected departments, and optimize
existing business process into electronic workflows.
