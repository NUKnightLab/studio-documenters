FUNDING: No Funding Required
GENERAL BACKGROUND
The Academy for Global Citizenship (AGC), an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, approached CHA with
a desire to purchase approximately 7 acres of vacant LeClaire Courts land for the development of a
charter school. The city state property is bounded by W. 44th Street (south), S. Lavergne (west), S.
LaPorte Avenue (east) and the CN Railroad (north). The charter school will consist of a three (3) story
building that will hold classrooms and a community center and two (2) one-story classroom buildings,
community gardens plots, a production farm, an orchard and wind turbine systems. AGC is a certified
Chicago Public School (CPS) that currently serves 300 Kindergarten through fifth grade students and has
a goal to add one grade level per year up to the 12th grade.
The CHA commissioned appraisal indicates a highest and best use assessed value of the 7 acres at
$5.00/square foot amounting to $1,534,600.
CHA and AGC will enter into a formal purchase and sales agreement for the sale of the CHA land. CHA
seeks to transfer and convey in fee simple and the AGC agrees to purchase the property for the sale
price of one million, five hundred thirty four thousand, and six hundred dollars ($1,534,600).

 The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable CHA
board policies.
The Chief Property Officer concurs with the recommendation to: 1) Enter into a Purchase and Sales
Agreement with the Academy for Global Citizenship to sell approximately 7 acres of vacant LeClaire
Courts city state land bounded by W. 44th Street (south), S. Lavergne (west), S. LaPorte Avenue (east)

and Sale Agreement; and 3) Execute and deliver such other documents and perform such actions as
may be necessary or appropriate to implement the foregoing.
