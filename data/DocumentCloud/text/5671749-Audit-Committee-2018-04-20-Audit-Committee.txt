 AGENDA ITEM #6A

Date: April 20, 2018

To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Nicolette Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer

Re:

Memorandum of Understanding Term Sheet Implementation

Background: The concept of formation of a regional water authority arose as a part of the
City of Detroit’s Chapter 9 Bankruptcy. The formation of the Great Lakes Water Authority
(GLWA) was discussed during mediation proceedings held as a part of the bankruptcy case.
On June,12, 2015, the City of Detroit and GLWA entered into a Regional Water Supply
Lease, a Regional Sewage Disposal Lease (collectively the “Leases”) and a Water and Sewer
Services Agreement (“WSSA”). On January 1, 2016, the Leases and WSSA became effective
and govern the relationship between GLWA and the Detroit Water & Sewerage Department
(DWSD).

In the course of operations, GLWA and DWSD determined that it would be in their mutual
interest to clarify certain matters pertaining to the operation of the Leases and WSSA and
began discussions regarding creation of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to
accomplish that goal. This lead to the drafting of a Term Sheet, and ultimately an MOU, with
the intent to (a) provide clarification of specific sections of the Leases, WSSA and Master
Bond Ordinance (MBO), (b) make adjustments contemplated by the Leases and the WSSA
and (c) address the liquidation of specific liabilities.
On April 3, 2018 the Board of Directors for the Great lakes Water Authority approved a
Memorandum of Understanding Term Sheet. On April 4, 2018, the Board of Water
Commissioners for the DWSD approved the same agreement.

Attached is the executed MOU Term Sheet and a communication from the Chief Executive
Officer to the member partner community.

Analysis: The execution of the Term Sheet set four key activities into motion which are in
various stages of implementation. Presently that includes:
1. Making adjustments to GLWA’s books and records to record the financial impact of
the lease and updating the draft FY 2017 financial statements.

Page 9

 2. Audit of the above transactions to complete the FY 2017 financial report by GLWA’s
auditor.
3. Revisions to the proposed budget for FY 2019+ based upon the terms of the
agreement.
4. Drafting the final MOU agreement.

Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

April 6, 2018

Dear Member Partners,
The Great Lakes Water Authority has great news!
On April 3, 2018, the GLWA Board of Directors approved a Term Sheet for a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) with the City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD). The
next day, on April 4, 2018, the Term Sheet was also approved by the DWSD Board of Water
Commissioners. This document clarifies the Leases and Water and Sewer Services agreement
between GLWA and DWSD.
As many of you know from our published materials and outreach meetings, the Leases, Service
Agreements and related documents reflect a historic transaction. Discussions regarding
operational, financial and legal matters have been progressing since early 2016. The MOU Term
Sheet reflects a common understanding of the Leases borne from the passage of time and the
experience that comes with implementing such a complex set of agreements.
The approval of the MOU Term Sheet is significant because we now have clarity to complete open
items that impact the final GLWA FY 2017 audited financial report, as well as the budget for FY
2019 and beyond. Under the MOU there are some impacts to the proposed budget and revenue
requirement for DWSD; however, the FY 2019 charges for other member partners are not
impacted.
We look forward to reviewing the highlights of the MOU with you. This agreement provides
benefits to all parties and strengthens long-term collaboration. A review of the MOU will be a
topic at the next One Water Partnership meeting on June 21, 2018, and at a Charges Work Group
meeting scheduled on May 24, 2018.
Sincerely,

Sue F. McCormick
Chief Executive Officer

Re:

Water Residential Assistance Program (WRAP) Update and Proposed Program
Assistance Allocation Changes

Background: The Water Residential Assistance Program (“WRAP”) provides sustainable
funding for qualifying low-income residents served by the Great Lakes Water Authority’s
(“GLWA”) customers. The program is funded by GLWA at an amount equal to 0.5 percent
of budgeted revenues with the initial FY 2016 funding level of $4.5 million combined for
water and sewer services, $4.7 million in FY 2017 and $4.9 million for FY 2018.

The scope of funding uses includes a) payment assistance and b) water audit and water
conservation measures. Eligible residential customers with a past due bill and/or who are
in active shut off can receive assistance with paying down arrears and receive $25 toward
monthly bill payment assistance annually up to $1,000. High volume water users can
receive a one-time home audit and home water conservation services up to $1,000.
Maximum annual assistance per household is $2,000. To participate in WRAP, an applicant
must have household gross incomes at or below 150% of the federal poverty income
thresholds. Customers with water usage at or above 120% of the average residential usage
are eligible to participate in a water audit and install water conservation measures. WRAP
participants are also encouraged to participate in both financial coaching and water
conservation workshops as well as other support services. The program is administered by
Wayne Metro Community Action Agency (Wayne Metro), a nonprofit agency.
The WRAP began providing assistance to customers of GLWA on March 1, 2016 and has the
potential to serve over 100 communities within the GLWA service area. In order to assist
qualified households each community must opt into the program and sign a Memorandum
of Agreement (MOA) with Wayne Metro. To date, 72 communities have opted into WRAP,
with 7 more communities with MOAs in progress. A list of current participating
communities is presented in Table 1.

WRAP Cashflow Updates
1. FY 2017 WRAP Cashflow
Table 2 shows the WRAP cashflow of budgeted and committed funds in total and for
each of the participating counties and the City of Detroit as of June 30, 2017. In total for
FY 2017, over $2.2 million in assistance funds were committed and over $570,000 of
conservation and repair dollars were spent. From March 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017, over
$8.0 million was budgeted for WRAP and almost $4.3 million was utilized by WRAP
participants during that time. As of June 30, 2017, the suburban counties still had
uncommitted funds (combined assistance and conservation) of over $1.9 million
2

Page 30

 through June 30, 2017. The City of Detroit had uncommitted funds of over $1.8 million
due to the reallocation of the uncommitted FY 2016 suburban assistance funds.

2. FY 2018 WRAP Cashflow as of March 31, 2018

Table 3 shows the WRAP cashflow of budgeted and committed funds in total and for
each of the participating counties and the City of Detroit as of March 31, 2018. From
March 1, 2016 to March 31, 2018 over $12.3 million was budgeted for WRAP (including
the FY 2018 allocation) and over $6.8 million was utilized by WRAP participants during
that time.

GLWA Proposed Changes to Program Requirements
WRAP has just completed its first 24 months of operations. During that time, GLWA and
Wayne Metro have worked together to recommend changes to the program design and
funding re-allocation. To date, GLWA management has brought these requests to the
GLWA Audit Committee and then to the GLWA Board of Directors. At its meeting on
November 4, 2016, the Audit Committee reviewed and recommended the following
changes to the Board:
•

•

Allow communities to opt into specific features of the WRAP. For example, a
community could choose to opt into the monthly assistance feature, but not the
arrearage assistance feature.

As part of the plumbing and repair feature of the program for those qualified
households with over 120% average annual water usage, kitchen and bathroom
faucets in the home that pre-date the lead-free plumbing code change will be
considered eligible for replacement as part of the one-time $1,000 per household
allotment.

In addition to the program changes above, GLWA management is recommending the
following program changes to WRAP.
1. Eligibility Extension:
In response to the feedback GLWA management has received from participating
member communities, GLWA management is recommending changing the 2-year
residential customer WRAP participation limit to a 3-year limitation. This will help
eligible participants in WRAP to have the best chance at success by allowing an extra
12 months of bill assistance. In addition to the approval by the Board of Directors, we
are requesting that each Director officially “opt-in” the representative area they
represent.
3

Page 31

 2. Removal of the 120% Usage Requirement for the Lead Fixture Replacement:
The GLWA Audit Committee previously recommended that as part of the plumbing
and repair feature of the program for those qualified households with over 120%
average annual water usage, kitchen and bathroom faucets in the home that pre-date
the lead-free plumbing code change will be considered eligible for replacement as
part of the one-time $1,000 per household allotment. This proposed program change
would remove the 120% usage requirement as a prerequisite to participating in part
of the program as it addresses the removal of lead fixtures and is not related to water
conservation. As part of Wayne Metro’s recommendation in the next section, GLWA
would set-aside uncommitted FY 2017 specifically for this purpose.

Wayne Metro Funding Recommendations

Based on the demonstrated usage of the WRAP funds since March 1, 2016 and the usage
during FY 2017, Wayne Metro is recommending reallocation of currently uncommitted FY
2017 suburban WRAP funds and a reallocation of budgeted WRAP funds for FY 2019.
Attached is Wayne Metro’s letter (including referenced documents) dated April 16, 2018
which outlines their recommendations. Below is a summary of the recommendations:

1. Reallocation of Uncommitted FY 2017 Assistance Funds: Similar to the
demonstrated WRAP utilization in FY 2016, suburban counties had uncommitted
assistance dollars of $1,034,435, as of June 30, 2017. Wayne Metro is requesting a
reallocation of those funds to the City of Detroit in the amount of $604,720 and
$383,515 ($307,515 for assistance and $76,000 for conservation) to the City of Flint.
The remaining $46,200 will remain in the county allocations for Year-3 WRAP
assistance to eligible participants. Table 4 shows the affect of the proposed
reallocation of these funds,
2. Reallocation of Uncommitted FY 2017 Conservation Funds: In addition to the
uncommitted assistance funds, the suburban counties have underutilized the
conservation funds in both FY 2016 and FY 2017. Wayne Metro is recommending
that the uncommitted $202,249 FY 2017 conservation dollars be designated for the
replacement of fixtures in the home that pre-date the lead-free plumbing code
change.
3. Need-Based Allocation of FY 2019 WRAP Funds: Although WRAP is still a
relatively new program and new communities are continuing to join WRAP, the
utilization of suburban funding allocations is below those of the City of Detroit. In
2017, the GLWA Board reallocated over $1.6 million to the City of Detroit and
$117,000 to the City of Flint from uncommitted FY 2016 WRAP allocations. A
similar request is being made for a reallocation of uncommitted FY 2017 suburban
4

Page 32

 funds. In order to address this continued gap in demonstrated utilization, Wayne
Metro is requesting an allocation for FY 2019 WRAP funds based on a need-based
formula, similar to the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. A
table of proposed need-based allocations is attached.

Budget Impact: None

Proposed Action: The Audit Committee recommends that the Great Lakes Water Authority
Board 1) approve the proposed program changes to WRAP to allow participants to remain
in the program for 3 years, subject to approval by the representing Director; 2) approve the
removal of the 120% usage requirement for the lead fixture replacement and 3) consider
the proposed Wayne Metro funding reallocation recommendations.

Detroit, MI 48202
RE: Water Residential Assistance Program Reallocation of Uncommitted FY16-17 Funds
Dear GLWA Board of Directors and Sue McCormick,
Community Action Agencies, America’s anti-poverty network, carry out a shared
promise to empower people and communities to be strong, healthy, and thriving. The
Community Action Alliance for Southeast Michigan, through our role in WRAP, has
made water assistance, conservation, and consumer education a leading priority in our
community-based poverty fighting efforts.
Together we have enrolled more than 11,000 GLWA resident customers into WRAP
assisting in the prevention of thousands of water service shut offs. With 72 of the eligible
GLWA communities now offering WRAP services to residents and four additional MOAs
in process the reach and impact of WRAP continues to grow. Even with an increase in
member community participation, an unspent balance of $446,089 in uncommitted
funds remain in year one (suburban conservation funds) and $1,236,684 in year two
(suburban conservation and assistance funds, see Exhibit 1).
The greatest need for WRAP services continues to be from City of Detroit customers. 70
percent of all WRAP enrollments are City of Detroit residents. All available GLWA Detroit
WRAP funding has been committed to service first year enrollments, second year
reenrollments, home repairs, and conservation measures.
We respectfully request that GLWA Board of Directors:
1. Approve a WRAP conservation and direct assistance funding reallocation as
follows:
a. Direct Assistance:
i. Reallocate year 2 unspent funds as follows (Exhibit 2):
1. All counties: Year 3 re-enrollments - $347,400
2. Genesee County: New enrollments & Conservation: $383,515
3. City of Detroit: New Enrollments: $303,520
b. Conservation:
i. Reallocate uncommitted Year 2 ($202,249) to replace kitchen and
bathroom faucets and program staffing supports.
ii. Evaluate unspent suburban conservation allocations from Year 1
($446,089) and Year 3 (TBD) remaining at program year end

Page 34

  
(6/30/2018) to determine if there is a need for reallocation based
on the usage trend
2. Adjust future WRAP allocations to include a need-based formula. Example
benchmark data scenarios are attached (Exhibit 3).
In advocating for this reallocation, it is worth noting:
 All allocated GLWA funding and additional funding raised for Detroit has been
committed.
 This request is consistent with the reallocation request made by the CAA Alliance
in 2017.
 An additional $4,000,000 has been raised and committed for WRAP Detroit Wayne Metro contributing $1M in Federal dollars and DWSD an additional $3M
for Departmental sources.
 $1.6M has been leveraged to expand and advance WRAP services through
technology, facilities, and increased staffing.
 $300,000 of discretionary funding has been raised through events, grants, and
donations to provide one-time assistance to individuals and communities
ineligible for WRAP.
 Introductory meetings have been conducted with GCARD, the Community
Action Agency serving Flint in anticipation of providing WRAP services to Flint
residents.
Please find attached:
1. A funding allocation request table
2. A yearly WRAP enrollment and community opt-in report
3. Benchmark data to inform a need-based allocation formula for WRAP
4. WRAP success story, Mr. Denzel Donald, a Detroit resident. Denzel’s monthly bill
went from $300 a month to $50 after a broken pipe was repaired. Denzel is also
doing well in his new role as a Wayne Metro 2018 Certified Tax Specialist assisting
other Detroit residents with free tax preparation services and financial education.

 AGENDA ITEM #7A

Date: April 20, 2018

To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Nicolette Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer

Re:

Alignment of Revenue Requirement, Budget, Capital, Debt, and Affordability

Background: Over the next sixty days, there are several key financial activities winding
down while others ramp-up. In order, those activities include the following.

1. Implementation of the recently approved Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
term sheet related to Leases with the City of Detroit Water & Sewerage Department
2. Revisions and finalization of the FY 2017 Audited financial report and single audit
report by the extension date of April 30, 2018 as approved by the State Treasurer
3. Modifications to the previously proposed FY 2019 Charges, FY 2019 & FY 2020
Biennial Budget, and Five-Year Financial Plan resulting from the MOU

4. Final review and approval of the FY 2019 Charges, FY 2019 & FY 2020 Biennial
Budget, and Five-Year Financial Plan

5. Discussion with the City of Detroit General Retirement System (GRS) related to longterm projections for the closed pension system commitment
6. Release of internal FY 2018 interim statements which were pending resolution of
opening balances based on implementation of the MOU
7. Final drafting, review, and approval of the MOU

8. Launch of a 2018 refunding transaction and potential new money financing for
DWSD

Completion of the MOU and the FY 2017 audited financial statements, which represents the
first twelve-month fiscal year audit report for GLWA, provides missing key inputs to better
understand preferred financial policies for GLWA to achieve long-term sustainability.
Before GLWA proceeds with finalizing FY 2019 Charges and drafting a preliminary official

Page 45

 statement, achieving consensus on measures to achieve financial sustainability begins with
the analysis below.
Analysis: The revenue requirement is the annual sum of 1) operations and maintenance
(O&M) expense, 2) debt service (as a proxy for investment in capital assets), 3) Master
Bond Ordinance (MBO) commitments, and 4) contributions to the Improvement &
Extension Fund (I&E). Improvement & Extension Fund reserves are intended to be used in
a subsequent year for capital investment. This is sometimes referred to as pay-as-you go
capital funding or revenue financed capital. The revenue requirement is also referred to as
the budget. Charges are based upon the revenue requirement less other nonoperating
income such as investment income.

Developing the annual revenue requirement is based upon a complex set of variables, many
of which are developed simultaneously and are interdependent. The chart below depicts
the linkages between the four primary revenue requirement categories.
Revenue Requirement Categories and Key Considerations 1

1

CIP = Capital Improvement Program
DWRF = Drinking Water Revolving Fund
DWSD = Detroit Water & Sewerage Department
I&E = Improvement & Extension Fund
MBO = Master Bond Ordinance

Page 46

 GLWA prepares a five-year financial plan along with the biennial budget. To date, given the
start-up nature of the organization, significant discussion has been focused on
understanding the budget and capital improvement plan details that support charges while
utilizing those detailed operational inputs to chart the long-term course. With the near
completion of the MOU implementation and FY 2017 audit, as well as the launch of a 2018
refunding transaction, the next step is refining macro financial objectives for the long term
financial plan.
Part 1: GLWA Credit Rating Report Excerpts from 2016 Financing Transactions

GLWA has had positive experience related to ratings and ratings outlooks since its
commencement of operations on January 1, 2016. In preparation for a water and sewer
refunding and a new money for water transaction in 2016, all three rating agencies
provided ratings reports on September 30, 2016. Below are excerpts from those reports
that focus on areas for improvement as we enter our next five-year planning cycle.
Fitch Ratings, September 30, 2016

“STRONG RATE-ADJUSTMENT HISTORY: The governing bodies have instituted
virtually annual rate hikes in support of financial and capital needs. Continued annual
adjustments are included in the forecast and will be needed to meet rising debt service
obligations and sustain financial performance.”
“SYSTEM LEVERAGE REMAINS HIGH:”
“Fitch expects leverage for both systems to remain high for the foreseeable future.
GLWA's system long-term debt per capita totaled a high $1,272 for sewer and
moderately high $667 for water for fiscal 2015.”

“The consolidated GLWA regional and DWSD local 2017-2021 capital improvement
plans (CIPs) total $979 million for water and $779 million for sewer. While GLWA's
CIPs for the regional water and sewer systems total just $752 million and $657
million, respectively, GLWA revenues fund the DWSD CIPs through the lease
payments and debt issued for the local projects so the consolidated CIPs are
factored into Fitch's analysis. Funding for the consolidated CIPs is expected to be
provided from around 50% debt financing and 50% pay-go.” [Note: combined
analysis of DWSD and GLWA CIP and debt.]

Moody’s Investors Service, September 30, 2016

“Factors that Could Lead to an Upgrade
» Sustained improvement in service area economic conditions, which may be
indicated by more rapid labor market expansion and population growth

Page 47

 » Continued improvement in key operating indicators, such as debt service coverage
and liquidity, while leverage of net revenue moderates
Factors that Could Lead to a Downgrade
» Renewed economic stress that pressures consumption and revenue trends
» Weakened liquidity and debt service coverage ratios
» Growth in leverage of the water utility’s net revenue”

S&P, September 30, 2016

“The water system is highly leveraged (especially since 2012, when the systems
issued bonds to refund their variable-rate debt portfolio and to terminate their
swaps). We do not expect this condition to abate in the near term and generally
view the debt profile as a credit weakness.”
Part 2: PFM Benchmarking Report to Audit Committee on March 16, 2018 (Excerpts)
Below is an excerpt from the above analysis presented to the Audit Committee. The focus of
this memo is to identify areas in which GLWA needs to improve to achieve a higher credit
rating. For this analysis, credit ratings a referenced as a measure of financial sustainability.

GLWA’s ratings are presently in the “A” category. Achieving a “AA” status will lower the cost
of borrowing as well as allow GLWA to release investments held in reserves.

 The PFM Benchmarking analysis identified the importance of the relationship between
revenues, debt, and capital financing as shown by the two benchmarks below.
Moody’s 2

Fitch Ratings

The chart above identifies areas where GLWA could improve: percent of CIP financed with
debt, debt service coverage, and operating margin.
The one metric where GLWA exceeds the benchmark is Days Cash on Hand. There are two
categories of cash for each system: construction bond funds and I&E funds. Cash is critical

and Moody’s Financial Ratio Analysis database as of February 1, 2018, updated where available with GLWA FY17

service reserve funds by most recent year's operating revenues.

 to financial sustainability – at the appropriate levels. During the five-year plan, it is planned
to utilize cash reserves to lower the need for borrowing as well as the cost of capital.

Part 3: Overarching Goal: Sustainability
A generally accepted broad definition of sustainability is the ability to meet the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
Sustainability is a concept that applies all GLWA operations in ways unique to that area. In
line with rating agency commentary and analysis, this discussion focuses on Financial
Sustainability. If the long-term financial plan focuses on doing the the following three
things well, financial sustainability is achievable.
Proposed Long-term Financial Plan Objectives to Achieve Financial Sustainability

1. Risk Management: Ensuring that there is sufficient liquidity to seek opportunities
as well as address unforeseen and/or uncontrollable events.
2. Affordability: Appropriate level of fixed long-term commitments, controlled
variable annual costs, and balancing the two to achieve intergenerational equity.

3. Stability: Anticipating annual budget variances and ensuring that charges are stable
and predictable (i.e. prevents “rate shock”).
Page 50

 Part 4: Translating the Objectives into Policy and Related Performance Measures
The table below demonstrates how the three long-term financial plan objectives above
translate into policies, performance criteria, and performance measures. Most importantly,
however, a) no one item is independent of the others and b) achieving financial objectives
over the long term is the outcome of effective operations and capital program management.

Part 5: Testing the Policies and Criteria
The table below presents a matrix that demonstrates how the criteria above would apply to
calculating the revenue requirement. It should be noted that, for discussion purposes, the

Note: This limitation shall not be applicable if the revenue requirement must increase beyond the 4%
assumption to satisfy the rate covenant or to pay the cost of improvements that are required to be made by
applicable laws.

Page 54

 While the matrix encompasses many of the criteria directly, the remaining performance
measures should be calculated simultaneously with the five year plan to check alignment
with the three Financial Sustainability objectives of Risk Management, Affordability, and
Stability.
Part 6 – Additional Chart for Analysis

Attached to this memo are two sets of tables for the revenue requirement policy matrix
discussion.
1. Illustrative key financial inputs.
2. Moody’s Water Utility Scorecard

Next Steps

Next steps include the following.

 Audit Committee feedback.

 The Foster Group has developed a similar model as the proposed revenue
requirement policy matrix that can be used to stress-test the proposed matrix and
related scenarios.

 The outcome of the stress testing effort may result in adjustments to the current,
proposed five-year plan as well as the analysis to support the policy matrix.
 Pending clarity of the legacy pension obligation after FY 2023, a ten-year forecast
would be developed using the proposed sustainability model.

 Further evaluation of the policy matrix in navigating the impact of DWSD budget
inputs.

Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

 WIFIA – Background
 Modeled after the long-standing Transportation Infrastructure Finance & Innovation Act (TIFIA) of 1998, the Water

Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act of 2014 (WIFIA) created a federal credit program which provides longterm, low-interest loans for large water infrastructure projects
 WIFIA was established as a five year pilot program for water infrastructure projects along the lines of the current

TIFIA program
 The WIFIA program will provide Federal credit assistance in the form of direct loans or letters of credit to aid in the

financing of water and sewer projects
 The WIFIA program was created to provide water infrastructure projects with a flexible, “patient” investor willing to

take on investor concerns regarding the investment horizon, liquidity, predictability and risk of projects
 WIFIA program received $20 million in appropriations from Congress in December 2016

• The $20 million of appropriations can support approximately $1 billion in loans for $2 billion in projects
• In 2017, for WIFIA’s inaugural round, EPA invited 12 projects in 9 states to apply
 Funding for additional projects was secured by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 that allows EPA to

provide up to $5.5 billion of additional credit support for projects

 WIFIA – Project Selection Criteria
The WIFIA program is required by statute to evaluate projects using selection criteria. The statute establishes eleven
criteria, to which EPA, via regulation, adds two additional criteria. The WIFIA program selection criteria and respective
weights are as follows:
1. Project of national or regional significance – 10%
2. Likelihood that credit assistance enables project to proceed earlier – 5%
3. New or innovative approaches used – 10%
4. Protection against extreme weather events – 10%
5. Extent to which project maintains or protects the environment or public health – 10%
6. Serves energy exploration or production areas – 5%
7. Serves regions with water resource challenges – 10%
8. Extent to which the project addresses identified municipal, state, or regional priorities– 5%
9. Readiness to proceed – 5%
10. Extent to which the project financing plan includes public or private financing in addition to WIFIA credit assistance – 5%
11. Reduction in federal assistance – 5%
12. Degree to which project addresses need for repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of infrastructure – 10%
13. Serves economically stressed communities – 10%

 WIFIA – Potential Economic Benefits
 Ability to lock in rate at financial close, reducing interest rate risk (a no cost rate lock)

• Retain ability to issue bonds instead if rates decline significantly
 Additional structuring and timing flexibility, including backloaded debt structures
 Greater project leverage with WIFIA’s low coverage requirements
 Up to 35 year amortization beginning at substantial completion
 Ability to draw funds and therefore accrue interest based on actual, rather than projected, spending
 Flexible prepayment provisions: a borrower may prepay WIFIA credit assistance in whole or in part without

penalty at any time (provided that WIFIA credit assistance may not be prepaid using federal funds)

 WIFIA – Timetable and Process for 2018
The timetable for WIFIA funding in 2018 requires a letter of interest to be submitted by July 2018
Process for FY2018 WIFIA Funding:
 Letter of Interest submitted by July 6, 2018 at 12:00 pm EDT

• Prospective borrower provides information to demonstrate its projects eligibility, financial creditworthiness,
engineering feasibility, and alignment with EPA’s policy priorities
• Letter of interest requires substantial work, including the use of consultants to fill out the sizeable data requests
and analysis asked for by EPA
 Once all letters of interest for a selection round have been evaluated, the Selection Committee will select which

prospective borrowers to invite to apply (likely a several month process)
• It is expected that EPA will only invite projects to apply if it anticipates that those projects are able to obtain WIFIA
credit assistance.
 Funding announcement for FY2018 identifies two major priorities for this round of funding:

• Providing clean and safe drinking water and reducing lead exposure
• Repairing, rehabilitating and replacing aging infrastructure and conveyance systems

 WIFIA - Major Considerations
 Federal project requirements WIFIA financing subjects project to federal requirements, including Davis-

Bacon, NEPA, and American Iron and Steel requirement
 Lien priority WIFIA credit assistance may be subordinate to the project’s other debt obligations in the

priority of its lien on the project’s cash flow but in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation, the
WIFIA credit instrument will have a parity lien with respect to the project’s senior creditors
 Continuing disclosure and monitoring WIFIA program requires that borrowers submit quarterly financial

condition reports, comply with site visits, provide material event notices, and regular legislative compliance
certifications
 Administrative burden Substantial ongoing administrative burden related to ensuring that WIFIA funds are

not spent on ineligible project costs
 Additional debt WIFIA may require consent rights for the issuance of additional indebtedness
 Variable rate debt WIFIA will not agree to exposure to material amounts of variable rate debt in the

borrower’s financing structure
 Required prepayment WIFIA may require borrowers to prepay WIFIA credit instruments on an accelerated

basis with excess revenues, refinancing proceeds, or trapped cash flow, as appropriate

 DWSD Retail Billings: Table 1 shows the FY 2018 sewer usage and billed revenue which
are provided by DWSD staff. As of February 28, 2018, the DWSD usage was at 99.19% of
the budget and billed revenue was at 100.00% of budget.
GLWA Wholesale Customer Billings: Table 1 shows the FY 2018 sewer billed revenue.
As a result of the sewer rate simplification which provides a more stable revenue stream,
the wholesale sewer customers are billed a fixed monthly fee. The results of this effort can
be seen as the billed revenue is at 100.00% of budget through February 2018.

Total System Billings: Table 1 shows the FY 2018 combined DWSD and GLWA Wholesale
sewer billed usage and billed revenue. Based on the combined, the GLWA Sewer System
had billed revenues of 99.19% of budget based upon the most current information
available as of this report.
2. FY 2018 Retail and Wholesale Water Revenue Report

Table 2 summarizes the unaudited FY 2018 wholesale customer water revenues billed by

 Construction Work‐in‐Progress Quarterly Report 
As of December 31, 2017 

4/20/2018 
To Our Stakeholders: 
The contents of this report represent the financial presentation of construction work‐in‐progress activity for the Great Lakes Water Authority 
(GLWA) as of December 31, 2017.  The information in this report presents a snapshot to inform decision makers and stakeholders.  This is 
important as we manage the capital program for the remainder of FY 2018 and approach the implementation of the FY 2019–2023 Capital 
Improvement Plan (CIP). 
This report is relatively new and will continue to improve each quarter to inform decision makers and stakeholders.  Added to this report last 
period are the following: 


Allowance & Program Analysis



Budget Amendments



Coordination of Phase Reporting within the Capital Improvement Program (CIP) & Construction Work‐In‐Progress (CWIP) Reporting
Documents

Report Contents and Organization 
This report is divided into two sections:  one for the Water System and one for the Wastewater System as identified in the table of 
contents.  Each section includes analysis and reporting of the following: 
Percent of Spend Compared to Budget and Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) Requests:  Presentation of spend information is 
necessary to report our progress on CIP projects. 
Analysis of Projects with Largest Percent of Spend and Otherwise Noteworthy Projects:  A combination of commentary and 
analysis provides further insight into risk factors and project status.  An excerpt from the CIP for each of the selected projects 
follows the commentary as further background information.

 Construction Work‐in‐Progress Quarterly Report 
As of December 31, 2017 

Construction Work‐in‐Progress Rollforward:  This table provides a list of all projects in the CIP along with status or financial 
activity.  This table may be used to revisit priorities, workload, and phasing. 
Budget Amendments / Allowance & Program Analysis:  This information identifies the specific usage and the reallocation of 
allowance and program budgets to CIP projects 

Financial Information 
All project amounts are unaudited and are “pre‐close”.  This means that direct contractor costs are generally included in these totals with most 
pay estimates entered through December 31, 2017.  There may, however, be some pay estimates that lag.  The totals do not include indirect 
overhead or capitalized interest.   
Budget vs. Plan 
Generally, GLWA’s CIP projects span two or more fiscal years.  The GLWA Board of Directors adopts a biennial “budget” and a five‐year capital 
improvement “plan”.   
 The adopted budget relates to operations and maintenance expense, annual fixed commitments such as debt service, and incremental
adjustments to reserves. The budget provides authority to spend within defined amounts.  The budget is also referred to as the
“revenue requirement” for the utility.
 The CIP “budget” for the same biennial budget period above is based on the first two years of the CIP.  Funding for these projects are
established in the financial plan through a combination of bond proceeds and Improvement & Extension fund reserves
 The five‐year capital improvement plan is a rolling plan that is updated at an administrative tracking level as projects move from
estimated to actual bid numbers.  An updated mid‐cycle CIP would be presented to the Board for approval if the prioritization strategy
was revised and/or the plan was in need of material revisions.

Future Enhancements 
This report presents information that is readily available.  Currently under development are enhancements that will provide the opportunity for 
improved CWIP reporting. 
Monthly Capital Spend Projections –  Improvements are underway related to preliminary monthly spend information, projected out for 
the duration of the CIP, and communicated with Treasury to allow for investment optimization.  This reporting is being developed as a 
joint effort with our engineering partners.  This will also allow for improved accuracy of our Key Performance Indicator on rate of 
spending. 
Direct Labor Capitalization – Technology solutions are being evaluated to improve direct labor capture accuracy, timeliness and ease in 
which labor cost are captured. 
Indirect Labor Capitalization –  Presently an effort to identify indirect labor related to the capital process is underway. 
Alignment of Budget & CIP – During the development of the FY 2019–2023 CIP Plan, FY 2018 budgeted CIP was reforecast to align with 
anticipated spend.  The resulting budget amendments will be entered and reflected in future period CWIP reports. 
Key Performance Indicators – KPI’s under consideration include CIP spend vs book value assets, percentage growth of project in amount 
and duration, actual vs planned number of projects completed, and actual vs planned monthly capital spend.

WATER SYSTEM 
Percent of Spend Compared to Annual Budget and Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) Requests 
The rate of spend of is a key performance indicator.  The ratios for FY 2017 (twelve months) of 37.9% and for FY 2018 (six months) of 17.6% are 
lower than simple benchmark of 80% and 50% respectively.  This is attributable to three reasons.  First is the competition for staff priorities 
during stand‐up of the GLWA (primarily during FY 2017).  Second, is the alignment of projects identified and staff or contractor resources to 
carry out the projects.  Several key hires occurred during the past year which will improve this performance.  Third, is the phasing of CIP activity 
which is being further refined throughout GLWA.

Additional Project Manager Comments:  The final completion date for CON‐133 is July 31, 2019 and it is scheduled to be completed on time. 
Within CON‐133 contract there are three Substantial Completion (SC) milestones; SC for SWWTP is May 2, 2018, SC for NEWTP is July 31, 2018 
and SC for SPWTP is May 2, 2019. Delays were encountered in isolating the 72" main for the SWWTP therefore the aforementioned date for SC 
will not be met and a Change Order #1 for SC time extension is in preparation (for the SWWTP SC only). All other dates remain 
unchanged. Some CON‐133 Contract work was deleted from the SPWTP to avoid duplication from another contract and a letter of credit was 
obtained from contractor. One CCD was processed, executed and the associated work is about 80% complete. No safety incidents reported to 
date and GLWA is working with the contractor and consultant to ensure the project is completed safely, on time and on budget.

Budget Amendment Reporting 
Scope:  Budget amendments seek to properly allocate funds from the allowance and programs within the Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) for 
the budgeted years by the reallocation of funds from the budgeted allowance or programs level to the actual project level. 
Process:  Steps are listed below. 
1)
2)
3)
4)

Properly identify projects that utilize funds from the allowance or programs
Reallocate the funds from the budgeted allowance or programs level through a journal entry
Attach documents that support the reallocation (CIP funding request, contract transmittal, or change orders)
Create, review, and approve budget amendment journal entry

As of December 31, 2017 

WASTEWATER SYSTEM 
Percent of Spend Compared to Annual Budget and Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) Requests 
The rate of spend is a key performance indicator.  The ratios for FY 2017 (twelve months) of 55% and for FY 2018 (six months) of 52.1% are 
lower than simple benchmark of 80% and 50% respectively. This is attributable to three reasons. First is the competition for staff priorities 
during stand‐up of the GLWA (primarily during FY 2017). Second, is the alignment of projects identified and staff or contractor resources to 
carry out the projects. Several key hires occurred primarily during fiscal FY 2017 will improve this performance. Third, is the phasing of CIP 
activity which is being further refined throughout GLWA.

Manager: Ali Khraizat 
Total Project Budget: $7,000,000 
Key Contract/Vendor: Sigma/Albert Kahn 
Project Description: The Relocation of the Industrial Waste Control Group (IWC) located at GLWA Livernois Center at 303 South Livernois 
Avenue and the GLWA Analytical Lab located at 2727 Second Avenue to Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF). 
Purpose: The existing Industrial Waste Control Group (IWC) facility is primarily used for sampler cleaning and preparation and location to house 
staff and division vehicles.  The IWC is currently situated at the GLWA Livernois Center at 303 South Livernois Avenue, Detroit, while the GLWA 
Analytical Lab is located at 2727 Second Avenue, Detroit. There is a two‐phase approach to relocate both groups to the GLWA WRRF 
consolidating the existing plant Operations Lab with the Analytical Lab making efficient use of space by utilizing owned facilities versus leased 
ones and increasing synergy between the lab groups by having them located at the WRRF.  The IWC relocation will also make way for the new 
Detroit River International Crossing (Gordie Howe Bridge project).   
Status: The bid documents are being prepared for advertisement. 
Additional Project Manager Comments: The Scope of Work includes relocation of the IWC from its current location to the 1st floor of the 
Ragland Building and 2nd floor of the New Administration Building (NAB) at the WRRF.  Twenty of the IWC team members and a document 
storage area will be accommodated in the current Engineering/Drafting areas on the NAB 2nd floor.  Renovation of the north bay and 
shower/restroom area of the existing locker room located on the 1st floor of the Ragland Building will be completed to accommodate the IWC 
sampler preparation, storage, and work space for IWC field personnel.

MEMORANDUM
FY 2019 Sewer Charges to OMID
To:

April 19, 2018

Nicolette Bateson

From: Bart Foster
You have asked for commentary and observations regarding a potential response to public
comments made by representatives of the Oakland Macomb Interceptor Drain District
(OMID) at the GLWA Audit Committee meeting on February 23. We have reviewed the
comments, which appear to request modifications to proposed FY 2019 Sewer Charges to
reflect four specific areas of inquiry. Herein we present background information, set forth
our understanding of OMID’s request, and provide a summary of our analyses and
perspective regarding the request.
Background:
The GLWA cost allocation methodology1 for purposes of establishing Sewer service charges
includes a “customer specific” cost pool designed to capture the costs related to GLWA
facilities that serve only the OMID. These facilities include the Northeast Sewer Pumping
Station (“NEPS”), and the portion of the North Interceptor East Arm (“NIEA”) downstream
of the NEPS that conveys flow only from OMID. The cost of service allocation methodology
has traditionally employed slightly different approaches for assigning capital and operating
revenue requirements to this cost pool.
Capital Revenue Requirement Allocations
Since the establishment of the FY 2011 Sewage Disposal Charges, GLWA allocations of
capital revenue requirements (including debt service) have been allocated to cost pools and
Customers based on a “Utility Basis” approach. Under this approach statistics from the fixed
asset records of the Sewer Utility are used to allocate capital costs. For instance, if 1% of the
representative capital asset value for the Sewer System is related to OMID specific assets,
then 1% of the capital revenue requirements (including debt service) are allocated to OMID.
GLWA’s review of the interceptor inventory indicates that the NIEA segment in question
represents approximately 3.5% of all GLWA interceptors, based on an “inch mile” analysis.
For purposes of the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study, we assigned 3.5% of all interceptor
capital revenue requirements to the OMID cost pool. This created a direct capital revenue
requirement of approximately $0.78 million.
1

The GLWA methodology is consistent with the methodology of the predecessor entity, DWSD.

 FY 2019 Sewer Charges to OMID

April 19, 2018
Page 2

Our cost of service study included a review of the GLWA asset records, which indicated that
the net book value of $19.6 million assigned to the NEPS. This NEPS asset value (and the
representative annual depreciation expense) amounted to approximately 1.2% of the overall
capital asset structure, and we used this ratio to subsequently allocate approximately $2.81
million of direct capital revenue requirements. So our FY 2019 Cost of Service Study
included $3.59 million of direct capital revenue requirements assigned to the OMID cost
pool, which was then directly assigned to the OMID Customer2.
Operating Revenue Requirement Allocations
For purposes of assigning operating costs to the OMID cost pool, the same approach (relative
inch miles) is used to assign NIEA related interceptor costs. In the FY 2019 Cost of Service
Study this resulted in approximately $0.43 million of direct operating revenue requirements
allocated to the OMID cost pool.
With regard to the NEPS operating costs, GLWA allocations of all budget operating
expenses related to sewer pumping stations (including maintenance, SCADA, etc.) have been
assigned to individual sewer pumping stations based on relative electric usage or costs. This
approach was established several years ago, as detailed specific pumping station maintenance
costs, etc. were difficult to isolate. For purposes of the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study, we
obtained budgeted electric utility costs for several years. The relative budgeted electric
utility costs for the NEPS, as a proportion of budgeted electric utility costs for all GLWA
sewer pumping stations, ranged from 24% to 40%. In our FY 2019 Cost of Service Study we
allocated 25% of all sewer pumping station operating expenses to the NEPS, which resulted
in direct operating costs totaling $5.88 million being assigned to the OMID cost pool. So our
FY 2019 Cost of Service Study included $6.05 million of direct operating revenue
requirements assigned to the OMID cost pool, which was then directly assigned to the OMID
Customer3.
The combined total revenue requirement allocated to the OMID cost pool in the FY 2019
Cost of Service Study was $10.50 million.
Pending Potential Operating Agreement
We have participated in several meetings between GLWA and OMID representatives as they
have sought to establish an “operating agreement regarding the OMID specific facilities
addressed in this memorandum. Elements of that potential operating agreement would impact
the cost allocation approaches and results discussed above.
2

Table 3 in the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study Report contains a “Net Capital” Revenue Requirement line item
that includes proportional allocation of certain other “indirect” non-operating items, such as the Lease Payment,
etc. These indirect elements result in the OMID “Net Capital” Revenue Requirement totaling $3.99 million in
the Cost of Service Study Report.
3
Table 3 in the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study Report contains a “Net Operating Expenses” Revenue
Requirement line item that includes proportional allocation of certain other “indirect” operating items, such as
the operating portion of the pension obligation, etc. These indirect elements result in the OMID “Net Operating
Expenses” Revenue Requirement totaling $6.52 million in the Cost of Service Study Report.

OMID Request, Analyses, and Perspective:
1. Reflect the treatment of debt service for the OMID only rate category consistent with the
October 22, 2009 Settlement and Release of Certain Rate Disputes as stated in
paragraph 3.a of that document.
• We believe that the reference in the OMID correspondence is taking a position that
the district should not be allocated any capital revenue requirements associated with
the portion of the NIEA that conveys only OMID flow. We do not agree with that
conclusion. We believe that the agreement that is cited in the referenced document
predates the agreements established as part of the Rate Simplification Initiative. In
any event, we encourage this issue to be further explored and discussed as part of the
negotiations towards the Operating Agreement. For purposes of our hypothetical
analysis summarized in the table that follows, we have reflected the calculated effect
of removing such capital revenue requirements from the OMID cost pool, which
would reduce the direct OMID cost pool allocated revenue requirements by
approximately $0.78 million. However the OMID share of the reallocated commonto-all (“CTA”) revenue requirement would increase by $0.13 million, resulting in a
net decrease of $0.65 million.
2. Adjust the assets of the Northeast Pump Station based on the results of the Northeast
Pump Station asset inventory review performed on February 2, 2018 with representatives
from OMID and GLWA.
• As noted in the request, subsequent to the establishment of the proposed FY 2019
charges, additional review of the capital asset data reported for the NEPS has been
conducted. It is our understanding that the parties are in basic agreement that the
asset records should be adjusted to reflect the results of that review, and that the
adjustments will result in a $5.2 million reduction in the 6/30/17 net book value
allocated to the NEPS – which would result in a revised total of approximately $14.4
million. For purposes of our hypothetical analysis summarized herein, we have
reflected the calculated effect of adjusting the capital revenue requirement allocations
accordingly. Based on our analysis, this would reduce the direct OMID cost pool
allocated revenue requirements by approximately $0.82 million. However the OMID
share of the reallocated common-to-all (“CTA”) revenue requirement would increase
by $0.12 million, resulting in a net decrease of $0.70 million.
3. Adjust the OMID only cost category revenue requirements to reflect any changes which
may occur pending the review of electrical costs.

As noted in the request, subsequent to the establishment of the proposed FY 2019
charges, additional review of the sewer pumping station electric use and costs has
been conducted. While the analysis continues4, the initial findings indicate that the
NEPS accounts for approximately 36% of recent pumping station electric bills, and
approximately 44% of recent total pumping station electric usage. Had we the benefit
of this additional analysis at the time we conducted the FY 2019 Cost of Service
Study, we likely would have allocated at a minimum 35% (rather than the 25%
original figure) of total sewer pumping station operating revenue requirements to the
NEPS. This hypothetical adjustment would have resulted in a $2.74 million increase
to the operating revenue requirements allocated to the OMID cost pool. However the
OMID share of the reallocated common-to-all (“CTA”) revenue requirement would
decrease by $0.45 million, resulting in a net increase of $2.49 million.
As shown in the table, the net impact of incorporating all of the hypothetical
adjustments noted above would result in a net increase of approximately $0.94
million. Given that the parties are negotiating an Operating Agreement, and that
GLWA is exploring a “Charges Stability Adjustment” to reflect potential adjustments
of actual costs, we do not believe it is prudent to modify the originally proposed FY
2019 Sewer Charges.

4. At the January 31, 2018 GLWA/OMID meeting, GLWA stated depreciation expenses for
the 2018-19 sewer rates will be utilized at 60% of the book value. For the formation of
GLWA, Duff and Phelps analyzed the GLWA assets, stated their values for the beginning
4

The additional review includes an analysis of the amount of wastewater volume handled by each sewer
pumping station. The initial estimate indicates that the NEPS handles approximately one-third of all flows that
utilize GLWA sewer pumping stations.

balances, and revised the remaining lives of the assets. Why use 60% instead of the full
amount of the depreciation expenses, does GLWA dispute the accuracy of their book
values? Further, if GLWA goes forward with the 60% for 2018-19 sewer rates, is there a
plan to move towards utilizing the full amounts of depreciation expense in the future?
• As noted in the request, the GLWA capital assets were subjected to a valuation
analysis conducted by Duff and Phelps, which was required to complete the creation
of GLWA. The leased regional assets were booked at an acquisition value based on
the Duff and Phelps analysis, which resulted in an increase in the net book value of
the “acquired” assets. However it also resulted in a significant increase in the annual
depreciation expense. In our opinion, GLWA does not dispute the accuracy of the
book values not the depreciation expense, but also recognizes (as do we) that the
changes produced by the asset valuation changed the dynamic of the overall asset
structure. For purposes of the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study, we sought to strike a
balance between the portion of the capital revenue requirements that were allocated
(under the Utility Basis approach) based on net book value, and the portion that were
allocated based on annual deprecation expense. The approach we applied
successfully accomplished this balance, and adhered to the overarching stability
objectives of the GLWA charge methodology initiatives. We recommend that future
cost of service studies continue to embrace these objectives with respect to this
specific issue.
We trust that this discussion is responsive to the request, and we are prepared to discuss this
matter at your convenience.

 Draft FY 2017 financial report as of April 30, 2018 (for GLWA Board Review on May 9,
2018)

 April 30, 2018
Mr. Nick Khouri, Treasurer
State of Michigan
Department of Treasury
P.O. Box 30716
Lansing, MI 48909
Dear Treasurer Khouri:
Thank you for previously granting an extension for submission of the audit for the Great Lakes
Water Authority’s (GLWA) fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 financial report until April 30, 2018.
As you may recall, the reason for the extension was to provide an opportunity for the GLWA and
the City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) to bring closure to financial
clarifications related to the leases for the regional water and sewer systems.
I am pleased to report that the GLWA Board of Directors approved a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) Term Sheet on April 3, 2018. The next day, on April 4, 2018, the Board
of Water Commissioners for DWSD approved the same document.
Since that date, staff and auditors have worked through accounting, financial reporting revisions,
and related audit procedures which impacted many areas. Revised, draft statements will be posted
on the GLWA website today (those draft statements and the Term Sheet are attached). The next
step is to fulfill the GLWA Board’s request to review the draft statements at its next meeting on
May 9, 2018 before approving the submittal of the final report.
Given these circumstances, we respectfully request an extension for the the filing of the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2017 audit until no later than May 31, 2018. This will ensure that the GLWA
Board has an opportunity to review the financial impact of the MOU Term Sheet on the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2017 financial report along with the external auditor’s report.
Thank you in advance for your consideration of this request.
Very truly yours,

Sue F. McCormick
Chief Executive Officer

 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S TRANSMITTAL LETTER
MONTH XX, 2018
Board of Directors
Great Lakes Water Authority
Dear Members of the Board,
I am pleased to present the inaugural Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) of the Great Lakes
Water Authority (“GLWA” or “Authority”) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. These financial
statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and
audited by a firm of independent certified public accountants.
Our regional water system is one of the largest in the United States, both in terms of water produced and
population served. The system currently serves an area of 981 square miles located in eight Southeastern
Michigan counties and an estimated population of nearly 3.8 million or approximately 38 percent of
Michigan’s population.
Our regional wastewater system is also one of the largest in the United States, both in terms of treatment
capacity and population served. The wastewater system currently serves an area of 850 square miles
located in three Southeastern Michigan counties and an estimated population of nearly 2.8 million or
approximately 28 percent of Michigan’s population.
GLWA as a Model of Regional Collaboration
GLWA was incorporated by the City of Detroit (the "City") and the counties of Macomb, Oakland and
Wayne on November 26, 2014 pursuant to Act 233, Public Acts of Michigan, 1955, as amended. At the
time of GLWA’s incorporation, the City, through its Detroit Water and Sewerage Department ("DWSD"),
was providing water supply services within and outside of the city through a water supply system and
drainage and sewage disposal services within and outside of the city through a sewage disposal system.
On June 12, 2015, the City and GLWA executed Regional Water Supply and Sewerage Disposal System
Leases (the “Leases”), transferring the regional water and sewer facilities from the City to GLWA for an
initial term of 40 years, as well as a Water and Sewer Services Agreement, pursuant to which GLWA
provides water and sewer services to the City; the City then supplies these services to Detroit retail
customers.
The above agreements required the satisfaction of several conditions before becoming effective. By
January 1, 2016 (the “Effective Date”), those conditions were met and GLWA, under the terms of the
Leases, became responsible for the assets, all bonded indebtedness, and operations for the regional water
and wastewater systems.

This document (Great Lakes Water Authority Financial Report as of June 30, 2017) is in draft form and is subject to further
review and approval by GLWA management, the GLWA Audit Committee and Rehmann, and accordingly no assurances can
be given with respect to the contents of the document until it is released in ﬁnal form. No representation or warranty,
express or implied, is provided in relation to the fairness, accuracy, correctness, completeness or reliability of the
information, opinions or conclusions expressed in this draft.

 GLWA leases the regional water and sewer facilities from the City for an allocation of $50 million per year
to fund capital improvements for the City’s retail system and/or debt obligations. GLWA also funds a
Water Residential Assistance Program to assist low-income residential households in enrolled member
partner communities.
Commitment to Excellence
Every month, I highlight the many accomplishments of our valued member partners and talented team
working together to benefit the region in the CEO Report. Here are some highlights for FY 2017.1
July 2016 – Water Operations Receives Water Quality Recognition
GLWA has received the “10-Year Directors Award” from the Partnership for Safe Water, a program
developed by the EPA, American Water Works Association (AWWA), and associated partner organizations
to guide water systems towards improving water quality by optimizing system operations. GLWA was part
of a select group of utilities honored by the Partnership at the annual AWWA conference, the largest and
oldest worldwide organization dedicated to safe water.
August 2016 – Security & Integrity Sponsors Regional Emergency Planning
GLWA’s Security & Integrity Group hosted a table top exercise utilizing its recently updated emergency
response plan. Participants included the City of Detroit, Wayne County, the State of Michigan, the
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and GLWA staff.
September 2016 – Rating Agencies Recognize Steady Progress
GLWA received positive ratings actions from all three ratings agencies – Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors
Service and S&P Global Ratings, and became an “A” rated utility after nine months of operation as an
independent regional water and sewer authority.
Fitch Ratings provided a substantial upgrade in ratings for senior and second lien debt, moving GLWA’s
outstanding bonds up three notches from “BBB“ to an “A” rating with a stable outlook for its senior lien,
and from “BBB-“ to “A-“ for its second lien.
Moody’s Investors Service upgraded GLWA’s credit rating to A3 and its second lien debt to Baa1 (the
second upgrade in nine months).
S&P Global Ratings revised the stable outlook to positive for both senior lien and second lien bonds.
October 2016 – Thank You to Our Investors
GLWA’s inaugural bond transaction priced which included nearly $1.1 billion for refunding of outstanding
debt and $251.8 million for new capital projects for the regional and Detroit local water systems. As a
result of the favorable interest rates on the bonds, GLWA will realize a net cash flow savings of $309.1
million over the life of the refinanced bonds.

 November 2016 – Systems Planning Presents New Capital Improvement Plan
The Asset Management/Capital Planning team presents a new business case evaluation and criteria for
presentation to the Board’s Capital Improvement Planning Committee. The in-depth of analysis and
business case supports improved decision making and financial metrics and is based upon best practices in
the water sector.
December 2016 – Public Affairs Prepares 2016 “Year in Review”
GLWA Public Affairs Group prepares for the launch of our inaugural “Year in Review” (YIR) for 2016 where
we will annually highlight the accomplishments achieved during the previous year. The YIR is presented to
our team members via Town Hall-style meetings at each GLWA location where I get a chance to thank
each team member (across all shifts) for their service and hear firsthand what is on their mind.2
January 2017 – System Analytics Water Audit Consultant Selected
GLWA strives to achieve equity and stability for its customers. For this reason, the System Analytics and
Meter Operations Group engaged a consultant to perform a “Water Units of Service for Non-Master
Metered Customers and System Water Audit”. This project will follow the American Water Works
Association standard water audit compilation and review process. Results from phase 1 of the study will
be used in the FY 2019 customer charge setting analysis.
February 2017 – Information Technology Security Updates
GLWA continues to invest in technology and the security of its systems. The Information Technology
Group implemented a Distributed Denial of Services protection for GLWA and for our shared service
partner, DWSD. In addition, the Barracuda web filter was upgraded to provide further protections as well
as other enhanced security measures.
March 2017 – Organizational Development Launches Apprenticeship Program
Seeking innovative ways to approach hard-to-fill jobs, GLWA launches a three-year apprenticeship to hire
and train Electrical Instrument Control Technicians (EICTs) in partnership with Focus: HOPE and Henry
Ford College. This program will develop a workforce to fill a skill gap in the employment market. Upon
successful completion of the program, individuals will have obtained their EICT-I certification from Henry
Ford College, receive a U.S. Department of Labor journeyman card, and full-time employment at a
starting wage of $25 per hour.
April 2017 – Regional Collaboration Expands – City of Flint Selects GLWA Water
A historic collaboration among GLWA, City of Flint, Genesee County Drain Commissioner, Karegnondi
Water Authority, and the State of Michigan resulted in the signing of a Statement of Principles for Long
Term Water Delivery to the City of Flint. GLWA will become the primary water source for the City of Flint
and now also provides backup service for Flint, GLWA and Genesee County customers utilizing the public
investments already made by the parties with minimal new investments. This ended a 17-year timeframe
in which Flint considered other water supply options. All agreements were finalized in December 2017.

 May 2017 – Systems Planning Group Wastewater Master Plan Study Underway
Beginning in April, the Wastewater Master Plan Steering Committee launched monthly meetings with
engaged stakeholders. The regional collaboration opportunities are significant. The master plan is a longterm project which would ultimately develop a roadmap to go from “clean to green” as we are on a
trajectory of being a clean system to a Utility of the Future.
June 2017 – GLWA Board Approves Budget and Charges for FY 2018
Due to excellent financial performance as we neared the end of FY 2017, the GLWA Board adopted
drinking water charges at 2 percent overall and limited sewer charges to an overall 1.9 percent increase
for FY 2018.
These are a few of the examples of how the good work that is done every day at GLWA leads to excellence
that supports a financially sustainable system for many generations to come.
Overview of the Financial Report
This report consists of management’s representations concerning the finances of GLWA. Consequently,
management assumes full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of all the information
presented in this report. To provide a reasonable basis for making these representations, GLWA
management has established a comprehensive internal control framework that is designed both to protect
the entity’s assets from loss, theft, or misuse and to compile sufficient reliable information for the
preparation of the Authority’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Because the cost of internal
controls should not outweigh their benefits, GLWA’s comprehensive framework of internal controls has
been designed to provide reasonable rather than absolute assurance that the financial statements will be
free from material misstatement. As management, we assert that, to the best of our knowledge and
belief, this financial report is complete and reliable in all material respects.
The Authority’s financial statements have been audited by Rehmann Robson, a firm of licensed certified
public accountants. The goal of the independent audit was to provide reasonable assurance that the
financial statements of the Authority for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 are free of material
misstatement. The independent audit involved examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management; and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
The independent auditor concluded, based upon the audit, that there was a reasonable basis for
rendering an unmodified opinion that GLWA’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017
are fairly presented in conformity with GAAP. The independent auditor’s report is presented as the first
component of the financial section of this report.
GAAP requires that management provide a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis to accompany
the basic financial statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). This letter of
transmittal is designed to complement the MD&A and should be read in conjunction with it. GLWA’s MD&A
can be found immediately following the report of the independent auditors.

This document (Great Lakes Water Authority Financial Report as of June 30, 2017) is in draft form and is subject to further
review and approval by GLWA management, the GLWA Audit Committee and Rehmann, and accordingly no assurances can
be given with respect to the contents of the document until it is released in ﬁnal form. No representation or warranty,
express or implied, is provided in relation to the fairness, accuracy, correctness, completeness or reliability of the
information, opinions or conclusions expressed in this draft.

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Management's Discussion and Analysis
June 30, 2017
The management of the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA or Authority) presents this discussion and analysis of
GLWA’s financial position and changes in financial position as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. The
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with GLWA’s basic financial
statements and the related notes to the financial statements. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in the
MD&A shall have the meaning given such terms in the transmittal letter from the Chief Executive Officer of GLWA
that accompanies the financial statements and the MD&A.
Introduction to the Great Lakes Water Authority
Our regional water system is one of the largest in the United States, both in terms of water produced and
population served. The Water System currently serves an area of 981 square miles located in eight Michigan
counties and an estimated population of nearly 3.8 million or approximately 38% of Michigan’s population.
Suburban wholesale customers comprise approximately 82% of the population served by the Authority while the
retail water customers served by the City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) comprise the
remaining 18%.
Our regional sewer system is one of the largest in the United States, both in terms of treatment capacity and
population served. The Sewer System currently serves an area of 850 square miles located in three Michigan
counties and an estimated population of nearly 2.8 million or approximately 28% of Michigan’s population.
Suburban wholesale customers comprise approximately 75% of the population served by the Authority, while retail
sewer customers served by the City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department comprise the remaining 25%.
GLWA began operations on January 1, 2016. This fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 report represents the first
twelve-month report for GLWA.
A New Organization with a Long History of Quality Service
The creation of a regional water authority was an outcome of the City of Detroit’s Chapter 9 Bankruptcy.
Collaboration among regional stakeholders, supported by mediation proceedings, resulted in a “Memorandum of
Understanding Regarding the Formation of the Great Lakes Water Authority” signed on September 9, 2014 by the
Mayor of the City of Detroit, the Chief Executives of Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties, and the Governor of
the State of Michigan. The agreement established a framework for a regional water and sewer authority to be
established pursuant to Act 233, Public Acts of Michigan, 1955, as amended. The purpose of GLWA is to operate,
control, and improve the regional assets of both the Water System and Sewer System owned by the City and which
were operated by DWSD. The purpose of DWSD is to be the service provider for the retail system which is largely
the City of Detroit customer base.

This document (Great Lakes Water Authority Financial Report as of June 30, 2017) is in draft form and is subject to further
review and approval by GLWA management, the GLWA Audit Committee and Rehmann, and accordingly no assurances can

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Management's Discussion and Analysis
Subsequently, on June 12, 2015, the City of Detroit and GLWA entered into a Regional Water Supply Lease, a
Regional Sewage Disposal Lease (collectively the “Leases”) and a Water and Sewer Services Agreement (“WSSA”).
Prior to implementation of the Leases, several conditions precedent were necessary to establish the financial and
legal parameters before the GLWA could assume control of the Regional Systems. Those conditions precedent
included execution of the Leases, WSSA, a Shared Services Agreement, and a Detroit General Retirement pension
agreement; adoption of a Master Bond Ordinance ("MBO") for both the Water System and the Sewer System;
confirmation from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality that all permits were secured for the
Leased Facilities; certification from the bond trustee that no less than 51% of bondholders of the outstanding
DWSD Water Bonds and DWSD Sewer Bonds, respectively, consented to the adoption by GLWA of the MBO for the
Water System and the Sewer System and to the assumption by GLWA of the outstanding DWSD Water Bonds and
DWSD Sewer Bonds on the Effective Date; certification from the feasibility consultant that GLWA had the ability
to issue at least one dollar of additional indebtedness at each level of lien priority pursuant to the Additional
Bonds Test set forth in the Master Bond Ordinance for each system; legal opinions that each Lease is valid,
binding, and enforceable and that the rates adopted by DWSD for fiscal year 2016 for the wholesale and City
customers were binding and effective; and all necessary consents to the assignment of the wholesale customer
contracts. On December 17, 2015, the GLWA Board determined that all conditions precedent were satisfied to
commence operations on January 1, 2016.
Activity for the Leases was recorded based upon GASB 69, Government Combinations and Disposals of
Government Operations. Equally important to the accounting treatment is the requirement of the flow of funds
in the related MBO. Since GLWA assumed the outstanding bonded indebtedness, retail customer revenues are
pledged for payment of outstanding bonded indebtedness assumed by GLWA. For this reason, pursuant to the
terms of the Leases, DWSD is GLWA’s agent for retail billing and collections. The chart below depicts the DWSD
and GLWA customer relationship and the impact of the MBO flow of funds.

Through
December 31, 2015
The Detroit Water &
Sewerage Department
(DWSD) is a provider of
water and sewer services
to regional wholesale and
City of Detroit retail
customers. The Master
Bond Ordinance defines a
flow of funds that is
unique to DWSD as it
functioned prior to the
implementation of the
lease agreements.
The Great Lakes Water
Authority (GLWA)had no
financial activity or
commitments.

Effective January 1, 2016
On the operational effective date, the Water System and Sewer
System Leases define new customer relationships. The GLWA Master
Bond Ordinance defines a new flow of funds for pledged revenues
collected.
Great Lakes Water Authority provides water and sewer service to a)
wholesale customers by a model contract and b) to the City of Detroit
for retail customers pursuant to a water and sewer services contract.
Revenues from all customers are deposited with a trustee and are
pledged for outstanding bonded indebtedness, contractual obligations

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Leases Accounting Treatment
Key Statement of Net Assets implications include the following:
Capital Assets: Capital assets subject to the Leases were recorded at “acquisition value” based upon an
inventory valuation performed by a certified appraisal firm. This resulted in an overall increase in capital
asset value from the predecessor entity’s historical cost. Accordingly, the depreciable lives were reviewed
and, in several cases shortened, which has increased annual depreciation expense.
Bonded Indebtedness: The outstanding bonded indebtedness of the predecessor entity was assumed in its
entirety by GLWA. GASB 69 also required debt to be recorded at acquisition value.
Net Pension Liability: The net pension liability represents the Regional Systems’ share of the frozen, defined
benefit City of Detroit General Retirement (GRS) pension assigned to DWSD in the City of Detroit’s Chapter 9
Bankruptcy Plan of Adjustment. On January 24, 2017, the parties agreed that 70.3% of the liability was
allocable to the GLWA regional operations and 29.7% to DWSD. That allocation is further subdivided between
the Water System and the Sewer System for each entity.
Obligation Payable: The obligation payable represents the Regional Systems’ share of the B and C Note
Obligations assigned to DWSD in the City of Detroit’s Chapter 9 Bankruptcy Plan of Adjustment. The B and C
Note Obligations refers to the debt service on City of Detroit Financial Recovery Bonds dated December 10,
2014. Those bonds were issued to satisfy claims relating to the City’s pension obligation certificates and
postemployment healthcare benefits. GLWA’s portion of the liability was estimated at 70.3% of the total
liability consistent with the allocation applied to the net pension liability.
Beginning Net Position: The acquisition value of assets acquired exceeded the liabilities assumed by $736.5
million in total with $457.9 million attributable to the Water System and $278.6 million attributable to the
Sewer System. In accordance with GASB 69, the opening capital assets were adjusted by an amount to
establish a beginning total net position of zero.
Contractual Obligation Receivable: This represents DWSD’s allocable portion of the long-term bonded
indebtedness assumed by GLWA on January 1, 2016. This receivable is amortized annually in an agreed upon
amount that approximates debt service. If new debt is issued on behalf of DWSD, the receivable is increased.
Lease Payable: The lease payable is the net present value of the lease payment of $50 million per year for
40 years payable to the DWSD with $22.5 million paid to the DWSD local water system and $27.5 million paid
to the DWSD local sewer system based on a 4.17% borrowing rate for both systems.
2018 Memorandum of Understanding Term Sheet
In the course of operations, GLWA and DWSD determined that it would be in their mutual interest to clarify
certain matters pertaining to the operation of the Leases and WSSA. Discussions began in 2016 regarding creation
of a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) to accomplish that goal. This lead to the drafting of a Term Sheet,
and ultimately an MOU, with the intent to (a) provide clarification of specific sections of the Leases, WSSA and
the MBO, (b) make adjustments contemplated by the Leases and the WSSA and (c) address the liquidation of
specific liabilities. On April 3, 2018, the Board of Directors for the Great lakes Water Authority approved the MOU
Term Sheet (“Term Sheet”). On April 4, 2018, the Board of Water Commissioners for DWSD approved the same
Term Sheet. The final MOU agreement is expected to be completed within the subsequent 90 days.

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Management's Discussion and Analysis
The 2018 Term Sheet resulted in a special item of $94.3 million with $32.8 million attributable to the water
system and $61.5 million attributable to the sewer system which increased the deficit. Despite the special item,
the clarifications provided by the Term Sheet provide other long-term benefits for both parties which largely
negate the impact over time.
Financial Highlights
Total business-type current assets of $834.8 million exceed current liabilities of $318.1 million by $516.7 million
in total or 2.6 times. For the Water System, current assets of $426.4 million exceed current liabilities of $136.4
million by $290.0 million in total or 3.1 times. For the Sewer System, current assets of $408.3 million exceed
current liabilities of $181.8 million by $226.5 million in total or 2.2 times.
The liabilities and deferred inflows of resources of the business-type activities exceeded the assets and deferred
outflows of resources as of June 30, 2017 by $102.8 million (a net deficit). The net deficit for the water fund was
$36.5 million and $66.3 million for the sewage disposal fund.
The largest category of expense is depreciation at $329.8 million in total with $144.2 million for the water fund
and $185.6 million for the sewage disposal fund. The depreciation is based upon the assets that were recorded at
acquisition value on January 1, 2016 as previously noted. The second largest category of expense is interest
expense at $291.6 million in total with $132.4 million for the water fund and $159.2 million for the sewage
disposal fund.
Overview of the Financial Statements
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the Authority’s basic financial statements.
The basic financial statements are comprised of the following:
The statement of net position presents information on all of the Authority’s assets, deferred outflows of
resources, liabilities, and deferred inflows of resources, with the residual reported as net position.
The statement of revenues, expenses and changes in net position presents information showing how the
Authority’s net position changed during the year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the
underlying event giving rise to the change occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Thus, revenues
and expenses are reported for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods.
The statement of cash flows provides information about the Authority’s cash receipts, cash payments and net
changes in cash and cash equivalents resulting from operating, investing and capital and non-capital financing
activities for the fiscal year.
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of
the data provided in the basic financial statements.
This report also contains other supplementary information in addition to the basic financial statements
themselves. These schedules provide additional financial, budgetary, statistical, trend, and economic information
that may be helpful to the readers of these financial statements.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
The Authority presents a combining statement for each system in the supplementary financial information
classified into three categories that align with the Authority’s strategic and budgetary focus of managing capital
investment for both the Regional Water System and Regional Sewer System: 1) operation and maintenance (low
capital investment), 2) improvement and extension (moderate capital investment and financial mechanism to
lower the cost of capital over the long term), and 3) construction projects (high capital investment). The water
and sewage disposal funds together comprise the activity of these three categories of the Authority in total. The
separate water and sewage disposal funds are required by the MBO, a separate credit rating is established for
each fund, and the customers and services provided by each system are separate and distinct.
Financial Analysis
Summaries of the basic financial statements and related commentaries are presented below.
Net Position
Net position is defined by the accounting standards as the residual of all other elements presented in a statement
of financial position. It is the difference between (a) assets and deferred outflows of resources and (b) liabilities
and deferred inflows of resources. A net deficit occurs when the liabilities and deferred inflows exceed assets and
deferred outflows. Deferred inflows and deferred outflows generally relate to financing activity and GLWA’s
share of the GRS pension obligation. In total, GLWA ended June 30,2017 with a $102.8 million net deficit. The
net deficit for the water fund was $36.5 million and $66.3 million for the sewage disposal fund.

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Management's Discussion and Analysis
There are three general components of a net position or deficit: 1) net investment in capital assets (in its
simplest form, capital assets acquired less debt incurred to acquire those assets); 2) restricted (such as legally
required bond reserves or net proceeds from bonds restricted for capital spending); and 3) unrestricted.
Net investments in capital assets is the largest component of the net position with a total balance of $528.9
million ($134.9 million the water fund and $394.0 for the sewage disposal fund). Increases during the year were
attributable to the acquisition of assets and repayment of debt which were both largely offset by depreciation
expense.
Net position restricted for debt service represents amounts that are required by the related MBO or other thirdparty agreements to be used for the repayment of debt. The total amount restricted at year end was $134.1
million with $26.2 million in the water fund and $107.9 million for the sewage disposal fund.
Net position restricted for capital acquisition primarily represents unspent bond proceeds of $323.9 million in
total with $173.0 million in the water fund and $150.9 million in the sewage disposal fund.
The remaining unrestricted deficit is significant: a total of $1.1 billion with $372.8 million for the water fund and
$722.3 for the sewage disposal fund. Unrestricted net position (deficit) is generally defined as the net result of
the other components of net position. This unrestricted deficit is representative of numerous cumulative
historical financial activities over many years through the predecessor entity. The largest dollar amounts were
driven by swap termination fees paid by debt and capital financed assets that were subsequently written off.
Addressing this deficit is a top priority for the GLWA Board and management but recognizes that it will take time.
GLWA continues to optimize its operations, focus on financial planning with a biennial budget, annually update
the five-year capital and financial plan, and expand its expertise in asset management.
Change in Net Position
Water Fund
Wholesale water customer charges of $331.1 million account for 94.1% of Water System revenues from 88
customers. Revenue and charge stability are important goals for GLWA and its member partners. Working within
a collaborative process, the water charge structure is based on the following:
1.
2.
3.

40% is based on the average annual sales for each customer from their 24 prior months of usage ending
September 30th each year.
60% is based on fixed monthly charges.
Fiscal year 2017 revenue billed was 106% of budget meeting the goal of revenue stability.

Local system revenues of $15.5 million account for 4.4% of the total operating revenue. Pursuant to the terms of
the WSSA with DWSD, a $20.7 million credit is applied in the charge methodology. This credit replaces a previous
ownership benefit that was in place prior to the Effective Date of the Regional System.
The remaining 1.5% of revenue is mainly due to the bad debt recovery. Collections on the retail customers prior
balances has resulted in a positive adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts.

This document (Great Lakes Water Authority Financial Report as of June 30, 2017) is in draft form and is subject to further
review and approval by GLWA management, the GLWA Audit Committee and Rehmann, and accordingly no assurances can

The largest category of nonoperating activities is interest expense of $132.4 million which is net of capitalized
interest on construction work in progress. Interest expense before capitalization is largely attributable to debt
service ($119.4 million) with the remainder related to the Water Lease and obligation payable.
Operating income after operating expenses (including depreciation) equals $105.9 million or 30.1% of operating
revenue.
Sewage Disposal Fund
Wholesale customer charges of $263.3 million account for 52.1% of Sewer System revenues from 18 customers.
Wholesale customer charges are based on a “share” percentage of the annual budget billed one-twelfth each
month. The shares are established based upon historical flows and are formally revisited every five years. The
result is no revenue shortfall or overestimation.
Local system revenues of $187.3 million account for 37.0% of total operating revenues. Pursuant to the terms of
the WSSA with DWSD, a $5.516 million credit is applied in the charge methodology. This credit replaces a
previous ownership benefit that was in place prior to the Effective Date of the Regional System.
The remaining 10.9% of revenue is due to other charges such as industrial waste charges, pollutant surcharges
which are charged to non-residential users. This also includes a bad debt recovery as collections on the retail
customers prior balances has resulted in a positive adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts.

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Management's Discussion and Analysis
Capital Assets and Debt Administration
GLWA’s investment in capital assets as of June 30, 2017 is $4.9 billion (net of accumulated depreciation) with
$2.0 billion assigned to the Water System and $2.9 billion assigned to the Sewer System. This investment in
capital assets includes land, buildings, plants, transmission lines, vehicles and other equipment. Total net capital
assets decreased by $230.6 million or 4.5% when compared to the prior year. The net decrease is primarily
attributable to depreciation in excess of current year additions.
Water Fund
Water System additions were largely due to construction work-in-progress of $39.7 million.
Approximately one-half of that amount, $18.9 million, is due to construction related to the following projects:
● Project # 114001: 1958 Filter Rehabilitation at the Springwells Water Treatment Plant (Contracts CS-1425, CS200, SP-563). Fiscal year 2017 expenditures were $11.4 million. Life to date costs through June 30, 2017
total $82.9 million. The project is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2019.
● Project # 122012: 36-Inch Water Main in Telegraph Road (Contract WS-648A). Fiscal year 2017 expenditures
were $7.5 million. Life to date costs through June 30, 2017 total $8.1 million. Project is expected to be
substantially completed in fiscal year 2018.
● The remaining $20.7 million is attributable to the 55 projects that are either near closeout in fiscal year 2018
or are design and study contracts related to larger projects.
Sewage Disposal Fund
Sewer System additions were also largely due to construction work-in-progress of $57.3 million.
Slightly more than one-half of that amount, $33.1 million, is due to construction related to the following projects:
● Project # 260113: Remediation at the Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF)-Complex II. Fiscal year 2017
expenditures and life to date costs through June 30, 2017 total $17.0 million. Work performed represents
capital remediation related to a March 2016 WRRF fire and capital improvements and enhancements
prioritized by the event. It is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2018.
● Project # 211001: Rehabilitation of Primary Clarifiers, Rectangular Tanks, Drain Lines, Electrical/Mechanical
Building and Pipe Gallery (Contract PC-757). Fiscal year 2017 expenditures and life to date costs through June
30, 2017 total $10.2 million. The project is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2020.
● Project # 212006: Rouge River Outfall Project (Contracts PC-797, CS-1781). Fiscal year 2017 expenditures
were $5.9 million. Life to date costs through June 30, 2017 total $6.8 million. Project is expected to be
completed in fiscal year 2019.
● The remaining $24.2 million is attributable to the 35 projects that are either near closeout in fiscal year 2018
or are design and study contracts related to larger projects.

Additional information on the Authority’s capital assets can be found in Note 5.
Long-term Debt. At year-end, the Authority had $5.5 billion of long-term debt. All the outstanding bonds are
revenue bonds, including capital appreciation bonds and state revolving fund loans.
Water Fund
The total outstanding bonds for the Water System is $2.4 billion, increasing by $80.1 million from the prior year.
In October 2016, new revenue and refunding bonds in the amount of $917,805,000 were issued for GLWA system
improvements ($201,090,000), refunding ($665,975,000) and pass-thru of DWSD system improvements of
($50,740,000). Repayment of GLWA bonds issued are funded by charges to all customers. Repayment of the
DWSD specific bonds are paid by DWSD from retail customer collections.
Less than 1% of the total indebtedness is issued through the State of Michigan revolving fund loan program for the
benefit of the Water System. The Water System received $2.44 million in new state revolving fund loans and
received a $1.17 million in loan forgiveness. The state revolving fund loan activity for the year was a pass-through
to DWSD for system improvements.
Sewage Disposal Fund
The total outstanding bonds for the Sewer System is $3.1 billion, decreasing by $125.7 million from the prior year.
In October 2016, new revenue and refunding bonds in the amount of $421,295,000 were issued. Repayment of
GLWA bonds issued are funded by charges to all customers.
Approximately 15.4% of the total indebtedness is issued through the State of Michigan revolving fund loan program
for the benefit of the Sewer System. The Sewer System received $22.2 million in new state revolving fund loans.

The ratings for the Water and Sewer Systems are at the same level. GLWA received positive ratings action from
all three rating agencies in its first nine months of operations. Presently, Fitch Ratings has rated senior lien debt
at A and second lien at A-; Standard & Poor’s has rated senior lien debt at A- and second lien at BBB+; and
Moody’s has rated senior lien debt at A3 and second lien at Baa1.
Additional information on the Authority’s long-term debt can be found in Note 6.
Economic Factors Affecting Next Year's Operations and Rates
On June 7, 2017, the GLWA Board adopted the biennial budget for the Authority for fiscal years 2018 and 2019.
That two-year financial plan remains true to a foundational commitment to control the budget within a 4% cap.
Water Fund
Due to favorable Water System financial performance the budget decreased by one percent for FY 2018. This
translated into a system average charge increase of 2% depending on each customers usage in relation to other
customers. An additional consideration was that an agreement was likely for the City of Flint to enter a 30-year
model contract in FY 2018 which has a positive revenue impact.
Sewage Disposal Fund
Due to favorable Sewer System financial performance the budget increased by only 0.3 percent for FY 2018. This
translated into a system average charge increase of 1.9%. This average increase reflects an amended sewer shares
allocation, based on a strength of flow study that will be phased-in over a two-year period (FY 2018 and FY 2019).
This outcome, which shifted shares among customers, was the result of a year-long data collection and research
study by a technical team comprised of GLWA and its sewer customers.

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Notes To Financial Statements
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Great Lakes Water Authority ("GLWA" or the “Authority” ) is the regional wholesale provider of water and sewer
services in southeast Michigan. The Authority was incorporated by the counties of Macomb, Oakland, Wayne and the
City of Detroit (the “City”) on November 26, 2014 pursuant to Act 233, Public Acts of Michigan, 1955, as amended
(“Act 233”). Pursuant to Leases that became effective on January 1, 2016, the Authority assumed possession and
control of the regional assets of both the water supply and sewage disposal systems owned by the City, which were
previously operated by the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (“DWSD” or the “Department”). The City,
acting through DWSD, will continue to manage and operate its own local retail water and sewer system
infrastructure. The leases assigned all revenues of both systems to the Authority for an initial term of 40 years and
substituted GLWA for the City as the obligor on all outstanding debt obligations of the City related to the systems.
The Authority’s water system is one of the largest in the United States, both in terms of water produced and
population served. The water system currently serves an area of 981 square miles located in eight Michigan counties
and an estimated population of nearly 3.8 million or approximately 38% of Michigan’s population. Suburban
wholesale customers comprise approximately 82% of the population served by the Authority, and the retail water
customers comprise the remainder served by the Authority.
The Authority’s sewer system is one of the largest in the United States, both in terms of treatment capacity and
population served. The sewer system currently serves an area of 850 square miles located in three Michigan
counties and an estimated population of nearly 2.8 million or approximately 28% of Michigan’s population. Suburban
customers comprise approximately 75% of the population served by the Authority, and the retail sewer customers
comprise the remainder served by the Authority.
The Authority is authorized to establish rates, fees and charges for its water supply and sewage disposal services.
Under the Water and Sewer Services Agreement, the City is appointed as agent of the Authority for setting retail
rates and for billing, collecting and enforcing the collection of charges from retail water and sewer customers. As
an agent of the Authority, the City, through the Board of Water Commissioners and without further approval by the
City Council, is required to set retail rates to meet the revenue requirements for the City retail portion of the water
and sewer systems. Under certain conditions, the Authority may terminate the City’s appointment.
The financial statements of the Authority have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) as applied to government units. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is the
accepted standard setting body for establishing governmental accounting and financial reporting principles. The
more significant of the Authority’s accounting policies are described below.
Reporting Entity
The GLWA Board is composed of six voting members. Two members are residents of the City of Detroit and are
appointed by the Mayor of the City of Detroit. The counties of Macomb, Oakland and Wayne each appoint one
member who is a resident of the county from which appointed and the Governor of the State of Michigan appoints
one member who is a resident of an area served by the Authority outside of the counties. All members of the GLWA
Board must have at least seven years of experience in a regulated industry, such as a utility, engineering, finance,
accounting or law firm. After the initial term specified in its Articles of Incorporation, each GLWA Board member is
appointed for a four-year term and serves at the pleasure of the appointing government.
The GLWA Board has adopted a committee structure. Four committees have been established: Audit, Capital
Improvement Planning, Operations and Resources, and Legal.
The Authority has a water enterprise fund and a sewage disposal enterprise fund, both of which are presented as
major funds.

This document (Great Lakes Water Authority Financial Report as of June 30, 2017) is in draft form and is subject to further
review and approval by GLWA management, the GLWA Audit Committee and Rehmann, and accordingly no assurances can
be given with respect to the contents of the document until it is released in ﬁnal form. No representation or warranty,

Notes To Financial Statements
Basis of Accounting
The accounting policies of the Authority conform to GAAP as applicable to governmental entities. The accounts of
the Authority are used to account for its activities, which are financed and operated in a manner similar to a private
business enterprise. Accordingly, the Authority maintains its records on the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues
from operations, investments and other sources are recorded when earned. Expenses (including depreciation) of
providing services to the public are accrued when incurred.
Nonexchange transactions, in which the Authority receives value without directly giving equal value in return,
include contributions and grants. On an accrual basis, revenue from contributions and grants is recognized in the
fiscal year in which all eligibility requirements have been satisfied, including timing and expense requirements.
Timing requirements specify the year when the resources are required to be used or the fiscal year when use is first
permitted. Expense requirements specify the year in which the resources are provided to the Authority on a
reimbursement basis.
Assets, Deferred Outflows of Resources, Liabilities, Deferred Inflows of Resources, and Equity
Cash Deposits and Investments
The Authority’s cash and cash equivalents are considered to be cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term
investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Investments are stated at fair value. Short-term investments are reported at cost, which approximates fair value.
Securities traded on a national or international exchange are valued at the last reported sales price at current
exchange rates. Mortgages are valued on the basis of future principal and interest payments, and are discounted at
prevailing interest rates for similar instruments. Investments that do not have established market values are
reported at estimated fair value. Cash deposits are reported at carrying amounts, which reasonably approximates
fair value.
State statutes authorize the Authority to deposit in the accounts of federally insured banks, credit unions and
savings and loan associations and to invest in obligations of the U.S. Treasury, certain commercial paper, repurchase
agreements, bankers’ acceptances and mutual funds composed of otherwise legal investments. The Authority also
maintains and adheres to a formal investment policy in accordance with Michigan Public Act 20 of 1943 Investment
Surplus Funds of Political Subdivisions.
Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents
Restricted assets are those assets set aside as required by the Authority's Master Bond Ordinance ("MBO"). See Note 4
for further details.
Unbilled Revenue
The Authority records unbilled revenues for services provided prior to year‐end by accruing actual revenues billed in
the subsequent month.
Contractual Obligation Receivable
Pursuant to the Water and Sewer Services Agreement between the City and Authority, the City is responsible for
paying the portion of debt service on the bonds assumed by the Authority that were issued to finance the cost of
improvements to the Detroit local facilities. Hence, the "receivable" recorded by the Authority on the "contractual
obligation" of the City to the Authority. Any new debt issued on behalf of DWSD is also included in the contractual
obligation receivable.

Notes To Financial Statements
Prepaid Items and Other Assets
Inventories consist of operating, maintenance and repair parts for sewage assets and are valued at the lower of cost
or market, with cost being determined on an average cost method. Inventory is recorded as expense when consumed
rather than when purchased. The water fund does not report inventory because the amounts are insignificant and
for efficiency are recorded in the sewage disposal fund. Any inventory usage by the water fund is charged through
an interfund payable to the sewage disposal fund.
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are recorded as prepaid items
in the financial statements.
Prepaid Lease
As described in Note 7, the Authority has recorded a prepaid lease for cash paid to DWSD on the date GLWA began
operations equivalent to six months of lease payments. As described in Note 11, based on a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) Term Sheet with DWSD, dated April 2018, this will be applied at the end of the 40 year term
and, hence it is classified as noncurrent.
Capital Assets
Capital assets are recorded at historical cost, together with interest capitalized during construction. All acquisitions
of land and land improvements are capitalized regardless of cost.
The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or materially extend assets’
lives are not capitalized.
Major outlays for capital assets and improvements are capitalized as projects are constructed. Interest incurred
during the construction phase of capital assets of business-type activities is included as part of the capitalized value
of the assets constructed.
Capital assets acquired after January 1, 2016 are depreciated on the straight line basis over the useful life of the
assets as follows:
Useful Lives
(in years)
Site improvements
Buildings and structures
Infrastructure
Machinery and equipment
Vehicles

15
20-50
80
3-20
5-7

Capital assets acquired from the bifurcation at January 1, 2016 are depreciated over their estimated remaining
useful lives at that time as determined by a third-party valuation. These remaining lives differ from the years cited
above for newly acquired capital assets and, in most instances, are significantly shorter.

Notes To Financial Statements
Deferred Outflows of Resources
In addition to assets, the statement of net position reports a separate section for deferred outflows of resources.
This separate financial statement element represents a consumption of net position that applies to future periods
and so will not be recognized as an outflow of resources (or expense) until then. The Authority reports deferred
outflows of resources for two items: deferred charges on refunding and pension amounts. Deferred charges on
refunding results from the difference in the carrying value of refunded debt and its reacquisition price; these
amounts are deferred and amortized over the shorter of the life of the refunded or refunding debt. Deferred
outflows of resources from pension amounts relate to the net pension liability. A portion of these costs represent
contributions to the plan subsequent to the plan measurement date. More detailed information on pension amounts
can be found in Note 9.
Long-term Obligations
In the financial statements, long-term debt and other long-term obligations are reported as liabilities in the
statement of net position. Bond premiums and discounts are deferred and amortized over the life of the bonds using
the effective interest method. Bonds payable are reported net of the applicable bond premium or discount.
Obligation Payable
Under the terms of the lease agreements with the City, the Authority is required to pay a portion of the City’s B and
C notes allocated to the regional water and sewer systems. See “Obligation Payable-City of Detroit 2014 Financial
Recovery Bonds” in Note 6.
Leases Payable
The effective date of the leases by the City to the Authority for the leased water and sewer facilities was January 1,
2016. See Note 7 for the detail of the leases.
Compensated Absences
The Authority has a paid time off (PTO) policy which has an annual accrual period ending September 30 each year.
Employees are allowed to carry over a maximum bank of 80 hours to the next accrual period. Balances greater than
80 hours up to a maximum of 160 hours shall be converted to the retiree health saving program at 50% of the value
of the PTO time. Hours in excess of 160 hours are forfeited if unused by September 30 of each accrual period. The
accrued compensated absences for PTO accrual are approximately $1,456,000 for the water fund and $679,000 for
the sewage disposal fund on June 30, 2017.
The Authority also has an accrued compensated absence liability assumed on January 1, 2016 relating to the
accumulated unpaid vacation and sick leave balances for those employees who retired from the City or resigned
from the City and accepted employment with the Authority on January 1, 2016. The June 30, 2017 balance of the
accrued compensated absences for the liability assumed on January 1, 2016 is approximately $2,990,000. This
liability is recorded in the water fund as the disbursements for payment will be processed from the water fund with
reimbursement from the sewer fund. The accrued compensated absences includes the employers’ share of Social
Security and Medicare taxes.
Bond Premiums, Discounts, and Deferred Amounts on Refunding
Bond premiums, discounts, and gains or losses on refunding are deferred and amortized over the life of the bonds.
Bond premiums and discounts are amortized using the effective interest method, and deferred amounts on refunding
are amortized using the straight‐line method. Bonds payable are reported net of the applicable bond premium and
discounts. Deferred amounts on refunding are reported as deferred outflows and deferred inflows of resources.

and is subject to further review and approval by GLWA management, the GLWA Audit Committee
and Rehmann, and accordingly no assurances can be given with respect to the contents of the

Notes To Financial Statements
Deferred Inflows of Resources
In addition to liabilities, the statement of net position includes a separate section for deferred inflows of resources.
This separate financial statement element represents an acquisition of net position that applies to future periods
and so will not be recognized as an inflow of resources (or revenues) until that time. The Authority has included the
deferred amounts on swap terminations, deferred gain on refunding and pension inflows in this reporting category.
The deferred amounts on swap terminations were assumed as part of the lease agreements with the City. The
amounts will be fully amortized for both funds by fiscal 2036. Deferred gain on refunding results from the
difference in the carrying value of refunded debt and its reacquisition price; these amounts are deferred and
amortized over the shorter of the life of the refunded or refunding debt. Deferred pension inflows result when
there is a change in total pension liability due to benefit changes, differences between expected and actual
experience, changes in actuarial assumptions, or differences between expected and actual investment returns. The
amount for the changes in actuarial assumptions is deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining service
life. The amount for the difference between actual and projected assumptions in investment earnings is deferred
and amortized over five years.
Net Position
Net position, which represents the difference between assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities and
deferred inflows of resources, is reported in three components as follows:
Net Investment in Capital Assets - consists of capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, and related debt.
Restricted – consists of amounts that are legally restricted by outside parties or by law through constitutional
provisions or enabling legislation.
Unrestricted – is the residual balance of net position after net investment in capital assets and restricted.
When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, generally it is the Authority’s policy to use
restricted resources first and then unrestricted resources when they are needed.
Classification of Revenues and Expenses
The Authority classifies its revenues and expenses as either operating or nonoperating.
Operating revenues are those revenues generated from providing services in connection with the Authority’s
principal ongoing operations. The principal operating revenues of the Authority are wholesale charges for providing
water and wastewater treatment. The local system charges are the wholesale charges to the City of Detroit under
the Water and Sewer Services Agreement. Wholesale customer charges are shown net of bad debt expense of
$1,252,465 for the water fund and $3,165,055 for the sewage disposal fund.
Operating expenses include the costs of operating the water and sewer utilities, administrative expenses and
depreciation on capital assets. Costs related to shared facilities and personnel are allocated to the water and sewer
funds on a basis that relates costs incurred to the system benefited. By agreement, the Authority provides shared
services to DWSD; accordingly, operating expenses for personnel and contractual services have been reported net of
the charges for shared services to DWSD.
All revenue and expenses not meeting these definitions are reported as nonoperating revenues and expenses.
Taxes
The Authority pays no direct federal, state or local taxes, except local taxes on excess property and federal Social
Security taxes.

Interest Income
Interest income is the interest earned on the contractual obligation receivable.
Interest Expense
Interest expense in the statement of revenues, expenses and changes in fund net position includes amounts related
to the accretion of capital appreciation bonds. Interest expense is reported net of capitalized interest.
Capital Contributions
Contributed capital represents the acquisition value of sewer lines received from a wholesale customer.
Central Services and Administrative Services
Various common costs incurred by the Authority are allocated proratably between the water and sewer funds. The
allocations are based on management’s best estimate and may change from year to year depending on the activities
incurred by each fund and the information available. The following table shows the allocation of these common
costs for the year ended June 30, 2017:

Administrative services includes executive, public affairs, general counsel, organizational development, risk
management, finance, procurement, and other service costs.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of basic financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the basic financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2. BUDGETARY INFORMATION
The financial activity of the Authority is presented in two enterprise funds, which are not required under State
statutes to adopt appropriated budgets. Budget to actual schedules for revenues and expenses is presented in the
other information section of this report. This schedule is not required by GAAP or subject to audit procedures. It is
presented strictly for informational purposes.
Budget Process
GLWA is required to adopt a two-year budget for the regional water and sewer systems. The budgeted expenses
shall equal the sum of the revenue requirement, including the following for both the regional water and sewer
systems: a) operation and maintenance expenses; b) amounts necessary to pay the principal of and interest on all
bonds and to restore any reserves therefor established in the Master Bond Ordinance; c) the lease payment, which
shall be a common-to-all charge; d) GLWA portions of the net pension liability and the B&C obligation payable; e)
the amount necessary to be deposited to the Water Residential Assistance Program (WRAP) Fund, which shall be a
common-to-all charge equal to 0.5% of the base budgeted operating revenues for the regional water and sewer
systems for each fiscal year; f) the amounts needed to make the required deposits to the regional Extraordinary
Repair and Replacement Reserve Fund and the regional Improvement and Extension Fund as defined in the Master
Bond Ordinance; and g) the amount necessary to satisfy the coverage ratios required by the rate covenant in the
Master Bond Ordinance.
As provided in the leases, through the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, the water and sewer systems are assumed to
experience annual increases in the regional revenue requirement of not more than 4%. This limitation shall not be
applicable, however, if the regional revenue requirement must increase beyond the 4% assumption in order to
satisfy the rate covenant or to pay the cost of improvements to the leased water and/or sewer facilities that are
required to be made by applicable laws.
In the leases, the City acknowledges that all local water and sewer system revenues received from customers in the
City are the property of the GLWA and will be deposited as received in the Receiving Fund as defined in the Master
Bond Ordinance and applied as provided in the Bond Ordinance. As a result, the City agrees to provide the Authority
with a budget for the local water and sewer system as provided in the Water and Sewer Services Agreement.
Schedule of Charges Process
The GLWA Wholesale Customer Model Water Contract requires that the GLWA provide wholesale customers with
written notice of a proposed charge, meet to review the proposed charges, and the underlying data used to
calculate the charge not less than 30 calendar days prior to a public hearing. Further, the contract requires that a
public hearing be held no less than 120 days prior to the date that a proposed charge increase is to take effect.
The Water and Sewer Services agreement between GLWA and DWSD requires that GLWA provides the City with
written notice of the proposed charges and the underlying data used to calculate the charge not less than 120
calendar days prior to the effective date of any new charges.

This document (Great Lakes Water Authority Financial Report as of June 30, 2017) is in draft form and is subject to further
review and approval by GLWA management, the GLWA Audit Committee and Rehmann, and accordingly no assurances can
be given with respect to the contents of the document until it is released in ﬁnal form. No representation or warranty,

Restricted cash of the Authority primarily consists of amounts held in reserve for construction retainage and for
future debt service payments.
Custodial Credit Risk - Deposits and Money Market Accounts. Deposits and money market accounts are exposed to
custodial credit risk if they are not covered by depository insurance. At year-end, the carrying amount of the
Authority’s deposits and money market accounts was $505,464,278 for the water fund and $404,341,355 for the
sewage disposal fund. The bank balance of the water fund deposits and money markets was $535,773,864 of which
$518,863,338 was uninsured and uncollateralized. The bank balance of the sewage disposal fund deposits and
money markets was $379,931,554 of which $379,593,521 was uninsured and uncollateralized.
In accordance with the Authority’s investment policy and State law, all deposits are uncollateralized, held in the
Authority’s name, and evidenced by a safekeeping receipt. Also, due to the dollar amounts of cash deposits and the
limits of FDIC insurance, the Authority believes it is impractical to insure all bank deposits. As a result, the Authority
evaluates each financial institution and assesses the level of risk of each institution; only those institutions with an
acceptable estimated risk level are used as depositories.

Investments are exposed to custodial credit risk if the securities are uninsured, unregistered or held by a
counterparty or its agent but not in the government’s name. In accordance with the Authority’s investment policy,
all investments are held in the name of the Authority and are evidenced by a safekeeping receipt confirmation, and
thus not exposed to custodial credit risk.
Credit Risk. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its
obligations. The Authority’s investment policy and State law require that commercial paper be rated in the top two
ratings by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.
As of June 30, 2017, all of the Authority’s investments in securities of U.S. agencies were rated AA+ by Standard &
Poor’s and Aaa by Moody's. U.S treasury securities are explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government and not
considered to have credit risk. The Authority's money market accounts were not rated.
Concentration of Credit Risk. Concentration of credit risk is the risk of loss attributed to the magnitude of a
government’s investment in a single issuer. The Authority’s investment policy requires diversification by security
type and institution, but does not place a fixed percentage limit for any one issuer.
At June 30, 2017, the Authority had greater than 5% of its total investment portfolio concentrated as follows:

Investment Type
Water fund
U.S. government agencies
U.S. government agencies

Sewage disposal fund
U.S. government agencies

64.75%
10.36%
24.89%

Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will adversely affect the fair
value of investments. The Authority’s investment policy does not limit investment maturities as a means of
managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates.

Fair Value Measurements - The Authority categorizes investments measured at fair value within the fair value
hierarchy established by generally accepted accounting principles. The hierarchy is based on the valuation inputs
used to measure the fair value of the assets. Level 1 inputs are quoted at prices in active markets for identical
assets; Level 2 inputs are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves observable at
commonly quoted intervals; and Level 3 inputs are unobservable in the market and are the least reliable. The
Authority had the following fair value measurements as of June 30, 2017:

Level 1

As part of the lease transaction in which GLWA leased the regional water and sewer system from the City of Detroit, all DWSD
revenue bonds outstanding as of December 31, 2015, including those purchased by the Michigan Finance Authority under its state
revolving loan program, were assumed by GLWA with the consent of bondholders. Total bonds assumed by GLWA totaled
$2,313,683,761 for the water fund and $3,291,282,050 for the sewage disposal fund.
Per the Water and Sewer Services Agreement between the DWSD and GLWA dated June 12, 2015 and the Master Bond Ordinance
dated October 7, 2015, as amended, the Detroit retail class continues to pay its common-to-all share of debt service revenue
requirements and its allocated share of debt service revenue requirements associated with improvements to the local water and
sewer systems. Payments on the debt service incurred by GLWA on the outstanding revenue bonds assumed as of December 31, 2015
are to be allocated using an agreed-upon percentage of total debt service associated with bond-financed local improvements over
the life of such bonds, though the bonds themselves continue to be secured by the net revenue of GLWA, and the revenues of the
Detroit retail class. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Term Sheet was entered into with DWSD dated April 2018 with an
agreed upon allocation and amortization schedule. The June 30, 2017 balance has been adjusted to the revised allocation. The
total obligation receivable at June 30, 2017, including the additional water fund debt issued during the year, is $495,681,322 for

adjustments expense. The liability is based on individual claims and management's evaluation of experience
with respect to the probable number and nature of claims. Any adjustments resulting from settlement of
losses will be reflected in earnings at the time the adjustments are determined.

Medical insurance. The Authority provides medical benefits to a significant number of employees through a
self-insured health plan that is administered by third party administrators. The Authority purchased stop loss
insurance for its self-insured health plan with terms of $300,000 per contract to reduce risk exposure for the
group. The self-insured program is administered by a third-party administrator who provides claims review
and processing services as well as illustrated premium rates, which are anticipated, over time, to
approximate the actual cost of benefits.

9. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLAN
Defined Contribution Plans
The Great Lakes Water Authority Defined Contribution Retirement Plan is a 401(a) governmental money
purchase plan administered by ICMA Retirement Corporation (the “Administrator”) to provide benefits at
retirement to all full-time employees of the Authority. The Authority contributes 6.0% of earnings to the
plan. The Authority will make an additional contribution to the 401(a) plan to match employee pre-tax
contributions under the Great Lakes Water Authority 457 Plan up to 3% of compensation. Employees are
100% vested after three years of service (cliff vesting). Employees who transferred to the Authority on or
around January 1, 2016 from DWSD retain their years of service for vesting purposes. Employer contributions
totaled $3,986,841 million for the year ended June 30, 2017. At June 30, 2017, there were 893 plan
members.

Notes To Financial Statements
The Great Lakes Water Authority Defined Contribution Plan Make-Up Benefit Plan is a 401(a) governmental
money purchase plan administered by ICMA Retirement Corporation (the “Administrator”) to provide
benefits at retirement to all employees who terminated employment with DWSD on or around January 1,
2016 and were not vested in the City of Detroit General Retirement System (GRS). Eligible employees are
required to roll over to the Authority’s Section 457 Deferred Compensation Plan their refunded employee
mandatory contribution from GRS. The amount of the make-up benefit will be determined by an actuary
based on the present value of the lost GRS benefit. Employees are 100% vested after one year of service.
The Authority has also adopted a Section 457 Deferred Compensation Plan which employees can make pretax contributions which are immediately 100% vested. At June 30, 2017, there were 729 plan members.
Retirement Health Savings Plan
The Authority also provides a Retirement Health Savings Program for full-time employees. Employees are
required to contribute $10 per pay period and the Authority contributes $80 per pay period. Employees are
100% vested after three years of service (cliff vesting). Employees who transferred to the Authority on or
around January 1, 2016 from DWSD retain their years of service for vesting purposes. Employer contributions
were $1,661,440 and employee contributions were $207,670 for the year ended June 30, 2017. At June 30,
2017, there were 975 plan members.
10. NET PENSION LIABILITY (SPECIAL FUNDING SITUATION)
As part of the City of Detroit bankruptcy plan of adjustment (POA) and the Leases (Section 4.3), the City,
the City of Detroit General Employees’ Retirement system (GRS or the “System”) and the Authority entered
into an agreement on December 1, 2015 that set forth the terms for contributions and reporting of the DWSD
share of the GRS pension pool. GRS provides the information necessary for the Authority and DWSD to report
the proportionate share separately in their respective statements. On January 24, 2017, DWSD and the
Authority provided a supplement to the agreement whereby GRS is directed to allocate investments and
pension liabilities of the DWSD division on the basis of 70.3% to the Authority and 29.7% to DWSD effective
January 1, 2016. This information is available in a separate audit report for the “Legacy Pension Plan
(Component II) of the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit Statement of Changes in Fiduciary
Net Position by Division with Supplemental Information as of June 30, 2017" and is available by contacting
the Authority’s management. This agreement constitutes a special funding situation pursuant to the
provisions of GASB 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions. As such, while no Authority
employees earn service credit in the legacy or hybrid plans, GLWA is legally responsible for making
substantial contributions to a legacy pension plan of another entity and, accordingly, must record a net
pension liability for its proportion and make the following disclosures regarding the plan as required by the
standard.
Plan Administration. The Authority contributes to (and DWSD participates in) the System. The System is a
single employer plan composed of a defined benefit plan component and a defined contribution annuity plan
component. The plan provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to plan members and
beneficiaries. The plan is administered by its own board of trustees. Plan members include active
employees, retirees and beneficiaries from various departments within the City. Benefit terms have been
established by contractual agreements between the City and the employees’ collective bargaining units;
amendments are subject to the same process.

Notes To Financial Statements
The System issues publicly available financial reports that include financial statements and the required
supplementary information. The reports can be obtained from City of Detroit Retirement Systems, One
Detroit Center, 500 Woodward Avenue, Suite 3000, Detroit, MI 48226 or obtained from the Systems’ website
(www.rscd.org). Detailed information about the pension plan’s fiduciary net position is available in the
separately issued financial reports.
Benefits Provided. Plan members may retire at age 55 or 60 with 5, 8, 10 or 25 years of credited service
depending on which group the employee is in. Members are vested after completing 5, 8 or 10 years of
credited service. Retirement options that provide for survivor benefits are available to members. The Plan
also provides death and disability benefits. If a member leaves employment or dies before vesting,
accumulated member contributions plus interest are refunded to the member or designated beneficiary.
Component II - Component II is the legacy plan, the original defined benefit plan, which includes a defined
benefit component and a defined contribution component. Component II generally applies to benefits
accrued by members prior to July 1, 2014. The plan provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to
plan members and beneficiaries. Except as specifically provided in the combined plan, benefits provided
under Component II are frozen effective June 30, 2014. Component II also includes the income stabilization
fund. The fund, a part of Component II and established as a provision of the POA, was established for the
sole purpose of paying the income stabilization benefits to eligible pensioners. Complete details regarding
the Component II benefits and changes in those benefits by virtue of the POA are presented in the System
financial statements.
Employer Contributions. Employer contributions, including the Authority's nonemployer contribution, for
the respective components are as follows:
Component II - Employer contributions to the GRS were determined by the provisions of the POA. Included
within contributions in Component II are amounts sourced from the one-time sale of City-owned artwork
with proceeds from the Foundation for Detroit's Future in the amount of $32,886,827 along with $4,005,830
from unlimited tax general obligation bonds and $67,900,000 of contributions from the City and related
entities, of which $45,400,000 of contributions were from GLWA and DWSD. Employer contributions were
also made into the income stabilization fund in the amount of $1,689,857 from the bond proceeds.
The POA obligates DWSD to pay $2,500,000 per year towards administrative costs and annual plan
contributions of $42,900,000 per year in total for both water and sewer employees, until 2023. Pursuant to
the leases, the Authority is obligated to pay its allocable share of such liability. The portion allocated to the
Authority is $31,916,200 for fiscal year 2017. Subsequent to 2023, DWSD and the Authority will be
responsible for paying their allocable share of any additional amounts that are actuarially determined to be
payable.
The information below represents the Authority’s share of pension liability activity. DWSD separately
reports its prorata share of activity in its separate financial statements.
DWSD Employee Contributions. Contribution requirements of plan members are established and may be
amended by the board of trustees in accordance with the City Charter, union contracts, and plan provisions.
For the year ended June 30, 2017, there were minimal employee contributions into Component II, only
related to military service credit, as the plan was frozen as of June 30, 2014; contributions into Component I
began thereafter.
Net Pension Liability. The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2016, and the total pension
liability used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of that date.

Actuarial Assumptions. The total pension liability in the June 30, 2016 actuarial valuation was determined
using the following actuarial assumptions.
Inflation
Salary increases
Investment rate of return

NA
NA
7.23%, net of investment expense and
including inflation

The actuarial assumptions were based on an experience study from 2008-2013 issued in February 2015; the
mortality table assumption was based on RP-2014 Blue Collar Annuitant Table for males and females. The
tables are projected to be fully generational, based on two-dimensional sex distinct mortality scale MP2014.
The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block
method in which best-estimates of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension
plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each asset class. These real ranges are combined
to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by
the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. For each asset class that is included
in the pension plan's target asset allocation as of June 30, 2016, these best estimates are summarized in the
following table:

Discount Rate. The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.23%. The projection of
cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that plan member contributions will be made at the
current contribution rate and that Authority contributions will be made at rates equal to the difference
between actuarially determined contribution rates and the member rate. Based on those assumptions, the
pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit
payments of current active and inactive employees. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on
pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total
pension liability.

11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Capital Improvement Program
The Authority is engaged in a variety of projects that are part of its five-year capital improvement program
(the "Program"). The total cost of this Program is anticipated to be approximately $800.6 million for the
water fund and $752.7 million for the sewage disposal fund through fiscal year 2022. The Program is being
financed primarily from revenue bond proceeds in addition to customer charges revenue. The latter is
accounted for in the Improvement & Extension Fund as defined in the MBO. As of June 30, 2017, the water
fund has unspent bond proceeds of $173.0 million in addition to the Improvement & Extension funds of
$177.3 million available for use in funding these commitments. Similarly, the sewage disposal fund has
unspent bond proceeds of $150.9 million in addition to Improvement & Extension funds of $61.8 million
available for use in funding these commitments.
The total amount of construction contract commitments outstanding at June 30, 2017 was approximately
$34.5 million for the water fund and $139.0 million for the sewage disposal fund.
Contingencies
The Authority is subject to various government environmental laws and regulations. GASB Statement No. 49,
Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pollution Remediation Obligations, established accounting and
financial reporting standards for pollution (including contamination) remediation obligations, which are
obligations to address the current or potential detrimental effects of existing pollution by participating in
pollution remedial activities such as site assessments and cleanups. The standard excludes pollution
prevention or control obligations with respect to current operations, and future pollution remediation
activities that are required upon retirement of an asset, such as landfill closure and post-closure care. The
Authority determined that there were no estimated pollution remediation obligations to be recorded at
June 30, 2017.
The sewage disposal fund’s operations are subject to regulation pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act, as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the Water Quality Act of 1987 (collectively, the
Clean Water Act). Included in the regulatory framework established by the Clean Water Act is the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program, which requires operation of wastewater
system facilities according to discharge limitations and other requirements as set forth in permits issued to
each facility. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has authorized the Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality (MDEQ) to implement and enforce the federal NPDES permit program. The sewage
disposal fund operates pursuant to an NPDES permit that is in effect through October 1, 2017.
The Authority is a defendant in numerous alleged claims, lawsuits, billing disputes, and other stated and
pending demands. The Authority's Legal Department has estimated a reserve of $75,000 for the water fund
and $4,039,562 for the sewage disposal fund, which are included in the accompanying financial statements,
for the potential outcome of such claims or the amount of potential damages in the event of an unfavorable
outcome for each of the above contingencies. The Authority’s management believes that any differences in
reserved amounts and final settlement, after consideration of claims covered by insurance, resulting from
such litigation will not materially impact the Authority’s financial position or results of operations.
The Authority holds various commercial insurance policies to cover other potential loss exposures.

12. SPECIAL ITEM
On April 3, 2018, the Board of Directors for the Great Lakes Water Authority approved a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) Term Sheet. On April 4, 2018, the Board of Water Commissioners for the DWSD
approved the same Term Sheet. The Term Sheet was not intended to impose any legal obligation on the
parties. A final MOU that will make the provisions of the Term Sheet binding on GLWA and DWSD is expected
to be completed and approved by both Boards by July 1, 2018. The Leases and the Water and Sewer Services
Agreement (“WSSA”) between the City and GLWA and the MBO, govern the relationship between DWSD and
GLWA, which began on January 1, 2016 (the “Effective Date”). The intent of the MOU is to (a) provide
clarification of specific sections of the Leases, WSSA and MBO; (b) make adjustments contemplated by the
Leases and the WSSA; and (c) address the liquidation of specific liabilities. The transactions associated with
this MOU Term Sheet resulted in a special item on the statement of activities for the year ended June 30,
2017, comprised of the following:

Effective December 1, 2017, the Authority, the City of Flint (the City), Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA),
Genesee County Drain Commission (GCDC) and State of Michigan entered into a long-term partnership
agreement to satisfy a number of critical water service needs across the region. Key provisions of a master
agreement comprised of seven separate exhibits includes: 1) a 30-year water service contract with the City
that establishes GLWA as the long-term water source for the City and credits the City of its debt service
payment obligations on existing KWA bonds for the building of its water plant; 2) a long-term lease to GLWA
of the 72-inch line serving the City; and 3) a 30-year contract for reciprocal, emergency water services
between GLWA and GCDC.
