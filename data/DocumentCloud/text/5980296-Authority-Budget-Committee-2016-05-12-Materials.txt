 1. Public Comment
None.

2. Minutes of the October 20, 2015 Budget Committee Meeting
Motion: Ms. Greene moved to approve the Minutes of the October 20, 2015 Budget
Committee meeting. Col. Winters seconded the motion and it passed by unanimous voice
vote.

3. Justice Assistance Grants (JAG)
Associate Director Kevin Givens called attention to the memo from himself dated
January 19, 2016 regarding the FFY14 JAG plan adjustment and contained at Item 3 in
the meeting materials. He said that staff recommends designating $331,569 in FFY14
funds to the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) to support its Community-Based
Residential Treatment for Adults program. He said that this pre-release program provides
for a structured environment that includes strict expectations for behavior, participation,
and active involvement during substance abuse treatment programming at an IDOC Adult
Transition Center (ATC). He briefly described the program’s budget details.
Motion: Ms. Campanelli moved to approve the recommended JAG FFY14 plan
adjustment. Ms. Greene seconded the motion and it passed by unanimous voice vote.

4. Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Act (RSAT) Local Program Request for
Proposal (RFP)
Associate Director Givens called attention to the memo from himself dated January 19,
2016 regarding the FFY13 - FFY15 RSAT Local Program RFP and contained at Item 4
in the meeting materials. He said that the RFP would support local post-detention
programs to treat heroin addiction.
Mr. Stevens said that after the RFP is let out and the responses are scored, staff will
present to the Budget Committee a set of designation requests to support the winning
proposals.
This information was provided for informational purposes only. No Budget Committee
action was taken.

 5. Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA)
Associate Director Givens called attention to the memo from himself dated January 19,
2016 regarding the FFY13 and FFY14 SORNA plan adjustments and contained at Item 5
in the meeting materials. He described designations of $159,098 in lapsing FFY13 funds
and $263,394 in FFY14 funds to the Illinois Sheriff’s Association to enter into a oneyear contract for statewide provision of Offender Watch © services. He said that this
effort would move Illinois closer to compliance with the Adam Walsh Child Protection
and Safety Act of 2006.
Ms. Wolff said that, ultimately, full compliance with the Adam Walsh Act would require
legislative action by the General Assembly.
Director Maki said that there are two issues here:
1. There is a larger compliance issue that includes needed statutory changes that
have not happened yet.
2. There is the question as to whether this is a worthwhile program in and of itself.
Mr. Reichgelt said that these funds resulted from a five percent fine on the Authority’s
JAG awards for Adam Walsh Act non-compliance. These funds are returned to these
states to support programming to move the states toward compliance. The Authority has
been using these funds to support a statewide reporting system via the Illinois State
Police (ISP). However, these funds pay for participating counties’ fees for using the
Offender Watch system as made possible by the Illinois Sheriff’s Association. Offender
Watch is not a statewide system and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) has informed
the Authority that starting with the FFY15 award support for Offender Watch will no
longer be an allowable use of SORNA funds. Therefore, the remaining FFY13 and
FFY14 funds are being used to continue to support Offender Watch until those funds are
exhausted. Staff is working with ISP to develop a use of the FFY15 SORNA funds in
support of a statewide system. Neither of these things will bring Illinois into full
compliance with the Adam Walsh Act.
This information was provided for informational purposes only. No Budget Committee
action was taken.

 6. Victim Assistance Discretionary Grant Training (VADGT) Program
Associate Director Givens called attention to the memo from himself dated January 19,
2016 regarding the FFY15 VADGT plan introduction and contained at Item 6 in the
meeting materials. He said that the designations recommended by staff and described in
the table below would support training and technical assistance for victim assistance
service providers and would have program start dates of January 1, 2016.

Ms. Wolff said that research should be a component of any program as a means of
evaluating training program effectiveness.
Ms. Greene said that these training programs are fairly standardized across the country.
Mr. Reichgelt said that Illinois received the FFY15 VADGT award of almost $1 million
as a discretionary grant and a result of a competitive process. The basis for this program
is the drastic expansion of Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) funding; the Office for Victims
of Crime (OVC) didn’t want VOCA-funded programs to hire lots of new people without
making the proper training available to them.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended VADGT plan introduction. Ms.
Greene seconded the motion and it passed by unanimous voice vote, with an abstention
by Ms. Hora with regard to the designation to the Illinois Attorney General’s Office.

7. Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)
Associate Director Givens called attention to the memo from himself dated January 19,
2016 regarding the FFY12, FFY13, and FFY14 VAWA plan adjustments and contained
at Item 7 in the meeting materials. He called attention to the table on Page 1 of the
VAWA memo describing FFY12 and FFY13 funds recently returned to the Authority and
said that staff recommended that those funds be made available for other programming.
He said that the table on Page 2 of the VAWA memo described recommended
designations to support Multi-Disciplinary Team Response programs (MDTs).

 Ms. Campanelli said that despite the large volume of information presented in the
materials regarding the designation recommendations, a more focused presentation would
be helpful.
Mr. Reichgelt said that every three years the Authority hosts a Victim Services Ad Hoc
Committee (VSAHC) meeting, the most recent one having been in 2013. This is done to
satisfy VAWA Implementation Plan requirements. The VSAHC consists of Authority
Board members and stakeholders from throughout Illinois. At the meetings, staff
provides the VSAHC with data showing victimization, crime rates, service gaps, etc., and
the VSAHC uses that data to develop a spending plan. The VSAHC also develops
priorities for the use of VAWA funds which are then presented to the Authority Board
along with the Implementation Plan. One aspect of the current plan is that VAWA funds
should support MDTs; coordinated programs and specialized personnel across specific
disciplines – law enforcement, probation, prosecution, and service providers. The
designations recommended in this memo are the winning responses to a Request-forApplications (RFA) that was let in 2015. While each participating agency will receive its
own grants, each MDT will be evaluated as a whole; the whole MDT will be held
accountable if a single participating entity fails. Evaluations of past MDT programs have
shown them to be very successful.
Ms. Wolff suggested that future Budget Committee memorandums addressing
designation recommendations derived from RFA or RFP processes include summaries of
said processes so that the necessary background information will be available to the
Board members as they review the materials.
Director Maki suggested scheduling pre-meeting conference calls so that Board
Members’ questions can be addressed between the time that they receive the Budget
Committee agenda/materials and the Budget Committee meetings themselves.
Mr. Reichgelt said that these programs would have program start dates of January 1,
2016.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended VAWA FFY12, FFY13, and
FFY14 plan adjustments. Ms. Campanelli seconded the motion and it passed by
unanimous voice vote, with an abstention by Ms. Greene with regard to the designations
involving Cook County.

 8. Violence Against Women Act Grants to Encourage Arrest and Enforcement of
Protection Orders Program (VAWA A)
Associate Director Givens called attention to the memo from himself dated January 19,
2016 regarding the FFY14 VAWA A plan adjustment and contained at Item 8 in the
meeting materials. He said that Rock Island County originally received a VAWA A
FFY14 grant for $9,260 to support its Judicial Circuit Family Violence Coordinating
Council (FVCC), but these funds had been rescinded and made available for other
programming purposes. He said that staff recommends designating $234,070 in
additional FFY14 funds to support the second year of the original FVCC designations
that were approved in 2014, as described in the attached Budget Committee Grant
Recommendation Report. These programs normally receive additional funding from the
state, but such funding has not been disbursed in SFY16 due to the budget impasse.
This information was provided for informational purposes only. No Budget Committee
action was taken.

9. Victims of Crime Act (VOCA)
Associate Director Givens called attention to the memo from Director Maki dated
January 19, 2016 regarding the FFY12, FFY14, and FFY15 VOCA plan adjustments and
contained at Item 9 in the meeting materials. He called attention to the table on Page 1 of
the VOCA memo describing FFY12 and FFY14 funds recently returned to the Authority
and said that staff recommended that those funds be made available for other
programming. He said that the table on Page 2 of the VOCA memo described
recommended designations to support Multi-Disciplinary Team Response programs
(MDTs) in conjunction with the VAWA MDT designations described in Item 7.
Sharmili Majmudar, representing Rape Victim Advocates (RVA), delivered a
presentation describing services provided by RVA and RVA’s role in its respective MDT
program.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended VOCA FFY12, FFY14, and
FFY15 plan adjustments. Col. Winters seconded the motion and it passed by unanimous
voice vote, with an abstention by Ms. Greene with regard to the designations involving
Cook County.

FFY15 INTRODUCTION
The total FFY15 award to Illinois is $9,870,856. As per federal guidelines, JAG funds allocated
to states are divided with 60 percent ($5,922,514) awarded to the State Administering Agency
(Authority) and 40 percent ($3,948,342) awarded directly to eligible units of local government
within the state and administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). These direct awards
are allocated to the units of local government by a formula established by BJA.
The Authority’s FFY15 JAG total award is $6,411,708. The Authority will use 10 percent of this
award ($641,171) for administrative purposes. Per federal requirements, a minimum of 70.66
percent ($3,766,363) of Illinois’s fund allocation must be made available to units of local
government. The remaining 29.34 percent ($1,563,899) is available for state and/or discretionary
use. This award includes a set-aside of $440,275 which is meant for direct formula awards to
units of local government in Illinois, as administered by BJA, but fell under the $10,000
threshold for direct funding as required by the federal formula. These funds are to be
administered by the Authority, but must be made available for local units of government not
receiving direct JAG funding under the federal formula.

High rates of violent crime and victimization continue
to plague many communities in Illinois, with some
communities experiencing violent index crime, murder,
and aggravated assault and battery rates notably above
the state’s average. Illinois’ communities that
experience higher levels of crime and victimization also
tend to suffer from high and persistent concentrations of
social and economic disadvantage, including
unemployment, poverty, family disruption, and racial
isolation.
The goal of this solicitation is to select local
jurisdictions in which to seed a focused deterrence
strategy along with procedural justice which requires
significant community engagement and cross systems
collaboration.

RE:

SFY 2016 Funding for Safe From the Start

This memo describes proposed State Fiscal Year 2016 designations for the above
referenced programs. Note: Safe From the Start is included as a line item in the
Governor’s proposed budget for FY2016. Funding approval is requested contingent on a
budget passed by the legislature and signed by the Governor.
SAFE FROM THE START
Currently in its 15th year, the Safe From the Start (SFS) Grant Program was initiated after
national and local attention was focused on the issue of childhood exposure to violence.
The SFS program implements and evaluates comprehensive and coordinated community
models to identify and respond to children (primarily ages 0-5) exposed to violence in the
home or community, and their families. The SFS Program consists of three major
components, Coalition and Collaboration building; Direct Services and Public
Awareness. The goals and activities associated with each of these program components
are discussed below.
Program requirements include the following:
 Develop and maintain a local Safe From the Start coalition to ensure multidisciplinary response to childhood exposure to violence. The coalition meetings
are held at least quarterly and serve as a forum to discuss the child exposure to
violence response system.
 Provide direct services to children, primarily ages 0-5, who have been exposed to
violence and their families. The direct services consist of individual and family
clinical services and supportive case management services. A comprehensive
battery of assessments is completed on both child and non-offending caregiver to
help guide therapeutic sessions. After five to eight (5-8) sessions, the assessment
tools are completed a second time to assess reduction in child’s symptoms and
caregiver’s stress.
 Conduct public awareness activities to raise awareness regarding childhood
exposure to violence. Grantees typically conduct presentations throughout the
community, collaborate in resource fairs, etc. They use resources such as Safe
From the Start Training Modules; Keeping Kids Safe From the Start; and the
19

 SFS SFY 2016

three DVDs in the series “Stories for Kids that Grownups Can Watch.” These
DVDs were developed in collaboration with the Chicago Department of Public
Health, Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, Chicago Metropolis
and the Illinois Childhood Trauma Coalition.
During FY15 (July 1, 2014 – June 30, 2015), grantees provided 8,598 direct service hours
to 1,967 children aged 0-5 and their families. Another 33,827 individuals were reached
through trainings, community presentations and events.
Staff recommends that a maximum of $1,031,400 in SFY 2016 General Revenue Funds
be designated to Safe From the Start program to allow the agencies listed below to
continue for an additional 12 months. If the appropriation is less than the amount
recommended, staff asks permission to reduce funding for University of Illinois at
Chicago based on anticipated expenditures needed to complete evaluation activities.
Remaining grantees would be funded based on pro-rate reductions consistent with
percentage of reduced funding.

All nine implementation sites have reduced their
collaboration and public education efforts,
primarily to help reduce the number of new clients
that come to the agency from the resulting
referrals. Seven sites have either stopped accepting
new families, or have limited the number of new
families they are able to serve. The agency
responsible for evaluation has not conducted any
activities on the effectiveness of service provision
that has been provided since July 1, 2015.

Effect of budget impasse on program – State
programs only

Compared to the first six months of FY2015, there
have been 105 fewer children ages 0-5 (and their
families) who have received therapy for childhood
exposure to violence, which translates into an 11%
reduction. During the same time period, there has
been a 28% reduction in the number of direct
service hours provided to families. Compared to
the first six months of FY2015, there have been a
277 fewer parents and children who have received
prevention programming, which translates into an
18% reduction.

During FY15 (July 1, 2014 – June 30, 2015),
grantees provided 8,598 direct service hours to
1,967 children aged 0-5 and their families.
Another 33,827 individuals were reached through
trainings, community presentations and events.
The Authority awarded a grant to the University of
Illinois at Chicago to complete a Safe from the
Start (SFS) evaluation report, examining services
from Fiscal Years 2001 to 2014 across all 11 sites.
Findings from this study, taken together with two
national studies on Safe from the Start (SFS) sites
and other published research on Safe from the
Start (SFS) programs suggest that families
involved in Safe from the Start (SFS) services
experienced reductions in trauma-related
symptoms. Analyses comparing baseline
behavioral health scores of Illinois Safe from the
Start (SFS) program participants to those with
assessments scores after five to 10 sessions
indicate notable reductions in social-emotional
delays, problem behaviors, and parental stress.
These findings are consistent to that found in sites
nationally. The greatest improvement in child
health measures were associated with services
dedicated to the healthy expression of emotion,
good and bad touches, and learning about the cycle
of violence. Services that focused on the effects of
violence exposure, sexual abuse, support networks,
and grief/loss were correlated with the largest
gains in caregiver stress relief, while caregiver
services focusing on appropriate discipline were
associated with improved child behavior measures.

VAWA FFY15 INTRODUCTION
The FFY15 VAWA award to Illinois is $4,792,641 and these funds are currently set to
expire on June 30, 2017. As with FFY01 through FFY14 VAWA funds, after setting
aside ten percent of the award ($479,264) for administrative purposes, 25 percent of the
funds must go to law enforcement, 25 percent to prosecution, 30 percent to service
providers, and five percent to the courts. The remaining 15 percent can be allocated at the
state’s discretion amongst the other identified disciplines. A total of $4,313,377 is
available for program purposes.

RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
On October 22 and 23, 2013, the Authority convened the Victim Service Ad Hoc
Committee (VSAHC) to review past priorities and define new ones for the use of STOP
VAWA funds. The VSAHC recommended that FFY14 - FFY16 VAWA funds be used
principally to continue to support programs previously funded through VAWA. The
following are continuation designations for previously funded VAWA programs which

RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
Services to Victims of Domestic Violence
Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV): ICADV is a statewide network of
service providers that provides direct services to victims to alleviate trauma and suffering
resulting from domestic violence. Staff recommends designating $15,000 in lapsing FFY13
funds to ICADV for the Virtual Legal Clinic (VLC) project. FFY13 funds expire on September
30, 2016.
The VLC project was recently developed in collaboration with Office of the Illinois Lieutenant
Governor. The VLC provides free, private, legal consultations via web cam technology by
licensed attorneys skilled in family law to domestic violence survivors who are clients of ICADV
agencies. The VLC brings survivors of domestic violence and attorneys together online in a
secure and confidential environment to help survivors understand the important legal rights they
have to protect themselves and their children. Utilizing Skype technology, a survivor can speak
face to face with an attorney regardless of where in Illinois the licensed attorney may be.
In order to bring this project to even more communities throughout Illinois, ICADV member
agencies need to be provided a laptop with webcam to set up in a private area of their agency.
With this designation ICADV will purchase laptops and technology upgrades to expand access to
its VLC to survivors of domestic violence in Illinois. Match will be provide through state and
local funds.
Continuing Programming
On October 22 and 23, 2013, the Authority convened the Victim Service Ad Hoc Committee
(VSAHC) to review past priorities and define new ones for the use of VOCA funds. The
VSAHC recommended that FFY14 - FFY16 VOCA funds be used principally to continue to
support core programs previously funded through VOCA. The following are continuation
designations for previously funded VOCA programs which staff deem successful. The
designations recommended in this memo and future designations will be consistent with the
priorities set forth by the Victim Service Ad Hoc Committee.
Except where noted by an asterisk (*), these continuation designations represent a 25 percent
increase compared to each program’s most recent designations. These designations will support a
final year of Authority VOCA-supported funding for these programs. New Requests-forProposals (RFPs) will be issued later in 2016 to determine recipients of Authority VOCAsupported funding beginning for a three-year period beginning in 2017.

The Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) is a formula grant
program awarded by the U.S. Department of Justice
Office of Justice Programs’ Office for Victims of
Crime. VOCA victim assistance is intended to pay for
direct services to victims of crime. Services under this
grant program are defined as those that: 1. Respond to
the emotional and physical needs of crime victims. 2.
Assist primary and secondary victims of crime to
stabilize their lives after victimization. 3. Assist
victims to understand and participate in the criminal
justice system. 4. Provide victims of crime with a
measure of safety and security such as boarding-up
broken windows and replacing and repairing locks.
The funds are distributed to each state, based upon the
state's population in relation to all other states, as
determined by current census data. Illinois is given
latitude in allocating funds, but must give 10% to each
of the following priority areas: - Sexual assault; Domestic violence; - Child abuse; and - Previously
underserved populations (i.e. Federal crime victims,
Survivors of homicide victims, Assault victims,
Robbery victims, Victims of gang violence, Victims of
hate or bias crimes, Victims of intoxicated drivers,

RE:

SFY 2016 Funding for the Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council
(IFVCC)

IFVCC is included as a line item in the Governor’s proposed budget for FY2016.
Funding approval is requested contingent on a budget passed by the legislature and
signed by the Governor.
ILLINOIS FAMILY VIOLENCE COORDINATING COUNCIL
The Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council is made up of 23 local family
violence coordinating councils, whose purpose is to establish a forum to share and
discuss information in order to promote a coordinated response to family violence in our
communities. Established in 1993, the Councils work to improve the criminal justice
institutional and professional response to family violence issues. The Councils engage in
prevention, education, and the coordination of intervention and services for victims and
perpetrators of child abuse, domestic violence, and elder abuse.
Each Council is judicially led by the chief judge or a judge appointed by the chief judge.
A separate fiscal agent administers the annual allocation of funds. Funds are used to
support a part-time Local Council Coordinator in each Council, as well as coordination of
committee work, training, travel, and other related activities as determined by the Local
Council Planning/Steering Committees. The Planning/Steering Committee establishes,
along with the Local Council Coordinator, the Goals and Objectives for the upcoming
year. All local council activities are approved by the Illinois Family Violence
Coordinating Council.
Staff recommends that a maximum amount of $417,947 in SFY 2016 General Revenue
Funds for the Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council for an additional 12 months
be designated as described in the table below. If the appropriation is less than the amount
recommended, staff asks permission to pro-rate reductions consistent with the percentage
of reduced funding.

Illinois is one of the few states that has a
systematically organized, statewide infrastructure
that operates at both the state and local levels.
Since the 1970's, a comprehensive, coordinated
approach to preventing family violence has been
promoted as the most efficient and effective way
to penetrate systems and mobilize them for the
greatest change.
Annually, up to 15,000 professionals from across
Illinois participate in trainings and council
projects. These include family violence training
and education of criminal justice and community
professionals; development of criminal justice
procedures, protocols, and services related to
family violence; and the facilitation of coordinated
community response to family violence in local
areas. These Local Councils provide opportunities
for communication between criminal justice
professionals and community service providers as
well as encourage the sharing of information and
resources, thereby providing for development of a
network of safety and assistance for family
violence victims.

on hiring a coordinator until a state budget is
passed. This has led to local FVCC’s losing
visibility, momentum and participation. The lack
of state budget has also affected local stakeholders
and committee members, which has limited local
council members' capacity to participate in council
activities, including meetings, trainings and
community awareness events. Additionally,
IFVCC's work on its federal OVW Arrest grant
has been affected. Five councils have declined to
renew/take the Arrest grant for this year due to
inability to complete goals and objectives.
Without the primary funding from GRF, Arrest
grant money is not being utilized due to no or little
activity in local councils. Trainings on protocols
developed through this the Arrest grant have been
canceled by several local councils, and will not be
scheduled until there is a state budget.
In FY15 7,579 criminal justice professionals
attended IFVCC trainings.
An external evaluation of the Illinois Family
Violence Coordinating Council (IFVCC) was
conducted in 2008 by Nicole E. Allen and
Shabnam Javani from the University of Illinois.
The goal of the research project was to document
the efforts of IFVCC and to examine how change
is facilitated in the community response to intimate
partner violence. This study collected data from
several sources including interviews with local
council coordinators, survey of council members,
ethnographic inquiry in three case study sites,
formal and informal observation of council
meetings and activities, review of criminal justice
and human service archives and review of IFVCC
annual reports over a span of six years. The
findings suggest that councils are poised to
facilitate shifts in knowledge and relationships
among stakeholders. The multi-level model of
having both a centralized (a single state FVCC
Steering Committee and Office) and decentralized
(local FVCC with considerable autonomy), this
program capitalizes on having the “best of both
worlds” including locally-driven action and
externally-supported efforts. Council formation
and development has a positive impact on the
return rate from emergency orders of protection to
become plenary orders reflecting greater
accessibility and also coordination.

Crime Strategy Analysis and Evaluation Program

Funding Source:

JAG FFY10 - $233,947

Program Description
The Crime Strategy Analysis and Evaluation Program supports a team of researchers in three centers that
identify priority criminal justice issues for the state, conduct research and analysis on these areas and
disseminate this information to guide decision-making both within our agency and locally. By awarding this
grant, we are able to minimize the lapse of funds unspent by other state agencies.
Program Activities
The program operates under three centers: The Criminal Justice Clearinghouse and Analysis Center collects,
analyzes and disseminates statistical information on a variety of topics. The Research and Evaluation Center
focuses on program assessment and evaluations, and produces publications that include keys findings and
implications for policy and practice. The Sponsored Research and Program Development Center works with
experts in the field to conduct research and program evaluation, as well as identify promising practices for
programs to replicate.
Goals
There are four main functions of this program: 1) conduct applied research and evaluation that examines critical
criminal justice topics; 2) expand the development, collection, analysis and dissemination of research and
statistical information; 3) utilize experts in the field to inform practitioners and other partners to assist them in
their local efforts; and 4) inform and advise on evidence-based and promising practices and identify areas of
program development.
Priorities
The Authority supports the JAG priority area of Planning, Evaluation and Technology Improvement Programs.
This program clearly fits within this priority area as it focuses on providing a body of research and data that will
inform and guide funding decisions, policy decisions, and expansion of promising and evidence-based
programming.

of its goals, including publishing a wealth of research on a variety of topics, program evaluation, expansion of
the Authority website to accommodate user-friendly data tools, and briefs that highlight main research findings
and implications for policy.

Program Name:

Community-based Residential Treatment for Female Offenders –
Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC)

Funding Source:

JAG FFY15; - $190,081 Total Federal; 25% Cash Match Amount

Program Description
The need for this program was identified at the Authority’s 2000 statewide planning summit and first funded
out of the Byrne Anti-Drug Abuse Act (ADAA) fund and has been continued with JAG funding.
Program Activities
Women returning to the community from prison face unique challenges. Many have significant histories of
victimization and substance abuse, and have been separated from their children for lengthy periods. In order to
increase each female offender’s chances for successful transition, specific needs are addressed before, during,
and after release. In this Females In Transition (FIT) program, a team of State of Illinois employees,
contractual caseworkers, and local service providers work to overcome the meet individual needs to help
overcome barriers to re-entry. Participants receive supportive services in the areas of affordable housing,
treatment, health care, childcare, legitimate income, and other areas as individual need dictates.
The program strategy is to provide support services on an individualized basis, rather than funding a prepackaged or general program. Gender-responsive case management services are available to program
participants. Services provide a continuum of programming from pre-release services in the facility through
post-release programming in the community linking women to available service networks and communitybased programs.
Priorities
The program addresses the State Corrections priority to, “Support programs which allow state and local
correctional facilities to apply proven and innovative programs to assist in meeting the needs of incarcerated

Performance Assessment
In the absence of a State budget, the contractual personnel funded under this agreement are being paid through
court order, but vendor agencies are not. Vendor service providers are so far continuing to provide necessary
services. Despite these challenges, the program continues to provide services a large number of women on
during both pre- and post-release components of the program. Quarterly reporting is accurate and timely.

 Appendix 3 - JAG

Goals
The work necessary to create multi-jurisdictional, cross-discipline, integration is highly complex and requires
specific skills-set with criminal justice project management experience. These funds will be used as seed money
to identify and hire an SME with project management services to guide local units of government, working
under a multi-jurisdictional, cross-discipline, governance structure toward the development of a countywide
information sharing environment that integrates with state entities such as the Illinois Department of
Corrections, Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice, Illinois State Police, Illinois Criminal Justice Information
Authority, and Illinois Prisoner Review Board. The role of the SME/PM is to provide professional and technical
assistance to ensure participating stakeholders progress with integration in a timely fashion and systems are
procured, configured, and deployed effectively, efficiently, and complimentary. This project aims to integrate
local police agencies with, at minimum, critical stakeholders such as respective county sheriffs’ department,
states’ attorney’s offices, public defenders’ offices, and circuit court clerk’s office; eventually, leading to
integration with the state agencies named above. Such integration would allow for these agencies to push and
pull data necessary for operations in prosecution, defenders, courts, jails, and others, in real-time while
eliminating redundant data entry and improving data reliability.
 

Priorities
One of ICJIAs enumerated Powers and Duties is to develop and operate comprehensive information systems for
the improvement and coordination of all aspects of law enforcement, prosecution and corrections. The work
proposed under this funding request is directly related to this responsibility.
This recommendation also incorporates many of the Authority’s Guiding Principles, including: Research 
Informed; Collaboration; and Efficient.1
For example, the constituent parts of local jurisdictions will be working together to strengthen information
sharing across the public safety domain, to improve the accessibility of that information in ways that will allow
stakeholders to improve outcomes.
It is also important to highlight the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG) Planning, Evaluation, and 
Technology Improvement goal.2. Funded with JAG dollars, this budget recommendation demonstrates the
Authority’s commitment to funding programs that support the development of a statewide information sharing
environment, through the use of Global standards, that facilities timely, accurate, and efficient exchange of
operational data for criminal justice stakeholders.
                                                            

The Authority’s Guiding Principles were approved by the Authority’s Strategic Opportunity Committee on March 29, 2016.
They will be presented to the full Authority Board during the June 3, 2016 Quarterly meeting.

Funding Prospectus
Multi-jurisdictional/cross-discipline information sharing projects require long-range planning and long-term
commitment from all stakeholders. It is estimated that countywide integration could take, at minimum, three
years to attain full integration between the law enforcement agencies and county agencies. It is essential for
participants retain an SME/PM throughout the duration of these efforts in order to attain and maintain progress
via short term goals with measurable outcomes that align with the long term goals of integration of operational
data.

Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent Crime

Funding Source:

Program / Appropriation, F/SFY, Amount, Match Amount (if necessary)

Justice Assistance Grants (JAG), FFY: TBD;
Amount: $800,000
Match structure: 1st year: 25% hard match with option of waiver request; 2nd year: TBD; 3rd year: TBD
Program Description
The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (Authority) is soliciting proposals from eligible applicants
to reduce violent crime and strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and communities by
completing the Problem-Oriented Policing SARA (Scanning, Analysis, Response and Assessment) assessment
process, building local research and evaluation capacity, and implementing procedural justice and focused
deterrence.. Initial grants will be awarded for the assessment process. Subsequent grants will be awarded for
training and implementation.
Program Activities
Jurisdictions will have varying degrees of readiness to implement focused deterrence. To facilitate readiness
and promote implementation the Authority will make available funds (through separate contracts) for each of
the three steps of the process: assessment, training and implementation of focused deterrence and procedural
justice.
First Cycle: Planning
Selected jurisdictions will convene local multi-disciplinary teams (MDT) consisting of the city mayor, law
enforcement, local and federal prosecutors, community corrections (probation, parole) and community
stakeholders. Each agency’s commitment to the assessment process is essential to its success. Each agency is
responsible for assigning a staff member with decision making power to attend the regular (at minimum
monthly) meetings, share information and data (when applicable); participate in the planning grant activities
listed below:
 Enhance effective working relationships with community, criminal justice and social service agencies;
 Collaborate across criminal justice agencies;
 Conduct crime analyses using the Problem-Oriented Policing SARA (Scanning, Analysis, Response and
Assessment) Model. (The Problem-Oriented Policing SARA Model is a highly regarded and utilized
comprehensive tool for local law enforcement officials to identify their needs and focus their work.

Conduct assessment of community and police relations; and
Identify training needs.

Planning period funds may be allocated to:
 A full-time Project Manager to facilitate leadership development and cross system collaboration; engage
in the SARA assessment process for the MDT in partnership with an identified research partner; and
develop an implementation plan.
 A research partner to assist the MDT in conducting crime analysis and developing an implementation
plan that includes data collection to facilitate a process and outcome evaluation.
 Travel within Illinois to attend regional networking and information sharing events
Second Cycle: Training
Jurisdictions that have demonstrated training needs, as identified during the planning phase, to assist in
implementation may seek additional funding to address those needs. Continued funding for training and/or
implementation is contingent on satisfactory progress in the preceding performance period and continued
funding appropriation. Training funds will be made available to:
• Assist in MDT agencies accessing training on focused deterrence, procedural justice and community
engagement.
• Ongoing technical assistance provided by identified experts.
Third Cycle: Implementation
Once a model has been selected through an assessment process (SARA Model preferred) and training is
completed, jurisdictions may apply for implementation funding. Continued funding for training and/or
implementation is contingent on satisfactory progress in the preceding performance period and continued
funding appropriation.

Grant Expectations
The goal of this solicitation is to help selected local jurisdictions implement a focused deterrence strategy along
with procedural justice to reduce violent crime.

Research Support
Focused deterrence, also known as “pulling levers,” is listed as a promising practice on crime solutions.gov and
is supported by the US Department of Justice.
                                                            
Applicants wishing to propose using a different assessment model must justify why the alternative model meets the applicant’s needs and how it
compares to the SARA model.

The effectiveness of procedural justice has been well documented, most notably with the work of Tom Tyler
and Tracey Meares both of Yale Law School.
Problem-Oriented Policing SARA (Scanning, Analysis, Response and Assessment) Model. The ProblemOriented Policing SARA Model is a highly regarded and utilized comprehensive tool for local law enforcement
officials to identify their needs and focus their work.
Priorities
This RFP incorporates many of the Authority’s Guiding Principles, including Legitimacy, Strengthening
Communities, Prevention, Research Informed and Collaboration principles4. For example, the jurisdictions will
be strengthening trust with the communities they serve (legitimacy); engaging community members in several
ways (strengthening communities); identifying and focusing on the few individuals responsible for most violent
crime and notifying these individuals of the consequences of future criminal activity (prevention); utilization of
the SARA model ensures that crime data and community input (research informed); and finally, all of the grant
activities require a high degree of intra and interagency partnership (collaboration).
It is also important to highlight the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG) Law Enforcement Goal.5
Funded with JAG dollars, this RFP demonstrates the Authority’s commitment to funding programs that support
the development and implementation of policing strategies that are data-driven, evidence-informed or have
promise to reduce serious crime, especially violent crime, and strengthen partnerships and the trust between
citizens and the justice system.
Funding Prospectus
The initial grant period will be the first of up to three funding periods for this initiative; however, renewal is
contingent on satisfactory progress in the preceding performance period and continued funding appropriation.

 OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
PROGRAM MANAGER, INFORMATION SHARING ENVIRONMENT
WASHINGTON, DC 20511

April 12, 2016

Mr. John Maki

Executive Director

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
300 West Adams Suite 200

Chicago, IL 60606

Dear Mr. Maki,

I would like to thank you for arranging to have key Illinois leaders participate in
the Office of the Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment 
sponsored State and Regional ISE Summit last fall. The Summit had 15 states gathered
to share their best practices and to advise the Federal government on the support that
would be most effective in reducing barriers to the creation of a national ISE supporting
the safety and security of our Nation and its citizens. After meeting for two days, the
States defined a set of 10 priorities to which my staff have identified action items that
coincidently align closely to what you have helped us understand to be Illinois priorities
as well. I have attached the summary of the summit outcome for your awareness and
consideration for further distribution.

You may not be aware, but my Office has heralded Illinois as an example of best
practices for your early recognition of the importance Of a governance process required to
create a State ISE, and touted Illinois? issuance of a related State Executive Order by your
former governor to put in place a state-wide governance council. We hope that this
important initiative would be embraced by Governor Rauner as he moves forward to
support high priority information sharing challenges across the state and local agencies in
Illinois.

We noted the early work that ICJIA did to instill a spirit Of collaboration
throughout Illinois at a past ICJ IA hosted statewide conference on advancing criminal
justice information sharing. As you may know, I addressed the conference and was
impressed by the pervasive call for action that came from your statewide constituents
regarding the development of a statewide ISE.

We are also mindful of your efforts to take full advantage of the extensive work
by my office and our Federal, State, and local mission partners to build methodologies
and tools that will facilitate the implementation of a state ISE. Your support for the
National Information Exchange Model (NIEM), federated identity management, and the
other components of our Project Interoperability toolkit are recognized. As many
agencies and organizations throughout the country have come to appreciate, these tools
represent the best, collectively defined practices for responsible information sharing.
Specifically, we have appreciated your direct support for introducing data?driven policing

1

54

practices through your moving toward full participation in National Incident Based
Reporting System (NIBRS) using the tools such as NIEM and-other components of

Project Interoperability.

Your work in taking advantage of these methodologies through the use of various
funding sources (state and federal) to help accelerate ISE implementation acknowledges
the important need for States to provide project management, technical assistance,
education and training to all stakeholders is further evidence of your understanding of
how we must all collaborate to build an ISE that serves all constituents.

We are convinced that a State?based ISE is a critical component of executing the
President?s National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding. We want to
continue to work with and support the Illinois efforts to implement standards based
innovation as the basis for a sustainable Illinois ISE. We look forward to hearing about
your forward progress and the early implementation of your Illinois ISE.

I would be pleased to meet with you and your staff as well as your board and
other decision?makers in Illinois to hear more about your vision for developing the
Illinois ISE and to discuss how the current and emerging tools and methodologies we
have to offer may be of value to you in this journey.

Sincerely,

Re: Letter of Support: justice Assistance Grant setaaside for Information Sharing
Dearjudge Robb:

We write in support of the Illinois Criminaljustice Information Authority?s IA) efforts to help
create a statewide information sharing environment (IS E) through use of Bureau of Justice
Assistance,]ustice Assistance Grant GAG) funds.

vision for an ISE is one where: operational data for the public safety and criminal justice
system are moved seamlessly; data entry, hardware, and software redundancies are eliminated; data
qualityf accuracy is improved; information can be accessed in by authorized users;
and, comprehensive data can be accessed in a costrefficient manner to better enable policy and
operational decision making. This approach to information sharing in the criminal justice system
aligns with Governor Rauner vision for Illinois information system and is re?ected in a
recommendation made by the State Commission on Crirninaljustice and Sentencing Reform' in its
report issued 1n December 2015.

Creating a sustainable involves more than procuring the latest available technologies. ICJIA
will help accelerate local ISE implementation by providing local governments with seed money for
project management, technical assistance, and education and training that promote national best
practices, methodologies, and standardization. To this end, we request your support and the
support of budget committee for designating requested seteaside.

Program Name:

Safe From the Start

Funding Source:

FY16 General Revenue Funds (Introduced)

Program Description
The Safe From the Start (SFS) grant program is designed to assist in the development, implementation, and
evaluation of comprehensive and coordinated community-based models to identify, assess, and serve children,
(primarily ages 0-5), who have been exposed to violence in their home and/or community.
Program Activities
1: Provide assessment, direct services and evaluation to children (and their families) who have been exposed to
violence in their home and/or communities.
2: Ensure social service and community engagement in the SFS program through collaboration and training.
3: Provide public awareness regarding children exposed to violence via presentations and community events.
Goals
SFS Program consists of three major components, Coalition and Collaboration building; Direct Services and
Public Awareness. SFS programs focus on collaborating with state and community agencies to provide
individual, family and community level supports. It is a unique, multi-disciplinary, research driven and targeted
intervention that reaches urban, suburban and rural Illinois families.
The Authority has developed standard objectives and performance measures for each component of the MDT
programs.
Priorities
The financial burden of children’s exposure to violence on other public systems, including child welfare, social
services, law enforcement, juvenile justice, and education is staggering when combined with the loss of
productivity over children’s lifetimes.1 Without intervention, young children exposed to violence are at risk for

On October 22 and 23, 2013, the Authority convened the Victim Service Ad Hoc Committee (VSAHC) to
review past priorities and define new ones for the use of STOP VAWA funds. The VSAHC recommended that
FFY14 - FFY16 VAWA funds be used principally to continue to support programs previously funded through
VAWA. In the past, the Authority has designated all of each federal fiscal year’s allocated Service Provider
funds to ICASA and the ICADV in equal amounts. These funds were then subcontracted to their program
agencies for service to underserved areas or victim groups.
The following are continuation designations for previously funded VAWA programs which staff deem
successful. The designations recommended in this memo and future designations will be consistent with the
priorities set forth in the VAWA FFY13 – FFY16 Multi-Year Plan.
Program Activities
ICADV is requesting STOP VAWA funds to support the continuation of 16 local domestic violence programs
that are currently implementing VAWA funded projects. These subrecipients will maintain or secure
approximately 15.7 full time equivalent employees to execute goals and objectives as described in this
narrative. The projects address the needs of three categories of underserved victim groups: rural women,
Latinas, and chemically dependent victims. Funded projects will provide:
• Crisis intervention
• Legal advocacy and safety planning
• Individual and group counseling
• Access to safe housing
• Information and referral
• Assistance in utilizing other community resources
• Outreach and education in the targeted communities
• Institutional advocacy, particularly in law enforcement and civil and criminal courts
• Culturally appropriate support (for Latinas)
• Translation and assistance with documentation, self-petitioning and immigration issues (for Latinas)
• Collaborative work with substance abuse agencies (chemical dependency projects)

Goals
Developing, enlarging, or strengthening victim services programs, including sexual assault, domestic violence, and
dating violence programs, developing or improving delivery of victim services to underserved populations,
providing specialized domestic violence court advocates in courts where a significant number of protection orders
are granted, and increasing reporting and reducing attrition rates for cases involving violent crimes against women,
including crimes of sexual assault and domestic violence.

During the first three quarters, the funded projects served approximately 1189 clients with 2907 hours of 
service. With 75% of the grant year completed, the projects have exceeded their objective for clients served and
provided 69% of the projected client service hours.

Priorities
On October 22 and 23, 2013, the Authority convened the Victim Service Ad Hoc Committee (VSAHC) to
review past priorities and define new ones for the use of STOP VAWA funds. The VSAHC recommended that
FFY14 - FFY16 VAWA funds be used principally to continue to support programs previously funded through
VAWA.
Funding Prospectus
As per the VSAHC funding for these core services is expected to continue. The program provided essential
services to underserved areas of the state for victims of sexual assault.

Past Performance
There have been no programmatic or reporting concerns during the past reporting period.

Budget Detail
Contractual: To subcontract with ICASA centers who have developed satellite services for
underserved areas or victim groups.

Program Description
On October 22 and 23, 2013, the Authority convened the Victim Service Ad Hoc Committee (VSAHC) to
review past priorities and define new ones for the use of STOP VAWA funds. The VSAHC recommended that
FFY14 - FFY16 VAWA funds be used principally to continue to support programs previously funded through
VAWA. In the past, the Authority has designated all of each federal fiscal year’s allocated Service Provider
funds to ICASA and the ICADV in equal amounts. These funds were then subcontracted to their program

The following are continuation designations for previously funded VAWA programs which staff deem
successful. The designations recommended in this memo and future designations will be consistent with the
priorities set forth in the VAWA FFY13 – FFY16 Multi-Year Plan.
Program Activities
These funds will be used to support the continuation of 14 satellite offices of sexual assault programs and core
services in two developing sexual assault crisis centers. In order to broaden the availability of sexual assault
crisis services throughout the state, ICASA has used VAWA funds to support these satellite programs since
FY96. The support to new centers has occurred more recently to establish rape crisis centers where none
previously existed. The satellite offices and new centers are located in previously unserved geographical areas
or underserved neighborhoods.
Services provided by satellite programs include a minimum of a 24-hour hotline and 24-hour access to
individual medical and criminal justice advocacy. The primary focus of these offices is to provide these 24hour crisis counseling and advocacy services. Additionally, the satellite offices provide on-going counseling,
professional training, prevention services, institutional advocacy and information and referral.
Goals
During SFY 2015, 1,239 clients were served at the 14 satellite offices and two developing centers. Of these
clients, 88 percent were female. The client population was 76 percent white, 18 percent black and 20 percent
Hispanic or Spanish. Of the 1,239 clients served, 40 percent were under age 18, 27 percent were 18 to 29, 15
percent were 30 to 39, 10 percent were 40 to 49, and 7 percent were 50 and older. One hundred clients

disclosed some disability (e.g. vision impairment, deaf/hard of hearing, physical disability, cognitive disability,
mental illness). Centers served 102 clients whose primary language is Spanish and 106 with limited English
proficiency.
VAWA-funded staff provided 5,820.82 hours of direct service to victims of sexual assault and their significant
others during SFY 2015. A total of 3,982.49 hours were counseling, and 1,515.90 hours were advocacy.
Another 168.78 hours were devoted to non-client crisis intervention. Staff also provided 1,312.10 hours of
institutional advocacy and 168.90 hours of professional training.

Program Activities
Child Advocacy Centers (CACs) are either government-funded or nonprofit agencies that provide a safe
location for child victims of sexual assault or severe physical abuse and their non-offending family members.
This is where forensic interviewing takes place as well as a wide variety of direct services for the child and
his/her family. Thirty-two grants provide VOCA-funded direct services in CACs throughout the state in both
urban and rural areas. These include crisis counseling, follow-up contact, therapy, group treatment, information
and referral, criminal justice support, assistance in filing compensation claims, personal advocacy, medical
advocacy and transportation for forensic exams, and counseling and court appearances. In the rural areas these
centers may serve up to seven counties and work with 27 different police jurisdictions. These services are
provided by family advocates, case managers, court-appointed special advocates, crisis intervention counselors,
and therapists, some of whom are bi-lingual.

Goals
To provide direct services to victims of violence crime for the purpose of alleviating trauma and suffering
incurred from victimization.

priorities set forth in the FFY13 – FFY16 Multi-Year Plan.
Program Activities
Police departments and state’s attorney’s offices both benefit from the 25 grants given in this program. Six
police departments receive funding to hire advocates and victim specialists to provide services to crime victims
in their villages or cities.
Seventeen different county state’s attorney’s offices benefit from the grant-funded services of advocates, some
of whom are bilingual, who work with victims, including those who are seniors or disabled. Common types of
services are: crisis counseling, follow-up contact, information and referral, criminal justice advocacy/support,
emergency legal advocacy, assistance in filing compensation claims, and personal and medical advocacy.
Without these grant funds, victims in police stations and courts would not receive the kind of personal attention
they need from police officers or assistant state’s attorneys, thus possibly being re-victimized.
Goals
To provide direct services to victims of violence crime for the purpose of alleviating trauma and suffering

Program Description
On October 22 and 23, 2013, the Authority convened the Victim Service Ad Hoc Committee (VSAHC) to
review past priorities and define new ones for the use of VOCA funds. The VSAHC recommended that FFY14
- FFY16 VOCA funds be used principally to continue to support programs previously funded through VOCA.
The following are continuation designations for previously funded VOCA programs which staff deem
successful. The designations recommended in this memo and future designations will be consistent with the
priorities set forth in the FFY13 – FFY16 Multi-Year Plan.
Program Activities
There are two agencies that currently receive VOCA funds under this program; Southern Illinois Health Care in
East St. Louis, Illinois, and Quanada in Quincy, Illinois. There is a great need for crime victim services in
sparsely populated areas. Those who reside in rural areas are equally likely to experience violence as those
residing in suburban or urban areas, but are not as likely to easily access needed and available governmental or
community resources due to lack of knowledge of the resources’ existence or an inability to access these
resources due to lack of transportation.
These funds support staff that have been extremely successful in ensuring that community members who have
been victimized have access to medical services, transportation, housing, clothing, legal assistance, educational
assistance, and help acquiring law enforcement assistance.

Goals
To provide direct services to victims of violence crime for the purpose of alleviating trauma and suffering
incurred from victimization.
Priorities
On October 22 and 23, 2013, the Authority convened the Victim Service Ad Hoc Committee (VSAHC) to

Funding Source:

Victims of Crimes Act, VOCA FFY 15, $166,823, Match 20%

Program Description
On October 22 and 23, 2013, the Authority convened the Victim Service Ad Hoc Committee (VSAHC) to
review past priorities and define new ones for the use of VOCA funds. The VSAHC recommended that FFY14
- FFY16 VOCA funds be used principally to continue to support programs previously funded through VOCA.
The following are continuation designations for previously funded VOCA programs which staff deem
successful. The designations recommended in this memo and future designations will be consistent with the
priorities set forth in the FFY13 – FFY16 Multi-Year Plan.
Program Activities
Victims of domestic violence need support in gaining orders of protection, finding shelter, obtaining immediate
basic needs such as food and clothing, and ongoing case management as they transition out of abusive
relationships. One of the most critical problems identified by local agencies is that there are few bilingual
domestic violence service providers available to cater to the needs of immigrants who do not speak English and
who may not be knowledgeable about the community resources available to them.
The Authority currently provides VOCA funding to three agencies (Howard Area Community Center, Korean
American Women in Need (KAN-WIN), and Mujeres Latinas en Accion) under this program. These funds are
used to provide non-English speaking or bi-cultural victims of domestic violence with the comprehensive
services needed to facilitate their experience through the legal system as they manage to overcome language and

The following are continuation designations for previously funded VOCA programs which staff deem
successful. The designations recommended in this memo and future designations will be consistent with the
priorities set forth in the FFY13 – FFY16 Multi-Year Plan.
Program Activities
The Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) uses VOCA funding to provide services to victims of convicted
offenders and IDOC employees who have been victims. Funds support 1.9 full-time-equivalent jobs to provide
the following services: assistance filing for compensation; assistance filing orders of protection; assistance with
victim impact statements; referrals for assistance services including mental health services, counseling, shelters,
food or clothing; providing information to victims on parole issues including general explanation of parole,
conditions of parole, who is the parole officer, how to reach the parole officer; and how to report a parole
violation; and, in general, listening to the victim and providing empathetic support and assistance.
This program is in a unique position to provide information on Prisoner Review Board orders. Victims can learn
how these orders work, whether they are in place, and how to report violations. Community-based services
would not have immediate access to this type of information and thus victims are more comprehensively served.
Goals
To provide direct services to victims of violence crime for the purpose of alleviating trauma and suffering
incurred from victimization.

APPENDIX 9 – SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION AND NOTIFICATION
ACT (SORNA)
BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Electronic Filing System

Funding Source:

SORNA FFY15; - $239,885 Total Federal; No Match

Program Description
States that are not in substantial compliance with the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA)
lose a portion of their annual JAG award. These funds are then returned to the states through the SORNA
program. SORNA funds may only be used to maintain or enhance state compliance with the SORNA Act
requirements.
Program Activities
The Illinois State Police (ISP) used SORNA Federal Fiscal Year 2012 (FFY12) funds to purchase an Electronic
Filing System (EFS). This system has enabled ISP to electronically share registration documents in a more
efficient manner by supporting the scanning of all documents in a registrant’s file and electronic storage and
sharing of these files. Scanned documents include but are not limited to notification/registration forms, any
correspondence to and from the offender, and court documents. But the transition to electronic submission,
storage and retrieval of these required documents for approximately 31,000 offenders, the ISP Sex Offender
Registration Unit server capacity is approaching its limits. With the available funds, ISP will competitively
procure a high capacity server dedicated to storage of Sex Offender Registration Unit documents.
Priorities
This funding will use available SORNA penalty funds to enable the ISP Sex Offender Registration Unit to
enhance public safety by efficiently managing sex offender records.
Performance Assessment
ISP struggled to complete procurements funded through SORNA FFY12 but has already prepared procurement
paperwork in anticipation of this FFY15 funding. FFY 13-14 SORNA funds were granted to the Illinois
Sheriff’s Association.
Past Performance
FFY12 SORNA funds were used to procure an Electronic Filing System.
