Good afternoon, Chairman

Daley, and to all of the Board of Commissioners.
I am Juliana Stratton, Executive
Director of the Justice Advisory Council.
For our fiscal year 2014 budget, I

will start by indicating the mission of the Justice

Advisory Council.

the highlights that we have accomplished in fiscal

2

and, finally, to promote fair and equitable access

3

to justice.

4

In terms of fiscal year '13, we worked

5

very hard to broaden the pool of applicants for our

6

recidivism reduction grant, as well as establishing

7

a vigorous RFP process for our violence reduction

8

grant dollars.

9

In addition, we have hosted our third

10

Barriers to Reentry forum, and we have established

11

quite a great working relationship with a number of

12

the community-based service providers as it relates

13

to recidivism reduction.

14

As for transparency and

15

accountability, we continue to look at not only what

16

is happening in Bond Court and how individuals are

17

entering the jail on the front end, but we have

18

expanded our examination of the issue of the

increasing length of stay at the jail.

as of January 1, 2014.

5

As we head into the new fiscal year,

6

we will continue to look at efforts to divert

individuals from the jail on the front end,

including an initiative that we are working with

Commissioner Gainer's office on street level

diversion for prostitution cases.

additional reentry barriers to reentry forums, but

we will do even more to look at what can be done in

often feel like they don't know how to apply for

grants or how to partner with other organizations to

be able to seek grant funding.

Juliana, let me

7

thank you for increasing the number of grants that

you are receiving -- yes, the microphone is on --

9

the number of grants that you have been able to

10

obtain in working with the various agencies.

That

11

is a super good thing.

12

again, there are more grants out there this year and

13

I'm sure you will be able to tap into more of those.

14

I hear you talking about new programs,

but I didn't hear you talking about the jail

been lacking.

areas.

Of course, those people who commit

 181

1

minor offenses, and all of us agree, those who have

2

been working in the profession for years as I have,

3

that shouldn't be in jail in the first place.

4

Because that is the gateway to prison, the jails,

5

and it continues increasing the recidivism rate over

6

and over like a revolving door from generation to

7

generation.

That we don't need.
I didn't hear you talk about funding

8
9

it at all, or working with me to get grants as

10

Chairman of Criminal Justice, to fund the jail

11

diversion.

12

What is your vision or your hopes of

13

funding jail diversion?

14

even your role.

15

proper grants and ensure that those grants are used;

16

because we could be severely penalized from what

17

they have been able to do.

18

Grants are basically specific to specific things.

19

I didn't know if that was

I thought your role was to secure

It is very important.

Those are Federal Government.

They

20

are not only driven by census data, because the

21

people who make up the number of people having the

22

problems, or incidents who are suffering from the

23

problems, are usually the intent of the legislation

24

to be targeted more at that group of people; trying
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 182

1

to reduce the number of them, where there is an

2

unusual number of people experiencing the same kinds

3

of things.

4

It is like the crime.

We can

5

basically single out the communities.

6

crime all over, but there are some communities where

7

there is serious danger not only to the citizens,

8

but to the police getting killed, or other law

9

enforcement getting killed.

10

There is

It would appear to me that we would be

11

targeting money to that.

12

that was your role.

13

talk, for whatever reason, as much as we should.

14

But I didn't know that

We don't really get a chance to

I think those two things, not for you

15

to do, should be separated out from each other and

16

your role is to get the grants.

17

are needed and they are monitored, but are they

18

going into the things that they need to be done?

19

That would be a great role for you.

20

I understand they

But it seems like you are deciding who

21

gets what and how much.

That I am not comfortable

22

with because some of the groups out there -- I know

23

most of them on the west side of Chicago and a lot

24

of them are on the south side of Chicago.

I know

________________________________________________

what they are capable of doing.

are doing.

is to go out and monitor.

out and asking for services and they don't even know

5

what they are doing.

We have other people go

What we have to do, Juliana, is to

make sure that programs that have been proven to

work get adequate funding, staff, and money to do

the things that they say they are going to do to

10

help us to reduce the number of people going in

11

jail.

work on getting people out of the system.

13

are out, to keep them from coming back.

And we have to also have grants that will

There are some special needs for those

people.

have to have people involved, and their families

involved, and others involved to make sure that they

have a plan for each individual to reduce recidivism

rates, to keep them from that revolving door, coming

back into the system.

21

You can't determine them on your own.

I haven't seen anything dealing with

that kind of thing.

do that, the centers would do that, the resources.

an ordinance, and you had some proposed changes to

that ordinance.

20

and we certainly appreciate your efforts because you

21

are absolutely right, as it relates to what we are

looking at with the jail.

MS. STRATTON:

As for the funding, that is

20

the conversation that will continue.

What our

21

office did distribute to the entire Board this

22

morning was a list for the request of the

23

Commissioners and Commissioner Gainer in particular,

24

a list of the public safety grants and the funding
________________________________________________

 186

sources -- at least where those grants are going to.

2

That will help give a better sense of where grant

funding sources continue to be.

the ongoing conversation with your office.
COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

5
6

Who makes that

determination?

7

MS. STRATTON:

8

COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

9

That can be part of

going to go.

Which determination?
Where the grants are

When you apply for the grants, you

10

usually apply for something specific, for those that

11

designate.
MS. STRATTON:

12

These are all grants.

The

13

document that was submitted are all grants that

14

respect the various public safety stakeholders.

15

various public safety stakeholders identify that

16

they had a particular project that they wanted

17

funded and went to the various sources for grants.

18

That is something that we can talk about as it

19

relates to this particular initiative.
COMMISSIONER COLLINS:

20

As a Commissioner,

21

can I apply for grants to fund the jail diversion

program?

grant-making entities as to whether or not they

3

would accept something directly from a Commissioner.

4

I am not aware of any Commissioners directly

5

applying for a grant.

6

will work with your office as this discussion

7

continues about where to identify funding.

8

be happy to work with you to determine the best

9

entity to apply for those funds and how it should

10

But what I am saying is we

We will

happen.

11

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

Vice Chair Sis.

12

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

Juliana, Commissioner

13

Fritchey showed me this morning where the City of

14

Chicago is dropping CeaseFire -- I guess it was a

15

million dollars that they gave CeaseFire.

16

we were on target when we were supporting the

17

Roseland CeaseFire because it would be a travesty if

18

the Roseland CeaseFire were to totally disappear.

19

What do you do about those agencies

I think

20

like CeaseFire, not only in Roseland, but CeaseFire

21

on the west side and CeaseFire on the southeast side

22

of Chicago that are now probably going to be

23

scrambling for funding?

24

seen the article to try to figure out that those

Have you looked or have you

ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 188

1

CeaseFires that are functioning, and that are

2

producing numbers where they are showing where they

3

are helping in communities?
I know CeaseFire in Roseland was part

5

of Safe passage.

6

were doing, but I know that one in particular was

7

part of that.
Are we looking to try to help to pick

8
9

I don't know what the CeaseFires

up that funding for those existing CeaseFires that

10

are in those communities that probably need to still

11

exist?
MS. STRATTON:

12

Commissioner Sims, I am not

13

aware of any additional efforts to identify funding

14

for any particular organizations.

15

recidivism reduction grants that are issued through

16

an RFP process through the Justice Advisory Council

17

as well as the violence prevention grants.

18

are the two sources that I am aware of currently

19

which any organization can apply.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

20

We do have the

prevention grant that we just allocated.

When is

22

the next round or applications coming out?

Is that

Is there a pool where those agencies will

2

be a grant coming forward?
MS. STRATTON:

First of all, the

3

information is posted on the Office of the Chief

4

Procurement Officer's website.

5

have some internal communication channels where we

6

try to make sure that any community-based

7

organizations that have a relationship with our

8

office, we notify them of grant opportunities.

Secondly, we also

12

frame, around that same time frame.

13

there are some things that we need to do to improve

14

the process as we go forward, but as soon as those

15

kinks are worked out we expect that in early 2014 we

16

should see that going forward.

We are looking at that same time
As you know,

17

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

Juliana, I want to

thank you for coming today.

19

back in the spring with young people, and I want to

thank you for participating in that.

21

are looking for funding -- because you saw that the

22

young people that were there were willing to talk

23

and to get involved.

24

just didn't have enough time to hear all of the

We had a conversation

I hope when we

They have a lot to say.

We

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 190

1

stuff they wanted to say.
I hope that in your grant funding that

2
3

we look for funding just for young people.

4

things like that, or to do a large summit for young

5

people -- maybe there is a way to put something

6

together to get them to have these conversations.

7

There are a lot of kids that are afraid to speak.

8

But in a forum like that, if you put something

9

together, they feel comfortable and they will do

10

Doing

that.
Maybe we should have a town hall

11
12

meeting maybe to figure that out, instead of you and

13

I saying that those different agencies should deal

14

with that, or what kind of funding they need.

15

you should put something like that together so we

16

hear from the communities and say, "Where would you

17

like to see the funding come from?"
Let me just back up -- let me back up

18
19

Maybe

so I don't confuse myself.

20

We should have town hall meetings to

21

talk about where best to put the funding, I should

22

say, because no matter how much we think we could

23

solve all of the problems, we would never solve them

24

all.

I don't think all of this gang violence and

They say that the idle mind is the
I know

When Karin is here

I talked to different agencies out

9
10

there this summer to ask who got kids.

11

members here told me I shouldn't ask this question

12

because with Shakman we shouldn't know that.

13

think that is wrong.

14

can't ask what kids got summer jobs, there is a

15

problem.

16

there are no summer jobs for kids.

we tried to do the City-County collaboration.

20

think that that was one collaboration that we should

not have done because I think we could have found --

that way, we would have something to track to say

the County has put kids to work -- north, south,

about the City because I worked for the City -- the

City is always going

first.

6

a job and it was supposed to go to the City and the

County is going to get the rest.

If it meant that there were ten kids to get

have all City.

13

young people in my District and say, "Yes, the

14

County is helping young people get jobs."

15

not say that at this point because I don't know of

16

any kids that got any summer jobs.

17

Even though I have City

I have to be able to look at the

MS. STRATTON:

I could

Commissioner, you would be

18

pleased to know that shortly after our conversation

19

about this very same issue I did have a meeting -- I

20

am sorry that her name escapes me -- but from the

21

Chicago-Cook Workforce Partnership, who is working

22

on juvenile justice issues.

23

specific conversation about how, as we look to

24

planning for next year, either through One Summer

She and I had a

Chicago or other avenues, how we can expand a

2

program for justice-involved youth in terms of jobs.
We are certainly taking that

3
4

seriously, and we are looking into how we can do it

5

better as we move forward.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

6

You can't put a number

7

out there and say we have 114 opportunities.

8

you tell a kid 114 opportunities, it's an

9

opportunity to do what?

10

When

It doesn't say that there

is 114 opportunities that equates to 114 jobs.
We have to be careful with the

11
12

terminology.

Please, next year when you all say

13

that, don't say "opportunities" because an

14

opportunity does not equate to an opportunity for a

15

job in all instances.

16

said.

That is even what you guys

So we would like to say if there is

17
18

114 kids that came in, out of that 114,000 came

19

through the program, one thousand of them got jobs.

20

Then we can say one thousand got jobs; how many went

21

to the County, the kids that live in the suburban

22

areas.

23

start asking questions, because of Shakman, nobody

24

can tell us.

If you just say that, we don't know.

If we

But that appears to us that none of

________________________________________________

the kids that we all have to work with got jobs.
That is all we are looking for is some

clarity.
MS. STRATTON:

4

I do understand.

It was, to

5

use the term, there were 180,000 opportunities which

6

included tutoring, mentoring, and other internships.

There were 20,000 jobs that were specifically

identified.

15

codes that are reflected.

16

are committed to improving the process going

17

forward.

There are suburban zip
But, as I indicated, we

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

are asking so that we have something we can actually

look at and say we know that these young people are

working.

Is it $2 million or is it another number for those

MS. STRATTON:

14

I don't see the roughly $2
Where is the $2 million?

It would not be reflected in

will defer to the Budget Director, Andrea Gibson, to

17

explain.

18

MS. GIBSON:

But I

The $1.9 million is in the

19

same place as it was last year, which is in fixed

20

charges in the 499 department, account 298.

21

COMMISSIONER SUFFREDIN:

This is money that

is coming from our general revenue.

there are about 1400 orders to electronic

2

2014 hoping to see that goal even higher to about

thirty-five percent of those releases.

4

COMMISSIONER SUFFREDIN:

As you look at

5

statistics from other jurisdictions, especially the

6

New Yorks, the Los Angeleses, the larger urban areas

7

-- is that percentage high - low - medium?

8

have any idea?

9

MS. STRATTON:

Do you

I would have to do some

10

additional research and get back to you in terms of

11

the exact numbers in terms of national trends.

12

know that we are high as it relates to the number of

13

pretrial detainees that we have at the jail.

14

would lead me to believe, just based upon

15

speculation, that we probably don't have as high a

16

release number in terms of EM and I-bonds.

17

will look into that and get back to you.

18

COMMISSIONER SUFFREDIN:

I do

That

But I

I don't know about

19

these other jurisdictions.

I just saw for 2012 we

20

had felony new cases, indictments, 22,753 -- or 4.

21

That is a lot of cases.

don't know if those other jurisdictions are dealing

with that volume.

So someone, the State's Attorney and the other

be part of what the State's Attorney's Office calls

8

their Diversion Unit, which diverts cases either

from prosecution to keep them out of the system,

from beginning, or has diversion sentences that

cause people to vacate a plea after a successful

with the State's Attorney's Office in terms of how

they designate this particular program.

know what we would traditionally think of as the

Your full

What I can is what we

intended to do is to allow for space that was more

space that was more humane for the detainees or the

interviews by yelling through the bars and getting

information that way.

I dislike
The

The Pretrial Services Act requires

17

that there is a confidential space to be able to be

18

interviewed so that they can get the information

19

that can be helpful to the Judges.

20

So the build-out of the space was to

21

allow for the interviews to be held, private spaces

22

where the attorneys and/or Pretrial Services can

23

talk to the detainees directly, and also have some

24

privacy and more humane conditions.

We believe it

all the groups in my area?

12

MS. STRATTON:

But this last award of

Thank you, Commissioner, for

13

the question.

14

hoping that we can continue to partner with all of

15

your offices, and that is making sure that the word

16

gets out to your respective Districts and to the

17

various community-based organizations in your

18

Districts so that they are aware of our grant

opportunities and how they can partner with us.

Because that is something we are

We believe that government serves its

role, but we know what we are trying to accomplish

are the barriers to reentry as it relates to

the next fiscal year, this is where we will want to

do that.
We will make it a point to inform all

you Commissioners of when those activities are

taking place so you can then get the word out in

what we may see next year so as to grow the practice

of restorative justice?

3

MS. STRATTON:

Absolutely, Commissioner.

First of all, the President has

5

expressed her support of seeing more restorative

justice practices utilized.

presentations by many of the practitioners and

advocate for restorative justice, as have I.

practices being utilized by the State's Attorney's

Office, through Juvenile Probation, and with youths

that are in the JTDC currently.

15

we need to do to reduce the population, to look at

more community-based alternatives to detention,

As we look at

That is one of

We would encourage any

I am certainly open to continued

conversations with those that are doing this type of

24

work as to how we can find more opportunities for
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 209

them to do that both within the community, but also

2

directly related to these entities that I mentioned

3

previously.

4

COMMISSIONER GARCIA:

In the same vein

5

regarding the question of jail crowding at the Cook

6

County jail.

7

population at the jail has been frustrating for many

8

of us; I think including the President.

The efforts to try to reduce the

I am wondering if we are able to

9
10

figure out how to do that as we end the year and as

11

we begin 2014.

12

were generated as a result of such a reduction,

13

might that yield resources for things like

14

prevention and restorative justice practices in the

15

communities that need it the most, in your opinion?

16

If we could do that, and the savings

MS. STRATTON:

Absolutely.

I believe that

17

is the President's goal.

18

expressed by the Board, which is that we are

19

spending so much on pretrial detention at the jail

20

as well as at the Juvenile Temporary Detention

21

Center, that it does not free up the resources that

22

could be available to invest in community-based

23

alternatives.

24

The goal I have heard

Right now, you asked a question about
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 210

1

what can be done in this process.

As you know, the

2

President has sought the assistance of the Illinois

3

Supreme Court.

4

responded that he is calling a meeting that will

5

take place in November, that will bring together all

6

of the stakeholders to look at what we can do as it

7

relates to pretrial detention, and getting that

8

population down.

Chief Justice Kilbright has

But at the same time, you state

9
10

exactly what the sentiment is.

11

we can either put money in detaining people, where

12

they are not getting the kinds of services as it

relates to their mental health, as it relates to

substance abuse treatment, as it relates to things

connected with the families, jobs, and school, or we

can reduce the population, spend less money on the

alternatives.

The improvements we have made enabled
us to create an aggressive and extensive fiscal year

to expand the risk assessment in fiscal year 2014 to

that the vendor gets paid based on either assumption

of savings or prediction of savings or their actual

savings.

As you know, several years

to keep our budget fairly modest.

growth that you see from last year to this year is

only responsible for the transfer of one employee

substantial accomplishments in the past year.

agencies to have not only access to our case

as well as what tickets have been paid.

the cases quickly and automatically.

2

Mr. Allen, the General Assembly passed

3

a bill that gave the Assessor of Cook County the

I think there is a paid differential that is good

6

for the Assessor's hearing officers, and it is not

good for your hearing officers.

attempt to get the Assessor to use your office when

says, "He shall appoint the hearing officer", rather

than the normal language of it being up to the

County Board.
MR. ALLEN:

He could appoint you.

The quick answer is "yes".

Mr. Valdez is currently working towards his license.

He is the first

He has a recommendation from a chief engineer to

The two men, although young, are very

ambitious, wanting to learn the physical plan.

I

14

think it offered us many different pluses to our

workforce to have a young couple of men that wanted

16

to learn.

We received two men at a very cheap rate.

COMMISSIONER GAINER: Andrea, if people are

moving to the apprentice program, do we include a

replacement to have additional apprentices?
MS. GIBSON:

I don't believe there are any

Yesterday we received an Inspector

MR. D'AMICO:

into -- this is across engineering, and I mean this
