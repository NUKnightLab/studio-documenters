Each manager will submit a compliance report to LABF on a quarterly basis. LABF investment staff will report to the Board

on a calendar basis, they may be asked to appear before the Retirement Board and explain why they were unable to achieve

Bene?t Fund of Chicago approve a policy of offering to minority owned businesses, female owned businesses, and
