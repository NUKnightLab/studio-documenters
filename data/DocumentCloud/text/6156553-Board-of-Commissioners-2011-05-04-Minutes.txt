 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR MAY 4, 2011
OF STATE COLLECTED REVENUES DUE MUNICIPALITIES
WHEREAS, all Illinois municipalities provide direct frontline services to their citizens; and
WHEREAS, these services have an immediate and fundamental reality to those citizens who depend on
local police and fire protection, water and sewer service, snow removal, roads and traffic safety; and
WHEREAS, local citizens pay income taxes to the State for both the State budget and local municipal
budgets and the revenue is collected by the State; and
WHEREAS, since the inception of the State income tax in 1969, municipalities have received, relied
upon and provided services with those revenues to their local taxpaying citizens; and
WHEREAS, the fiscal reality is that municipalities have already experienced less income tax revenues
from the State; and
WHEREAS, the recent income tax increase provided new revenues all of which went to the State budget
– none of the increase was received by cities – costing over $2.7 billion in future lost revenues; and
WHEREAS, the State, through its Legislature and Governor, is contemplating further reductions to
municipal revenues; and
WHEREAS, one proposal under discussion would take an additional $300,000,000.00 of State-collected
income tax from cities and counties, which would reduce their revenues by $23.40 per capita on top of the
$19.02 that has already been lost during the recession, totaling an estimated $42.42 in lost revenue per
resident in FY 2012.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners strongly
opposes further reduction in state collected revenues and demands that the General Assembly and
Governor take no further action to financially ruin municipalities; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary to the Cook County Board of Commissioners
delivers a suitable copy of this Resolution to Governor Quinn and all members of the Illinois General
Assembly.

DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE (CONTRACT AMENDMENT) by Zahra Ali, Director.
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 15, 2011:
Re: Contract Extension – New Item 13, March 15, 2011 Board Agenda
The Department of Revenue requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to extend the
amended contract for sixteen (16) months, from May 1, 2011 through September 18, 2012,
Contract No. 05-43-628 with Linebarger Goggan Blair & Sampson, LLP (“Linebarger
Goggan”) Chicago Illinois, for debt collections services for various Cook County agencies.
Reason:

Linebarger Goggan’s contract which was originally approved by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners (“Board”) on September 8, 2005, renewed by
the Board on June 19, 2007 and July 21, 2009 under the Office of the President,
extended by the Department of Revenue on September 1, 2010, and expires on
April 30, 2011. This extension would allow the complete contract negotiation,
project planning, transition and implementation of the Countywide Debt
Collections Initiative that has been developed by the Department of Revenue and
Office of the State’s Attorney with the committee representatives from the
Bureau of Finance, Clerk of the Circuit Court, Bureau of Administration, Office
of the President, Sheriff, County Clerk and the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System. The extension will provide time for the using agencies to have
continuation of service, especially for existing placed accounts in the collection
process cycle, including the litigation process through the Department of
Administrative Hearing and increased revenue collection. The time period for
extension would be from May 1, 2011 through September 18, 2012.
Neither the amended contract or extension prevents the County or Board from
exercising an earlier termination period nor does it prevent the County from
engaging in services for collections services with other agency or agencies.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. (Contingency Fee Basis 25%). Contract period: May 1,
2011 through September 18, 2012.
Referred to the Committee on Finance on 03/15/11.
Commissioner Tobolski, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved to approve Communication No.
311629. The motion carried.

Miscellaneous Reports, including artist's drawings, but not including police reports.

(4)

Permit to cremate a dead human body obtained from the Office of the Medical Examiner,
by facsimile or electronic filing.

(5)

Return fee. The Return Fee is charged to funeral homes that pick up bodies from the
Medical Examiner's Office and then request to return them to the Office after determining
that the family has no funds for burial. This cost would include the cost of the burial
shell and the burial cost.

57

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR MAY 4, 2011
(6)

Death certificate amendment fee. Fee is charged if the amendment is made later than 1
year of the person's death (due to a return by Funeral Home). The Office of the Medical
Examiner is charged by the Illinois Department of Vital Records for amendments made
to a death certificate after 1 year of the death.

(7)

Storage fee. This fee covers the bodies returned (by the Funeral Homes) to the Office of
the Medical Examiner for storage while families secure funds for burial services. This
"storage fee" would replace the "return fee" if a funeral home returns a body and picks it
up again within 10 days. If the body is not picked up within 10 days, the body will be
held and buried by the County according to the standard operating procedures of the
Medical Examiner. This "storage fee" discourages the use of the Office of the Medical
Examiner as a storage location by funeral homes and also encourages the funeral
directors to verify that families have funds for burial prior to removing a body from the
Office of the Medical Examiner.

(8)

Photographs, radiographs and histology slides.

Debt due County.

All fees and expense reimbursements shall constitute a debt due the County of Cook and be paid

Examiner investigator.
Sec. 38-138.

Penalty for violation.

$1,000.00 and imprisoned not more than six months.
Sec. 38-139.

Annual report.

The Medical Examiner shall prepare and submit to the Cook County Board of Commissioners an
annual report of the activities of his/her office.
Sec. 38-140.

Medical Examiner Fees Fund.

Beginning on or before March 1, 2011, the Comptroller shall create a special revenue fund to be
entitled the, “Medical Examiner Fees Fund.” The revenue collected by the Office of the Medical
Examiner from all of the various fees of the Office of the Medical Examiner shall be placed in such
special fund for the Office of the Medical Examiner to be held by the Treasurer of the County. Such
revenues collected and placed in such special fund shall only be disbursed by appropriation of the County
Board and shall be used solely for the purchase of electronic and forensic identification equipment or
other related supplies and the operating expenses of the Medical Examiner’s Office.

Decedents shall be defined as deceased individuals for whom the Medical Examiner cannot conclusively

and procedures for such samples, as determined by the Illinois State Police for testing and inclusion in the
State and National DNA Database. Immediately after the Illinois State Police have completed all DNA
analysis, testing and database inclusion, the remaining evidence shall be returned to the Office of the
Medical Examiner.
Sec. 38-152. Number of bodies per casket.

contain the remains of only one indigent, unclaimed or unknown decedent. In the case of infants and
fetuses, the Medical Examiner shall be permitted to place multiple infants and fetuses in a single burial

burial shell. No other tissues or skeletal remains, human or otherwise, shall be permitted in such shell.
Sec. 38-153. Unique Personal Identifiers.
Prior to the burial or interment of an indigent, unclaimed or unknown individual, the Office of the
Medical Examiner shall affix one non-biodegradable Unique Personal Identifier tag to the outside of the

Sec. 38-154. Documentation to be released to contracting cemetery.

the Office of the Medical Examiner. The affidavit form shall delineate each of the elements to be

CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT
CONTRACT ADDENDA
Transmitting a Communication, dated April 5, 2011 from
DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to extend for ten (10) months, Contract No. 09-85-2451
with Trademark Products, Inc., Elk Grove, Illinois, for the purchase of new rubber/hand stamps and
marking equipment.
Reason:

In FY 2010, the Clerk of the Circuit Court began a program that recycles old unused
rubber/hand stamps. As a result of returning old unused stamps to the vendor for credit, the
Clerk of the Circuit Court receives a reduction in the costs to procure new rubber/hand
stamps. Therefore, we are requesting to extend the current contract in order to use the
remaining funds out of the original appropriation, made possible by the recycling program.
Approximately $28,266.40 remains on this contract. The expiration date of the current
contract is June 30, 2011.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract extension: July 1, 2011 through April 30, 2012.

date received, time, court document status of "filed or entered", and department name, etc., on
incoming court documents and administrative records. The majority of the time stamps are
more than ten years old and require constant repairs and replacement parts due to the
frequency of usage. We are requesting to increase our current two-year contract to enable the
Clerk's office to cover ongoing maintenance costs until our current pending contract to
replace/purchase 122 electric time stamp machines can be obtained. The delay in obtaining
the replacement equipment has significantly depleted the fund originally allocated for this

COOK COUNTY HEALTH & HOSPITALS SYSTEM
LETTER REGARDING THE ABILITY TO MEET FY2011 REVENUE BUDGET

125

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR MAY 4, 2011
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 2, 2011 from
MICHAEL AYRES, Chief Financial Officer, Cook County Health & Hospitals System
Re: FY2011 Revenue Budget Forecast
The County Health and Hospitals System (CCHHS) has been assessing its ability to meet the
FY2011 Revenue Budget. As set forth in the chart below, the original budgeted revenue of $638.5
million was composed of three parts: patient fee revenue of $360.2 million; governmental payments of
$271.3 million, comprised of Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) and Benefit Improvement
Protection Act (BIPA) payments; and other income of $6.9 million. As of March 30, 2011, the Health
System was under total revenue budget by $23.8 million of which patient fees were under budget by
$28.3 million and DSH payments were over budget by $4.5 million.
The purpose of this letter is to address the causes of the unfavorable variance to date and what
actions are being taken to adjust the Health System's operation to achieve a balanced budget by fiscal
year-end.
FY2011 Revenue
Budget
$360.237
$271.299
6.974
$638.510

Patient Fees
Government Payments
Other Revenue
Total Revenue

The patient fee revenue budget was based on a number of assumptions related to volumes,
payment rates, payer mix, implementation of the Health System's Strategic Plan: Vision 2015, and the
impact of the PricewaterhouseCoopers engagement in the Performance Improvement Project. As of
March 30, 2011, the Health System was on target for inpatient volumes and payer mix. There was a
slight unfavorable variance in outpatient volumes and in payment rates. Implementation of the Strategic
Plan: Vision 2015, while not progressing as aggressively as originally hoped, is not materially behind
schedule; provided, however, that this will change significantly if we do not discontinue inpatient services
on the Oak Forest campus as planned. The PwC engagement in the Performance Improve Project has
shown significant results in a number of areas.
The overall revenue deficiencies to date appear to lie in the four areas discussed immediately
below. The corrective actions proposed for these deficiencies are addressed later in this letter.
a. Medicaid Receivables -- As of November 30, 2010, CCHHS submitted 10,676 eligibility applications
to Medicaid. As of March 30, 2011, eligibility applications pending approval grew to 11,261. The
budget assumed that, as a result of negotiations during late summer, Medicaid would both remain
current in processing receivables and begin reducing the backlog of receivables. Neither of these
events occurred as of March 30, 2011.
b. Physician Billing Initiative -- CCHHS anticipated that it would begin billing third parties for services
provided by physicians in early FY2011. Because of the complexity in the implementation of this
billing process, CCHHS now anticipates that physician billing activities will begin yielding revenue
in October, 2011. As a result, a relatively small portion of the budgeted physician billing revenue of
$20 million will be received in FY2011.

126

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR MAY 4, 2011
c. Performance Improvement Project -- The PwC engagement anticipated that, in early FY2011,
CCHHS would be positioned to aggressively pursue revenue performance improvement initiatives. A
number of factors including: delays in implementation of information technology changes; delays in
hiring; and unanticipated complexity in correcting or implementing billing processes has slowed the
expected growth in patient service revenue.
d. Revenue Cycle Software Migration -- On December 1, 2010, CCHHS migrated its three Siemens
patient billing systems to one single platform. This was necessary in order to standardize the patient
accounting processes throughout the system and to achieve maximum efficiency within the revenue
cycle. As a result of this migration, it was anticipated that revenues would decline during December
and January with a recovery in February and March of the unbilled backlog of eligibility applications.
The actual recovery of the November, December and January revenues has been delayed. This is a
timing issue. It is anticipated that all accounts payable during this time will be recovered within the
next quarter.
Forecast
The Health System, working with PwC and other advisers, anticipates that the revenue that has
been delayed as a result of the software migration will be recovered within the next quarter and that some
of the anticipated additional revenue will be recovered prior to fiscal year-end. In spite of this, it is
possible that the Health System will have an approximately $33.9 million unfavorable variance in patient
fees by fiscal year-end. This is due primarily to the concern that Medicaid will be unable to resolve the
approximately $40 million in receivables as
originally anticipated and that CCHHS will not be able to implement physician billing in time to achieve
the full $20 million budgeted revenue.
It is significant to note that this estimated shortfall will be offset, in part, by unanticipated
payments from the following:
a. Upper Payment Limit -- Medicaid is allowed to pay providers up to a ceiling determined by the
difference between what Medicaid pays and an allowable or upper payment limit established by
other payers. CCHHS has been in negotiations with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services to recognize this differential. It is anticipated that Medicaid will pay CCHHS between
$20 million and $25 million within the next 90 days as a result of these negotiations. These
revenues were not included in the FY2011 budget because there was significant uncertainty as to
whether these funds would be available.
b. Medicare Settlement -- On April 15, 2011, CCHHS completed its Medicare cost reports for 2010
and recorded a receivable of $4.978 million with an anticipated settlement payment of $3.5
million to CCHHS within the next 90 days. This settlement was not included in the budget
because the outcome of the cost report process was unknown.
The above combined unanticipated revenue ranges from $23.5 million and $25 million and
payment is expected within the next 90 days. However, only $20 million has a high probability of
recovery. As stated above, it is possible that the Health System will have an approximately $33.9 million
unfavorable variance in patient fees by fiscal year-end. This anticipated loss in the current period revenue
is offset by these additional unanticipated revenues resulting in an approximately $14 million shortfall by
the end of FY2011, as set forth in the chart immediately below.

Corrective Action
Recognizing that CCHHS has an obligation to balance its budget, management is currently taking
steps to reduce its operating expenses by an additional $14 million. The analysis of current expenditures
indicates that the system is under budget in most expense categories. While overtime pay is exceeding
budget, total wages are under budget. Management has committed to the CCHHS Board of Directors to
reduce its overtime payments by July, 2011. At this time, it is anticipated that the additional $14 million
in expense reductions will be absorbed through under spending or the reduction of certain line items
within the budget. The proposed list of reductions will be presented to the CCHHS Board of Directors at
its May, 2011 meeting.
Conclusion
The approximately $33.9 million anticipated loss in patient fees effects FY2011 only. As the
initiatives for physician billing, outpatient billing and charge capture are implemented, these revenues
will be recovered by CCHHS in future years. While the current unfavorable variance as of March 30,
2011 is alarming, CCHHS anticipates that approximately half of the variance will be recovered before
fiscal year-end with the remaining $14 million absorbed through the reduction of operating expenses.
It should be noted that total revenues continue to grow. The graph below shows that revenues
decreased from a high of $517 million in FY2006 to a low of $420 million in FY2008. The retroactive
DSH payment benefit received in FY2009 contributed to the almost $668.5 million in revenue for
FY2009 while the Health System generated $539.7 million in FY2010. The original FY2011 revenue
budget anticipated $638.5 million and is now decreased to $624.6 million.
I hope you find this information helpful. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please
feel free to contact Michael Ayres, CCHHS Chief Financial Officer.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR MAY 4, 2011
Previously, your Honorable Body approved an Intergovernmental Agreement on November 20, 2007,
wherein the Toll Authority will be the lead agency for design and construction of the improvements and
the County will share the project costs. Subsequently, your Honorable Body approved an Addendum to
the Agreement on November 16, 2010 to reflect the County’s increased participatory share of costs for
the improvement in the amount of $396,172.71 including unanticipated Land Acquisition costs. This
Second Addendum reflects additional costs incurred by the Toll Authority for reimbursable utility
relocation work related to the County’s Lake Cook Road improvements but were not anticipated in the
original Agreement or the subsequent Addendum. The County of Cook is to reimburse the Toll Authority
for said utility relocation costs estimated as $225,000.00 for an amended total project cost of
$3,384,378.62 (previously amended as $3,159,378.62), under Section: 07-A5019-04-RP.

Highway Authority Agreement along with a Supplemental Agreement
Banco Popular North America
11901 South Pulaski Road at 119th Street (CH B74)
in the Village of Alsip in County Board District #6
Fiscal Impact: None
The Agreement has been prepared in compliance with Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA)
directives toward a tiered approach in dealing with petroleum contamination to soils, and has been
examined and approved by the State's Attorney's Office.
The County, by executing the Agreement, will agree to restrict the extraction of potable water from this
location, inform Permittees of the proscribed status of the referenced location and require that Permittees
properly dispose of excavated soil.
The Agreement further indemnifies and holds the County harmless from liabilities and damages arising
from the petroleum contamination; as well as makes provisions for reimbursement of expenses incurred
by the County should the Highway Department be required in the course of normal maintenance to
expose and dispose of contaminated soils.
The Department of Highways submits for execution three (3) copies of a Highway Authority Agreement
along with a Supplemental Agreement with Banco Popular North America for facilities at 11901 South
Pulaski Road, the intersection of Pulaski Road at 119th Street (CH B74), in the Village of Alsip. This
two-agreement approach became necessary when the Illinois Administrative Code was amended to
provide that all future Tiered Approach to Corrective Action Objectives Agreements be based upon a
State-mandated form. The Supplemental Agreement contains greater protections for Cook County than
the state form and together they are considered as a single “Agreement”.
The Agreement has been prepared in compliance with Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA)
directives toward a tiered approach in dealing with petroleum contamination to soils. For contaminate
concentrations which are of low levels, Tier 1 residential remediation, the IEPA allows for their
remaining in place subject to certain conditions which are, in part, that pumping of potable water in the
location be prohibited, that excavators in the location be informed of the proscribed status for material
handling and that any excavated material be properly disposed. The IEPA requirements also call for these
Agreements to, by reference, be recorded against the property.
The location listed as subject for Highway Authority Agreements is, in part, located along a County
highway and so being, the County has control of the right-of-way through the Highway Department
Permit Office. The County, by executing the Agreement, will agree to restrict the extraction of potable
water from this location, inform Permittees of the proscribed status of the referenced location and require
that Permittees properly dispose of excavated soil.
The Agreement further indemnifies and holds the County harmless from liabilities and damages arising
from the petroleum contamination; as well as makes provisions for reimbursement of expenses incurred
by the County should the Highway Department be required in the course of normal maintenance to
expose and dispose of contaminated soils.
The Agreement was prepared following a Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office prepared Standard
Agreement and has been examined and approved by this Department and the State's Attorney's Office. It
is respectfully requested that, should your Honorable Body concur in this recommendation, the resolution
be adopted and the Agreement executed and that an executed copy of the Agreement be returned to Banco

Local Agency Agreement for Jurisdictional Transfer between the County of Cook and the Village of
Hodgkins

in the Village of Hodgkins in County Board District #16
Section: 02-B7021-03-CH
Centerline Mileage: 0.50 miles
Fiscal Impact: $154,285.04 from the Motor Fuel Tax Fund (600-600 Account)
I respectfully submit to your Honorable Body and recommend for adoption, five (5) copies each of a
Resolution with two (2) Local Agency Agreements for Jurisdictional Transfer between the Village of
Hodgkins and Cook County to transfer jurisdiction of 67th Street from La Grange Road (US 45) to East
Avenue and East Avenue from 67th Street to Joliet Road. The transfer of jurisdiction from the County to
the Village will become effective after execution of the agreements by the Illinois Department of
Transportation and the Village shall assume jurisdiction of said roadways in their present condition and
entirety. In lieu of a roadway improvement for this transfer, the County shall reimburse the Village for
costs incurred for storm sewer video inspection, storm sewer repairs and construction of a deceleration
lane for access to the International Airport Center along 67th Street, said costs totaling $154,285.04.
Further, the County commits a maximum amount of $300,000.00 toward the cost of a future roadway
improvement along East Avenue by the Village, subject to contract award within ten years after execution
of these agreements.
This action is warranted because these sections of roadway service primarily local municipal access only
and are not appropriate road segments to remain under Cook County maintenance.
