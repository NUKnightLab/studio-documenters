Summary: The City of Evanston is interested in participating in the 2017 No Cash Bid Program to
acquire tax delinquent vacant land that will be redeveloped as affordable housing and green space in west
Evanston based on the West Evanston Master Plan (WEMP) that was generated following a robust
community engagement process and approved by the Evanston City Council. This Request Package
contains eight (8) PINs that are listed in order by volume number and PIN.

The first five PINs comprise vacant land that was part of, or adjacent to, the former Mayfair railroad
right of way between Foster and Simpson Streets and Ashland Avenue and Green Bay Road. Several
parcels are buildable lots for affordable housing and others would be redeveloped as green space based
on the WEMP. The last three PINs are segments of the former railroad right of way between Davis Street
and the alley north of Grove Street that would be redeveloped as green space, including pedestrian and
bike paths, with east-west pedestrian/bike connections at Davis and Grove Streets, which currently dead
end near Evanston Township High School.
The City will file for tax exempt status on all of the parcels for as long as the City retains ownership. The
City does not have an agreement with a third party to convey the parcels or for redevelopment at this
time. The City will bear all legal costs and expenses to obtain the tax deed and clear title to the acquired
parcels. The City agrees to submit to the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development an annual
report on the status of the parcels acquired through the No Cash Bid program for five years or until
development is completed, whichever occurs last.

Fiscal Impact: $870,000.00
Accounts: Motor Fuel Tax Fund: 600-585
Summary: The Department of Transportation and Highways respectfully submits for adoption a
resolution appropriating funds for participation in the Federal Highway Administration’s Local
Empowerment for Accelerating Projects (LEAP) Pilot Program. The purpose of this appropriation is as
follows:

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has created a five-year pilot program for Local Public
Agencies (LPAs) to receive federal funding directly instead of via the state’s Department of
Transportation to accelerate project delivery.
The Cook County Department of Transportation and
Highways (DOTH) has recently been selected as a potential finalist for the LEAP Pilot Program. One of
the conditions of advancing the County’s application is a commitment from the LPA to contribute from
non-federal funds an amount equal to 1 percent (1%) of federal funds transferred from FHWA. These
funds will cover the cost of FHWA’s direct stewardship and oversight of federally funded transportation
projects that would have otherwise been provided by the Illinois Department of Transportation.
The objectives of this appropriation are to: First is to secure a direct flow of federal transportation funds
to Cook County; and Second is to streamline the federal project review and approval process so as to
achieve an estimated savings of $16 million in reduced costs from quicker delivery.
Participation in
LEAP will also allow DOTH to use innovative alternative designs permitted by the FAST Act and
facilitate greater access to design-build contracting methods, both of which are not easily utilized under
existing Illinois law. Further, this participation is in accordance with County goals and the Department’s
mission.
