County which has a Chief Executive Officer elected by the electors of the County ... (is) a Home Rule Unit” and
The County of Cook, Illinois (the “County”), has a Chief Executive Officer elected by the electors of the County
and is therefore a Home Rule Unit and may, under the power granted by said Section 6(a) of Article VII of the
Constitution of 1970, as supplemented by the Local Government Debt Reform Act of the State of Illinois, as
amended (the “Debt Reform Act”), and the other Omnibus Bond Acts, as amended, exercise any power and perform
any function pertaining to its government and affairs, including, but not limited to, the power to tax and to incur
debt; and
WHEREAS, the County has the power to incur debt payable from ad valorem property tax receipts or from
any other lawful source and maturing within 40 years from the time it is incurred without prior referendum approval;
and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the County (the “Corporate Authorities”) has not adopted
any ordinance, resolution, order or motion or provided any County Code provisions which restrict or limit the

Page 28 of 94

 exercise of the home rule powers of the County in the issuance of general obligation bonds without referendum for
corporate purposes or which provides any special rules or procedures for the exercise of such power; and
WHEREAS, the County has heretofore issued and there are now outstanding various series of general
obligation bonds (collectively, the “Prior Bonds”), including General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series 2006A
(the “2006A Bonds”); and
WHEREAS, the 2006A Bonds are now outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $333,680,000,
mature and are subject to optional redemption on the dates and as provided in the ordinances adopted by the
Corporate Authorities on the 19th day of September, 2002, and on the 5th day of January, 2005, authorizing the
issuance of the 2006A Bonds; and

all as may be advisable from time to time in order to achieve debt service savings for the County or to restructure
the debt service burden on the County; and
WHEREAS, the aggregate costs of the Refunding, including consulting, financial advisory, legal services,

interests of the County to borrow from time to time for the purpose of the Refunding, and to pay costs of issuance,
and, in evidence of such borrowing, to issue one or more series of full faith and credit bonds of the County as

Sec. 2.Findings.
The Corporate Authorities hereby find that it is necessary and in the best interests of the County, its residents
and taxpayers that the County provide for the Refunding; that the Refunding is expressly authorized under the Act;
and that the Bonds be issued to enable the County to pay the costs of the Refunding. The Corporate Authorities
hereby find that all of the recitals contained in the preambles to this Ordinance are full, true and correct and do
hereby incorporate them into this Ordinance by this reference. It is hereby found and determined that the Corporate
Authorities are authorized by law to borrow upon the credit of the County and as evidence of such indebtedness to
issue at this time one or more Series of Bonds to pay the costs of the Refunding. It is hereby found and determined
Page 37 of 94

 that such borrowing of money pertains to the government and affairs of the County, is necessary or advisable for
the welfare of the government and affairs of the County, is for a proper public purpose or purposes and is in the
public interest, and is authorized pursuant to the Act; and these findings and determinations shall be deemed
conclusive. The authority to issue the Bonds is the Act, and the Bonds shall be issued pursuant to the Act.
Sec. 3.Bond Details.
To pay the costs of the Refunding, the Bonds shall be issued from time to time in one or more Series, all as
may be determined by the Chief Financial Officer, provided that the aggregate principal amount of any Bonds issued
pursuant to this Ordinance shall not exceed $375,000,000. The Bonds shall be designated substantially as “General
Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series 2016,” with such additions or modifications as shall be determined to be
necessary by the Chief Financial Officer at the time of the sale of the Bonds.
Each Series of Bonds shall be dated as of June 1, 2016, or such later date at or prior to the date of issuance
thereof as may be provided in the relevant Bond Order (any such date for any Bonds being a “Dated Date”);
provided that no Bond shall be dated later than December 31, 2016.
All Bonds (i) shall also bear the date of authentication, (ii) shall be in fully registered form, (iii) shall be
issued in Book Entry Form, (iv) shall be in Authorized Denominations as provided in the relevant Bond Order (but
no single Bond shall represent installments of principal maturing on more than one date), (v) shall be numbered 1
and upward within each Series, (vi) shall bear interest at the rates percent per annum and (vii) shall mature serially
or as Term Bonds (subject as hereinafter provided with respect to prior redemption) on November 15 (or such other
date or dates as may be provided in the relevant Bond Order) of the years and in the amounts, as provided in the
relevant Bond Order, subject to the limitations set forth below.
All Bonds shall become due and payable as provided in the relevant Bond Order, provided, however, that
no Bond shall have a Stated Maturity which is later than the date which is thirty (30) years after its Dated Date.
The Bonds shall bear interest at a rate or rates percent per annum not to exceed seven percent (7.0%) per
annum. The Bonds shall bear interest at the rate or rates percent per annum as provided in the relevant Bond Order.

Page 38 of 94

 Each Bond shall bear interest from the later of its Dated Date or the most recent interest payment date to
which interest has been paid or duly provided for, until the principal amount of such Bond is paid, such interest
(computed upon the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) being payable, subject to the provisions of
any Bond Order, on each May 15 and November 15, commencing on such May 15 or November 15 as determined
by the Chief Financial Officer in the Bond Order therefor.
So long as the Bonds are held in Book Entry Form, interest on each Bond shall be paid to the Depository
by check or draft or electronic funds transfer, in lawful money of the United States of America, as may be agreed
in the Representations Letter; in the event the Bonds should ever become available in physical form to registered
owners other than the Depository, interest on each Bond shall be paid by check or draft of the Trustee, payable upon
presentation thereof in lawful money of the United States of America, or by electronic funds transfer of lawful
money of the United States of America, as may be provided, to the person in whose name such Bond is registered
at the close of business on the applicable Regular Record Date, and mailed to the address or transferred to such
account of such registered owner as it appears on the Bond Register or at such other address or account as may be
furnished in writing to the Trustee.
Principal of and premium (if any) on each Bond shall be paid upon surrender in lawful money of the United
States of America, at the principal office maintained for the purpose by the Trustee or its proper agent.
The Bonds shall have impressed or imprinted thereon the corporate seal or facsimile thereof of the County
and shall be signed by the manual or duly authorized facsimile signatures of the President and County Clerk, as
they shall determine, and in case any officer whose signature shall appear on any Bond shall cease to be such officer
before the delivery of such Bond, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same
as if such officer had remained in office until delivery.
All Bonds shall have thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form hereinafter set forth
duly executed by the Trustee as authenticating agent of the County and showing the date of authentication. No
Bond shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose or be entitled to any security or benefit under this Ordinance
unless and until such certificate of authentication shall have been duly executed by the Trustee by manual signature,

Page 39 of 94

 and such certificate of authentication upon any such Bond shall be conclusive evidence that such Bond has been
authenticated and delivered under this Ordinance. The certificate of authentication on any Bond shall be deemed
to have been executed by the Trustee if signed by an authorized officer of the Trustee, but it shall not be necessary
that the same officer sign the certificate of authentication on all of the Bonds issued hereunder.
Sec. 4.Book-Entry Provisions.
The Bonds shall be initially issued in the form of a separate single fully registered Bond for each of the
maturities of each Series of the Bonds. Upon initial issuance, the ownership of each such Bond shall be registered
in the Bond Register in such name as may be provided by the Depository (the “Book Entry Owner”) and,
accordingly, in Book Entry Form as provided and defined herein. Any Designated Officer is authorized to execute
a Representations Letter or to utilize the provisions of an existing Representations Letter. Without limiting the
generality of the authority given with respect to entering into the Representations Letter for the Bonds, it may
contain provisions relating to (i) payment procedures, (ii) transfers of the Bonds or of beneficial interests therein,
(iii) redemption notices and procedures unique to the Depository, (iv) additional notices or communications, and
(v) amendment from time to time to conform with changing customs and practices with respect to securities industry
transfer and payment practices. With respect to Bonds registered in the Bond Register in the name of the Book
Entry Owner, neither the County nor the Trustee shall have any responsibility or obligation to any broker-dealer,
bank, or other financial institution for which the Depository holds Bonds from time to time as securities depository
(each such broker-dealer, bank, or other financial institution being referred to herein as a “Depository Participant”)
or to any person on behalf of whom such a Depository Participant holds an interest in the Bonds. Without limiting
the meaning of the immediately preceding sentence, neither the County nor the Trustee shall have any responsibility
or obligation with respect to (a) the accuracy of the records of the Depository, the Book Entry Owner, or any
Depository Participant with respect to any ownership interest in the Bonds; (b) the delivery to any Depository
Participant or any other person, other than a registered owner of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register or as
expressly provided in the Representations Letter, of any notice with respect to the Bonds, including any notice of
redemption; or (c) the payment to any Depository Participant or any other person, other than a registered owner of

Page 40 of 94

 a Bond as shown in the Bond Register, of any amount with respect to principal of or interest on the Bonds. No
person other than a registered owner of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register shall receive a Bond certificate with
respect to any Bond. In the event that (x) the County determines that the Depository is incapable of discharging
its responsibilities described herein or in the Representations Letter, (y) the agreement among the County and the
Depository evidenced by the Representations Letter shall be terminated for any reason, or (z) the County determines
that it is in the best interests of the County or of the beneficial owners of the Bonds that they be able to obtain
certificated Bonds; the County shall notify the Depository of the availability of Bond certificates, and the Bonds
shall no longer be restricted to being registered in the Bond Register to the Book Entry Owner. The County may
determine at such time that the Bonds shall be registered in the name of and deposited with a successor depository
operating a book entry only system, as may be acceptable to the County, or such depository’s agent or designee,
but if the County does not select such successor depository, then the Bonds shall be registered in whatever name or
names registered owners of Bonds transferring or exchanging Bonds shall designate, in accordance with the
provisions hereof.
Sec. 5.Redemption.
A.

MANDATORY REDEMPTION. If so provided in the relevant Bond Order, any Bonds may be issued as

Term Bonds and be subject to mandatory redemption by operation of the Bond Fund at a price of par, without
premium, plus accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption, on November 15 (or such other date or dates as
may be provided in the relevant Bond Order) of the years and in the amounts and subject to such provisions as shall
be set forth in the relevant Bond Order. The County covenants that it will redeem Term Bonds pursuant to the
mandatory redemption requirement for such Term Bonds and provide Pledged Taxes accordingly.
In connection with any mandatory redemption of Bonds as authorized above, the principal amounts of such
Bonds to be mandatorily redeemed in each year may be reduced through the earlier optional redemption thereof,
with any partial optional redemptions of such Bonds credited against future mandatory redemption requirements in
such order of the mandatory redemption dates as the Chief Financial Officer may determine. In the absence of
such determination, partial optional redemptions of such Bonds shall be credited against future mandatory

Page 41 of 94

 redemption requirements in inverse chronological order of such payments beginning with the amount scheduled to
become due at Stated Maturity, then the amount subject to mandatory redemption on the redemption date
immediately preceding Stated Maturity, and so on. In addition, on or prior to the sixtieth (60th) day preceding any
mandatory redemption date, the Trustee may, and if directed by the Chief Financial Officer shall, purchase Bonds
of such maturities in an amount not exceeding the amount of such Bonds required to be retired on such mandatory
redemption date and at a price not exceeding par plus accrued interest. Any such Bonds so purchased shall be
cancelled and the principal amount thereof shall be credited against the payment required on such next mandatory
redemption date.
The County shall provide the Trustee with written notice of such reduction, which notice shall be given
within thirty (30) days after such redemption or purchase, and the Trustee shall promptly give written notice of the
same to the Bondholders, in the manner hereinafter provided.
B.

OPTIONAL REDEMPTION. If so provided in the relevant Bond Order, any Bonds may be redeemable

prior to maturity at the option of the County, in whole or in part on any date, at such times and at such optional
redemption prices, including any make-whole optional redemption prices, as shall be determined by the Chief
Financial Officer at the time of the sale thereof. Such optional redemption prices, other than for any make-whole
optional redemption, shall be expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of Bonds to be redeemed, provided
that such percentage shall not exceed one hundred three percent (103.00%), plus accrued interest to the date of
redemption. Optional redemption prices and other provisions related to any make-whole optional redemption with
respect to any Bonds shall be determined by the Chief Financial Officer at the time of the sale thereof.
If less than all of the Outstanding Bonds of a Series are to be optionally redeemed, the Bonds to be called
shall be called from such Series, in such principal amounts and from such maturities as may be determined by the
County and within any maturity in the manner hereinafter provided.

Page 42 of 94

 C.

REDEMPTION PROCEDURE. The Bonds subject to redemption shall be identified, notice given, and

paid and redeemed pursuant to the procedures as follows.
1.Redemption Notice. For a mandatory redemption of Term Bonds, unless otherwise notified by
the County, the Trustee shall proceed to redeem the Term Bonds without any further order or direction from
the County hereunder or otherwise. For an optional redemption, the County shall, at least forty-five (45)
days prior to any optional redemption date (unless a shorter time period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee),
notify the Trustee of such redemption date and of the principal amount and maturities of Bonds to be
redeemed.
2.Selection of Bonds within a Maturity. The Bonds shall be redeemed only in the principal amount
of $5,000 each and integral multiples thereof. For purposes of any redemption of less than all of the Bonds
of a single maturity, the particular Bonds or portions of Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by lot by
the Trustee for the Bonds of such maturity by such method of lottery as the Trustee shall deem fair and
appropriate; provided, that such lottery shall provide for the selection for redemption of Bonds or portions
thereof so that each $5,000 principal amount of such Bond shall be as likely to be called for redemption as
any other such $5,000 Bond or $5,000 portion. The Trustee shall make such selection (a) upon or prior to
the time of the giving of official notice of redemption, or (b) in the event of a refunding or defeasance, upon
advice from the County that certain Bonds have been refunded or defeased and are no longer Outstanding
as defined.
Alternatively, if so provided in the relevant Bond Order, for purposes of any redemption of less
than all of the Bonds of a single maturity, the particular Bonds or portions of Bonds to be redeemed shall
be selected by the Trustee pro rata based upon a fraction the numerator of which is the principal amount of
Bonds to be redeemed on a given date and the denominator of which is the aggregate principal amount of
such Series of Bonds and of the given Stated Maturity remaining unpaid immediately prior to such
redemption. If the Bonds are held in Book Entry Form at the time of such redemption, the County shall
direct the Trustee to instruct the Depository to select the specific Bonds within such maturity for redemption

Page 43 of 94

 pro rata among such Bonds, which redemption may utilize the Depository’s current pro rata pass-through
distribution of principal procedure or similar or substituted procedure promulgated from time to time. If
while in Book Entry Form the Depository has no procedure for pro rata redemption, then such partial
redemption shall be accomplished by lot, as described above. The County and the Trustee shall have no
responsibility or obligation to insure that the Depository properly selects such Bonds for redemption.
3.Official Notice of Redemption. The Trustee shall promptly notify the County in writing of the
Bonds or portions of Bonds selected for redemption and, in the case of any Bond selected for partial
redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Unless waived by the registered owner of Bonds
to be redeemed, official notice of any such redemption shall be given by the Trustee on behalf of the County
by mailing the redemption notice by first class U.S. mail not less than thirty (30) days and not more than
sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for redemption to each registered owner of the Bond or Bonds to be
redeemed at the address shown on the Bond Register or at such other address as is furnished in writing by
such registered owner to the Trustee. All official notices of redemption shall include the name of the
Bonds and at least the information as follows:
(a)

the redemption date;

(b)

the redemption price, or for any optional redemption utilizing a make-whole

redemption provision, a description of the formula by which the redemption price shall be
determined;
(c)

if less than all of the outstanding Bonds of a Series and of a particular maturity are to

be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of Bonds of a Series within
such maturity, the respective principal amounts) of the Bonds to be redeemed;
(d)

a statement that on the redemption date the redemption price will become due and

payable upon each such Bond or portion thereof called for redemption and that interest thereon
shall cease to accrue from and after said date; and

Page 44 of 94

 (e)

the place where such Bonds are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price,

which place of payment shall be the office designated for that purpose by the Trustee.
4.Conditional Redemption. Unless moneys sufficient to pay the redemption price of the Bonds to
be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee prior to the giving of such notice of redemption, such
notice may, at the option of the County, state that said redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt of
such moneys by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for redemption. If such moneys are not received,
such notice shall be of no force and effect, the County shall not redeem such Bonds, and the Trustee shall
give notice, in the same manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such moneys were not
so received and that such Bonds will not be redeemed.
5.Bonds Shall Become Due. Official notice of redemption having been given as described, the
Bonds or portions of Bonds so to be redeemed shall, subject to the stated condition in paragraph 4.
immediately preceding, on the redemption date, become due and payable at the redemption price therein
specified, and from and after such date (unless the County shall default in the payment of the redemption
price) such Bonds or portions of Bonds shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of such Bonds for
redemption in accordance with said notice, such Bonds shall be paid by the Trustee at the redemption price.
The procedure for the payment of interest due as part of the redemption price shall be as herein provided
for payment of interest otherwise due.
6.Insufficiency in Notice Not Affecting Other Bonds; Failure to Receive Notice; Waiver. Neither
the failure to mail such redemption notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular
registered owner of a Bond, shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other registered
owners. Notice having been properly given, failure of a registered owner of a Bond to receive such notice
shall not be deemed to invalidate, limit or delay the effect of the notice or redemption action described in
the notice. Such notice may be waived in writing by a registered owner of a Bond entitled to receive such
notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of
notice by registered owners shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent

Page 45 of 94

 to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. In lieu of the foregoing official notice, so
long as the Bonds are held in Book Entry Form, notice may be given as provided in the Representation
Letter, and the giving of such notice shall constitute a waiver by the Depository and the book entry owner,
as registered owner, of the foregoing notice. After giving proper notification of redemption to the Trustee,
as applicable, the County shall not be liable for any failure to give or defect in notice.
7.New Bond in Amount Not Redeemed. Upon surrender for any partial redemption of any Bond,
there shall be prepared for the registered owner a new Bond or Bonds of like Series and tenor, in Authorized
Denominations, of the same maturity, and bearing the same rate of interest in the amount of the unpaid
principal.
8.Effect of Nonpayment upon Redemption. If any Bond or portion of Bond called for redemption
shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from
the redemption date at the rate borne by the Bond or portion of Bond so called for redemption.
9.Bonds to Be Cancelled; Payment to Identify Bonds. All Bonds which have been redeemed shall
be cancelled and destroyed by the Trustee and shall not be reissued. Upon the payment of the redemption
price of Bonds being redeemed, each check or other transfer of funds issued for such purpose shall bear the
CUSIP number identifying, by issue and maturity, the Bonds being redeemed with the proceeds of such
check or other transfer.
10.Additional Notice. The County agrees to provide such additional notice of redemption as it
may deem advisable at such time as it determines to redeem Bonds, taking into account any requirements
or guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the
Government Accounting Standards Board, or any other federal or state agency having jurisdiction or
authority in such matters; provided, however, that such additional notice shall be (a) advisory in nature, (b)
solely in the discretion of the County (unless a separate agreement shall be made), (c) not be a condition
precedent of a valid redemption or a part of the Bond contract, and (d) any failure or defect in such notice
shall not delay or invalidate the redemption of Bonds for which proper official notice shall have been given.

Page 46 of 94

 Reference is also made to the provisions of the Continuing Disclosure Undertaking of the County with
respect to the Bonds, which may contain other provisions relating to notice of redemption of Bonds.
11.Trustee to Advise County. As part of its duties hereunder, the Trustee shall prepare and forward
to the County a statement as to notices given with respect to each redemption together with copies of the
notices as mailed.
Sec. 6.Registration of Bonds; Persons Treated as Owners; Bonds Lost, Destroyed, Etc.
The County shall cause the Bond Register to be kept at the office maintained for the purpose by the Trustee,
which is hereby constituted and appointed the Registrar of the County. The County is authorized to prepare, and
the Trustee shall keep custody of, multiple Bond blanks executed by the County for use in the transfer and exchange
of Bonds.
Subject to the provisions hereof relating to the Bonds in Book Entry Form, any Bond may be transferred or
exchanged, but only in the manner, subject to the limitations of and upon payment of the charges as set forth in this
Ordinance. Upon surrender for transfer of any Bond at the office maintained for the purpose by the Trustee, duly
endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee
and duly executed by, the registered owner or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing, the County shall execute
and the Trustee shall authenticate, date and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new fully registered
Bond or Bonds of the same Series of the same tenor, of the same interest rate and Stated Maturity, of Authorized
Denominations, for a like aggregate principal amount. Subject to the provisions of this Ordinance relating to Book
Entry Form any fully registered Bond or Bonds may be exchanged at said office of the Trustee or its proper agent
for a like aggregate principal amount of such Bonds of the same tenor, of the same Series, interest rate and Stated
Maturity, of other Authorized Denominations.
The Trustee shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Bond during the period from the close of
business on the Regular Record Date for an interest payment to the opening of business on such interest payment
date or during the period of fifteen (15) days preceding the giving of notice of redemption of Bonds or to transfer
or exchange any Bond all or a portion of which has been called for redemption.

Page 47 of 94

 The execution by the County of any fully registered Bond shall constitute full and due authorization of such
Bond, and the Trustee or its proper agent shall thereby be authorized to authenticate, date and deliver such Bond in
accordance with the terms of this Ordinance; provided, however, the principal amount of Bonds of each Series and
maturity authenticated by the Trustee shall not at any one time exceed the authorized principal amount of Bonds
for such Series and maturity less the amount of such Bonds which have been paid.
The person in whose name any Bond shall be registered shall be deemed and regarded as the absolute owner
thereof for all purposes, and payment of the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on any Bond shall be made
only to or upon the order of the registered owner thereof or his or her legal representative. All such payments shall
be valid and effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability upon such Bond to the extent of the sum or sums so paid.
No service charge shall be made for any transfer or exchange of Bonds, but the County or the Trustee may
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
connection with any transfer or exchange of Bonds exchanged in the case of the issuance of a Bond or Bonds for
the outstanding portion of a Bond surrendered for redemption.
If any Bond, whether in temporary or definitive form, is lost (whether by reason of theft or otherwise),
destroyed (whether by mutilation, damage, in whole or in part, or otherwise) or improperly cancelled, the Trustee
or its proper agent may authenticate a new Bond of like Series, date, maturity date, interest rate, denomination and
principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding; provided that (a) in the case of any
mutilated Bond, such mutilated Bond shall first be surrendered to the Trustee, and (b) in the case of any lost Bond
or Bond destroyed in whole, there shall be first furnished to the Trustee evidence of such loss or destruction, together
with indemnification of the County and the Trustee, satisfactory to the Trustee. In the event any lost, destroyed or
improperly cancelled Bond shall have matured or is about to mature, or has been called for redemption, instead of
issuing a duplicate Bond, the Trustee shall pay the same without surrender thereof if there shall be first furnished
to the Trustee evidence of such loss, destruction or cancellation, together with indemnity, satisfactory to it. Upon
the issuance of any substitute Bond, the Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or
other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto.

Page 48 of 94

 Sec. 7.Security.
The full faith and credit of the County are hereby irrevocably pledged to the punctual payment of the
principal of and interest on the Bonds. The Bonds shall be direct and general obligations of the County, and the
County shall be obligated and hereby covenants and agrees to levy ad valorem taxes upon all the taxable property
in the County for the payment of the Bonds and the interest thereon, without limitation as to rate or amount. The
County hereby pledges, as equal and ratable security for the Bonds, all present and future proceeds of the Pledged
Taxes on deposit or to be deposited in the Bond Fund for the sole benefit of the registered owners of the Bonds,
subject to the right, hereby expressly reserved by the County, to transfer certain interest income or investment profit
earned in the Bond Fund to other funds of the County.
Sec. 8.Forms of Bonds.
The Bonds shall be in substantially the forms hereinafter set forth; provided, however, that if the text of the
Bonds is to be printed in its entirety on the front side of the Bonds, then the second paragraph on the front side and

Taxes; Ordinance and Bond Orders to be Filed; Abatement.
A.

TAXES LEVIED. For the purpose of providing the funds required to pay the principal of and interest

on the Bonds promptly as the same become due, there is hereby levied upon all taxable property in the County, a
direct annual tax sufficient for those purposes in addition to all other taxes, for the years and in the amounts as shall
be provided in each relevant Bond Order, which amounts, when aggregated with (i) the receipts, if any, of taxes
levied and collected for the payment of Refunded Bonds, (ii) any accrued interest received on the sale of a Series
of Bonds, and (iii) any proceeds of a Series of Bonds available to pay capitalized interest on said Series of Bonds,
shall be sufficient to pay principal of and interest on such Series of Bonds.
B.

PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. Subject to the right reserved by the County under Section

7 of this Ordinance to transfer investment income, the Bond Moneys shall be applied by the Trustee to pay principal
of and interest on the Bonds.
Principal of and interest on the Bonds coming due at any time when there are insufficient funds on hand
from the Pledged Taxes to pay the same shall be paid promptly when due from current funds on hand in advance of
the collection of the Pledged Taxes herein levied which funds are hereby appropriated for such purpose as necessary;
and when the Pledged Taxes shall have been collected, reimbursement shall be made to said funds in the amount so
advanced.
C.

COVENANTS RE PLEDGED TAXES. The County covenants and agrees with the purchasers and

registered owners of the Bonds that so long as any of the Bonds remain outstanding, the County will take no action
or fail to take any action which in any way would adversely affect the ability of the County to levy and collect the
Pledged Taxes. The County and its officers will comply with all present and future applicable laws in order to
assure that the Pledged Taxes may be levied, extended and collected as provided herein and deposited into the Bond
Fund.
D.

ORDINANCE AND BOND ORDERS TO BE FILED. A copy of this Ordinance, together with a subsequent

copy of each Bond Order, duly certified by the County Clerk, shall be filed in the office of the County Clerk, and
such filings shall constitute the authority for and it shall be the duty of said County Clerk, in each year as aforesaid,

Page 56 of 94

 to extend the taxes levied pursuant to this Section and said Bond Order(s) for collection, such taxes to be in addition
to and in excess of all other taxes heretofore or hereafter authorized to be levied by the County on its behalf.
E.ABATEMENT. Whenever and only when other funds from any lawful source are made available for the
purpose of paying any principal of and interest on the Bonds, so as to enable the abatement of the Pledged Taxes
levied herein for the payment of same, the Corporate Authorities shall, by proper proceedings, direct the deposit of
such funds into the Bond Fund and further shall direct the abatement of the Pledged Taxes by the amount so
deposited. A certified copy or other notification of any such proceedings abating taxes may then be filed with the
County Clerk in a timely manner to effect such abatement.
Sec. 10.Powers as to Bonds and Pledge.
The County is duly authorized to pledge the Pledged Taxes and other moneys, securities and funds
purported to be pledged by this Ordinance in the manner and to the extent provided in this Ordinance.
The Pledged Taxes and all other moneys deposited or to be deposited into the Bond Fund are pledged as
security for the payment of the Bonds. This pledge is made pursuant to Section 13 of the Debt Reform Act to the
fullest extent applicable and shall be valid and binding from the date of issuance of the initial series of the Bonds.
All such Pledged Taxes and the moneys held in the Bond Fund shall immediately be subject to the lien of such
pledge without any physical delivery or further act and the lien of such pledge shall be valid and binding as against
all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the Country irrespective of whether such
parties have notice thereof.
The Pledged Taxes and other moneys, securities and funds so pledged are and will be free and clear of any
pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance thereon or with respect thereto prior to, or of equal rank with, the pledge created
by this Ordinance. The County shall at all times, to the extent permitted by law, defend, preserve and protect the
pledge of the Pledged Taxes and other moneys, securities and funds pledged under this Ordinance and all the rights
thereto of the Bondholders under this Ordinance against all claims and demands of all persons whomsoever.

Sec. 12.Creation of Funds and Appropriations; Abatement of Taxes Levied for Refunded
Bonds.
A.

BOND FUND CREATED. There is hereby created the “General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series

2016, Bond Fund” (the “Bond Fund”), which shall be the fund for the payment of principal of and interest on the
Bonds.
All receipts of the Pledged Taxes received by the County Treasurer, acting ex officio as the County
Collector, shall be deposited daily, as far as practicable, with the Trustee. All other moneys appropriated or used
Page 62 of 94

 by the County for the payment of the principal or redemption price of and interest on the Bonds shall be paid to the
Trustee. The Trustee shall be accountable only for moneys actually so deposited with the Trustee. The Trustee
is hereby expressly authorized to establish such accounts within the Bond Fund as shall be necessary to account for
the Pledged Taxes levied for each Series of Bonds issued hereunder. All Pledged Taxes, and all such moneys,
shall be deposited by the Trustee into the Bond Fund.
The County Treasurer is hereby expressly authorized and directed to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary to provide for the prompt deposit with the Trustee, in accordance with this Ordinance, of all Pledged
Taxes.
The Bond Fund shall be held and maintained as a separate and segregated account by the Trustee. The
Trustee may create accounts within the Bond Fund as necessary for any Series of Bonds as specified in a relevant
Bond Order. Moneys in the accounts of the Bond Fund may be withdrawn or may be transferred among the
accounts of the Bond Fund by the County upon requisition by the Chief Financial Officer. Accrued interest,
capitalized interest and to the extent set forth in a Bond Order, premium, if any, received upon delivery of the Bonds
shall be deposited into the Bond Fund and be applied to pay first interest coming due on the Bonds.
The Pledged Taxes shall either be deposited into the Bond Fund and used solely and only for paying the
principal of and interest on the Bonds or be used to reimburse a fund or account from which advances to the Bond
Fund may have been made to pay principal of or interest on the Bonds prior to receipt of Pledged Taxes. Interest
income or investment profit earned in the Bond Fund shall be retained in the Bond Fund for payment of future
principal of and interest on the Bonds or, to the extent lawful and as determined by the Chief Financial Officer,
transferred to such other funds as may be determined.
B.

ESCROW ACCOUNTS. The sum necessary, as determined by the Chief Financial Officer, of the

principal proceeds and premium, if any, received upon delivery of the Bonds, together with such money in the debt
service funds for the Refunded Bonds as may be advisable for the purpose, shall be used to provide for the
Refunding, pursuant to the provisions of the relevant Escrow Agreement or Escrow Agreements. Any funds

Page 63 of 94

 remaining to the credit of the County pursuant to an Escrow Agreement upon the termination of the Escrow
Agreement shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to the County as directed by the Chief Financial Officer.
C.

EXPENSE FUND CREATED. The sum necessary, as determined by the Chief Financial Officer, of the

principal proceeds of each Series of the Bonds shall be deposited into a separate and segregated fund, hereby created,
to be known as the “General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series 2016 Expense Fund” (the “Expense Fund”) and
shall be disbursed upon the delivery of that Series of Bonds by the Trustee at the written direction of the Chief
Financial Officer or shall be used by the County to pay costs of issuance in accordance with normal County
disbursement procedures. Any funds remaining to the credit of the Expense Fund on the date which is six months
following the date of delivery of the Bonds shall be transferred to the County Treasurer for deposit into such fund
or account of the County as the Chief Financial Officer may direct.
D.

INVESTMENTS. The moneys on deposit in the Bond Fund may be invested from time to time by the

Trustee at the written direction of the Chief Financial Officer in Qualified Investments. Any such investments may
be sold from time to time by the Trustee without further direction from the County as moneys may be needed for
the purposes for which the Bond Fund has been created. In addition, the Chief Financial Officer shall direct the
Trustee (which direction may be by telephonic, electronic or facsimile transmission by the County to the Trustee
and confirmed by electronic or facsimile transmission by the Trustee to the County) to sell such investments when
necessary to remedy any deficiency in the Bond Fund or any accounts created therein. All other investment earnings
shall be attributed to the account for which the investment was made.
E.

DEPOSITS. All moneys (not including securities) held by the Trustee subject to the provisions of this

Section may be deposited by it, on demand or time deposit, in its banking department or with such banks, national
banking associations, trust companies, savings banks or savings and loan associations, that are members of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as may be designated by the President or the Chief Financial Officer. No
such moneys shall be deposited with any such financial institution in an amount exceeding 20 percent of the amount
that an officer of such financial institution shall certify to the Trustee and the Chief Financial Officer as the
combined capital and surplus of such financial institution. No such moneys shall be deposited or remain on deposit

Page 64 of 94

 with any such financial institution in excess of the amount insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, unless (a) such financial institution shall have lodged with the trust department of the Trustee or with
a Federal Reserve Bank or branch or, with the written approval of the Trustee and the Chief Financial Officer,
pledged to some other financial institution for the benefit of the County and the holders of Bonds, as collateral
security for the moneys deposited, Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations having a market value (exclusive of
accrued interest) at least equal to 100 percent of the amount of such moneys, and (b) the Trustee shall have a
perfected first lien in the Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations serving as collateral, and such Federal
Obligations or Agency Obligations shall be free from all third party liens. The Trustee shall allow and credit
interest on any such moneys held by it at such rate as it customarily allows upon similar funds of similar size and
under similar conditions or as required by law. Interest in respect of moneys or on securities in any fund shall be
credited in each case to the fund in which such moneys or securities are held.
F.

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

The County may invest any moneys pursuant to a repurchase

agreement. Each repurchase agreement shall meet the requirements of the Public Funds Investment Act of the
State of Illinois, as amended, or be secured by Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations or such Qualified
Investments as may be specified in a relevant Bond Order, having a market value, marked to market weekly, at least
equal to 102 percent of the amount invested in the repurchase agreement plus accrued interest. The Trustee shall
at all times have a first lien in such Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations perfected (i) by possession of
certificated securities held by the Trustee or held by a third party acting on behalf of the Trustee if the institution
serving as Trustee is also the counterparty to the repurchase agreement and is providing the collateral securities, or
(ii) under the book-entry procedures specified in 31 Code of Federal Regulations 306.1 et seq. or 31 Code of Federal
Regulations 350.0 et seq. The President or the Chief Financial Officer is hereby authorized to enter into, execute
and deliver any investment or repurchase agreement authorized by this Ordinance, and any additional documents
as shall be necessary to accomplish the purposes of any such agreement.
G.TAXES LEVIED FOR REFUNDED BONDS. To the extent not theretofore abated and as determined necessary by the
Chief Financial Officer, the taxes previously levied and collected (or in the process of collection) to pay the

Page 65 of 94

 Refunded Bonds shall be used to effectuate the Refunding as provided in the Escrow Agreement or shall be used to
effectuate the Restructuring, or to the extent not needed due to the issuance of the Bonds, shall be deposited into
the Bond Fund and used to pay first interest coming due on the Bonds. Taxes previously levied for the Refunded
Bonds but not yet extended for collection shall be abated. The Chief Financial Officer is hereby expressly
authorized to file an abatement certificate with the County Clerk, without further official action of the Corporate
Authorities, to effectuate such abatement.
H.PURCHASE REFUNDING. The proceeds of any Bonds issued in accordance with Paragraph H of Section 11 of
this Ordinance shall be used to purchase Prior Bonds from their owners on a date or dates not later than 90 days
after the issuance of such Bonds.
Sec. 13.General Tax Covenants.
A.

NOT PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS. None of the Tax Exempt Bonds shall be a “private activity bond”

as defined in Section 141(a) of the Code.
B.

PERTAINING TO REBATE.

The County further certifies and covenants as follows with respect to the requirements of Section 148(f) of
the Code, relating to the rebate of “excess arbitrage profits” (the “Rebate Requirement”) to the United States:
1.

Unless an applicable exception to the Rebate Requirement is available to the County will

meet the Rebate Requirement.
2.

Relating to applicable exceptions, any Designated Officer is hereby authorized to make such

elections under the Code as either such officer shall deem reasonable and in the best interests of the County.
3.

The Designated Officers are hereby expressly authorized and directed to cause to be

established, at such time and in such manner as they may deem necessary or appropriate hereunder, a
“General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series 2016, Rebate Fund” (the “Rebate Fund”) for the Tax Exempt
Bonds, and such officers shall further, not less frequently than annually, cause to be transferred to the 148
Compliance Fund the amount determined to be the accrued liability under the Rebate Requirement or
Penalty. Said Designated Officers are hereby expressly authorized and directed to cause to be paid to the

Page 66 of 94

 U.S., without further order or direction from the Corporate Authorities, from time to time as required,
amounts sufficient to meet the Rebate Requirement or to pay the Penalty.
4.

Interest earnings in the Bond Fund are hereby authorized to be transferred, without further

order or direction from the Corporate Authorities, from time to time as required, to the Rebate Fund for the
purposes herein provided; and proceeds of the Tax Exempt Bonds and other lawfully available funds of the
County are also hereby authorized to be used to meet the Rebate Requirement or to pay the Penalty, but
only if necessary after application of investment earnings as aforesaid.
Sec. 14.Registered Form.
The County recognizes that Section 149 of the Code requires Tax Exempt Bonds to be issued and to remain
in fully registered form in order to be and remain Tax Exempt. In this connection, the County agrees that it will
not take any action to permit Tax Exempt Bonds to be issued in, or converted into, bearer or coupon form.
Sec. 15.Further Tax-Exemption Covenants.
The County agrees to comply with all provisions of the Code which, if not complied with by the County,
would cause Tax Exempt Bonds not to be Tax Exempt. In furtherance of the foregoing provisions, but without
limiting their generality, the County agrees: (a) through its officers, to make such further specific covenants,
representations as shall be truthful, and assurances as may be necessary or advisable; (b) to comply with all
representations, covenants and assurances contained in certificates or agreements as may be prepared by Bond
Counsel; (c) to consult with Bond Counsel and to comply with such advice as may be given; (d) to file such forms,
statements and supporting documents as may be required and in a timely manner; and (e) if deemed necessary or
advisable by its officers, to employ and pay fiscal agents, financial advisors, attorneys and other persons to assist
the County in such compliance.
The County also certifies and further covenants with the Underwriters and registered owners of the Tax
Exempt Bonds from time to time outstanding that moneys on deposit in any fund or account in connection with the
Tax Exempt Bonds, whether or not such moneys were derived from the proceeds of the sale of the Tax Exempt
Bonds or from any other source, will not be used in a manner which will cause the Tax Exempt Bonds to be

Page 67 of 94

 “arbitrage bonds” within the meaning of Code Section 148 and any lawful regulations promulgated thereunder, as
the same presently exist or may from time to time hereafter be amended, supplemented or revised.
The County further covenants that it will not take any action, or omit to take any action or permit the taking
or omission of any action within its control (including, without limitation, making or permitting any use of the
proceeds of the Tax Exempt Bonds) if taking, permitting or omitting to take such action would cause any Tax
Exempt Bond to be a private activity bond within the meaning of the Code or would otherwise cause interest on the
Tax Exempt Bonds to be included in the gross income of the recipients thereof for federal income tax purposes.
The County acknowledges that, in the event of an examination by the Internal Revenue Service of the exemption
from federal income taxation of interest on the Tax Exempt Bonds, under present rules, the County may be treated
as a “taxpayer” in the examination and agrees that it will respond in a commercially reasonable manner to any
inquiries from the Internal Revenue Service in connection with such an examination.
Sec. 16.Opinion of Counsel Exception.
The County reserves the right to use or invest moneys in connection with the Bonds in any manner,
notwithstanding the tax-related covenants set forth in Sections 13 through 15 herein, provided, that it shall first have
received an opinion from Bond Counsel to the effect that such use or investment as contemplated is valid and proper
under applicable law and this Ordinance and that such use or investment will not adversely affect the Tax Exempt
status of the Tax Exempt Bonds.
Sec. 17.Payment and Discharge; Refunding.
The Bonds may be discharged, payment provided for, and the County’s liability terminated as follows:
(a) Discharge of Indebtedness. If (i) the County shall pay or cause to be paid to the registered
owners of the Bonds the principal, premium, if any, and interest, to become due thereon at the times and in
the manner stipulated therein and herein, (ii) all fees and expenses of the Trustee shall have been paid, and
(iii) the County shall keep, perform and observe all and singular the covenants and promises in the Bonds
and in this Ordinance expressed as to be kept, performed and observed by it or on its part, then these presents
and the rights hereby granted shall cease, determine and be void. If the County shall pay or cause to be
paid to the registered owners of all Outstanding Bonds of a particular Series, or of a particular maturity
within a Series, the principal, premium, if any, and interest, to become due thereon at the times and in the
manner stipulated therein and herein, such Bonds shall cease to be entitled to any lien, benefit or security
under the Ordinance, and all covenants, agreements and obligations of the County to the holders of such
Bonds shall thereupon cease, terminate and become void and discharged and satisfied.
Page 68 of 94

 (b) Provision for Payment. Bonds for the payment or redemption or prepayment of which
sufficient monies or sufficient Defeasance Obligations shall have been deposited with the Trustee or an
escrow agent having fiduciary capacity (whether upon or prior to the maturity or the redemption date of
such Bonds), and accompanied by an express declaration of defeasance of the Bonds by the Corporate
Authorities, shall be deemed to be paid within the meaning of this Ordinance and no longer outstanding
under this Ordinance; provided, however, that if such Bonds are to be redeemed prior to the maturity thereof,
notice of such redemption shall have been duly given as provided in this Ordinance or arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee shall have been made for the giving thereof. Defeasance Obligations shall be
considered sufficient only if said investments mature and bear interest in such amounts and at such times
as will assure sufficient cash to pay currently maturing interest and principal and redemption premiums if
any when due on the Bonds without rendering the interest on any Bonds taxable under the Code.
The County may at any time surrender to the Trustee for cancellation by it any Bonds previously
authenticated and delivered hereunder, which the County may have acquired in any manner whatsoever,
and such Bonds, upon such surrender and cancellation, shall be deemed to be paid and retired.
(c) Termination of County’s Liability. Upon the discharge of indebtedness under paragraph (a)
hereof, or upon the deposit with the Trustee of sufficient money and Defeasance Obligations (such
sufficiency being determined as provided in paragraph (b) hereof) for the retirement of any particular Bond
or Bonds, all liability of the County in respect of such Bond or Bonds shall cease, determine and be
completely discharged and the holders thereof shall thereafter be entitled only to payment out of the money
and the proceeds of the Defeasance Obligations deposited with aforesaid for their payment.

Sec. 18.Duties of Trustee.
(a)

If the Trustee has received notice, or has actual knowledge that an Event of Default has occurred and

is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise its rights and powers and use the same degree of care and skill in their
exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person’s own
affairs.
(b)

The Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in this Ordinance and no

others, and no implied covenants or obligations of the Trustee shall be read into this Ordinance. In the absence of

opinions expressed, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of
this Ordinance. However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether they

this Ordinance;

the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred therein or thereby.

Sec. 20.Individual Rights of Trustee.

the registered owners of a majority in principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding shall have the right, by an
instrument in writing executed and delivered to the Trustee, to direct the method and place of conducting all

direction shall not be otherwise than in accordance with law and the Trustee shall be indemnified to its satisfaction
against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby.
Sec. 30.Right of Holders to Institute Suit.
Subject to the provisions of any Commitment, no holder of any of the Bonds shall have any right to institute
any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law for the execution of any trust hereunder, or for any other remedy

of Default as hereinabove provided, and unless also the registered owners of twenty-five percent (25%) in principal
amount of the Bonds then outstanding shall have made written request of the Trustee after the right to exercise such
powers, or right of action, as the case may be, shall have accrued, and shall have afforded the Trustee a reasonable
opportunity either to proceed to exercise the powers hereinbefore granted, or to institute such action, suit, or
proceeding in its name; and unless, also, there shall have been offered to the Trustee security and indemnity
satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee shall
have refused or neglected to comply with such request within a reasonable time; and such notification, request and
offer of indemnity are hereby declared in every such case, at the option of the Trustee, to be conditions precedent
to the execution of the powers and trusts of this Ordinance or for any other remedy hereunder; it being understood
and intended that no one or more holders of the Bonds shall have any right in any manner whatever by his, her or
their action to affect, disturb or prejudice the security of this Ordinance, or to enforce any right hereunder, except
in the manner herein provided, and that all proceedings at law or in equity shall be instituted, had and maintained
in the manner herein provided and for the equal benefit of all holders of the outstanding Bonds, respectively.

Page 75 of 94

 on his or her Bonds, respectively, out of the Bond Fund, or the obligation of the County to pay the same, at the time
and place in the Bonds expressed.
Sec. 31.Suits by Trustee.
All rights of action under this Ordinance, or under any of the Bonds, enforceable by the Trustee, may be
enforced by it without the possession of any of the Bonds or the production thereof at the trial or other proceeding
relative thereto, and any such suit, or proceeding, instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its name for the
ratable benefit of the holders of the Bonds affected by such suit or proceeding, subject to the provisions of this
Ordinance.
Sec. 32.Remedies Cumulative.
No remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee, the Bondholders, or to the Insurer is intended
to be exclusive of any other remedy or remedies, and each and every such remedy shall be cumulative, and shall be
in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute.
Sec. 33.Waiver of Default.
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Bondholder to exercise any right or power accruing upon any
default shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default, or an
acquiescence therein; and every power and remedy given by this Section to the Trustee and the Bondholders,
respectively, may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient. In the event any Event
of Default shall be waived by the Bondholders or the Trustee, acting at the direction, or with the consent of, the
Bondholders, such waiver shall be limited to the particular Event of Default so waived and shall not be deemed to
waive any other Event of Default hereunder.
Sec. 34.Application of Monies After Default.
Subject to any Commitment, the County covenants that if an Event of Default shall happen and shall not
have been remedied, the Trustee shall apply all monies, securities and funds received by the Trustee pursuant to
any right given or action taken under the provisions of this Article as follows:
(1) First, to the payment of all reasonable costs and expenses of collection, fees, and other
amounts due to the Trustee hereunder; and thereafter,
Page 76 of 94

 (2) Second, to the payment of amounts, if any, payable to the United States Treasury pursuant to
any Tax Agreement;
(3)

All such monies shall be applied as follows:

(A) first, to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of all installments of interest on
Outstanding Bonds then due, in the order of the maturity of such installments, and, if the amount
available shall not be sufficient to pay in full any particular installment, then to the payment ratably,
according to the amounts due on such installment, to the persons entitled thereto, without any
discrimination or preference; and
(B) second, to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of the unpaid principal and
premium, if any, on any of the Outstanding Bonds which shall have become due (other than Bonds
matured or called for redemption for the payment of which monies are held pursuant to the
provisions of this Ordinance), in the order of their due dates, with interest upon such Outstanding
Bonds from the respective dates upon which they became due, and, if the amount available shall
not be sufficient to pay in full Outstanding Bonds due on any particular date, together with such
premium, then to the payment ratably according to the amount of principal and premium due on
such date, and then to the payment of such principal ratably according to the amount of such
principal due on such date, to the persons entitled thereto without any discrimination or preference.
Whenever monies are to be applied by the Trustee pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, such monies shall
be applied by the Trustee at such times, and from time to time, as the Trustee shall determine upon consultation
with the County, having due regard to the amount of such monies available for application and the likelihood of
additional monies becoming available for such application in the future. The deposit of such monies with the
paying agents, or otherwise setting aside such monies, in trust for the proper purpose, shall constitute proper
application by the Trustee; and the Trustee shall incur no liability whatsoever to the County to any Bondholder or
to any other person for any delay in applying any such funds, so long as the Trustee acts with reasonable diligence,
having due regard to the circumstances, and ultimately applies the same in accordance with such provisions of this
Ordinance as may be applicable at the time of application by the Trustee. Whenever the Trustee shall apply such
funds, it shall fix the date (which shall be an interest payment date unless the Trustee shall deem another date more
suitable) upon which such application is to be made and upon such date interest on the amounts of principal paid
on such date shall cease to accrue. The Trustee shall give such notice as it may deem appropriate of the fixing of
any such date and of the endorsement to be entered on each Bond on which payment shall be made, and shall not
be required to make payment to the holder of any unpaid Bond until such Bond shall be presented to the Trustee for
appropriate endorsement, or some other procedure deemed satisfactory by the Trustee.
Page 77 of 94

restrictions in this Ordinance and any Commitment contained, may pass and accept an ordinance or
ordinances supplemental hereto, which ordinance or ordinances thereafter shall form a part hereof, for any
one or more of the following purposes:
(i) To add to the covenants and agreements of the County in this Ordinance contained,
other covenants and agreements thereafter to be observed or to surrender, restrict or limit any right
or power herein reserved to or conferred upon the County;
(ii) To make such provisions for the purpose of curing any ambiguity, or of curing,
correcting or supplementing any defective provision contained in this Ordinance, or in regard to
matters or questions arising under this Ordinance, as the County may deem necessary or desirable
and not inconsistent with this Ordinance and which in the opinion of the Trustee shall not adversely

delivered to the Trustee;
(iii) To designate one or more tender or similar agents of the Trustee, bond registrars or

(iv) To comply with the provisions of Section 17 hereof when money and the Defeasance
Obligations designated therein sufficient to provide for the retirement of Bonds shall have been

(v) as to Bonds which are authorized but unissued hereunder to change in any way the
terms upon which such Bonds may be issued or secured.
Any supplemental ordinance authorized by the provisions of this Section may be passed by the County and
accepted by the Trustee without the consent of or notice to the registered owners of any of the Bonds at the
time outstanding, but with notice to the Insurer, notwithstanding any of the provisions of paragraph (b) of
this Section, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to accept any such supplemental ordinance which affects
the Trustee’s own rights, duties or immunities under this Ordinance or otherwise.
(b) Supplemental Ordinances Requiring Consent of Bondholders. With the consent (evidenced
as provided in Section 40 hereof) of the registered owners of not less than a majority in aggregate principal

Page 78 of 94

 ordinances supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or
eliminating any of the provisions of this Ordinance or of any supplemental ordinance; provided that no such
modification or amendment shall extend the maturity or reduce the interest rate on, or permit the creation
of a preference or priority of any Outstanding Bond or Outstanding Bonds over any other Outstanding Bond
or Outstanding Bonds, or otherwise alter or impair the obligation of the County to pay the principal, interest
or redemption premium, if any, at the time and place and at the rate and in the currency provided therein of
any Bond, without the express consent of the registered owner of such Bond or permit the creation of a
preference or priority of any Bond or Bonds over any other Bond or Bonds, or reduce the percentage of
Bonds, respectively, required for the affirmative vote or written consent to an amendment or modification,
or deprive the registered owners of the Bonds (except as aforesaid) of the right to payment of the Bonds
from the Pledged Taxes, or alter or impair the obligations of the County with respect to the Tax Exempt
status, the registration, transfer, exchange or notice of redemption of Bonds, without the consent of the
registered owners of all Outstanding Bonds affected; nor shall any such modification or amendment reduce
the percentage of the registered owners of Outstanding Bonds required for the written consent of such
modification or amendment without the consent of the owners of all of the Outstanding Bonds. Upon
receipt by the Trustee of a certified copy of such ordinance and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence
of the consent of Bondholders as aforesaid, the Trustee shall accept unless such supplemental ordinance
affects the Trustee’s own rights, duties or immunities under this Ordinance or otherwise, in which case the
Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, accept such supplemental ordinance.
If a given Series of Bonds is fully and irrevocably insured or otherwise provided for as to the timely payment
of principal and interest by a municipal bond or financial guaranty insurance policy, a letter of credit, or
some other means, and such policy provider or letter of credit provider shall not be in default, then any
consent to amendment as herein provided shall not be given by the owners of Bonds of such Series, but
rather shall be obtained from such provider, whose consent may or may not be given in its complete
discretion, and whose consent shall be binding on such owners and all successors in interest. Ownership
of Bonds for purposes of consent by the registered owners thereof shall be conclusively proved by the Bond
Register.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Bondholders under this paragraph to approve the particular
form of any proposed supplemental ordinance, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the
substance thereof.
Promptly after the passage by the County and the acceptance by the Trustee of any supplemental ordinance
pertaining to the Bonds pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, the County shall publish a notice,
setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental ordinance, at least once in a financial
newspaper or journal printed in the English language, customarily published on each business day and of
general circulation among dealers in municipal securities in the County of New York, New York. If,
because of temporary or permanent suspension of the publication or general circulation of any financial
newspaper or journal or for any other reason it is impossible or impractical to publish such notice of
supplemental ordinance in the manner herein provided, then such publication in lieu thereof as shall be
made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute sufficient publication of notice. Any failure of the
County to given such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the
validity of any such supplemental ordinance.
(c) Supplemental Ordinance to Modify this Ordinance. Upon the execution of any
supplemental ordinance pursuant to the provisions of this Section, this Ordinance shall be modified and
amended in accordance therewith and the respective rights, duties and obligations under this Ordinance of
Page 79 of 94

 the County, the Trustee and all registered owners of Bondholders, respectively, outstanding thereunder shall
thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder subject in all respects to such modification and
amendments, and all the terms and conditions of any such supplemental ordinance shall be and be deemed
to be part of the terms and conditions of this Ordinance for any and all purposes.
(d) Trustee May Rely Upon Opinion of Counsel Re: Supplemental Ordinance. The Trustee
may receive an opinion of counsel as conclusive evidence that any supplemental ordinance executed
pursuant to the provisions of this Section complies with the requirements of this Section.
(e) Notation. Bonds authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental
ordinance pursuant to the provisions of this Section may bear a notation, in form approved by the Trustee,
as to any matter provided for in such supplemental ordinance, and if such supplemental ordinance shall so
provide, new bonds, so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Corporate Authorities,
to any modification of this Ordinance contained in any such supplemental ordinance, may be prepared by
the County, authenticated by the Trustee and delivered without cost to the registered owners of the Bonds
then outstanding, upon surrender for cancellation of such Bonds in equal aggregate principal amounts.
Sec. 37.Effect of Consents.
After an amendment or supplement to this Ordinance becomes effective, it will bind every Bondholder.
For purposes of determining the total number of Bondholders’ consents, each Bondholder’s consent will be effective
with respect to the Bondholder who consented to it and each subsequent holder of a Bond or portion of a Bond
evidencing the same debt as the consenting holder’s Bond.
Sec. 38.Signing by Trustee of Amendments and Supplements.
