B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
The following individuals provided additional information on the requests: Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief
Executive Officer; Randolph Johnston, System Associate General Counsel; and Steven Glass, Executive
Director of Managed Care.
With regard to request number 1, Mr. Johnston stated that when the administration determined that outside
expertise was needed for the highly-specialized area of managed care contracts, staff solicited input from a
number of other lawyers for health systems of who they knew had expertise in managed care contracting.
Hogan Marren, Ltd. has significant experience in managed care contracts - not only in Illinois, but throughout
the country.
With regard to request number 2, Ms. Besenhofer stated that what is being requested is to decrease the term of
the contract from 60 months to 36 months, with two one-year options for renewal. The administration is not
asking for any additional funding at this time. She stated that it was determined that this is the most prudent
way to move forward with the new requirements associated with the Managed Care contracting. The contract
will have the same amount of money that was initially approved; although the contract spend has a shorter time
period, there is an increase to the population that is being serviced.
In response to a question from Acting Chairman Hammock regarding the size of the population, Mr. Glass
stated that, in the FY2015 Preliminary Budget that will be introduced later in the meeting, the administration is
predicting and budgeting for a total of 150,000 members. The current membership has held at approximately
100,000 members; adding in the new populations, and calculating decreases in other categories, the
administration is budgeting at 50% net growth. He noted that the administration is also dealing with a new
service package, what the State calls “Service Package 2.” This is for long-term services and supports for
things like homemaker services for individuals who are deemed eligible for community and home-based
waiver services. Those services will have to be provided, as well, and are very costly.
Director Carvalho indicated that the request appears to be packaged in a way to suggest that the reduction in
contract term is a way to not need to ask for more money to support the amendment to the contract, which adds
new populations. If that is the case, he stated that he is a big believer in just asking for what is needed, and
defending what is being requested. Mr. Glass responded that, to comply with the Procurement Code, and the
way in which purchasing is handled, the request of this Board to obligate funds would have been a very
significant amount, approaching an additional three quarters of a billion dollars. The other alternative that was
considered was, rather than asking for an obligation of that amount to one vendor, to instead create
opportunities that keeps the approved amount the same, and change the scope of the work. He added that the
actual percentage of funds that are retained by the Third Party Administrator (TPA) are decreased; there is
more money flow-through to the provider network than there is to the TPA under this request.
Dr. Shannon provided additional information on the rationale to taking this approach. He stated that when the
System initially changed its TPA, it was not yet clear what was going to be the timing of the roll-out of the
traditional populations and exactly when they would get folded in; even today, they are awaiting the beginning
of that process with the Family Health Plan (FHP) members. He believed that staff, in considering this, saw
this as an opportunity for flexibility for the organization. This allows the System to have the flexibility to, at
year three, extend the contract if things are going swimmingly, and if projections about both the populations
and their utilization of dollars are going well, the administration would be asking for more money to get to
years four and five. On the other hand, if the experience is different, either with the utilization or with
IlliniCare with its strengths and weaknesses, this gives the administration the opportunity to partner with a
different entity as the TPA.

III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Acting Chairman Hammock stated that he agreed with Director Carvalho that perhaps this request was not
related with the kind of transparency it should have; it might have been a lot easier for the Committee to look
at it as a “proposed amendment to change the term” and right under it, “financial impact is:___,” and explain
how that, in effect, is an increase over the next three years of expenses certain, because of the increased
population.
The Committee discussed the subject of the TPA rate for the five year contract versus the current proposal. It
was noted that the TPA rate is currently fixed for the five year contract period. For the current proposal, the
TPA rate is fixed for the three year contract period, and then is subject to negotiation for the renewal options.
Acting Chairman Hammock stated that he would like to ask Mr. Glass and Ms. Besenhofer to go back and
further clarify and review. He stated that if they want to present it for consideration at the Board Meeting on
August 29th, they can advise him and discuss it with him. Right now, he stated that the Board will want to have
greater transparency of what the underlying contract changes are, and what impact they will have.
With regard to request number 3, Ms. Besenhofer stated that a correction needs to be made to the amount listed
on the transmittal as the fiscal impact; the fiscal impact for this request is an amount not to exceed
$70,233,781. This is due to some revised member projections, and also because the shared savings was
calculated at the three year time period, versus a two year time period.
In response to a question from Acting Chairman Hammock regarding the managers/partners under the LLC,
Mr. Glass stated that the members are comprised of virtually all the pioneer participants from the original
MHN organization, including the federally-qualified health centers (FQHCs) of the Friend Family Health
Center, Alivio Health Center, Esperanza Health Center, Chicago Family and Lawndale Christian Health
Center, as well as Rush University Medical Center, Mt. Sinai Hospital and La Rabida Hospital. These not-forprofit organizations are partners of the LLC.
Mr. Glass stated that, similar to the TPA contract structure, the bulk of funding under this contract is passed
through the MHN ACO corporation to those providers that are within the network, to deliver care directly to
the CountyCare members within their practice. The model of care innovation that is in play from the MHN
participants is to innovate delivery of care at what is termed the sharpest point in care, which is right when the
provider is sitting with the patient. MHN ACO funds those organizations mentioned to innovate and
implement models of care within their practices, and is aimed at set and shared goals among the organization
and members.
Director Carvalho provided additional information. He stated that, to date, the System has been paying feefor-service in its network; going forward, this piece of it at least, at some point, will have an assumption of risk
on their part. Mr. Glass responded affirmatively. He stated that the assumption of risk is planned for year
three; part of the agreement includes beginning in year two to have those discussions about the assumption of
risk. Following his comments, Director Carvalho noted that, as La Rabida Hospital is involved in the MHN
ACO, he will abstain on the matter.
Acting Chairman Hammock inquired as to the reason why request number 5 was this not competitively bid.
Ms. Besenhofer responded that this vendor is not the only provider of these types of services. This is a contract
with a vendor under the Group Purchasing Organization, and is a company that the System has used for a
period of time, with successful results.

III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Ms. Besenhofer indicated that review of request numbers 3, 4 and 5 by Contract Compliance has not yet been
completed; she respectfully requested that the Committee conditionally approve these requests, pending the
completion of the review by Contract Compliance.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the approval of request
number 1. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Request number 2 was deferred (see discussion above).
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the conditional approval of
request numbers 3, 4 and 5, pending completion of review by Contract Compliance.
THE MOTION CARRIED.
Director Carvalho abstained and voted PRESENT on request number 3.

C. Proposed Transfers of Funds (Attachment #2)
Aaron Galeener, System Director of Budget, presented the proposed Transfers of Funds. The Committee reviewed
and discussed the requests.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the approval of the
proposed Transfers of Funds. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

D. Any items listed under Sections III and IV
IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update on CountyCare Health Plan (Attachment #3)
Mr. Glass reviewed his presentation regarding the Update on the CountyCare Health Plan, which included
information on the following subjects: Overview of Illinois and Mandatory Managed Care and CountyCare
Health Plan; TPA Transition Update; Members and Member Months; and Updates to Focus Areas. The
Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
In response to Director Gugenheim’s question regarding whether the increase in male members in the age
group of males aged 25-34 was due to enrollment efforts at the Cook County Department of Corrections, Mr.
Glass stated that he would have to look at that a little closer. He stated that in March, the administration was
estimating that the State had around 12,000 of its applications pending; at the end of July the pending
applications had decreased to 800. He thought that the increase was due to the State getting current with
processing of the applications; he stated that he can go back and look at it.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved to receive and file the
Update on the CountyCare Health Plan.
THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items (continued)
B. Introduction of CCHHS FY2015 Preliminary Budget (Attachment #4)
Following is the verbatim introduction provided by Dr. Shannon regarding the CCHHS FY2015 Preliminary
Budget.
I  wanted  to  set  the  context  for  the  coming  year.    As  a  reminder,  the  development  of  the 
organization into the mature organization that we are today, owning and operating a health plan, 
was  a  direction  that  was  set  by  choice.    It  was  a  choice  of  action  over  inaction,  as  the  world 
changed to one of Medicaid managed care.  We think that is a very good thing. 
 
I’ll remind us, that has provided 100,000 individuals in this County not only with the self‐respect 
and dignity that comes with having their own options to get care in an insured status, but it has 
also given them choice, and that is something that increasingly our staff is understanding better.  
For the first time in our history, in the last six months, this organization has seen a majority of the 
people having insurance, as opposed to not having insurance, and that is a very big change. 
 
As you’ll hear, and as Aaron Galeener goes through his presentation, it doesn’t get away from the 
fact that our historical mission persists.  We continue to deliver care to a very substantial number 
of  people  that  the  Affordable  Care  Act  (ACA)  has  not  touched.    There’s  no  imminent  solution  for 
those  individuals  on  the  horizon  that  we  see.    In  addition  to  that,  the  care  we  provide  in 
correctional  health  services  and  care  provided  to  prevent  illness  by  our  Department  of  Public 
Health is an unfunded mandate.  I hope that you’ll see in the presentation that the organization is 
making  FY2015  a  year  of  serious  intentionality  ‐  intention  to  build  important  foundations  and 
clinical operations that we have not done in the past, and investing in people.   
 
The budget is going to be accomplishing things like developing fully costed‐out structures.  You’ll 
see that there is a reapportionment of certain costs, such as those costs associated with pharmacy, 
to the appropriate clinical area where those are being delivered.  That is important for us as we go 
forward, because as Steven Glass, John Cookinham and others have pointed out, the cost that we 
negotiate with the State for our Medicaid Managed Care population relies completely on us being 
able to identify the true cost of caring for those populations, and this is a step in that direction.   
 
It also invests in a couple of key developments and key services that should be a major satisfier for 
our  patients,  including  centralized  scheduling  and  a  call  center.    You’ll  also  see  attention  paid  to 
neglected  capital  costs,  and  you’ll  see  big‐ticket  items,  such  as  MRIs,  interventional  radiology 
suites and cath labs in FY2013 and FY2014, but also a pivot in FY2015 to an expenditure on larger 
numbers  of  items  that  themselves  each  have  smaller  unit  costs  but  are  critical,  frequent 
encounters  with  our  patients  and  our  staff  ‐  simple  things  like  beds,  blood  pressure  cuffs, 
wheelchairs,  and  the  like,  and  examination  tables  that  have  been  neglected  over  time.    We  think 
those are important satisfiers. 
 
As you will see, we will still have contracted services.  What the organization will be bringing to 
those contracted services in the coming year is increased scrutiny, increased accountability.  We 
should  be,  and  I  expect  that  this  Board  will  be  holding  us  accountable  for,  in  those  areas  where 
we’re  bringing  in  staff,  there  should  be  an  offset  in  contracted  services  and  agency  staff,  and  I 
expect we’ll be getting those difficult questions at the Board Meetings about what is the tradeoff.  I 
want  to  share  with  you  that  I  will  be  holding  our  managers  and  executive  team  accountable  for 
those kinds of tradeoffs when we bring those forward.  You’re also going to see investments to try 
to reduce wait times for patients in clinics.  We’ll talk about those more as we go through this.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
B. Introduction of CCHHS FY2015 Preliminary Budget (continued)
Importantly, a large part of this coming year’s fiscal budget is depending on us hiring more staff.  
We’ve set a very ambitious goal to reduce the number of vacancies that we currently have.  We do 
that with no small amount of circumspection, because we recognize that it is likely that during this 
fiscal year we will also see pension reform at the County level, and so there is an unknown factor 
that  we  will  have  to  anticipate  and  respond  to  as  it  relates  to  people  leaving  the  organization 
because  of  pension  reform.    Nonetheless,  I  think  you  are  going  to  see  very  ambitious  goals  as  it 
relates  to  staffing,  and  not  just  staffing,  but  the  right  staff  at  the  right  place  with  the  right 
competency.    So  we’ll  be  investing  more  in  the  coming  year  in  staff  development  and  staff  skills 
training,  but  just  one  small  example  is  the  flexibility  that  is  going  to  be  required  to  meet  staff 
needs, and we heard a little bit about that earlier today around staffing for Saturday clinic hours, 
which we know our patients need.  It is these kinds of challenges that I think you are going to see 
in the budget in the coming year.   
 

I just want to close by saying we are going to be focusing in the coming fiscal year on four items.  
First ‐ provision of high‐quality, safe care delivered by competent staff that are assigned to their 
stations to meet clinical needs.  Secondly ‐ a focus on the financial stability of the organization.  As 
the budget grows in proportion to the Medicaid Managed Care plan, we will need to bring frequent 
reminders  and  updates  back  to  this  organization.    Steven  Glass  has  talked  about  those.    I  think 
you’ve  seen  in  the  last  couple  of  months  changes  in  the  way  that  we’re  reporting  to  the  Finance 
Committee, the overall health of the Health System, as well as the financial health of the Managed 
Care plan, and the complicated interplay between the two of those.  Thirdly ‐ investments in the 
right kind of staff, so again, those ambitious goals for hiring, and Aaron Galeener will go into some 
detail  about  that.    Lastly  ‐  efficient  clinical  operations  that  work  better,  and  we  think  will  be  a 
satisfier,  not  only  for  our  patients  who  are  going  to  be  able  to  increasingly  vote  with  their  feet 
during  calendar  year  2015,  but  also  a  marked  improvement  for  our  clinical  professionals  who 
work  here,  and  we  hope  it  will  be  a  major  satisfier  for  our  nurses,  our  doctors,  our  physical 
therapists and everyone else who works here, if we have a better functioning clinical system.   
 

These will increasingly need to be supported by data coming from our business intelligence, from 
our  finance  unit,  and  from  our  Quality  and  Safety  unit,  and  some  of  the  changes  that  we  will  be 
making in staffing in the coming years will be to support those executives who are running these 
clinical operations with the information to know whether the changes they are putting in place are 
in fact moving the meter or not.  I think that our team, from our Environmental Health Services to 
our most sophisticated medical professionals who are working there, are ready for this challenge.  
And as I hope Aaron Galeener will point out to you, we hope that our budget is putting our money 
where our mouth is, as it relates to those changes that the organization is going to have to make to 
become a competitive player in an increasingly complex environment. 
Mr. Galeener reviewed the presentation on the proposed CCHHS FY2015 Preliminary Budget. The Committee
reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Gugenheim offered a suggestion as to how the System refers to its income sources, relating to
uncompensated care and unfunded mandates. She stated that, when talking about uncompensated care and the
County’s Health allocation, the portions of the allocation that are used to fund the correctional obligations and
Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) should be separated out from the total cost of
uncompensated care, as those are mandated services. Acting Chairman Hammock clarified that, of the $164
million allocation, $71 million of that is mandated services, so what is left is under $100 million for
uncompensated care. Director Carvalho suggested that a subcategory could be placed under County Health Fund
Allocation showing two line items – one is allocation for CCDPH and correctional at $71 million, and the other is
allocation for uncompensated care at $93 million.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
B. Introduction of CCHHS FY2015 Preliminary Budget (continued)
In response to a question from Director Collens regarding how to translate $93 million for uncompensated care
into a metric to calculate what is being provided in services, Mr. Galeener stated that, it is often mentioned that
approximately $500 million in uncompensated care is provided per year, so that $93 million would go towards
offsetting some of that cost. Staff has the ability to look, for example, within the CareLink program, to see what
type of discounts that have been provided for services, to try to allocate some of that. He was unsure whether any
efforts had been made to specifically tie that to the $93 million, but he thought that is something that staff could
try to do. Acting Chairman Hammock stated that he supports that heartily. To Director Collens’ point, he
suggested that that one more line under expenses is needed, which is uncompensated care other than correctional
etc. - just like there are X number of people in CountyCare, there are X number of patients served in
uncompensated care that adds up to X total number. He stated that this would be a good challenge to try to
address during this fiscal year.
The Committee further discussed the following subjects: mail order pharmacy services; transition of some staff
from CCDPH to ACHN clinics relating to family planning and STD treatment services, for better coordination of
service delivery; and potential reductions in other revenue sources, such as disproportionate share payments
received, that may take place in future years.
Acting Chairman Hammock stated that one of his personal goals is that when the Board goes through the
preliminary budget process next year, that they will have a high-level three year projection. It is meant to be very
high-level and very directional, but he thinks that the System is at a point where this is needed for transparency
and good communication.
Acting Chairman Hammock noted that, for the sake of completeness, the County pays for the pension liability,
which is $57 million; therefore, the allocation is approximately $220 million. Director Collens added that,
similarly, the System does not yet have a comprehensive capital budget. He thought it is important that this is
developed, as there are substantial capital needs for this institution to provide the services. Under the current
accounting system, it is the County that is paying for that and it is not in the System’s budget. Acting Chairman
Hammock concurred, and added that this is another support from the County that is not fully reflected in the
budget; he stated that one of the goals in the next year is to reflect some of these things more completely.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved to recommend the proposed
CCHHS FY2015 Preliminary Budget to the full Board of Directors. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:

Health Plan, Inc., (IlliniCare) is contracted by to provide managed care administrative and c:

services to the CountyCare Health Plan.

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:

linical

Background. At the time of TPA contracting, CountyCare was operating under a CMS 1115 Waiver granted to the
State of Illinois to provide managed care services to newly eligible Affordable Care Act (ACA) Adults only. With the
expiration of the Waiver on June 30, 2014 and the transition of CountyCare to a full-fledged Medicaid managed care

health plan under its County Managed Care Community Network (County MCCN) agreement, CountyCare is
able to serve all Medicaid beneficiaries. This includes Seniors and Persons with Disabilities (SPDs) starting 0
September 1, 2014, Family Health Plan (FHP) members starting on October 1, 2014, as well as provide Med
defined Service Package 2 (SP2) benefits for all eligible members starting on September 1, 2014.

With this expanded population and services now available for CountyCare, proposes to execute an
amendment to the existing contract to meet these new requirements.

caid-

Proposed Amendment. This Amendment mirrors the structure of the existing agreement: including managed care
administrative and clinical support services, contracted clinical services, and clinical and pharmacy claims payment

pass through for the new FHP and SPD populations, with the exception of At-risk behavioral health services i
FHP and SPD populations.

Financial Request. No additional funding is requested.

or the

Reduction in Contract Term. This amendment proposes a reduction to the existing contract term from 60 months to
36 months, with the option for two 1-year extensions. Using projections, it is estimated that the originally

approved $1,795 million will be expended around month 33 of this new contract term, with a total 36-month 5
$1,960 million. The estimated additional $165 million is not requested at this time.

Impact. In total, the amount of funding retained by for its direct or contracted services is $402.1 milli
a decrease from the original contract?s $423.9 million Payments made to contracted netwo

providers and pharmacies for direct care provided to CountyCare members increases from $1,214 million (74.

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
During the March 2014 Board of Directors? meeting, the Board was informed that we were entering into a no
binding Letter of Intent (LOI) with the Medical Home Network (MHN) that defined the principles and framewc

The LOI memorialized ongoing discussions between and MHN on ways to further establish Countyl
a provider-centric health plan by building on the four-year experience of MHN and its participating providers
(including to reduce costs of caring for Medicaid beneficiaries by innovating models of care and ca
delivery. initial four~year experience was paid by philanthropic funds, and by the Illinois Healthcare a
Family Services (HFS). MHN data from this period illustrate a percent decrease in cost for participating
beneficiaries.

At its core, the proposed MHN ACO contract provides support for continuation of the innovative model put ir
place by the participating providers of MHN. Through a delegation model, participating providers in the MHN
network will be delegated by CountyCare to provide a defined scope of care coordination support to Countyl
members assigned to the MHN ACO network providers.

The request is for three of four funding categories in the contract as detailed in the table below. A fourth fun
category, Delivery System Reform Incentive Payments, are accounted for in the agreement pending funding

 Revenue Assumptions
Uncompensated Care Payments
– Disproportionate Share (DSH) payments and Benefits Improvement and
Protection Act (BIPA) payments assumed to remain flat compared to
FY14 at $293M.

Medicaid Fee-For-Service (FFS)
– As a result of the state shifting from a FFS model to a managed care
model, the budget will reflect a $122M
$
decline in Medicaid FFS revenue.
– FFS reimbursement is now limited to the application period prior to
member assignment to a managed care health plan and special
populations.

 Revenue Assumptions
p
CountyCare serves three Medicaid populations with
average monthly membership and reimbursement
rates
– ACA adult average monthly membership of 79,500 at $630 composite*
per member per month (pmpm)
– Family Health Plan (FHP) average monthly membership of 65,000 at
$250 composite* pmpm per enrolled family member
– Seniors and Persons with Disability (SPD) average monthly
membership of 4,700 at $1,571 composite* pmpm
– Actual pmpm rates vary by demographics, geography and category

FY15 CountyCare Projected Revenue

$915M

* Rates listed are reflective of the composite rates as calculated by the state actuary for the base medical package for 
each population. Additional rates apply for more medically complex members. Within each population, rates are adjusted 
for age, gender, complexity of case such as medically complex children, all deliveries, long term care support services, etc.

 Expenditure and Position Variances
Proposed FY15 budget increases by 9% compared to FY14 year-end estimate
•
•
•
•
•

Increase mainly due to increasing membership in CountyCare ($73M)
Additional costs allocated to mail-order pharmacy ($17M)
Increases in employee health benefits, malpractice premiums and property insurance ($14M)
Pharmaceutical supply and equipment increases ($14M)
Miscellaneous increases in supplies and services ($8M)

Proposed FY15 budget re-allocates existing costs and positions to improve cost allocation and
transparency
•
•
•

Decline in Health Administration expenses reflects realignment of pharmacy positions and supply
costs to Stroger, Provident and Cermak.
Decreased CountyCare positions reflect realignment of personnel to Ambulatory Services.
Decreased positions in Public Health reflects transition of services to Ambulatory Services to
improve coordination and service delivery.

Medicaid Expansion. Collectively, these entities provide primary, intermediate, acute,
and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to pay. The Bureau of
Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2012 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and Cook County Board Officials
collaborated to cut Medicaid costs, help county taxpayers, and transform Cook County’s
hospital system by jump-starting national health care reform in Cook County. In
November, 2012 the federal governmnent approved the 1115 Medicaid Waiver for Cook
County, allowing CCHHS to enroll more than 115,000 individuals who will be eligible
for Medicaid in 2014 into a Cook County network with no cost to the state of Illinois.
Medicaid Expansion allows the Cook County’s Health System to early enroll certain
uninsured patients into Medicaid. Specifically, these are patients who are not currently
eligible for Medicaid, but who will be eligible in 2014 under the Accountable Care Act.
Many of these individuals are patients who already are being treated by our system
without compensation. The Waiver is funded entirely by the federal government.

 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the seven months with overall
revenue of $761,413 and overall expenses was $782,441.
Net Patient revenue for the seven months was $632,986.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $3,672. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable
General
As compared to November 30, 2013, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
June-2014 increased by 8 to 113 days. Additionally, there was a 1 day decrease in this
figure, as compared to the previous month’s figure.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage, including the
Medicaid Expansion Program and MANG applications;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Total billed accounts grew by $25.764M (8.1%) as compared to the November-2013
balance. As compared to the previous month, this figure decreased by $7.549M (-2.1%).
The decline in this figure indicates an increasing number of accounts are completing the
collection process, which includes charity care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
6

 care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for Medicaid Expansion Program patients is
made through a per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of June-2014 increased by
$3.708M (43.8%), as compared the November 30, 2013 balance and increased by
$0.136M (1.1%), as compared to the previous month’s balance. This indicates that fewer
inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for Medicaid Expansion Program patients is
made through a per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of June-2014 increased by $23.232M (14.6%) as
compared to the November 30, 2013 balance. This figure fell by $5.042M (-2.7%)
compared to the previous month’s total.
The decrease in this number indicates more accounts had the collection process
completed than in the previous month and that a greater number of accounts are being
removed from active accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity
care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
up on the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for Medicaid Expansion Program patients is
made through a per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts increased by $3.340M (30.8%) by the end of
June-2014, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2013. This
balance was $0.758M (5.6%) larger than the previous month’s balance. This indicates
that fewer outpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the
previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
7
Page 101 of 131
Page 7 of 37

 Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of June-2014 increased by $2.532M
(1.6%), as compared to the balance as of November 30, 2013. This figure is $2.508M (1.5%) less than last month’s figure.
The decline in this figure indicates that more Out-Patient accounts had their collection
and write-off related activities completed, as compared to the prior month.
The reduction of internal bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a growth in
the billed accounts receivable.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

 For the current fiscal year, Nonoperating revenues allocated to CCHHS are Cigarette
Tax, Other Tobacco products and Firearms Tax. There is no Sales Tax allocated to
CCHHS for the current fiscal year.

Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

The OFHC FFS budget has been combined with the SHCC FFS budget due to the configuration of CCHHS system that treats OFHC as a SHCC clinic.

Beginning March-2014, the capitation for the Medicaid Expansion program is paid at 100% instead of 50%.
Vendor Payments From Revenue are payments out of revenue posted by the County Comptroller. Pharmacy Billing and Revenue Enhancement
payments are reductions to Medicaid revenue. Collection Agency payments are reductions to Self-Pay (Other) revenue. Physician Billing
payments include refunds processed by CCHHS. Included in the "Revenue Enhancement" totals are payments to the state for supplemental
workers hired to help process CountyCare and MANG applications.
The Meaningful Use budget was spread over 12 months, as it was not known at the time the budget was created in which month this payment
will be received. Meaningful Use includes both the Medicare and Medicaid portions. The Meaningful Use payment is detailed as follows:
Jun-14
Meaningful Use - Medicare $
