November 8, 2013

The Honorable John P. Daley

Chairman, Cook County Board of Commissioners
Finance Committee 

118 N. Clark, Floor 3M

Chicago, IL 60602

Dear Chairman Daley:

This is a response to your recent request for information regarding Items 13-1938 and 13-1961, on

the Finance Agenda for November 13, 2013.

1. Regarding the existing $200 Million line of credit, what is the total amount that has been
borrowed against it since its establishment, and what is the current amount of debt outstanding,

if any?

The County Board previously authorized the Chief Financial Officer to draw up to $75 Million
in aggregate. To date the County has drawn $46 Million, during FY 2011, to pay for the Young
lawsuit settlement filed on behalf of a class of inmates at the County correctional-facility.

Strong budget to actual performance in the General Fund has allowed the County to pay off the
entire drawn balance in FY2012 and FY2013. The current drawn balance is zero.

2. What impact will recent downgrades by national rating agencies have on the cost of

re?nancing any of the County?s current obligations?

DeSpite the Moody?s action this summer, the County?s current general obligation bond ratings

remain strong at:
Moody?s: A1 (negative outlook)
AA (stable Outlook)
Fitch: AA- (negative outlook)

However, as you have noted, several local governmental entities have been downgraded by
national rating agencies since August 2013, with the County specifically suffering a downgrade
by Moody?s from Aa3 to A1. The table below depicts the local rating actions that have

Unfortunately, the cumulative effect of these downgrades of local area issuers will negatively impact the bond
market?s view of the County credit quality, as they will look at the ratings of the County and the underlying
jurisdictions with which we share a tax base, as well as the State of Illinois. Based on our analysis of the market, the
downgrade of the County itself 1s eStimated to have an impact of approximately 0.35% or roughly $350, 000 annually
per $100 million issued on the proposed 2013A and 2014 refunding. As the likely refunding candidates are
approximately $200 million in aggregate, the increased cost is anticipated to lead to a combined reduction in annual
savings of roughly $700,000 or reduced net present value savings of approximately $3 Million. I would note
however, that this impact is market dependent and a re?ection of current market conditions.

Despite the increased credit spread the County will experience in the market, the refinancings are projected to
generate a cembined net present value savings in excess of $12 Million, taken over multiple years, as we replace
5.25% and 5.00% coupons with anticipated yields below 

3. Please summarize the County ?3 policy regarding the use of proceeds from bonds, lines of credit, or other debt
instruments, to pay for operating costs.

The County policy regarding the use of proceeds from debt instruments is derived from applicable governing IRS
regulations, Illinois statutes, Cook County?s Code and Government Finance Officers Association?s best practices Any
capital project or equipment funded through the issuance of bonds is financed for a weighted average period not to
exceed the life of the project or equipment. If an asset can be depreciated in accordance with government accounting
principles, then the County will consider financing from the issuance of tax exempt bonds. This policy is further
discussed' 1n the County? 3 Financial Policies Tab of Volume One of the Executive Budget Recommendation.

Current County policy does not allow for the issuance of bonds to pay for operating costs. In FY2012, the County
discontinued the practice of issuing taxable bonds, which generally are bonds issued for assets that cannot be
depreciated such as judgments or settlements. The County has encountered several large judgments In FY 2011?2013
and has maintained this policy. As an alternative, instead of issuing bonds with a longer repayment schedule,
significant unforeseen costs of this nature could be paid for from the line of credit and repaid by the final maturity of
November 30, 2015.

As mentioned previously, the County paid $46 Million for the Young lawsuit settlement in FY2011 through its
existing line of credit. The line of credit allows us to have ?exibility to repay those costs in a rapid manner as
financial conditions warrant, as demonstrated by the full payoff of the drawn amount associated with the 'Young
lawsuit in early FY2013. We expect to draw another $10.5 Million by the end of FY2013 to pay for investments that
we will seek to repay prior to November 30, 2015 when the line expires, and more rapidly if budget to actual
performance allows during FY2014. Specifically the $10.5 millionof costs are associated with the real estate asset
strategic realignment project and the mainframe migration project.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if an item in the answers above requires additional
clarification. We thank you for your inquiries and look forward to responding rapidly to any further matters that may
arise. -

Sincerely,
