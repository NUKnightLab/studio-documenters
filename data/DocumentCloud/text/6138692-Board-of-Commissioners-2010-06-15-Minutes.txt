PROPOSED REAPPOINTMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 9, 2010 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
Please be advised that I hereby reappoint Mr. Joseph Ford to the South Stickney Sanitary District for a

I submit this communication for your approval.
_________________________
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the reappointment by the

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Chicago/Cook County is the capital of the hockey world as the home of the 2010 Stanley
Cup Champion Chicago Blackhawks; and
WHEREAS, all of Chicago, Cook County, Illinois and Blackhawks fans around the world are joining in
the celebration the 2010 Stanley Cup Hockey Champions; and

2

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2010
WHEREAS, the Stanley Cup Champion Chicago Blackhawks an “Original Six” team were able to add
the team’s fourth Stanley Cup to the Blackhawks trophy case after wins in 1934, 1938, 1961 and two
three valiant tries by the 1971, 1973 and 1992 teams; and
WHEREAS, although they faced a challenge this year in being a young team, the high energy, speed and
focus of the Stanley Cup Champions more than compensated and at times over the course of their 103game season they even made the game look easy; and
WHEREAS, led by Coach Joel Quenneville each player dug deep to give his best performance, as they
approached the limits of their capabilities; and
WHEREAS, in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Blackhawks embodied ferocity and fierceness through four
tough and challenging playoff series; leaving the Nashville Predators, Vancouver Canucks and San Jose
Sharks in their wake; and
WHEREAS, this was exemplified by Duncan Keith who, in Game Four of the Western Conference
Finals against San Jose, lost seven teeth, got treatment in the locker room and came back in the period to
play a pivotal role in that decisive game; and
WHEREAS, the talent and toughness of the Stanley Cup Champions was brought to bear in the six game
Stanley Cup Final against the Philadelphia Flyers; and
WHEREAS, Game One was a wild affair with two goals from Troy Brouwer, and goals each from Dave
Bolland and Patrick Sharp, Tomas Kopecky, Kris Versteeg and the Tomas Kopecky game winner all
leading to a 6-5 Blackhawks win; and
WHEREAS, Game Two was a closely fought 2-1 contest which put the Blackhawks up two games to
none. The game featured big hits, goals from Marian Hossa and Ben Eager and incredible goaltending
from Antti Niemi; and
WHEREAS, Games Three and Four were bumps in the road to the Cup with the Blackhawks coming
close to doing what they had not done since 1996 win in Philadelphia. After goals from Duncan Keith,
Brent Sopel and Patrick Kane gave the Hawks a 3-2 lead, it would take overtime for the Flyers to finally
overcome the talent of the Hawks in Game Three; and
WHEREAS, in Game Four, the Blackhawks would use goals from Patrick Sharp, Dave Bolland and
Brian Campbell to fight back all night, and with time running down, pulled within a goal of sending the
game to overtime before an empty-net goal would give Philadelphia a 5-3 win; and
WHEREAS, Coach Quenneville would employ a “shifting lines” strategy in the 3rd period of Game Four
which would lead to a powerful Game Five 7-4 Blackhawks victory in Chicago. Goals from Brent
Seabrook, Dave Bolland, Kris Versteeg, Patrick Kane, Patrick Sharp and two goals from Dustin
Byfuglien would pull the Hawks within one win of a 49 year old dream; and
WHEREAS, Game Six in Philadelphia would go the distance and a little more as the Blackhawks would
control the game for most of the night while the Flyers desperately fought to stay alive. Goals from
Dustin Byfuglien, Patrick Sharp and Andrew Ladd gave the Hawks the lead until the Flyers tied the game
in the closing minutes; and

3

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2010
WHEREAS, 4 minutes and 6 seconds into the sudden death overtime period, Patrick Kane fired a shot
that the Flyers’ goalie could not stop, and as the Flyers and their fans stood in stunned confusion Kane
lead his teammates in a length-of-the-ice celebration of the return of Lord Stanley’s Cup to Chicago; and
WHEREAS, the goalie, Antti Niemi had a phenomenal post-season, especially for having never played
in a NHL playoff series; and
WHEREAS, all the members of the active roster deserve recognition for their talents including: Kyle
Beach, Bryan Bickell, Nick Boynton, Adam Burish, Brian Connelly, Corey Crawford, Jassen Cullimore,
Jake Dowell, Colin Fraser, Jordan Hendry, Niklas Hjalmarsson, Cristobal Huet, Kim Johnson, Shawn
Lalonde, John Madden, Danny Richmond, Jack Skille, Hannu Toivonen and Conn Smythe Most Valuable
Player trophy winner Captain Jonathan Toews; and
WHEREAS, we salute the Blackhawks’ second-generation owner, Rocky Wirtz, Team President John
McDonough, General Manager Stan Bowman, former General Manager Dale Tallon Senior Vice
President of Business Operations Jay Blunk and all the front office staff for their efforts to build a Stanley
Cup Champion in Chicago; and
WHEREAS, these games and these plays will live on in the memories of fans for years to come, as will
the sound of “Chelsea Dagger” when the lamp is lit; and
WHEREAS, just as the Blackhawks salute their fans after every game, we salute you, who have brought
us this high honor.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Members of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners do hereby congratulate the Chicago Blackhawks on their 2010 Stanley Cup
Championship, and do express our pride and joy upon this auspicious occasion.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE INSTALLATION OF BLUE HOSPITALITY SIGNS
ALONG THE ENTIRE ILLINOIS STATE TOLL HIGHWAY AUTHORITY SYSTEM
WHEREAS, many states across the nation use hospitality logo signage throughout their entire highway
and tollway systems to aid motorists and the travel industry; and
WHEREAS, the installation of blue hospitality logo signs along the entire Illinois State Toll Highway
Authority (ISTHA) system is important to the travel industry, and will provide vital information for
travelers using all ISTHA and Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) routes, including places to
stay overnight, rest, visit, recreate, dine and provide services for vehicles; and
WHEREAS, these newly installed logo signs on the Illinois State Toll Highway system will be located
not to compete directly with the restaurants and/or service stations located within the Oasis system; and
WHEREAS, routine stops made by travelers provide an important economic benefit and generate
revenue for the entire Chicagoland region and those communities that border the highway and tollway
system while providing needed tax revenues for the State of Illinois; and
WHEREAS, the installation of these logo signs will create important economic development
opportunities and hopefully eliminate the further erosion and closure of many restaurants and hotels along
the Illinois State Toll Highway system, and keep those businesses viably operational; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners in tandem with the Southwest Conference of
Mayors, the South Suburban Mayors and Managers Association, the Chicago Southland Convention and
9

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2010

Toll Highway Authority, the Illinois Department of Transportation, and the Illinois State Toll Highway
Authority (ISTHA) to make any and all necessary engineering adjustment, to exhibit flexibility and
eliminate and or relax current state and or federal restrictive regulations which currently prohibit logo
signage installation, and move aggressively forward to install blue logo signs for lodging, restaurants,
service stations and regional attractions, along and throughout the entire highway and tollway system; and
WHEREAS, the challenging economic climate the State of Illinois now faces mandates action to enhance
the growth and viability of the travel industry in Illinois.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners do hereby
support the proposal for the installation of lodging, restaurant, service station and attraction logo signs at
various locations along the entire Illinois State Toll Highway Authority system and support the
legislative, administrative and engineering action necessary to ensure the installation of these needed logo
signs.

RESOLUTION CONCERNING BOYCOTT OF ARIZONA AND ARIZONABASED BUSINESSES (PROPOSED SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION). Submitting a
Proposed Substitute Resolution sponsored by Edwin Reyes, Joseph Mario Moreno and
Joan Patricia Murphy, County Commissioners; Co-Sponsored by Earlean Collins and
Larry Suffredin, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION CONCERNING BOYCOTT OF ARIZONA
AND ARIZONA-BASED BUSINESSES
WHEREAS, the State of Arizona adopted a controversial new law, SB 1070, which makes
it a state-level crime for someone to be in the country illegally and criminalizes the failure
to carry immigration documents at all times by lawful foreign residents or otherwise
hereinafter referred to as the “Arizona Immigration Law”; and
WHEREAS, since SB 1070 was signed into law, the Arizona Legislature has passed HB
2162, making amendments to the Arizona Immigration Law which are an improvement,
but far from ideal; and
WHEREAS, the Arizona Immigration Law imposes a requirement for police officers to
question those they suspect may be in the United States illegally when they are lawfully in
contact with such people while enforcing any other law; and
WHEREAS, the Arizona Immigration Law has been rebuked by the nation’s top law
enforcement community, which found that local police enforcement of immigration laws
would likely lead to racial profiling and have a negative effect and undermine the level of
trust and cooperation between local police and immigrant communities; and
WHEREAS, the recent amendments to the Arizona Immigration Law try to eliminate
60

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2010
racial profiling by no longer allowing race, color or national origin as a factor to be
considered when forming a reasonable suspicion that a person is in the United States
illegally; and
WHEREAS, while removing race, color or national origin as a factor to be considered is a
good idea, the problem is the law now contains no guidance or definition of what criteria
should be used to form a reasonable suspicion that a person is in the United States illegally,
which can still lead to racial profiling; and
WHEREAS, the State of Arizona has charted an ominous legal course that puts extremist
politics before public safety, and betrays our most deeply-held American values; and
WHEREAS, as it did two decades ago when the State of Arizona refused to observe Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, the State of Arizona has again chosen to isolate itself from
the rest of the United States of America; and
WHEREAS, the most appropriate response, by the taxpayers of Cook County to the State
of Arizona, is to assure that the State of Arizona’s isolation is tangible rather than
symbolic.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that this Board of Commissioners hereby finds the Arizona Immigration
Law to be offensive to the values of the taxpayers of Cook County; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that this
Board of Commissioners hereby boycotts the State of Arizona and Arizona-based
businesses until the Arizona Immigration Law is repealed or invalidated; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
County will not enter into any contracts with the State of Arizona or with any companies
headquartered in the State of Arizona nor shall the County renew any current contracts
with the State of Arizona or with companies headquartered in the State of Arizona when
they expire; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
County will not participate in any conventions or other business which requires County
resources to be spent in the State of Arizona; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that this
Board of Commissioners hereby requests the Illinois General Assembly and the Governor
of the State of Illinois to adopt a similar resolution calling for the boycott of the State of
Arizona and Arizona-based businesses until the Arizona Immigration Law is repealed or

PRODUCTION OF THE HUMAN RESOURCE ACTIVITY REPORT. Transmitting
a Communication, dated May 14, 2010 from Joe Sova, Chief, Bureau of Human
Resources:
Comptroller Connie Kravitz and I have discussed how best to produce the Human
Resource Activity report as outlined in New Item #5 approved by the Board of
Commissioners on May 4, 2010. She and I will be conducting a meeting next week with
key members of our staffs as well as Nathan Paige of the Department for Management of
Information Systems to determine the most efficient process to determine an accurate and
timely Human Resource Activity report on an ongoing basis.
The Comptroller currently produces a quarterly report that is sent to the Board but the
report is limited to hires and terminations. Connie and I are committed to producing the
new Human Resource Activity Report but I respectfully request an extension of a couple
weeks for us to discuss how best we can leverage current database systems that will
capture all activity for the Grades 17 thru 24 executive, administrative, and professional
employees across all of Cook County.
Secondly, I would like your perspective on whether producing the report on a less frequent
basis (as opposed to generating it within seventy-two (72) hours of a change) would be
acceptable.

PRODUCTION OF CONTRACT PAYMENTS REPORT, AND HUMAN
RESOURCE ACTIVITY REPORT. Transmitting a Communication, dated May 17,
2010 from Constance Kravitz, County Comptroller:
New Item No. 4 (Ordinance No. 10-O-23) and New Item No. 5 (Ordinance No. 10-O-24)
approved by the Cook County Board of Commissioners on May 4, 2010 requires the
Comptroller to provide the County Board with specific information and reports regarding
contract payments and salary data in a specific time frame.

64

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2010
Status of Ordinance No. 10-O-23
Pursuant to Ordinance No. 10-O-23, the Cook County Comptroller is responsible for
providing to the Cook County Board of Commissioners various payment reports within 72
hours of any payments involving an expenditure of less than $100,000 that was approved
by the Purchasing Agent and of payments made pursuant to contracts for professional and
managerial services for Cook County, including the separately Elected Officials, which
involve an expenditure of less than $25,000 that were approved by the Purchasing Agent.
The Comptroller has been diligently working with the Comptroller’s Accounts Payable
Department (A/P) and the Department for Management of Information Systems (MIS) to
produce an accurate and timely payment report. While the specific data related to contract
payments is generally included in our JD Edwards System, there is limited ability to pull a
canned report such as a check registry report. Additionally, the report that is extracted is
not in a sortable format and written duplications may occur when a Purchase Order (PO)
has multiple lines. The Office of the Comptroller has been working with MIS to create a
special report that would address such issues.
Once these reporting issues are resolved, it is projected that the Comptroller’s Office will
be able to issue such reports within the 72 hour timeframe. The Office of the Comptroller
prints checks weekly, on Thursdays and as a result, it is anticipated that the report pursuant
to Ordinance 10-O-23 would then be available the following Monday or Tuesday.
It is anticipated that the reporting issue as it relates to Ordinance 10-O-23 will be resolved
in a timely manner; however; the parities will need additional time, approximately a couple
of weeks to derive a useful report that will meet all the Ordinance requirements.
Status of Ordinance No. 10-O-24
Pursuant to Ordinance No. 10-O-24, the Cook County Comptroller in partnership with the
Chief of Human Resources is required to make detailed specific Human Resource Activity
Reports as outlined in the Ordinance.
I have been working with the Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources and the Director of
MIS to determine the most efficient process to determine an accurate and timely Human
Resource Activity Report. The applicable parties are meeting to determine how each of
the parties database systems capture employee information and whether a new report
should be created to address the human resource activity information requested by the
Cook County Board of Commissioners pursuant to Ordinance No. 10-O-24.
The Office of the Comptroller will continue to work with MIS and the Bureau of Human
Resources to create a special report that would address and report the information
requested under Ordinance No. 10-O-24.
It is anticipated that the reporting issue as it relates to Ordinance 10-O-24 will be resolved
in a timely manner; however; the parities will need additional time, approximately a couple
of weeks to derive a useful report that will meet all the Ordinance requirements.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2010

requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $29,800.00 from Account
529-521, Institutional Equipment to Account 529-549, Vehicle Purchase for the procurement of two
trucks that were previously approved by the Board of Commissioners.
Reason:

Additional funds are needed to purchase the previously approved trucks. The original
estimated cost of $85,000.00 was for gasoline engine trucks, however, upon further review of
the dimensions and specifications we realized that the trucks are much smaller and do not
provide access to a standard dock. As a result, we are reverting to purchasing the type of
trucks we are replacing due to high mileage and high maintenance that meet our needs.

1.

Vehicle Purchase

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On May 13, 2010 it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations. At that time, the balance in the account was $85,000.00 and 30
days prior to that it was $85,000.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 521-Institutional Equipment was identified as the source of the transferred funds as the
account was budgeted for the purchase of various equipment that will be needed for the moving
of the Record Center from 2323 South Rockwell to the Hawthorne Warehouse, which is no longer
anticipated to take place in FY 2010, hence, the availability of funds for transfer.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 529-521 Account.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Account 521-Institutional Equipment was budgeted for the purchase of various equipment that will
be needed for the moving of the Record Center from 2323 South Rockwell to the Hawthorne
Warehouse. The move to the Hawthorne Warehouse is currently behind schedule due to funding
issues encountered by the Bureau of Capital Planning and Facilities Management. Hence, the
availability of funds for transfer in FY 2010. However, we will be requesting funds in FY 2011 to
complete the move to the Hawthorne Warehouse.

COOK COUNTY WORKS
PROPOSED GRANT AWARD
Transmitting a Communication from
BRENDOLYN HART GLOVER, Field Operations Manager, President’s Office of Employment Training
requesting authorization to accept a grant in the amount of $266,921.00 from the Illinois Department of
Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) for additional Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Title I
funds. These funds represent an incentive grant awarded for exceeding WIA performance
measures during Program Year 2008 (July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009). The State of Illinois has
awarded incentive funds to the President’s Office of Employment Training (POET) consistently over the
last nine (9) consecutive years as a result of the department exceeding planned performance goals. All
funds will be spent on direct training activities.
The authorization to accept the previous grant was given on July 21, 2009 in the amount of $293,059.00
by the Cook County Board of Commissioners.
I respectfully request approval of the funds, and request that the Chief Administrative Officer of the

requesting authorization to accept revised funding in the amount of $13,496.655.00 from the Illinois
Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO), Springfield, Illinois, for Workforce
Investment Act (WIA) services.
The authorization to accept the original PY'09 WIA formula grant funds in the amount of $15,845,920.00
for Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Title I services was given on March 2, 2010 by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners. The revised allocation, $13,496,655.00 reflects a decrease of $2,349,265.00 due
to the decision of DCEO to re-allocate funding based on a reporting error. At this time POET is waiting
for an administrative hearing to protest this action.
I respectfully request approval of the funds, and request that the Chief Administrative Officer of the

OFFICE OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER (IN ACTIVE)
TRANSFER OF FUNDS

Transmitting a Communication, dated May 13, 2010 from

ABISHI C. CUNNINGHAM, JR., Public Defender
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $16,000.00 from Account
260-353, Books, Periodicals, Publications, Archives and Data Services to Account 260-444, Maintenance
and Repair of Automotive Equipment for maintenance of Cook County owned vehicles.
Reason:

The transfer is needed because we require maintenance for our aging fleet. This account was
originally budgeted for $15,000.00. In error, $3,500.00 of FY2009 expense was encumbered
against FY2010 which in effect, reduced the budget to $11,500.00. Most of this was then
used for maintenance on four automobiles. There are eight other older autos that have been
taken in for estimates. The estimates came in at a total of approximately $10,000.00. In
addition, we are asking our drivers to be more diligent about oil changes and expect this
expense to run approximately $3,000.00 for all of our autos. Therefore, I am requesting a
transfer of $16,000.00 to cover the cost of repairs to eight of our vehicles, oil changes and a
small amount for any other issues that may arise. We did not anticipate requiring this much
maintenance when we originally budgeted for this item.

1. On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds in
order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what was
the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On May 12, 2010, it became apparent that the Maintenance and Repair of Automotive Equipment
Account 260-444 would require an infusion of funds in order to meet outstanding obligations. At this
time, the balance in the account was $1,107.40. The balance 30 days prior was $1,107.40.
2. How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts that
were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 260-353 was identified as the source of transferred funds because early in FY2010, this
office received approximately $16,000.00 in credits from one of our vendors. The credits were for
adjustments to our account stemming from 2008 activity. The $16,000.00 is over what we placed in
the budget for this item and we do not anticipate needing these additional dollars. No other accounts
were considered.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

When this office completed the budget for FY2010 we anticipated requiring the same budget dollars as
FY2009. This office received approximately $16,000.00 in refund checks in early FY2010 for this
account which we do not anticipate a need for. Also, at the end of FY2009, there was a positive variance
in this account and we do not anticipate requiring more budget dollars than we actually spent in 2009.

REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT DIVISION
APPROVAL OF SALE OF EXCESS LAND
107

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 15, 2010

Transmitting a Communication, dated May 17, 2010 from
RAYMOND MULDOON, Director, Real Estate Management Division
On February 1, 2005, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County declared as excess and released for
sale an irregular shaped parcel of vacant land, being an area of approximately + 101,302 square feet.
(2.3256 acres) located northwest of the intersection of Mannheim Road and Frontage Road and directly
north of Interstate 290 (Eisenhower Expressway), in Hillside, Proviso Township, Cook County, Illinois.
The property was advertised for bid on December 18, 2005; however, no bids were received.
The adjoining landowner, Allied Waste Transportation, Inc. (“Allied“), has now indicated its interest in
acquiring this land to make improvements in front of its property that will both buffer the site and
improve the overall appearance. Allied has agreed to pay the fair market value of the parcel, determined
by appraisal to be $725,000.00.
Recommend approval of sale to Allied Waste Transportation, Inc. and authorization for the President of
the Board or the Director of the Real Estate Management Division to execute and deliver a quit claim
deed in exchange for a certified check in the amount of $725,000.00, and authorization for the Director of
the Real Estate Management Division to execute any and all documents and take all actions necessary to
effectuate the conveyances described herein, in a timely manner and in accordance with customary terms
and conditions.
Since Federal funds were used for right-of-way acquisition at this location with a 90/10 funding split
between Federal and County funding, 90% of the sale proceeds must be deposited into the Highway
Motor Fuel Tax fund.
Approval is recommended.

Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the request of the Director of

requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $23,675.00 from Account
007-260, Professional and Managerial Services to Account 007-240, Printing and Publishing to process
vehicle license application production associated with the Cook County Wheel Tax Ordinance.
Reason:

Due to time limitation and the labor intensive nature of the Vehicle License project, we are
compelled to look to outside sources to implement and expedite the process of renewal
application production. By improving our vehicle license application process for FY2010,
we will save over $10,000.00 on our postage and produce an improved application design.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On May 4, 2010, it became apparent that an infusion of funds, into the receiving account, would be
needed to meet current obligations. The balance in the account on May 4, 2010 was
$23,952.00 and 30 days prior it was approximately $47,382.00. Other budgeted expenditures were
paid out of this account.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The account was identified based on the department's reduction of anticipated usage. There were
no other accounts considered.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 520830.
There will be no other direct impact to other areas.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The Professional Services account was budgeted for temporary services for assistance of clerical
support. Though, the department reduced the need by reviewing internal staffing functions, reassignments and improved business processes.
The receiving account is the most appropriate budgetary account for this type of vehicle license
expenditure which relates to the production process of printing vehicle license applications.
Additionally, our initial funding request for Printing and Publishing was reduced, thus resulting in
an unexpected shortfall in this account. Most importantly, the Wheel Tax Ordinance generates
approximately $2 million in revenue per year and we are working towards improving on our
compliance efforts as well to improve our revenue stream.
