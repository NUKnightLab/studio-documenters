Fieldhouse and Mr. Greathouse responded that, upon completion, the total project will have been
approximately $7 million.
Mr. Greathouse also noted that the fire alarm system update is seventy percent complete with 27

with zone testing to be complete September 20, 2019.
Ms. Nunnally then provided an update on the Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse Transformation Project
and the inclusion reports contained in the Board materials. Ms. Nunnally first addressed the
exterior work noting that the jersey barriers on the sidewalk have been removed to permit the
pouring of the new concrete sidewalks. Also, precast planters and seating will be installed with
the replacement of approximately twelve trees in the sidewalk next week. Also, the light poles are
being repainted and new trash cans will be placed around the Fieldhouse exterior to complete the
exterior finishes. Ms. Nunnaly then suggested that Mr. Bonavita provide a quick update on the
status of the interior renovations. Mr. Bonavita stated that September 23, 2019 is the date that they
will officially be bringing the team members back to the Fieldhouse and in the interim there will
be a substantial amount of dust cleanup and confirmation that all systems are operational. Mr.
Bonavita thanked the entire Gateway team for keeping such a large project moving in a timely
manner towards completion.
In the interests of time, Ms. Nunnally then referred the Board members to the diversity and
inclusion summary reports in the Board materials and briefly stated that all the numbers are at or
over the diversity and inclusion goals set by the Board. Ms. Nunnally noted that she will be
preparing a final report upon completion of the project.
Mr. Greathouse then provided an update on the $4.227 million escalator major capital project at
the Ballpark. He indicated that the down payment under the contract with Schindler has been
made and the shop drawings are done. The shipment date is set for September with completion of
the project in March 2020 before the start of the next baseball season. Mr. Weiss then made a first
reading presentation for a major capital replacement of the Ballpark Building Automation System.
Mr. Weiss advised the Board that the BAS is the nerve center of the Ballpark providing automatic
control for the HVAC and lighting systems. He circulated materials to the Board regarding the
current BAS which was installed in 1994 when the Ballpark was originally built and noted that the
Facility Conditions Assessment recommended replacement of the BAS in 2018 and that, due to
the age of the current system, no new software upgrades are even available for the current system
which fails and requires a system reboot approximately four times a week. Mr. Weiss intends to
begin working with the Gateway staff and consultants and present the BAS replacement for major
capital consideration at the November Board meeting. Mr. Silliman then explained the first
reading/second reading protocol to those in attendance who were unfamiliar with the Gateway
protocol for consideration of major capital funding requests. Mr. Silliman then asked Mr. Weiss
if he has an idea of the likely cost for the BAS replacement. Mr. Weiss stated that it would only
be an educated guess at this time but probably north of $2 million. Mr. Silliman then asked Mr.
Weiss the current status of the Indians’ unreimbursed major capital expenditures at the Ballpark
and Mr. Weiss indicated that there is currently about $5 million in major capital expenditures that

 the Board has approved and the Indians have advanced/funded, not including the escalators
replacement currently being conducted. Mr. Silliman then sought a Board vote on whether to
approve Gateway staff proceeding with the Indians on investigating the BAS system replacement
on the first reading. Upon motion by Mr. Silliman, Mr. Carroll seconded and the Board
unanimously approved proceeding.
Next, the financial reports were given by Mr. Kelly. He first reviewed the operating account for
the month ended August 30, 2019 and reported a cash beginning balance of $352,635, total receipts
of $258,859, and total disbursements of $211,670 for a month-end balance of $379,824. He then
