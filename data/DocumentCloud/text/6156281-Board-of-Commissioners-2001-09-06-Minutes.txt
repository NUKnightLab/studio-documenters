DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM

Transmitting a Communication, dated August 15, 2001 from
GWENDOLYN D. CLEMONS, Director, Department of Planning and Development
Re:

HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME Program)

respectfully requests approval of a HOME Investment Partnerships Program Loan Restructuring for fiftynine HOME Program financed Community Integrated Living Arrangement (CILA) Group Home loans to
Cicero, Illinois based not-for-profit Seguin Services, Inc. The fifty-nine properties contain approximately
182 disabled persons and are scattered throughout the Western Planning region of the County. Financing
of the fifty-nine homes took place between November 1993 and December 1999 with interest rates
ranging from 3 to 1.5 percent. The request seeks to reduce those interest rates to the current Home
Program lending rate of 1 percent.
The original repayment terms for the properties range from twenty to forty years with final payments due
between July 2008 and August 2038. The loan restructuring will keep those terms intact. Annually, the
fifty-nine properties generate $202,080.00, in loan repayments. However, the modification will reduce
the program income generated by $32,304.00 or $169,776.00 annually. This will result in a $700,000.00
savings to the agency over the life of the loans.
I respectfully request approval of this request, and that the Chief Administrative Officer of the County of
Cook, or his designee, be authorized to execute for the County, any and all documents necessary to
further the request approved herein, including but not limited to modification to the original 59 HOME
Loan Agreements, Notes and Mortgages. The approval of this request by this Honorable Body will
permit staff to issue the necessary documents to move this loan restructuring forward.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant funds: None.
Commissioner Carr, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved that the request of the Director of the
Department of Planning and Development be approved. The motion carried unanimously.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 6, 200 I

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Redistricting of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice
on Thursday, August 23, 2001, at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County
Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
At the request of the Chairman, the Notice of the Meeting was read into the record by the Secretary of the
Board of Commissioners.
Chainnan Lechowicz noted that all Members of the County Board were in attendance. Chairman
Lechowicz expressed his condolences and those of all Members of the Board to Commissioner Sims on
the loss of her mother and thanked her for her commitment in attending the Committee meeting at a time
of great personal loss. A moment of silent prayer was observed in memory of Commissioner Sims'
mother.
Chairman Lechowicz stated that a series of nine public hearings had been held throughout the County for
the purpose of gathering public input and soliciting proposals and ideas. He thanked all those who took
the time to appear at such hearings to express their ideas and views. He also thanked Vice-Chairman Carr
and the Members of the Committee for participating in the hearing process. In addition, he thanked the
members of the redistricting staff, led by Peter Creticos of the Center for Governmental Studies of
Northern Illinois University, for all of their hard work. Chainnan Lechowicz recognized and thanked
staff members Amy Krause, Amanda Furman, Sharonda Washington, and Ricardo Cruz.
Chairman Lechowicz thanked Kimball W. Brace of Election Data Services, Inc., for his invaluable
assistance with software, hardware, technical support, and consulting.
Chairman Lechowicz stated that the task of redistricting had been undertaken with one fundamental goal -fairness and that the Committee had endeavored to be fair to everyone, both in terms of opportunity for
input into the process and access to computer technology and data necessary to meaningfully understand
and participate in the process.
Chairman Lechowicz thanked the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund
["MALDEF"], the United States Hispanic Leadership Institute ["USHLI"], and the Latino Committee of
Illinois for Fair Redistricting for taking the time and effort to submit a redistricting plan. He assured that
the population percentages proposed by these groups for two super-majority Hispanic districts and a third
Hispanic community of interest district had been a substantial factor in guiding deliberations, while not
elevating ethnic origin or race above other factors which must be considered. Chairman Lechowicz
pointed out that the Chicago Tribune in its front-page story on Sunday, August 12, 200 I, had noted that
census data indicates that the suburbs have become a "hot destination" for people of all races. It was with
this in mind that a suburban Hispanic community of interest district had been proposed.
Chainnan Lechowicz thanked Vice-Chainnan Carr for all of his help and for his fairness.
Finally, Chairman Lechowicz stated that the staff proposal to be presented is fair to everyone, complies
with one man-one vote principles and federal and State constitutional guidelines, and takes into account
incumbent members, existing districts, communities of interest, and existing political dynamics.
The Chair then recognized President Stroger and noted that he had been a strong supporter of the concept
of single-member districts. President Stroger thanked the Committee for its hard work and expressed the
view that those involved had done an excellent job and had been very unselfish in developing the
proposed lines.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 6, 2001

Chaimrnn Lechowicz again thanked the Committee members for their outstanding part1c1pation
throughout the course of the nine public hearings. He also noted that the Redistricting Office at 69 West
Washington Street, Room 141 8, had been available to the public on a daily basis.
Commissioner Steele noted that a private citizen from the 2nd County Board District, Christopher Smith,
had utilized the Redistricting Office facilities to develop a map and thanked Mr. Smith for participating in
the process. Chaimrnn Lechowicz stated that such map had been received and would be made part of the
record.
The Chair recognized Commissioner Hansen on a point of infonnation. Commissioner Hansen asked
whether, in light of the present unavailability of citizenship data in connection with the current census,
comparative data on citizenship versus population was available from the 1990 census. Peter Creticos
responded that such data had been compiled and that copies would be furnished to all members of the
Board.
The Chair then called upon Peter Creticos for a presentation on Staff Proposal # 1. Mr. Creticos described
the process by which Staff Proposal # 1 was developed:
Based on the year 2000 census data, the central core of the City of Chicago (primarily the
African-American districts starting on the west side of the City of Chicago and extending
to the south side of the City and into the south suburbs) were low relative to the ideal
population. The ideal population is 316,279 people per district.
For the prior ( 1993) district map, the ideal population was slightly over 300,000
(specifically, 300,298), based on the 1990 census data. As a result, even if a district
drawn in I 993 stood still in tenns of population, it would automatically be short of ideal
population by more than five percent. In other words, it would be short by approximately
16,000 people because it did not grow as fast as the rest of the County.
The process of structuring the map started with Navy Pier, at the geographic north-south
center of the County. The proposed map attempts to equalize the change in districts to
the north of Navy Pier and those to the south of Navy Pier, so that no one particular part
of the County, no one district, no one community of interest, no one racial group, or no
one ethnic group would bear the brunt of the entire change in population demographics.
With these goals, we looked to Commissioner Butler's District. This district, previously
south of the Museum Campus, was extended north to one block south of Oak Street
Beach east of Michigan Avenue. This allowed us to shift district lines both to the north
and to the south.
We also shifted the districts west. Commissioner Collins' district is moved approximately
eight to ten blocks west of the current boundary of her district. This allowed the northern
boundary of Commissioner Steele's district to be moved further to the north to absorb
some of the population change. Commissioner Sims' district was moved further south.
President Stroger's district was moved further south. Commissioner Carr's district was
moved a bit further out or westward. Commissioner Quigley's district was moved further
northward.
In general tenns, the large population gains have been in the northwest and southwest
comers of the County and in the core of the City, particularly in the Hispanic
communities. We attempted to move the districts consistent with these growth patterns.

2990

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 6, 2001
There are also certain areas that act as anchors or pivot points. District 1 and District 2
along the west side are cohesive African-American communities and act as a horizontal
shelf across the County. This shelf has been respected in terms of the basic structure of
the proposed map. The Hispanic communities in District 7 and District 8 are also
cohesive communities and, to maintain them as a basic principle, act as anchors.
The proposed map was guided by several basic principles. The proposed map complies
with one man-one vote principles. The populations within the proposed districts are
substantially equal. The maximum deviation from ideal population is less than 0.25% on
the high side and approximately 0.20% on the low side. The total swing is approximately
0.44 (or 1,400 people). There is less than 1/2 of 1% difference between the highest
proposed population for any district and the lowest.
The proposed map complies with the Voting Rights Act. The five districts which have
traditionally elected African-Americans to the County Board remain super-majority
African-American, ranging from 74.62% on the high side to 69.75% on the low side.
There is no retrogression in the number of districts that allow the African-American
populations in the west and south sides of Chicago and in the western and southern
suburbs of Cook County to elect candidates of their choice.
The proposed map is also guided by the testimony, the reasoning, and the proposal
offered by MALDEF, USHLI, and the Latino Committee of lllinois for Fair
Redistricting. Jn their proposal, they advocated two super-majority Hispanic districts and
a third district described as a "community of interest" district. Their specific proposal
called for a district corresponding to our District 7 that was 83 .33% Hispanic [79.20%
V AP]. Our proposed District 7 is 82.21 % Hispanic (78.36% V AP]. Their specific
proposal called for a district corresponding to our District 8 that was 68.63% Hispanic
[63.31% YAP]. Our proposed District 8 is 67.54% Hispanic [62.31% YAP]. Their
specific proposal called for a district corresponding to our District 16 that was 33. 78%
Hispanic [29.00% V AP]. Our proposed District 16 is 34.00% Hispanic [ 28. 94% VAP].
There are two major differences between their proposal and our proposal. First, our
proposal takes incumbents into account their proposal does not (as they lacked data on
incumbents' residences). Second, based on conversations with representatives of
MALDEF, our proposal recognizes that the Latino communities in the suburbs face
issues that are different than those of similar communities in the City. Accordingly, we
have attempted to establish a Hispanic community of interest district as a suburban-only
district and District 7 as a City based district. Our proposal deviates from this only with
respect to Cicero, which is divided (i) based on the fact that two incumbents reside in
Cicero and (ii) in recognition of the fact that the eastern edge of Cicero has been aligned
since 1993 with the Chicago Latino communities on the City's southwest side.
Our proposed map also is based on and addresses a number of other factors. We took
into account incumbency, existing district configurations and areas of representation, the
political composition of the Board, and communities of interest. We considered the
testimony given at the nine public hearings. The proposed map is a compromise
balancing many factors. No Commissioner is faced with a radical change in his or her
district. At least 70% of each Commissioner's existing district is contained within his or
her new proposed district. And there is one Commissioner whose proposed district is
contained wholly within the boundaries of his existing district. And voters are not faced
with radical changes in the configuration of the districts to which they are just becoming

2991

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 6, 200 I

accustomed. This is particularly important as we approach the end of only the first
decade of single-member districts and in light of the fact that we have had only two
elections for Commissioners in these districts.
The five existing districts represented by African-American Commissioners are
collectively 119,295 short of ideal population (or nearly 38% of a district collectively).
Thus, we had to make up more than a third of a district to bring these five districts into
compliance.
The areas of greatest growth have been the City's northwest and southwest sides and the
far south and northwest suburbs. The natural progression is to have districts radiate
outward toward those areas that have population to give. But this is complicated and
restricted by what we have characterized as core goals of preserving African-American
"shelves" and Hispanic "anchors".
We have taken into account existing municipal boundaries. This contributes to the odd
shapes of some of the suburban lines. Many existing village lines are derived from
annexations, resulting in very irregular boundaries. To a lesser extent, we have attempted
to take into account existing ward boundaries in the City of Chicago. Since the ward
lines are presently in the process of being redrawn, it becomes very difficult to hit a
moving target.
We took into account the lines in the new congressional map, particularly where a
County Board district edge came close to a congressional edge.
And, finally, we took into account natural boundaries, such as arterial streets,
expressways, etc.
The Chairman inquired as to whether there were any questions on Mr. Creticos' presentation.
Commissioner Hansen stated that he had two proposals involving his district. Commissioner Hansen also
asked whether, for the citizenship data received, such data was available by wards and whether there was
a total figure for the County. Kim Brace responded that the 1990 census data for citizenship is now only
available at the block group level, not at the block level, and therefore does not correspond to the wards,
which were not drawn at the block group level. Mr. Brace further responded that the citizenship totals for
the County as a whole could be detennined by adding up available data and that he would provide such
infonnation.
Chainnan Lechowicz called for proposals by any of the Commissioners. No proposals were offered.
Commissioner Hansen commented that he was unaware that the three lawyers who had been approved
were available to each member of the Committee. Chairman Lechowicz responded that they had been
available to each member of the Committee throughout the process and that they had been present at the
public hearings, responding to and addressing questions as they arose. The Chainnan called upon the
three lawyers, Donald Hubert, David Epstein, and Jeremiah Marsh, to again introduce themselves. In
further response to Commissioner Hansen, the Chairman stated that the three lawyers will continue to be
available to each member of the Committee and to all other members of the County Board until final
Board action on the map.

2992

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 6, 200 l

Commissioner Hansen further noted that the proposals that he had requested of staff had been prepared
for him, but did not show all of the other districts, making it impossible for him to present a complete
proposal at this point. Commissioner Daley noted that the Redistricting Office had been open to every
Commissioner and that any Commissioner could have utilized the facilities available to come up with a
plan showing 17 districts, which they could have submitted today, had they chosen to do so.
Commissioner Quigley thanked the redistricting staff for their patience and expertise and effort in a
difficult process. He noted his view that most of the concerns of the Commissioners had been addressed,
because there had been ample opportunity to do so. He further stated that there should be the ability to
make further changes which are minor in scope prior to the process being completed.
Chainnan Lechowicz called for proposals by members of the public. No proposals were offered by any
member of the public.
The Chair called for public testimony or comment on any proposal. The Chair recognized Honorable
Bernard L. Stone, Aldennan and Democratic Committeeman of the 50th Ward of the City of Chicago.
Alderman Stone submitted his written statement and, at the request of the Chair, read it into the record.
Aldennan Stone objected to Staff Proposal # 1 based on the fact that it placed more than 1/3 of the 50th
Ward within the proposed l 0th County Board District, with the remainder in the proposed 13th County
Board District. Under the current County Board map, the entire 50th Ward is contained within the
existing 13th County Board District. According to Alderman Stone, the proposed map would divide the
Asian-American community in the 50th Ward by utilizing Devon Avenue as a north-south boundary.
Aldennan Stone further stated that the proposed map would dilute the political effect of the last remaining
large contingent of people of the Jewish faith in Cook County. Aldennan Stone added that he did not
believe that anyone intentionally drew the proposed map to do this.
Chainnan Lechowicz noted that 2/3 (or 65%) of the population of the 50th Ward is maintained within
County Board District 13, now represented by Commissioner Sutker. He further noted that, under the
1990 census, District 13 is 9.60% non-Hispanic Asian and District IO is 8.80% non-Hispanic Asian. The
proposed map maintains approximately the same ratio proposed District 13 would be 12.01% nonHispanic Asian and proposed District JO would be 11.16% non-Hispanic Asian. Chairman Lechowicz
further stated that it would not be possible to achieve a level high enough to create an Asian community
of influence district, even by combining the entire Asian populations of District 13 and District I 0. He
noted that the Jewish population remains concentrated in District 13. He pointed out that placing the
Asian community in the 50th Ward into a district with other substantial Asian population was a rational
goal. And he assured Alderman Stone that there was no disrespect intended to him or to any member of
the community that he represents.
The Chair recognized Commissioner Sutker. Commissioner Sutker stated that he is very sensitive to the
concerns of both the Asian-American community and the Jewish community. He indicated that he would
love to have all of the 50th Ward, but that changes driven by the dynamics of population movements
resulted in every Commissioner losing some areas in which he or she has been very popular and would
wish to keep and/or gaining areas that are new to him or her. He pointed out that the population
movement to the north and to the west had to affect his district and Commissioner Quigley's district. He
stated that the staff has been fair and that every Commissioner, to some slight degree, has been adversely
affected, but that compromises have been made. He assured Aldennan Stone that he would be available
to him at any time, even on an ex officio basis with respect to the portion of his ward not within the
proposed 13th County Board District.

2993

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 6, 200 I

Commissioner Quigley stated that he is and would be proud to serve and work with any Alderman of the
City of Chicago. He stated that he recognized that the districts to the south of his district needed to gain
population. He indicated that he had made every effort to accommodate, including agreeing to give up
the 42nd Ward, a significant change.
The Chair called for any other public testimony. No other member of the public sought recognition or
asked to testify.
The Chair recognized Commissioner Maldonado. Commissioner Maldonado expressed his opposition to
the proposed map. He stated that he felt that the 34.00% Hispanic population level for the proposed
Hispanic community of interest district was too low and that he felt that 40-45% was accomplishable
without hurting the possibility of any incumbent having a fair chance at re-election. He further noted that
he is not making a legal argument, but a political argument. He stated that part of the Latino population
in the City of Chicago could be incorporated into and made a part of the proposed influence district. The
argument can be made, according to him, that all Latino communities will fall within a community of
interest and that it does not matter how you connect them, citing the existing 4th Congressional District as
precedent. Finally, he noted that the Hispanic population of his district would increase only 2 1/2% (from
65% to 67.5%).
The Chair recognized Commissioner Moreno. Commissioner Moreno pointed out that, focusing on
voting age population [V AP] and citizenship, the Hispanic community is very young, with a median age
of 26 years old. He further pointed out that the Mexican-American community which comprises a
substantial majority of the Hispanic community has a median age of 21 years old. He stated that the
creation of a community of influence district at a higher level than was being proposed would require
disregarding some of the considerations that the Committee is bound to take into account. He indicated
that he had met with MALDEF quite frequently and that the proposed map not only meets, but exceeds,
most of their expectations. He noted that the proposed Hispanic community of influence district has a
higher percentage of Hispanic total population than proposed by MALDEF. Finally, he indicated that the
proposed map is a fair map, that it does the absolute best job that could be done in order to take into
account everyone's concerns and interests, and that he supports it.
The Chair recognized Commissioner Hansen. Commissioner Hansen stated that the proposed map has
fai led to solve the problem with the 17th District, which still runs from Palwaukee Airport on the north
almost to the bottom of the map, and, in fact, has increased the problem by extending the 17th District
west in Elk Grove Township. He expressed his view that the starting point for the map is accommodation
of ethnic and racial districts, which, in tum, influences the lines for all other districts. He further
expressed the view that eight of the districts drawn along ethnic and racial grounds would be Democrat
anyway. He expressed his objection to dividing Elk Grove Township in half, placing half of it in the 17th
County Board District. And he noted that there had been indications during the original districting
process in 1993 that the problem of the 17th District would be addressed next time around , but that this
was not being done.
The Chair recognized Commissioner Schumann. Commissioner Schumann noted that the problem we are
faced with results from the losses of population in same parts of the County and gains in other parts. The
alternatives, he stated, are either to reconfigure the whole map or to make the best of the existing districts
with some modifications. He further stated his view that the proposed 17th District is not any more
geographically diverse than the proposed 14th District or the proposed 15th District, both of which reflect
large geographic distances. He noted that the proposed 17th District contains some areas that he has not
represented before, but that he will try to represent such areas to the best of his abilities and that the best
way to represent new areas is to get out and work with other elected officials. He stated that, if he were a
member of this Committee, he would vote for the proposed map.

2994

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDfNGS FOR SEPTEMBER 6, 2001

The Chair recognized Commissioner Hansen for response. Commissioner Hansen noted that the farther
one gets from his or her home the less intense his or her knowledge of the area represented will be.
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved approval of the proposed Redistricting
Ordinance in the following form (submitted hereto and incorporated by reference herein) as a Committee
Ordinance:

REAL PROPERTY ASSESSMENT CLASSIFJCATION ORDINANCE
AS AMENDED
BE IT ENACTED BY THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS:
The Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance, as from time to time amended (November 29,
1976; June 6, 1977; September 19, 1977; May 16, 1978; January 2, 1979; March 3, 1980; September 2,

November 23, 1999; aHd April 18, 2000 and September 6, 2001) is hereby amended to read as follows:
The Cook County Board of Commissioners finds and declares:
( 1)

that in certain areas of Cook County there is a lack of viable industrial and commercial buildings,
which is contributing to substantial unemployment in such areas;

(2)

that if existing industrial and commercial structures were improved and utilized fu lly, and if new
industrial and commercial structures were developed, the County's economic well-being would be
improved by an increase in the level of economic activity, by increased employment opportunities
and by a growth in the real property tax base;

(3)

that because of the blighted or depressed condition of the areas where such development is
needed, the ordinary unaided operation of private enterprise cannot accomplish the necessary
modernization, rehabilitation and development, therefore provision must be made for public
assistance and encouragement of such private enterprises;

(4)

that the creation of new property tax classifications for (a) new deve lopment of industrial
structures, or the substantial rehabilitation and re-utilization of existing industrial structures, for
the County as a whole as well as for specific areas of special need, and (b) new development of
commercial structures, or the substantial rehabilitation and re-utilization of existing commercial
structures in areas that are depressed, blighted or threatened with blight, is an appropriate and
necessary method of providing such assistance and encouragement, and will result in increasing
the tax base in such areas and for the entire County; and

3 122

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 6, 200 I

(5)

that the creation of a new property tax classification for the rehabilitation and new construction of
certain multifamily rental housing will increase and improve the stock of decent, safe and
affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households in Cook County, and will remove
the blight or potential blight of deteriorating housing stock while also increasing the tax base of
the County.

(6)

that the amendment of real estate assessment classifications for the purpose of lowering the
assessment level for certain retention and development of the most affordable permanent housing
available to homeless and very low income individuals.

(7)

that the creation of a new property tax classification, to facilitate commercial and industrial
development through remediation of property, contamination of which is not attributable to the
owner, is an appropriate and necessary method of providing assistance and encouragement to
achieve remediation and utilization of such property, which will result in increasing employment
opportunities as well as the tax base in the areas in which such sites are located and in the entire
County.

(8)

that the creation of a new property tax classification, to encourage the preservation and
rehabilitation of historically and architecturally significant commercial and industrial buildings,
will enhance the general character of real estate in the County and contribute to the economic
well-being of the County by increasing the level of economic activity, increasing employment
opportunities and contributing to the long-term growth of the real property tax base.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 6, 2001

Class 3:

All improved real estate used for residential purposes which is not included in Class 2 or
in Class 9, including a single room occupancy building, as defined herein.

Class 4:

Real estate owned and used by a not-for-profit corporation in furtherance of the purposes
set forth in its charter unless used for residential purposes. If such real estate is used for
residential purposes, it shall be classified in the appropriate residential class.

Class 5:

7a, Class 7b, Class 8, Class 9, or Class L of this section.

Real estate used primarily for industrial purposes, as defined herein, consisting of all
newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are
situated; or abandoned property, as defined herein, including the land upon which such
property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially
rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified
land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or
horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
Board of Commissioners of Cook County if the real estate is located in an unincorporated
area, an ordinance or resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board,
as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by Class 6b is necessary

Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 6b application to the
Assessor. A certified copy of the ordinance or resolution need not be filed at the time of
filing the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the
Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to

secretary of the Cook County Board for distribution to the Commissioners from the
affected districts.
In the case of abandoned property, if the municipality or the Board of Commissioners, as
the case may be, finds that special circumstances justify finding that the property is
"abandoned" for purpose of Class 6b, even though it has been vacant and unused for less
than 24 months, that finding, along with the specification of the circumstances, shall be
included in the resolution or ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b

Commissioners of Cook County is required to validate such shortened period of
qualifying abandonment, and a resolution to that effect shall be included with the Class
6b eligibility application filed with the Assessor.

the assessment level is higher than 16%, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined
above and receive a 16% assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the
filing and approval of the resolution and renewal application. However, if, as of that
effective date, the tax payer's assessment is higher than 16% and the taxpayer is granted a
renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment
level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the

2. the municipality in which the real estate is located or the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County, if the real estate is located in an unincorporated
area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board,
as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is
necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to
renewal of the Class L, and;
3. a copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the
Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the incentive period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply
and qualify for Class L. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the
Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Cook
County Board for distribution to Commissioners from the effected districts.
If, as of this Ordinance's effective date, a property is receiving Class L treatment, but the
assessment level is higher than 16%, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined
above and receive a 16% assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the
filing and approval of the resolution and renewal application. However, if as of the
effective date, the tax payer's assessment is higher than 16% and the taxpayer is granted a
renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment
level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the
incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section 3 below. After
expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable
classification under this Ordinance.
For commercial properties, once the original twelve year incentive period has expired, the
commercial Class L incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject
to renewal and the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this
Ordinance.
The Assessor shall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to detennine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits
provided under Class L.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all
Class L recipients as to the continued Landmark status of the property and the number of
persons employed at the Class L site. Failure to file such reports within the time
established by the Assessor's rules may result in loss of the incentive for the period
relating to the non-filing.

Section 4.
(A)

To quali fy as a commercial development project under Class 7a or 7b, it is necessary that the
project be located in an area in need of commercial development in that:
( I)

the area is, or has been within the last I 0 years, designated by federal, state or local
agency as a conservation, blighted or renewal area or an area encompassing a
rehabilitation or redevelopment plan or project adopted under the Illinois Urban Renewal
Consolidation Act of 1961 , as amended, or the Commercial Renewal Re-development
Areas Act of 1967, as amended, or that the area is located in a federal Empowennent
Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners on June 22, 1994 or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, or the
Commercial District Development Commission Ordinance of the City of Chicago or
designation(s) of like effect adopted under any similar statute or ordinance; and

(2)

real estate taxes within said area, during the last six years, have declined, remained
stagnant or potential real estate taxes are not being fully realized due to the depressed
condition of the area; and

3 140

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 6, 200 I

(3)

there is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation
of the commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably
timely basis if granted Class 7a or 7b designation and will therefore result in the
economic enhancement of the area; and

(4)

certification of the commercial development project for C lass 7a or 7b designation will
materially assist development, re-development or rehabilitation of the area and the
commercial development project would not go forward without the full incentive offered
under Class 7a or 7b; and

(5)

certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation is
reasonably expected to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and
employment opportunities within the area.

Prior to filing a Class 7a or 7b eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain
from the municipality in which the real estate is located, or the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an ordinance or resolution expressly
stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that factors (I)
through (5) are present and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports
and consents to the Class 7a or 7b application to the Assessor. A certified copy of such ordinance
or resolution shall be included with the Class 7a or 7b application at the time of filing the
application with the Assessor. A copy of the ordinance or resolution, whichever is submitted,
will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the secretary of the Board of Commissioners for
distribution to the Commissioners from the affected districts. The application shall include any
other infonnation deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the
commercial development project qualifies for the Class 7a or 7b classification and shall bear the
expense of doing so.
Inasmuch as the County desires to encourage economic development in the neighborhoods of
Cook County, support the increased use of the incentive by smaller projects and to limit the
expense of such applications, the Assessor shall liberally construe the requirements of factors (I)
through (5) for Class 7a applications.
The Assessor shall adopt rules, including a provision to ensure a proper review of the application
and supporting data.
Certification of a commercial development project shall not be denied by reason of insufficient
size if it otherwise qualifies hereunder. In detennining what constitutes the "full incentive
offered" as provided in factor (4) above, consideration may be given to any lawful intergovernmental participation agreements under which the project developer has agreed, as a
precondition to Class 7a or 7b certification, to share a portion of future profits with the
appropriate taxing districts.
For C lass 7a applications, where the Assessor finds that factors (I) through (5) exist, he shall,
within 60 days after receipt of the application and necessary supporting data, certify the
commercial development project eligible for Class 7a treatment under this Ordinance
In order to determine Class 7b applications, upon receipt of the application and all the necessary
supporting data, the Assessor shall forward it to the Economic Development Advisory Committee
of Cook County. The Committee shall within thirty days return the application to the Assessor
with a finding stating whether factors ( I) through (5) are present. Upon receipt of a written

3141

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 6, 200 I

request from the Committee no later than seven days prior to the expiration of the thirty day
period, the Assessor may extend for a period not to exceed an additional thirty days the time for
return of the application with the Committee's finding. The Assessor shall review the application,
supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate facts. Where the Assessor finds
factors ( 1) through (5) exist, he shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the Committee' s findings,
certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7b treatment under this Ordinance.
Class 7a and 7b certifications shall lapse within one year from the date of issuance unless new
construction or substantial rehabilitation, or in the case of abandoned property, reoccupation of
the commercial development project has commenced prior to its expiration.
(B)

To be certified as an area in need of substantial revitalization for purposes of C lass 8
classification it is necessary: ( 1) that the municipality in which the area is located or, if an
unincorporated area, the County detennine by lawful resolution that the area is in a state of
economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish
the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public
assistance and encouragement, or a detennination of similar import; (2) that the municipality or,
if in an unincorporated area, the County apply to the Assessor for certification of the area as one
in need of substantial_revitalization ; (3) that, upon receiving an application to certify an area as in
need of_substantial revitalization, the Assessor shall review the application, supporting data and
other appropriate factors relevant to a detennination of the severity of the economic conditions of
the area. In determining whether the "in need of substantial revitalization_" requirement is met,
the Assessor shall give strong consideration and substantial weight to the fact that an area is
located in a federal Empowennent Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by
the Cook County Board of Commissioners on June 22, 1994 or the Chicago City Council on May
18, 1994.
Upon finding that existing factors convincingly demonstrate that the area is in need of substantial
revitalization, as defined in this Ordinance, the Assessor shall grant such certification to the area.
In making this determination statistical data relevant to the surrounding area as well as the
specific area for which certification is sought may be considered. The surrounding area for the
City of Chicago shall be the "community area" as defined herein; for all other areas in the County
it shall be, where applicable, the municipality in which the area is located.
If a municipality within an Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18,
1994, detennines by municipal resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and
that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish the necessary
modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public assistance and
encouragement, or a determination of similar import and submits a request for Class 8
certification, such certification shall be automatic pursuant to this ordinance. However, each
property eligible for a Class 8 incentive within the certified area must file their application in a
timely manner.

Section 5.
Where a single parcel of real estate is partially included in two or more of the above-described classes,
each portion shall be assessed at the assessment level herein prescribed for that class.
