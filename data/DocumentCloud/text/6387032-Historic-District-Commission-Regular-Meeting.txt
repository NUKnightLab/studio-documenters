APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6412
VIOLATION NUMBER: 19-315
ADDRESS: 1793 SEYBURN STREET
HISTORIC DISTRICT: WEST VILLAGE
APPLICANT: SIDNEY MIGOSKI
DATE OF COMPLETE APPLICATION: 8-26-2019
STAFF SITE VISIT: 08-30-2019

PREPARED BY: A. PHILLIPS

SCOPE: REHABILITATION OF BUILDING
EXISTING CONDITIONS
The building located at 1793 Seyburn Street is a 1 ½-story single-family residence constructed in 1912. The structure
is clad in dark red/brown brick and features painted cedar shake siding at the gable ends. The cross gable roof is
covered in gray asphalt shingles and includes a central dormer with three wood double hung windows. The simple
massing of the house boasts a deep front porch which spans the width of the house accessed by a set of six steps
centered on the façade. A small single-story bay exists on the north façade and the east facade. The rear façade
includes a small enclosed porch directly north of the rear entrance and is clad in multiple materials. A garage exists at
the far southwest corner of the lot. All landscaping in the front yard has been recently removed. The rear yard is
fenced and is accessed through a chain-link gate located south of the house.

PROPOSAL
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to perform a general rehabilitation
of the building per the attached drawings. Included in the proposal are the following scope items:
• Demolish existing rear porch in its entirety and install a new wood window and brick infill knee wall to
match existing windows at location of existing exterior door
• Replace all (7) existing second story wood double-hung windows

 •
•

Paint cedar shake
Remove bars from all windows, paint, and restore all windows at first floor

STAFF OBSERVATIONS & RESEARCH
• The existing rear porch is not visible from the right-of-way.
• The rear porch was constructed as part of the home originally (see Sanborn map).
ISSUES
• While on routine site visit, staff noticed that all landscaping at the front yard has been removed recently.
This work was completed without a Certificate of Appropriateness (see applicant photographs for
landscaping condition prior to removal). Additionally, the designation slide shows significant
landscaping at the front yard at the time of designation.
• Only three (3) second story windows were determined too damaged for repair and restoration (see
attached statement from window professional).
• Paint color for cedar shake not included in application.
RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Recommendation for the following scope items:
• Paint cedar shake
• Remove bars from all windows, paint, and restore all windows at first floor
It is staff’s opinion that the work, as proposed, does not destroy historic materials that characterize the historic
building, its site, and setting. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission find the scope items listed above to be
appropriate as the scope of work meets the following Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation:
6) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration
requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and
other visual qualities, and where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by
documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.
9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
2. Recommendation for the following scope items:
• Demolish rear porch in its entirety and replace existing door with new wood window and brick knee wall infill
• Replace all (7) existing second story wood double-hung windows

It is staff’s opinion that the work, as proposed, destroys historic materials that characterize the historic building, its
site, and setting. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission find the scope items listed above to be
inappropriate as the scope of work does not meet the following Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation:
6) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration
requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and
other visual qualities, and where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by

9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
3. Recommendation for the following scope items:

 •

Landscape removal at the front yard

It is staff’s opinion that the work, as completed without a Certificate of Appropriateness, alters a space (front yard)
that characterizes the historic building, its site, and setting. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission find the
scope items listed above to be inappropriate as the scope of work does not meet the following Secretary of the
Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation:
2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or
alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1) Height. Buildings in West Village range in height from one story to eleven (11) stories. The majority of the residential
buildings are two and one-half (2½) stories tall, meaning they have two (2) full stories plus an attic or finished third
floor within the roof. One and one-half-story residential buildings exist and are primarily concentrated on Van Dyke
between Lafayette and Kercheval, the east side of Shipherd, and on St. Paul between Shepherd and Van Dyke.
Apartment buildings range from two (2) stories to eleven (11) stories tall although buildings of more than four (4)
stories are rare. Commercial buildings range from one to three (3) stories tall; the older commercial buildings are two
(2) stories tall.
(2) Proportion of buildings' front facades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on age, style, use and location in a
specific subdivision. On narrow, thirty-foot to thirty-five-foot parcels, proportion of front facades is narrow compared
to depth and buildings are taller than wide. Apartment buildings are taller than wide, terraces and attached row houses
are wider than tall when taken as a whole.
(3) Proportion of openings within the facades. Areas of voids generally constitute between fifteen (15) per cent and
thirty (30) per cent of the front facades, excluding the roofs. Most major openings are taller than wide, although when
grouped together some may achieve a horizontal affect. Transoms over windows are usually wider than tall or square.
Window openings in residences are always subdivided, the most common window type being double-hung sash,
whose area may be further subdivided by muntins. Dormer and gable windows exist in a variety of shapes and sizes.
The district contains a great variety of sizes, shapes, and arrangements of openings.
(4) Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. Voids are usually spaced evenly within the facades, resulting in balanced
compositions. Voids in buildings derived from classical precedents are usually arranged in a symmetrical manner.
Buildings influenced by the arts and crafts movement and the Victorian era display voids arranged with more
freedom.
(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. Spacing of buildings on streets is generally determined by the setback
form the side lot lien, which tends to vary according to the width of the lot. The regularity of spacing on narrow lots or
parcels (thirty-foot to forty-foot range) is interrupted by vacant lots resulting from demolition as well as the occasional
combination of several lots for larger, newer structures. On Parker from Jefferson to Agnes where lots are forty (40)
feet to fifty (50) feet wide, houses are most often centered on the lot or sometimes placed closer to one side lot line to
form a small side yard or permit space for a driveway.
(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Most residences have porch projections and/or entrance recessions.
Porches and entrances on classically inspired buildings are either centrally placed or, as in the case of some duplexes,
placed on both sides of the facade in a symmetrical arrangement. Victorian and arts and crafts inspired buildings
display more freedom in placement. Side and sun porches are rare in the district due to the lack of side yards; a few
exist on larger lots. Rowhouses or terraces generally exhibit freedom in placement of porches and entrances within
each complex; centrally located recessed entrances in Shipherd Court crate a rhythm amongst themselves.
Commercial buildings on Kercheval display a progression of recessed entrances, usually two (2) per building. No
rhythm is established along the Jefferson Avenue frontage.
(7) Relationship of materials. The majority of the buildings in West Village have either common or pressed brick or
clapboard sheathing as their principal exterior material. Stucco wall surfaces also exist as a principal material; some
later replacement siding exists in the district, but much of such siding changes the visual relationship of the siding to
the building. Masonry is used on the first story only on some houses, and wood shingles exist on some second stories.
Most buildings have wood trim; a few more substantial houses and apartment buildings have stone trim. There are
some tile roofs; some slate roofs still exist; asphalt replacement roofs are common. Porches are built of brick or wood.
(8) Relationship of textures. The most common relationships of textures are the low-relief pattern of mortar joints in
brick contrasted to smooth wood trim and/or wood clapboard contrasted with smoother trim. Random ashlar used at
first story level is contrasted with a wood-sheathed or shingled upper story in a few houses, as is a brick first story and

 a stuccoed second story. The smoother surface of glazed brick or painted brick is sometimes contrasted with stone or
wood trim. Carved wooden detail and half-timbering provide textural interest. Slate and tile roofs provide textural
interest whereas asphalt shingles usually do not.
(9) Relationship of colors. Orange natural brick, pressed brick, and replacement siding in natural earth colors are
plentiful in the district; the paint colors of frame houses often relate to style. The classically inspired buildings
generally have woodwork painted in the white and cram range. Doors and shutters feature an array of colors, usually
harmonizing with the main body of the house. Colors known to have been in use on buildings of this type in the
eighteenth or nineteenth century on similar buildings may be considered for suitability. Buildings of medieval or arts
and crafts inspiration generally have painted woodwork and window frames of dark brown, cream, or other natural
tones. Stucco is either left in its natural state or painted din a shade of cream or yellow. Dark brown half-timbering is
common. Victorian buildings display freedom in use of color. Original color schemes for any given building may be
determined by professional paint analysis and when so determined are always appropriate for than building. Roofs are
in natural colors (tile and slate and wood colors) and asphalt shingles are predominantly within this same color range.
(10) Relationship of architectural details. Architectural details generally relate to style. Victorian architectural details
appear on one and one-half and two and one-half-story Victorian cottages; spindlework, fishscale shingles and
patterned shingles are indicative of the Queen Anne style. Areas treated include porches, gables, window and door
surrounds, and cornices. The buildings influenced by the arts and crafts or medieval sometimes have details carved in
wood on window frames, door frames and eaves and sometime shave half-timbering. The four-square buildings,
mostly on the northern end of the district, have little architectural embellishments; the detail on the eaves, bays,
dormers and porch are architectonic. Neo-Georgian or colonial have classical details in wood on porches, shutters,
window frames and dormers. In general, various styles are rich in architectural detail.
(11) Relationship of roof shapes. The district is characterized by a diversity of roof shapes. Hipped or pitched roofs on
most residential buildings are punctuated with gables and dormers, with the exception of the Victorian cottages with
their steeply pitched roofs and apartment buildings, whose roofs are not visible from the street. Roofs of commercial
buildings generally appear flat. Porch roofs vary greatly according to style.
(12) Walls of continuity. The major wall of continuity is created by the buildings, with their generally uniform setbacks
within block faces. New buildings should conform to these setbacks where they exist. Fences along building lines
extend the major wall of continuity. Hedges extending along the front lot lines create a minor wall of continuity where
they exist, and a major wall of continuity where they exist in sufficient quantities such as on Shepherd between St.
Paul and Agnes. Gaslights on Parker between Lafayette and the Parkstone parking lot and on Agnes from Parker to
Van Dyke create minor walls of continuity, as do trees on tree lawns. Fences in the district exist alongside lot lines as
well as front lot lines. On Shipherd garages on the west side of the street create the major wall of continuity.
(13) Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The typical treatment of individual properties
is a flat or slightly graded front lawn area in grass turf, subdivided by a walk leading got the front entrance from the
curb and frequently a side walk beginning at the sidewalk leading to the rear. Materials for such walks are primarily
concrete, although a few brick walks exist. Some front yards have rectangular raised earthwork terraces upon which
the house stands, sometimes with a brick or stone retaining wall at the change of grade. Foundation plantings, often of
a deciduous character, are present. Hedges between properties and along front lot lines are not uncommon. Several
types of fences exist in the district, including cyclone fences, fences with wooden posts and rails with wire mesh,
wrought iron fences, and brick and concrete walls. Some large American elm trees remain on the tree lawns in the
district, although they are virtually extinct. Replacement trees should be characteristic of the area and period, though
only a disease-resistant elm would be a practical choice. Very few straight side drives from the street to the rear are
present; alley-facing garages are the norm, although many parking bays are present with alley entrances. The lack of
front driveways leads to a unity of front yards. Street pavements are now asphalt; cut stone curbs exist with frequency
although in some areas they have been replaced with concrete curbs. Alleys are concrete except for the alley between
Shipherd and Van Dyke and the alley between East Jefferson and Van Dyke Place, which are brick. Steel lighting
poles on Van Dyke are fluted; elsewhere in the district on north-south streets O.P. poles are the predominant type. On
east-west streets and Shipherd three are telephone poles with cranes carrying lanterns. A boulevard with a landscaped
median forty-four (44) feet by three hundred seventy (370) feet exists on Parker Avenue between the Jefferson and
Lafayette and Lafayette Avenue [sic].
(14) Relationship of open space to structures. In those areas of the district where demolition of houses has occurred, the
character of the open space is haphazard as it relates to the buildings. On Shipherd, the original relationship between
the houses on the east side and the garages on the west side of the street has been severely altered due to demolition of
houses. On both sides of Seyburn between the alley between Seyburn and Van Dyke Place clearance for
redevelopment has occurred. The arrangements of Shepherd Court provides a central communal courtyard space. The
boulevard on the south end of Parker provides a more spacious setting for the houses facing it.

 (15) Scale of facades and facade elements. There is a variety in scale from block to block depending on lot width and
style. Houses south of Lafayette are of a more substantial character than those north of Lafayette, and houses south of
Agnes on Parker are the most substantial. Size and complexity of facade elements and details either accentuate or
subdue the scale of the facades. Facade elements have been determined by what is appropriate for the style. Window
sashes are usually subdivided by muntins, which affects the apparent scale of the windows within the facades.
(16) Directional expression of front elevations. The expression of direction on residential blocks is neutral, although
individual houses may emphasize their verticality or horizontally according to style. Rowhouses and terraces are
horizontal in directional expression; apartment buildings are vertical. Commercial buildings on Kercheval form a
horizontal row.
(17) Rhythm of building setbacks. Setbacks on the north-south streets in the district vary slightly from area to area within
the district, although they are generally consistent within each street face and/or subdivision because of the existence
of various deed restrictions. Buildings on the main east-west streets—East Jefferson, Lafayette, and Agnes—are less
consistent in setback due to more recent development. The varying designs of the buildings, frequently with slight
setbacks or projections in their facades, cause the buildings to relate to the front setback line in different ways; this
creates a slight variation in setback line.
(18) Relationship of lot coverages. Lot coverages range from fifteen (15) per cent to eighty (80) per cent. Apartment
buildings and rowhouses generally occupy a percentage at the high end of this range. Most homes are in the twenty
(20) per cent to thirty-five (35) per cent range of lot coverage. Lot coverage is greater north of Lafayette where lots
are narrower in width.
(19) Degree of complexity within the facade. The degree of complexity has been determined by what is typical and
appropriate for a given style. The classically inspired buildings usually have simple, rectangular facades with varying
amounts of ornamentation. Foursquare buildings are usually less complex with ornament restricted to the porch and
entrance and sometimes eaves. Other more decorative styles frequently have facades complicated by gables, bays,
slight setbacks, porches, an occasional turret, window and door hoods, and carved detail. Apartment buildings have
historical details derived from the styles in which the buildings are designed.
(20) Orientation, vistas, overviews. Most of the buildings are oriented toward the street. Garages are usually oriented
toward an alley; almost all garages are detached and at the rear of the lot. They are not generally visible from the
street. Houses on the east side of Shipherd are oriented toward the street and face the garages of buildings oriented
towards Seyburn. All houses in Wesson's Subdivision face the north-south streets, except those on the north side of
Lafayette. In other subdivisions the corner house often faces the east-west streets. Rowhouses and terraces are usually
oriented toward the east-west streets. Buildings on Jefferson are most often slanted slightly towards the west.
(21) Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Neo-colonial or classically inspired buildings are usually symmetrical. Other
styles are asymmetrical but most often result in balanced compositions.
(22) General environmental character. The West Village District is characterized by residential and minor commercial
development dating from 1880-1930. Long, straight streets, a significant array of housing types, and a cohesiveness
achieved through uniform setbacks and heights result in an urban, medium density neighborhood. Newer commercial
and institutional uses exist primarily on the northern and southern fringes of the district. West Village is of an urban
character rare in Detroit because of the diversity of building types in the area.

 REPORT

DEMOLITION OF BACK PORCH AND DOOR FOR INSTALLATION OF NEW WINDOW
The existing back porch is poorly constructed and not original to the home. One of the windows
is newer and does not match the others. Another window was removed at some point and
patched with plywood. These haphazard modifications contributed to the porch decay and poor
condition. Directly next to this porch is the main back door. This makes this door and porch
redundant and unnecessary. This small porch is not visible from the street or the alley because
the garage blocks the view.
The decaying condition in combination with its location in the back of the home support our
request to demolish it. In its place, we are proposing to install a new wood window to match
the existing windows in size and material. Brick will in fill below the new window, to match
existing. The new window will be painted to match the existing windows of the house.

REPORT

INSTALLATION OF NEW WOOD WINDOWS AT THE SECOND LEVEL
After having a window assessment done by Building Hugger, it is clear that (3) three of the
second story windows need to be replaced. Considerable damage has occurred over the years
of neglect, rendering these windows un-salvageable.
With regards to the other (7) seven windows at this level, we are requesting to replace those as
well. We are proposing this for three main reasons:
1. The windows are damaged. Although they can be restored, Building Hugger noted “one
major repair for (2) two of the windows and due to the deteriorated condition, these openings
will require a full sill replacement.”
2. To maintain visual continuity. The second story siding is wood, a different material than the
first story. We must replace three of the windows on this level, and it would be less noticeable if
all the windows at the wood siding looked identical.
3. To ensure this home lasts another 100 years. The new windows will require new window
flashing, preventing water from entering the wall cavity. This protects the load bearing exterior
walls better than the existing assembly, ensuring a longer building life. The installation of the
new wood windows will insulate the second story better, where the walls are less insulated
due to the wood siding. The higher performing windows will decrease the homes overall
energy consumption. As the City of Detroit restores historic buildings, we need to be leaders by
thinking about how energy consumption will impact our city in the future. We are committed to
the longevity of this home and a better performing window aligns with this goal.

Sidney,
Based on our assessment onsite at 1793 Seyburn and the conditions observed, we believe restoration is
possible for the following openings: 2A/2B/2C/2D/2E/2I/2J. In general, the front façade and both side
room sashes are in sound condition with sharp profiles. We noted one major repair for openings 2D/2E
and due to the deteriorated condition, these openings will require a full sill replacement.
For the rear openings, 2F/2G/2H, we recommend replacement windows. These openings are extremely
racked and require major structural repairs. In addition, 4 out of 6 sashes require replacement as well as
repairs to the interior casing. Please see attached for pictures and written descriptions of the existing
conditions.

Please feel free to contact us with any questions.

Thank you,
Amy Swift
