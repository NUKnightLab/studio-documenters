REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT DIVISION
PROPOSED REAL ESTATE MATTER

Transmitting a Communication, dated November 9, 2004 from
JOHN W. DA VIS, Director, Real Estate Management Division
requesting approval of the first amendment to lease between the County of Cook, as landlord, and
Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Chicago, as tenant, for space located at 69 West Washington
Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Prior to the event of October 17, 2003 Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Chicago occupied Suite
3130 on the 31st floor of the Cook County Administration Building, space which was provided to them
for their operations in connection with the Traffic Court. This location was to have been a temporary
location, with the tenant moving to a new traffic court then under consideration. This tenant brings a
substantial population into the upper floors of the building, which could be better accommodated on a
lower fl oor. Therefore, while the tenant was unable to occupy the original premises due to the casualty,
the Office of Capital Planning and Policy worked with 69 West Washington Management Company to
relocate Catholic Charities to premises on the 9th floor of the building. This first amendment provides for
such relocation and reduces the premises from 6,263 rentable square feet to 5,365 rentable square feet, in
addition to extending the tenn beyond the expiration date previously approved by the Board in the
original lease. Catholic Charities shall continue to use and occupy the premises for general office
purposes for Central States Institute of Addiction activities, related to the operation of the First District
Traffic Court of Cook County located in the Daley Center. Details are:

to the public safety fund ; two and one-half million goes to the Circuit Court Clerk for the automation fund
and two million to the Chicago Transit Authority.

Chairman Daley called the meeting to order, and leave was granted for Zelda Whittler, Undersheriff, to
address the Committee.
Ms. Whittler expressed Sheriff Sheahan's support for the concept of a staffing study of the Sheriff's
Office including the Department of Corrections. However, the Sheriff's position includes his support for
a similar staffing study of other agencies, departments, and offices of elected officials.
Chainnan Daley noted that President Stroger has also expressed his support for staffing studies in other
departments and agencies. The study in the Sheriff's Office is expected to be the first of many such
studies.
President Stroger said that this series of studies must begin with the Sheriff's Office because of the
involvement of a court-appointed monitor.
Commissioner Hansen expressed his concern regarding how the issue of staffing at the jail will impact the
budget.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 1, 2004

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Labor Subcommittee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Thursday, October 21, 2004 at the hour of 2:00 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building,
118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinoi s.
Your Subcommittee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
265627 AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY LIVING WAGE ORDINANCE (PROPOSED
ORDINANCE AMENDMENT) . Submitting a Proposed Ordinance Amendment sponsored by
Roberto Maldonado and John P. Daley, County Commissioners. Co-Sponsored by Bobbie L.
Steele, Mike Quigley and Larry Suffredin, County Commissioners.
requesting authorization to amend to the "Cook County Living Wage Ordinance" (98-0-21 ),
approved by the Board on September 15, 1998, for your approval. This item will be introduced at
the May 18, 2004 Board meeting and I will request that it be referred to the Finance Labor
Subcommittee for further review and discussion.
Similar to the City of Chicago' s Living Wage Ordinance (Title 2, Chapter 92, Section 6 10), the
proposed amendment increases the living wage for lowest-wage individuals employed by
contractors or subcontractors doing business with Cook County. The county's current living
wage of $7.60 per hour will be increased to $9.43 per hour if health benefits are provided, or
$10.68 per hour with no health benefits. There will be an annual adjustment calculated as I 00%
of the federal poverty line for a family of four (as defined by the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services) with health benefits and 125% of the federal poverty line for a family of four
without health benefits.
In addition, the proposed amendment applies to companies benefiting from property tax
incentives as set forth in the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance.
These amendments will ensure fair wages and will contribute to the county' s overall economic
well-being.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance Amendment.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT

COOK COUNTY LIVING WAGE ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, on September 15, 1998, the Cook County Board of Commissioners passed the
County Living Wage Ordinance to establish meaningful employee compensation for lowest-wage
individuals employed by a person or business entity awarded a contract or subcontract with Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, Cook County's Living Wage Ordinance should be updated to reflect the most
recent federal poverty level standards to maintain a stable and productive work force thereby
stimulating the local economy; and

106

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 1, 2004

WHEREAS, companies that benefit from property tax incentives from Cook County should be
held to the same living wage standard as those companies who do business with Cook County to
ensure a fair wage for their employees and to contribute to the County's overall economic wellbeing; now, therefore,
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE PRESIDENT AND THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF
THE COUNTY OF COOK:
The Cook County Living Wage Ordinance (98-0-21) is hereby amended by deleting the language
stricken and by inserting the underlined language as follows:

Section 1. Living Wage Requirements.
Section 2. Applicability.
Section 3. Effective Date.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether $2.35 is an appropriate figure for health benefits.
Chainnan Murphy responded in the affirmative. She stated that research has detennined that the
employee health benefit contribution should not exceed 25% of the health insurance premium.
Commissioner Hansen responded that this might encourage the employer not to provide health coverage.
Commissioner Maldonado responded that this figure was taken from the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services; they added $2.35 to the poverty line to compensate for the lack of insurance, which
results in the Living Wage Ordinance.
Commissioner Hansen said that this amount translates into approximately $4,000 annually, and that a
person cannot obtain health benefits for this amount.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that they needed to adhere to the established standards.
Chairman Murphy stated that they based their figures on the federal government's standards.
Commissioner Hansen asked which specific government agency claims that yearly health benefits can be
bought for $4,000.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services established a
poverty line, and recommended that a specific amount be added to cover health insurance to thereby raise
a person above the poverty line. He further stated that Chairman Murphy has committed to review the
economic impact of the living wage after one year.
Commissioner Hansen asked what funds have been budgeted for such a review.
Chainnan Murphy stated that the Real Estate Board and other organizations would provide this status
report. She further stated that the Assessor's Office also can provide information on economic impact.
Commissioner Butler stated his concern that companies would hire 24 or fewer employees to circumvent
the Ordinance.

107

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 1, 2004

Commissioner Maldonado stated that the language was taken from a City of Chicago ordinance. He
stated that the rationale was that very small companies would not be severely impacted if they were a
subcontractor for Cook County.

Commissioner Butler moved that "25 or .more" be stricken and "any number or' be added under
Section 1 (A) 2. and 4. Commissioner Gorman seconded. The motion carried.

.;

4. "Eligible Contractors" means any person or business entity awarded a
contract or subcontract by the County of Cook which requires in the
perfonnance thereof the employment of any number of 25 or more full
time non-county employees, including, but not limited to, the following
classifications: cashier, clerical, custodial, day laborer, elevator operator,
home and health care, laundry, leased employee, parking attendant, and
security guard. Eligi01e CoRtraetors shall Rot iRelude any person or
busiRess entity with fewer than 25 full time employees.

"Contract" means any written agreement requiring board approval
whereby the County is committed to expend or does expend funds in
connection with any contract or subcontract which requires in the
perfonnance thereof the employment of any number of 25 or more full
time non-county employees, including, but not limited to, the following
classifications: cashier, clerical, custodial, day laborer, elevator operator,
home and health care, laundry, leased employee, parking attendant, and
security guard. exee13t t Ihe term "Contract" shall not include contracts
with Not-For-Profit Organizations, Community Development Block
Grants, President's Office of Employment Training, Sheriff's Work
Alternative Program, or Department of Correction inmates .

Chairman Murphy noted that there are listed exemptions to this wage.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the cost of health insurance.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that $7,000 insures a family.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the County has contracts that are highly sought after, and that this
power should be leveraged so that extensive healthcare coverage can be supplied.
Chainnan Murphy stated her concern that if the stipulated wage in the Ordinance were made too high, it
might encourage contractors to hire only part-time employees.
Commissioner Gornrnn stated that the employer had to pay 75% of the premium.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that if the employee has to pay more than 25% of their wages for their
health insurance, then a wage of $11.78 becomes applicable, because the employee would be considered
uninsured.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that he thought the employer should be responsible only for supplying
individual health insurance and not family health insurance.
Commissioner Hansen voiced concern that there was a loophole.

108

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 1, 2004

Chairman Murphy asked Commissioner Hansen to specify the loophole.
Commissioner Hansen replied that an employer could employ employees part-time at less than eight
hours per day. He also stated that the company should not be awarded the contract if its employees are
paying more than 25% of their salary toward health insurance.
Commissioner Maldonado explained that once the employee pays over 25% of his salary toward health
care insurance, he is compensated at the higher wage. He further stated that the real issue is whether the
contractors have to provide single or family coverage for employees.
Commissioner Hansen stated that this is a golden opportunity to cover the entire family. He also stated
that he believes the living wage should be increased to $13.25.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that the entire Board has to be comfortable with this amount. He stated
that the original language was $10.68 and with this amendment the wage would go up.
Commissioner Butler stated that this rate of pay will be figured into the bids submitted to the County, so
the County not the employer, will end up paying for the pay increase. He further stated that, on the other
hand, if there is no healthcare provision, the County foots the medical bills.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that bidders will not risk losing the bid, and will cut their profit to obtain
the bid.
Commissioner Hansen stated that based on the $7,000 figure, he advocated $13.25 per hour without
health benefits. He stated that this moves forward towards giving the employees health benefits.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that it is not known whether the contractors have insurance in place that
covers the employee only or the family. He believed that an entire family would not be covered by a
small company.
Commissioner Hansen asked why this should take a year to review.
Chairman Murphy stated that the issue could be revisited in six months.
Commissioner Gonnan stated that this living wage might de-incentify the very companies that the County
is trying to attract.

Commissioner Gorman moved that the following language be added: "Annually, the Cook County
Assessor shall analyze and review the property tax incentives program to determine whether the
living wage program has resulted in less application for and utilization of the incentive
classification. A report of this review shall be provided by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners." Commissioner Maldonado seconded. The motion carried.
.{fil

Annually, the Cook County Assessor's Office shall review and analyze the
propertv tax incentives program to detennine whether the living wage
program has resulted in less application for and utilization of the incentive
classification. A report of this review shall be provided by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners.

109

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 1, 2004

Chairman Murphy stated that she discussed this verbiage with the State's Attorney's Office who approved
it. She stated that the Department of Planning and Development also receives application for 6bs.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that the language should be edited to read "The Labor Committee shall
review and analyze."
Commissioner Hansen stated that he believed that it violates the law to do this by commission, and that
this falls under the aegis of the Assessor's Office.
Patrick Driscoll, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, State's Attorney 's Office, stated that each committee can
analyze whatever it wants, and stated that it is best not made by commission, but rather a report can be
made to the committee.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that it is the Department of Planning and Development that receives
applications for both Class 6b unincorporated as well as for the 24-month exemption, and that the
remainder of applications came through the Assessor's Office.
Jackie Harder, Economic Development Project Director, Department of Planning and Development,
clarified that all the incentive classes go through the Assessor's office, which is where they are
administered. The Department of Planning and Development does not administer the incentive program,
but they provide a report to the Board for the adoption of a resolution.
Commissioner Hansen asked where "Section B" is, and recommended that "Section B and C" be changed
to "Section C and D."
Commissioner Maldonado agreed.
Commissioner Gorman asked why "Section 28" is being removed.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that it is being removed at the State's Attorney' s suggestion.
Commissioner Maldonado clarified that Chainnan Murphy wants to reintegrate "Class 9" into the text.
Chairman Murphy stated that "C9" should be put in with the "6b" classification, because the person
developing property only has to devote 35% of his property to affordable housing residence and therefore
the developer should pay a living wage to employees. She further stated that the exemptions are " C7a,"
"C7b," "C8" "C9" and " L."
Commissioner Maldonado stated that for 30 years these for-profit developers have been receiving a
property tax incentive, and that the not-for-profits are exempt.
Commissioner Hansen noted that "6b" was left in; he noted it was underlined and therefore inserted.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that although the first proposed amendment included all of the
classification properties, the most recent amendment excludes all of the classes except 6b.
Chairman Murphy stated that "Section 7a" and "Section 7b" deal with contaminated property that would
cost the developer significantly more to make it usable. She stated that class "7a" is for property that is
abandoned and in disrepair and therefore would cost significantly more to build on it.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 1, 2004
Commissioner Maldonado noted that these properties are either landmark buildings or are in enterprise
areas, which are economically depressed, therefore, there is no point in penalizing them.
Chairman Murphy noted that the objective is to exempt the categories discussed and that both "6b" and
"9" would be left in.
Commissioner Hansen noted that "9" had already been deleted.
Chainnan Murphy requested that it be put back in, along with "6b," so that developers of affordable
housing would have to abide by the Living Wage Act.
Commissioner Hansen asked for clarification of"9."
Chairman Murphy replied that "9" concerns affordable housing developers, and that "C," "L," and "A"
have been removed.
Commissioner Maldonado moved that under Section 1, "Class 9" be added.
Commissioner Butler, the motion carried.

incentives from Cook County should be held to the same living wage standard as those

Commissioner Maldonado stated that in June, the administration stopped this ordinance. He stated that
only yesterday were concerns heard, and modifications made.
Chainnan Murphy read the notice into the record.
Commissioner Maldonado moved the approval of Communication No. 265627 as amended.
Seconded by Commissioner Butler, the motion carried.
