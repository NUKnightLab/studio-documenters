III.

Opening Remarks
In his opening remarks, Chairman Lerner noted that, while the CountyCare operation will clearly have a
financial side to it as well as a quality side to it, this Committee has chosen to not take that on as part of its
responsibility as an initial focus; rather, the Managed Care Committee is going to work with management to talk
about those interventions/actions/management prerogatives that help to manage a risk-based population.
Towards that end, the Committee is going to have many more discussions about what that means. It will
address questions such as: what is and is not directly under its control; what factors are societally-based, versus
institutionally-based; and how the System can work better to serve its patients and families by working together
to help manage their health status and their functional status. He stated that this is a work in progress; it will
change over time, but the focus will really be - given its population and its size, and where we want to go with
our population, how do we help them manage their health? There are all kinds of techniques and processes that
other health care organizations have implemented; the Committee will look at those to see if they are valid for
the CountyCare Health Plan, and will bring in some outside perspectives as it does that.
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, provided additional comments. He stated that the organization
is early in its own journey of actually living in a managed care environment. Besides the development of the
ownership and operation of an insurance product itself, the organization’s maturity and understanding of how to
interact in a managed care environment and how the organization effectively interacts with its members, with a
large panoply of different kinds of plans in a dynamic environment, is a big part of what the Committee will be
discussing.

IV.

Overview
Doug Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, provided an overview and introduction
to the subject. He stated that there will be a lot of innovations employed in this area that will not be seen from
other managed care plans; one example is an initiative regarding housing. Housing is a key determinant for
those with behavioral health issues; if they have stable housing, they do better, and they are a better financial
risk. Additionally, he noted that they working to address housing needs for a small number of people who have
sickle-cell disease and who are homeless, because that is a disease that is very much affected by stress; higher
stress means higher costs. Another initiative planned is related to the concept of food as medicine and what that
means; the administration expects to start a pilot program to determine whether people’s medical situations,
ability to function and cost of their care can be addressed by looking at food as medicine.
Board Chairman Hammock noted that this will also have significant impact on how the administration focuses
its staff resources – there will be much more activities that take place outside of the hospital setting, and that
will require adjustments from top to bottom on how staff are employed. Mr. Elwell concurred; he stated that, in
some cases, it will require re-training of some employees to do something different, in others, it will require a
whole new skill set.

Report on CountyCare Health Plan (Attachment #1)
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided an overview of the Report on the CountyCare
Health Plan. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Mr. Glass noted that, with regard to membership, in the month of January, another 11,000 members were added
to the ranks; most of the increase is due to auto-assignments of Family Health Plan members. He added that, on
February 1st, data is reflecting that membership will be increased by an additional 31,000 members. The
Committee discussed the subjects of the redetermination process and auto-assignments; Chairman Lerner noted
that it would be helpful to receive some education on those topics at a future meeting1.
With regard to the information contained in slide 4 of the presentation, Board Chairman Hammock requested
further clarification on the data; in the column containing the FY’15 Budget data, it appeared that the sum of the
categories did not add up to the total monthly membership figure. Mr. Glass concurred; he stated that he will
revise to reflect the correct numbers. Chairman Lerner stated that it would be helpful to not only to look at
trending of actuals, but to also trend against the budget2.
On slide 7, regarding risk management metrics, Chairman Lerner requested that a key be provided to reflect the
designation of the colors of red, yellow and green for that data3.
The Committee discussed the subject of primary care medical home assignment. Mr. Glass stated that Medicaid
beneficiaries have the right to switch their primary care provider once in every calendar month. With the choice
process, members are locked into their health plan, but once they are in a plan, they can switch their primary
care providers once every 30 calendar days. He indicated that he will investigate further to see if this is a metric
that can be pulled, to see how many members switch on a regular basis.
Board Chairman Hammock referenced a recent article regarding hospitals that are penalized primarily by
Medicare for readmissions. Mr. Glass clarified that the number referenced in this data (21%) represents
readmissions of CountyCare Health Plan members; he stated that they have not yet broken out whether there is
a higher percentage of readmissions at certain hospitals versus others. Additionally, he noted that he has
requested detail on the percentage of readmissions for the same diagnosis.

Report on CountyCare Health Plan (continued)
Board Chairman Hammock noted that, as Chairman Lerner mentioned, this Committee is not expecting to cover
aspects relating to finance and quality that are covered by other Standing Committees. However, he asked that
this Committee work closely with the Finance and Quality and Patient Safety Committees so that metrics for the
other two Committees could be overlaid on Managed Care, and are not lost in a larger set of hospital or other
metrics.
Director Junge inquired regarding the post-corrections population; she asked whether staff can ask the applicant
whether their children are eligible during the application process. Mr. Glass responded that, as staff works with
the adult around their access to benefits, he is unsure as to what extent they are screening; he indicated that he
will research that question further.

VI.

Adjourn
Director Junge, seconded by Chairman Lerner, moved to adjourn. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY and the meeting adjourned.

Respectfully submitted,
Managed Care Committee of the
Board of Directors of the

colors of red, yellow and green for that data. Page 2.

Follow-up: research further – outstanding questions: 1) availability of data on members who switch primary care
providers; 2) whether there is a higher percentage of readmissions at certain hospitals versus others
within the CountyCare network; 3) availability of data on readmissions for same diagnosis; and 4)
post-corrections population –regarding screening process and ability to inquire/determine if applicant
has children who may be eligible.
