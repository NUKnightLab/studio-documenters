WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of local
government pursuant to Article VII, Section 6(a) of the 1970 Illinois
Constitution; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that except as provided
below or when otherwise required by law, no Cook County bureau,
office, department, employee, or other Cook County agency or agent
shall condition the provision of Cook County benefits, opportunities, or
services on matters related to citizenship or immigrant status; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that it shall be the policy of the Cook
County Sheriff’s Office not to assist in the investigation of the
citizenship or immigrant status of any person unless such inquiry or
investigation is (a) integrally related to an investigation by the Cook
County Sheriff’s Office regarding a matter other than the individual’s
citizenship or immigrant status, such as criminal smuggling and
harboring of immigrants, or other crimes that have as an element of the
crime the illegality of a person’s presence, or (b) as otherwise required
by law. The Cook County Sheriff’s Office shall not make inquiries into
immigration status for the sole purpose of determining whether an
individual has violated the civil immigration laws; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that except when otherwise required
by law, no Cook County bureau, office, department, or employee or
other Cook County agency or agent shall disclose information regarding
the citizenship or immigrant status of any person unless required to do so

or guardian; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 18, 2007
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Bureau of

benefits, opportunities, or services on matters related to citizenship or
immigrant status, but may, in the course of determining eligibility for
benefits or seeking reimbursement from state, federal, or other third party
payers, inquire about immigrant status for the sole purpose of such a
determination or receipt of reimbursement from said sources and, to such
extent as the disclosure of such information is related to such a
determination or receipt of reimbursement, the provisions of this
Resolution and any subsequent ordinance do not apply to the CCBH; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that except when otherwise required
by law, where presentation of an Illinois driver’s license or identification
card is accepted as adequate evidence of identity, presentation of a photo
identity document issued by the person’s nation of origin, such as a
driver’s license, passport, or matricula consular (consulate-issued
document) shall be accepted and shall not subject the person to a higher
level of scrutiny or different treatment than if the person had provided an
Illinois driver’s license or identification card except that this provision
does not apply to the completion of the federally mandated I-9 forms
provided, however, that a request for translation of such document to
English shall not be deemed a violation of any provision of this
Resolution and any subsequent ordinance; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Resolution does not create or
form the basis for liability on the part of the County, its agents, or
agencies. The exclusive remedy for violation of this Resolution shall be
through the County’s disciplinary procedures for officers and employees
under regulations including, but not limited to, County personnel rules,
union contracts, civil service commission rules, or any other agency rules
and/or regulations. Any person alleging a violation of this Resolution
shall forward a complaint to the Cook County Office of the Inspector
General (“Inspector General”) who shall process it in accordance with
the complaint-processing procedures established in the Cook County
Code (Vol. I, Ch. 2, Art. IV, Div. 5, Sec. 2-285); and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that any applications, questionnaires
and interview forms used in relation to Cook County benefits,

Resolution to require the disclosure of such information or (b) otherwise
required by law, shall be, in the best judgment of the pertinent agency,
either deleted in its entirety or revised such that the disclosure is no
longer required. Such review and revision shall be completed within
ninety (90) days of the passage of this Resolution.

PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
ANTHONY J. PERAICA, County Commissioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, residents of Cook County are already overburdened by high taxes at the federal, state,
county and municipal levels; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government continues to waste taxpayers money on patronage employees,
many of whom do little or no work; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government wastes taxpayers money on contracts to politically connected
firms which often do poor or incomplete work; and
WHEREAS, the Bureau of Health Services has added to the County budget problems by amassing
millions of dollars in uncollected debt that is owed to the County; and
WHEREAS, the 2007 budget trimmed front line workers from the payroll and eliminated many vital
programs and services, while protecting political insiders; and
WHEREAS, President Stroger proceeded to hire many of his friends and relatives to high-salaried
positions while low salaried workers were being laid off; and
WHEREAS, President Stroger and his administration unilaterally modified the budget after it was
approved by this Board and redirected millions of dollars as they deemed appropriate; and

3383

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 18, 2007
WHEREAS, some commissioners are now proposing to shore up the budget deficit by placing an even
larger burden on Cook County taxpayers; and
WHEREAS, it is unconscionable for the Cook County Board President and members of this Honorable
Body to require taxpayers to make larger sacrifices without making sacrifices ourselves; and
WHEREAS, the people of Cook County need visionary leadership from their County Commissioners
and County Board President as opposed to wasteful spending and ever-increasing taxes and fees; and
WHEREAS, the County would have more than enough money to fund its operations if the waste and
fraud were eliminated and the revenues due the County were collected in a timely manner.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners do hereby declare a moratorium on raising or imposing any new taxes for the 2008 fiscal
year budget.

A RESOLUTION CALLING ON COMMISSIONER FORREST CLAYPOOL TO INTRODUCE
A RESOLUTION RESCINDING AMENDMENT 2L TO THE FISCAL YEAR 2007
EXECUTIVE RECOMMENDATION GRANTING AN EXCESSIVE INCREASE IN PAY
TO STAFF OF THE 12TH COUNTY DISTRICT
WHEREAS, in February 2007 the financial crisis facing Cook County Government was devastating,
with a half billion dollar deficit standing in the way of a balanced budget; and
WHEREAS, Cook County Board President Todd H. Stroger, with the support of this Board, passed a
balanced budget which forced some tough choices for all Commissioners to meet targeted budget cuts of
17% in each office; and
WHEREAS, several amendments were offered to President Stroger’s Executive Recommendation, many
of which sought to alter the recommendation; and
WHEREAS, a key amendment, purported to be an “alternative budget” was introduced by Commissioner
Forrest Claypool; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Claypool has represented this failed amendment as an effort to “chop from
the top” those whose salaries are excessive in an effort to protect “front-line workers”; and

3384

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 18, 2007
WHEREAS, despite the call to cut at the highest levels of government, Commissioner Claypool also
introduced Amendment 2L on February 22 which would make it possible for his personal aide to increase
his salary to $90,000 after the recently passed Cost of Living Adjustments went into effect; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Claypool’s personal aide is now the highest-paid staff member of any
district office; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Claypool is the only Commissioner who does not serve on any committee of
the Board, or chair any committee of the Board beyond the committees of the whole; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Claypool’s staff work load is significantly lighter than the work load of
those Commissioners because Commissioner Claypool has chosen to serve on only the mandated
committees of the whole; and
WHEREAS, the Chicago Sun-Times Sneed Column dated September 12, 2007 pointed out the disparity
in salaries between Commissioner Claypool’s staff and other Commissioners’ staff members; and
WHEREAS, such a disparity is unprecedented and an embarrassment to the office of Commissioner
Claypool and to the entire Cook County Board.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby request that Commissioner Forrest Claypool introduce a resolution to rescind Amendment 2L to
the Fiscal Year 2007 Executive Recommendation granting an excessive increase in pay to one staff
member of the 12th County District staff; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Resolution to be introduced by Commissioner Claypool should
include instruction to the appropriate County departments to adjust the staff member’s salary to the
original recommended FY 2007 level in the FY 2008 budget.

REGARDING THE COOK COUNTY BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVICES
NEIGHBORHOOD REFERRAL SERVICE
WHEREAS, on January 24, 2007, Dr. Robert R. Simon, Bureau Chief for the Cook County Bureau of
Health Services (“Dr. Simon”) (the “Health Bureau”) distributed a memorandum to the Executive
Directors of the Neighborhood Referral Program Health Centers (the “Clinics”) stating that due to a major
budget crisis, the Health Bureau must discontinue a partnership with the Clinics that had previously
allowed the Clinics to refer patients directly into the Health Bureau system (the “IRIS Program”); and

3385

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 18, 2007
WHEREAS, the Clinics expressed disapproval of Dr. Simon’s decision and the Board of Commissioners
held a public hearing to discuss the matter on May 23, 2007; and
WHEREAS, following a summit of Clinics, Health Bureau personnel and President Todd H. Stroger on
June 13, 2007 (the “IRIS Summit”), President Stroger called for a 90-day reprieve on the termination of
the IRIS Program, during which time the Clinics and senior Health Bureau personnel agreed to discuss
ways to increase the number of insured patients referred by the Clinics to the Health Bureau through the
IRIS Program; and
WHEREAS, following the grant of the 90-day reprieve by President Stroger on June 13, 2007,
discussions between the Clinics and senior Health Bureau personnel ensued, resulting in a draft of a
Memorandum of Understanding that was distributed to the Clinics on August 20, 2007; and
WHEREAS, to date, of the 18 organizations whose Clinics use the IRIS Program, only two have signed
the Memorandum of Understanding as proposed, and only two of the Clinics have informed the Health
Bureau of specific changes that are needed in order to sign the Memorandum of Understanding; and
WHEREAS, the 90-day reprieve expired on September 11, 2007; and
WHEREAS, it is the wish of this honorable body that Dr. Simon make a formal presentation to the Board
of Commissioners regarding the status of the IRIS Program, any updates regarding the budgetary
constraints that led to the termination of the IRIS Program as used by the Clinics, and any updates
regarding the participation by the Clinics.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Dr. Simon be invited to make a formal presentation to
this Board of Commissioners no later than September 28, 2007 to discuss the IRIS Program in general
and the status of agreements with the Clinics specifically.

control of the court in 2008. The expiration date of the current contract is September 30,
2007.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $38,000.00 (FY 2007: $12,680.00; and FY 2008: $25,320.00). Contract

requesting authorization to accept a no-cost grant extension from October 1, 2007 through March 31,
2008 from the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA). This extension will enable our
office to expend the remaining grant funds that were awarded. This grant provides funding for the DNA
Training and Prosecution Program. The DNA Training and Prosecution Program provides training,
support and assistance to assistant state’s attorneys in cases involving DNA evidence. The program works
to best utilize limited DNA testing resources by being an internal resource for other bureaus of the office
for the purpose of teaching and consulting on how to make better use of DNA evidence and expedite
cases. In addition, the program helps to prepare all assistant state’s attorneys for the continued growth
and importance that DNA technology has to law enforcement. In addition, the program investigates and
prosecutes some complex cases that involve DNA evidence. The DNA Training and Prosecution Program
dedicates one (1) assistant state’s attorney, one (1) DNA Resource Specialist, two (2) investigators and
one (1) administrative support staff to the Criminal Prosecutions Bureau of the State’s Attorney’s Office.
This grant requires that our office match one dollar for each three dollars of federal funding. A cash
match from the Capital Litigation Fund that partially supports the salary and fringe benefits of the grantfunded assistant state’s attorney and one (1) investigator fulfills the match commitment for this program.

Submitting a request from
MICHELLE MARKIEWICZ-QUALKINBUSH, Mayor, City of Calumet City
Re:

No Cash Bid Request Package for the City of Calumet City.

This correspondence will serve as notification of the interest of the City of Calumet City, a municipal
corporation, in receiving a No Cash Bid for the parcels listed below. This request package contains 55
property index numbers.
All of the parcels listed are vacant and without improvement, except Property Index Number 30-07-327028-0000, on which sits the City of Calumet City Police Department and which use will remain the same.
It is the intention of the City of Calumet City to use all parcels for the redevelopment of the areas in
which the parcels are located. The redevelopment of the parcels will return the property to a viable use
beneficial to the municipality. The redevelopment will also return the properties to a tax producing status,
thereby generating economic development for the municipality and other taxing bodies.
The City of Calumet City, at this time, does not have an immediate intention to convey any Tax
Certificate of Purchase from Cook County or any perfected deed to any Third Party Requestor. Also, the
City of Calumet City will accept an assignment of all Tax Certificate of Purchase from Cook County and
will undertake such legal proceedings and tax search services as necessary to obtain a tax deed and will
bear all legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of the parcels. Also, the City of Calumet
City agrees to submit, to the Cook County Offices of Economic Development, No Cash Bid Reports on
the status of each parcel for five years or until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as
required by the Cook County No Cash Bid Ordinance.

CITY OF MARKHAM
NO CASH BID REQUEST
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 10, 2007 from
DEBORAH SIMS, Chairman, Tax Delinquency Subcommittee
Submitting a request from
DAVID WEBB, JR., Mayor, City of Markham
Re:

County “No Cash Bids” on 91 Parcels owned by the City of Markham

On behalf of the City of Markham, I formally make application for Cook County “No Cash Bids” on 91
parcels. It is specifically requested that, if approved by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, the
“no cash bids” be made as “over the counter” forfeiture tax purchases.
This application, being made on behalf of the City of Markham, is somewhat unusual because the purpose
of the City’s request is NOT to acquire the 91 parcels by tax deed proceedings. In fact, the City is
currently the record title holder of all 91 parcels and has owned the 91 parcels since December 7, 1992.
The purpose of the City’s request is to extinguish longstanding real estate tax liens on its property which
should have been exempt from taxation for the years in question. In the event the Board of
Commissioners is willing to assist the City of Markham in this manner, it will make possible the transfer
of the 91 parcels to the Natural Land Institute, which intend to preserve the land in its natural state as a
natural land preserve for future generations. In exchange for the 91 parcels, the Natural Land Institute
will convey to the City a tract of land of similar acreage, which will be the site of future economic
development in the City.
The following documentation is submitted in accordance with the City’s application for Cook County
“No Cash Bids.”
1.

List of Permanent Index Numbers (PINs) and Volume Number for each parcel (Exhibit A). As
previously indicated, the intended use of the 91 parcels is to prohibit development in order to
preserve the land in its natural state, as a natural land preserve for future generations;

2.

Certified Ordinance of the City of Markham formally requesting Cook County “No Cash Bids”
which includes the PIN and volume number for each of the 91 parcels and the intended use for the
parcels (Exhibit B);

3.

A current letter of opinion issued by the Chicago Title Insurance Company establishing the title
status on all 91 parcels (Exhibit C);

4.

A Sidwell Tax Map showing the location of all 91 parcels (Exhibit D); and,

5.

Photographs of the 91 parcels (Group Exhibit E);

3443

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 18, 2007
As previously indicated, and as set forth in the Ordinance submitted hereto, the benefit to the City of
Markham (provided the County Board agree to make the requested “no cash bids” on its behalf) will be
twofold. First, the City will be able to convey title to the 91 parcels to the Natural Land Institute, free and
clear of outstanding real estate tax liens, who will, under its stewardship, preserve and protect the
property as a natural land preserve for future generations. Second, the City will receive, in exchange,
title to a similar sized tract of land from the Natural Land Institute, which it will be able to economically
develop. Such economic development will provide jobs, increase the City’s tax base, and generally
benefit the City and its citizens.
On behalf of the City of Markham, it is further represented that the City has retained me to cause the
outstanding county tax liens to be extinguished and otherwise complete the real estate transaction set forth
herein and in the Ordinance submitted as Exhibit B. The City and the Natural Land Institute will bear all
legal and other costs associated with extinguishing the real estate tax liens and completing the real estate
transactions described herein.
In the event the documentation provided is deficient in any way, kindly contact me so I can supplement
the documentation provided, per your requirements.

VILLAGE OF BROOKFIELD
NO CASH BID REQUEST
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 31, 2007 from
DEBORAH SIMS, Chairman, Tax Delinquency Subcommittee
Submitting a request from
RICCARDO F. GINEX, Village Manager, Village of Brookfield
The Village of Brookfield, Illinois, would like to apply to make an over-the-counter no-cash bid for the
following parcel:
Volume 176

15-34-100-001-0000.

This request package contains one PIN. This parcel is located at 3101 Grand Boulevard, Brookfield,
Illinois 60513. This parcel is a corner lot upon which a welcome sign for the Village of Brookfield is
located, and the Village intends to continue to use this parcel for that purpose. By allowing the Village to
obtain this parcel through the Cook County No-Cash Bid Program, the Village will be able to continue to
accommodate the maintenance of its welcome sign.

3445

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 18, 2007
Submitted please find the ordinance passed by the Village formally requesting that a no-cash bid be made
for this parcel. The Village agrees to submit an annual report on the status of this parcel for five years or
until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No-Cash Bid
Ordinance to the Cook County Office of Economic Development, 69 West Washington Street, Suite
2900, Chicago, Illinois 60602. Furthermore, the Village represents that no Third Party Request by a
developer or organization exists by which the no-cash bid for this parcel located in volume 176 with the
PIN 15-34-100-001-0000 will result in the conveyance of the perfected deed by the Village of Brookfield.
The following PIN was withdrawn from the list approved in the ordinance:
Volume 176

15-34-100-002-0000.

A no-cash bid for this PIN is no longer requested because a title search revealed that the property has not
been tax delinquent for two (2) years; and therefore, the property is not eligible for participation in the
Cook County No-Cash Bid Program.
The Village authorizes and directs the Village attorneys, Storino, Ramello & Durkin, 9501 West Devon
Avenue, Rosemont, Illinois, 60018 to obtain the tax deed to this property. The Village of Brookfield will
bear all legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of this parcel.

VILLAGE OF NILES
NO CASH BID REQUEST
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 4, 2007 from
DEBORAH SIMS, Chairman, Tax Delinquency Subcommittee
Submitting a request from
NICHOLAS B. BLASE, Mayor, Village of Niles
Re: Request for a “No Cash Bid” On Certain Property Located in the Village of Niles
This letter is a formal request to place a property in the Village of Niles, Property Index Number 09-23103-065-0000 to be obtained by the Village of Niles through the “No Cash Bid” process. This request
contains one (1) Property Index Number. The property that Village seeks is situated between residential
parcels. It was originally to be an alley but was never deeded to the Village when the subdivision was
created. The Village wishes to own this property to be able to keep the option open to create an ally when
it becomes necessary. Owning the parcel will also assure the Village of its utility easements.

3446

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 18, 2007
The Village has retained legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all legal and other costs associated
with acquisition of the parcel. The contact information is as follows:
D. Danielle Grcic
Attorney at Law
8074 N. Milwaukee Ave
Niles, Illinois 60714
Also, the Village is willing and able to submit to the Cook County Office of Economic Development an
annual report on the status of the parcel for the next five (5) years.
There is no Third Party request for the parcel at the present time, nor will the Village entertain a third
party request in the future.

Commissioner Quigley asked the Budget Director if the budget department has the opportunity to review
overspent line items during the year.
Ms. Wilson stated that overspent items are being covered.

transfer to cover any overspending. He concurred with the Budget Director, that some departments may
have overspent, and do not have enough surplus appropriation to cover the transfer. At that point there
has to be some sort of interdepartmental transfer to clean up the account and to put it back where it should
be.

ORDINANCE AMENDING CHAPTER 2, ARTICLE VII, SECTIONS 2-561, 2-585 AND
2-601 (COOK COUNTY ETHICS ORDINANCE) OF THE COOK COUNTY CODE
(PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT).
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance
Amendment sponsored by William M. Beavers, County Commissioner.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance Amendment:
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AN AMENDMENT TO CHAPTER 2
ARTICLE VII OF THE COOK COUNTY CODE
WHEREAS, it is crucial that the people of the County of Cook have trust, respect and
confidence in those who are elected to public office; and
WHEREAS, it is equally crucial that the citizenry have absolute faith in the integrity of the
electoral process by which our public officials are chosen; and
WHEREAS, to accomplish this, the County of Cook has adopted certain rules and
regulations including campaign finance laws that establish, among other things, limitations on
the amounts of political contributions that may be made by individuals and entities doing
business with the County, registered lobbyists and other entities that have an interest in
influencing the policies and decisions of County government; and
WHEREAS, these laws limit the amount of money that such individuals and entities may
contribute to candidates for public office to $1,500 during a single candidacy and $3,000
during an election year; and
WHEREAS, it is the intent of the elected officials within the County of Cook to reduce the
ability of entities to brazenly ignore these limitations, thereby restoring faith in the integrity
of the electoral process and the candidates who might otherwise benefit from these abuses;
and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook wishes to strengthen its campaign finance laws to prevent
persons or entities with a financial or other interest in the decisions made by County
government from attempting to manipulate the County’s campaign finance laws through
cynically clever and circuitous financing and contribution methods; and
WHEREAS, this ordinance is intended to put an end to this untenable situation, to close any
real or perceived loopholes, and to avoid future abuses of the County’s campaign finance
laws by the very people these laws were intended to constrain.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners
that Chapter 2, Article VII, Sections 2-561, 2-585 and 2-601 of the Cook County Code are
hereby amended as follows:

the contrary contained in this Code of Ordinances, any person found by a court to be
guilty of knowingly making or accepting contributions in excess of the amounts

to notice on Tuesday, May 15, 2007 at the hour of 2:30 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County
Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
283674

THE COOK COUNTY ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CLIMATE CHANGE
MITIGATION ACT (PROPOSED ORDINANCE). Submitting a Proposed Ordinance
sponsored by Forrest Claypool, and Mike Quigley, County Commissioners; Cosponsored by Elizabeth “Liz” Doody Gorman, Mike Quigley, Roberto Maldonado,
Anthony J. Peraica and Peter N. Silvestri, County Commissioners.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
THE COOK COUNTY ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AND CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION ACT
WHEREAS, the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) provides a means for governments
and firms to enter into a voluntary, legally binding agreement to reduce their emissions of
six greenhouse gasses by 1.2 percent each year from 2006 to 2010; and
WHEREAS, the CCX operates under a standard “cap-and-trade” system: each emitter is
allocated a certain number of credits and the number of credits is lowered each successive
year, allowing entities that reduce their emissions below their requirements to sell credits
and those that do not meet their requirements to purchase them; and
WHEREAS, many governments including the City of Chicago, King County,
Washington, and the State of Mexico as well as many Fortune 500 companies including
Ford, IBM, and DuPont have joined the CCX and committed themselves to reductions;
and
WHEREAS, Chicago reduced its direct greenhouse gas emissions by nearly nine percent
from its baseline (an average of between 1998 and 2001) and 2003, a reduction of over
30,000 tons of global warming pollution; and
WHEREAS, the City’s steps to improve energy efficiency in City buildings led to the
auditing and retrofitting of 15 million square feet of public buildings, allowing the City
and sister agencies to save $6 million annually.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that Chapter 30, Article III, Division 1, Section 30-326 be enacted as
follows:

3540

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 18, 2007

Sec. 30-326
(a)

Short title.
This Ordinance shall be known as “The Cook County Climate Change
Mitigation Act.”

(b)

Joining the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX).
Cook County shall enter into Phase II of the CCX, committing to a
reduction of 1.2 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions each year
between 2006 and 2010.
The County will deliver energy consumption and other relevant data to
the CCX which will assist the County in creating an emissions baseline
from future reductions will be measured.
The County will develop a strategic plan within three months of the
passage of this ordinance that outlines where the County will cut
greenhouse gas emissions by the amounts required—or exceeding the
amounts required—in Phase II of CCX. This plan will be made publicly
available through the President’s Web site.
As the emissions reduction plan is implemented, the County will sell any
extra emissions credits that it has on the CCX’s online trading platform.

* Referred to the Committee on Environmental Control on 12/19/06.
Leave was granted to change the listing of sponsors and co-sponsors to include Chairman Quigley as one

Any owner of a site which is required by the State of Illinois to have an air pollution
operating permit shall also obtain a filing permit from the Cook County Department of
Environmental Control within 30 days of receipt of its state permit and every three years
thereafter. The owner also must pay annual emissions fees based upon the tonnage of
pollutants emitted.
This requirement does not apply to sites permitted by the Illinois Environmental Agency
solely as (1) retail liquid dispensing facilities that have air pollution control equipment or
(2) agrichemical facilities with an endorsed permit pursuant to Section 39.4 of the Illinois
Environmental Protection Act. The owner or operator of a portable emission unit, as
defined in 35 Ill. Adm. Code 201.170 of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act, may
change the site of any unit previously permitted without paying an additional fee under
this Section for each site change, provided that no further change to the permit is
otherwise necessary or requested.
Notwithstanding any rules to the contrary, the owner of a permitted site shall remit to the
Cook County Department of Environmental Control the following filing permit fees,
payable every three years upon obtaining or renewing a permit, and annual emissions
fees:

3544

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 18, 2007

(1) A site permitted to emit less than 25 tons per year of any combination of
regulated air pollutants as reported by its previous year Annual Illinois Air Emission
Report (AER), shall pay a filing permit fee of $1,000 plus an annual emissions fee of $5
per ton of the total tonnage of any combination of regulated air pollutants.
(2) A site permitted to emit at least 25 tons per year but less than 50 tons per
year of any combination of regulated air pollutants as reported by its previous year AER,
shall pay a filing permit fee of $1,500 plus an annual emissions fee of $10 per ton of the
total tonnage of any combination of regulated air pollutants.
(3) A site permitted to emit at least 50 tons but less than 100 tons per year of any
combination of regulated air pollutants as reported by its previous year AER, shall pay a
filing permit fee of $2,000 plus an annual emissions fee of $15 per ton of the total
tonnage of any combination of regulated air pollutants.
(4) A site permitted to emit at least 100 tons per year of any combination of
regulated air pollutants as reported by its previous year AER, shall pay a filing permit fee
of $2,500 plus an annual emissions fee of $20 per ton of the total tonnage of any
combination of regulated air pollutants.
Section 30-396. Rules and Regulations.
(a)
The Cook County Department of Environmental Control shall establish
procedures for the collection of air pollution filing permit and annual emissions fees.
(b) The Cook County Department of Environmental Control (“Department”) may deny
an application for the issuance, transfer, or renewal of an air pollution operating permit if
any air pollution site fee owed by the applicant has not been paid within 60 days of the
due date, unless the applicant, at the time of application, pays to the Department in
advance the air pollution site fee for the site that is the subject of the operating permit,
plus any other air pollution site fees then owed by the applicant. The denial of an air
pollution operating permit for failure to pay an air pollution site fee shall be subject to
review by the County Environmental Control Board of Appeals pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 30, Article II, Division 4. Section 30-123 of the Counties Code.
(c) If the Cook County Department of Environmental Control determines that an owner
or operator of a site was required, but failed, to timely obtain an air pollution operating
permit, and as a result avoided the payment of permit fees, the Department may collect
the avoided permit fees with or without pursuing enforcement. The avoided permit fees
shall be calculated as double the amount that would have been owed had a permit been
timely obtained. Fees collected pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited into the
Cook County Environmental Management Fund
(d) If the Cook County Department of Environmental Control determines that an owner
or operator of a site was required, but failed, to timely obtain an air pollution operating
permit and as a result avoided the payment of permit fees, an enforcement action may be
brought. In addition to any other relief that may be obtained as part of this action, the
Cook County Department of Environmental Control may seek to recover the avoided
permit fees. The avoided permit fees shall be calculated as double the amount that would
have been owed had a permit been timely obtained. Fees collected pursuant to this
subsection (d) shall be deposited into the Cook County General Fund.

3545

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 18, 2007

(e) If a Permittee subject to a fee under this Section fails to pay the fee within 90 days of
its due date, or makes the fee payment from an account with insufficient funds to cover
the amount of the fee payment, the Department shall notify the Permittee of the failure to
pay the fee. If the Permittee fails to pay the fee within 60 days after such notification, the
Department may, by written notice, immediately revoke the air pollution operating
permit. Failure of the Cook County Department of Environmental Control to notify the
Permittee of failure to pay a fee due under this Section, or the payment of the fee from an
account with insufficient funds to cover the amount of the fee payment, does not excuse
or alter the duty of the Permittee to comply with the provisions of this Section.
Section 30-397. Emission Levels Reduction.
Permit Holders for sites where the levels of pollution emissions exceed 100 tons per year
of cumulative regulated air pollutants shall be required to submit an annual “Regulated
Air Pollutant Emission Reduction Plan” to the Cook County Department of
Environmental Control for the Department’s approval. Said plan shall detail efforts that
will be made to decrease the Site’s cumulative regulated pollutant emissions by 10%
within the term of the air pollution operating permit.
(a) Annual Regulated Air Pollutant Emission Reduction Plans submitted to the Cook
County Department of Environmental Control will be verified by reviewing the
Site/Permitee’s Illinois Annual Air Emission Report (AER).
(b) Established Regulated Air Pollutant emission reductions exceeding 10% on an annual
basis will allow a 10% credit reduction of the following year annual air permit fee.
(c) Failure to reduce Regulated Air Pollutant emissions as indicated in the County
approved Reduction Plan may result in penalty fees or loss of permit.
Section 30-398. Required Submission of Illinois Annual Air Emission Report.
(a) Each Site/Permittee shall be required to submit its Illinois AER to the Cook County
Department of Environmental Control within 1 month of the submittal of the AER to the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.
(b) Additionally, each Site/Permittee shall be required to submit quarterly reports
detailing the individual pollution emission levels for its fuel burning devices and
cumulative values of pollution emissions within the quarterly period.
Section 30-399. Effective Date. This Ordinance shall take effect within ninety (90)
days of passage.
Vice Chairman Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved to accept the Substitute
Ordinance for Communication No. 285200. The motion to accept the Substitute Ordinance carried.
After discussion, Mr. Givens stated that over the next several weeks his department would formulate a
concrete and definitive course of action to address the State’s Attorney’s opinion regarding overlap
between the municipal, county and state governments in enforcing environmental violations.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 18, 2007

(3)

a.

In general, automobiles should be replaced when they reach eight years
of service or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first.

b.

Departments shall request the smallest possible vehicle for the intended
use.

c.

Requests that do not meet these criteria will not be considered for
replacement unless the Department Head submits a written justification
to the Vehicle Steering Committee for the exception which documents
the extenuating circumstances.

d.

Only specialized equipment; such as heavy highway construction
equipment will be allowed to use other criteria such as hours of service,
however the criteria utilized by the Department should be submitted to
justify the vehicle replacement request, and the Vehicle Steering
Committee will determine if this information is adequate and the
maintenance cost information required.

e.

A request for a new vehicle which increases the number of vehicles in
the department's vehicle inventory shall be submitted to the Vehicle
Steering Committee with a written justification as to why the additional
vehicles will be required. Such request must demonstrate that
reassignment of existing vehicles would be unable to meet department
needs and that sufficient funding is available for both the purchase and
the cost of operating and maintaining the vehicle. The request to
purchase must state the use intended for the vehicle, whether the vehicle
will be assigned with 'take home' privileges and whether the vehicle will
bear a municipal license plate.

f.

Departments shall submit draft vehicle requests to the Vehicle Steering
Committee at the same time they submit capital budget requests to the
Department of Budget and Management Services. Finalized vehicle
requests shall be submitted to the Vehicle Steering Committee within one
month of Board approval of the annual appropriation ordinance or the

f.g.

If sufficient funds are available and other conditions of the ordinance
have been complied with, the Vehicle Steering Committee may concur in
the request for new or replacement vehicles. Such concurrence shall be
transmitted to the Purchasing Agent, and where County Board approval
is required for the purchase, such concurrence shall be reflected on the
County Board's Agenda.

New County Vehicle purchases must adhere to the following green vehicle
purchasing guidelines:
a.

Preference shall be given to vehicles in the following order. Purchase
requests from categories other than Subsection (c)(3)1 of this section

Submitting a Proposed Resolution

Patricia Murphy and Peter N. Silvestri, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION DIRECTING THE BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVICES TO
DISCONTINUE FILLING PRESCRIPTIONS FOR NON-COOK COUNTY
RESIDENTS
WHEREAS, the Bureau of Health Services and its hospitals and clinics serve as the
anchor for the safety net serving the metropolitan Chicago region’s ever-increasing
number of uninsured or underinsured citizens, not only in Cook County, but also the
neighboring counties and in some cases beyond; and

3566

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 18, 2007

WHEREAS, the Bureau of Health Services not only provides health care services, but
also pharmacy prescription services to said citizens; and
WHEREAS, for the period of September 1st, 2006 to December 31st, 2006, 6% of all
prescriptions were filled and delivered to non-Cook County resident patients for a total of
257,000 prescriptions at a cost of $4.6 million; and
WHEREAS, under the leadership of the Board of Commissioners and President Stroger,
the Bureau of Health Services has and continues to make a concerted effort to resolve its
financial shortcomings; and
WHEREAS, despite these ongoing efforts, further cuts in core services may result
without increased funding; and
WHEREAS, Cook County cannot continue to provide care for the indigent population for
both residents and non-residents of Cook County, without increased assistance from other
governments, providers, insurers and health care stakeholders; and
WHEREAS, in order to avoid additional cuts in services, the Bureau of Health Services
must consider ceasing the provision of non-emergency medical services including
pharmaceuticals to Non-Cook County resident patients; and
WHEREAS, this measure is needed to preserve the already limited county healthcare
resources to provide for the residents of Cook County and stop this loss of revenue to our
taxpayers.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners does hereby request that the Bureau of Health Services discontinue the
provision of non-emergency pharmaceuticals to Non-Cook County resident patients,
thereby conserving healthcare resources for the residents of Cook County.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION AMENDMENT (PENDING)
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners does hereby request that the Bureau of Health Services discontinue the
provision of non-emergency pharmaceuticals to uninsured Non-Cook County resident
patients, or those not eligible for Medicare and Medicaid Benefits effective December 1,
2007 unless the patients residing county enters into a Governmental Agreement with Cook
County to reimburse the county for such services thereby conserving healthcare resources
for the residents of Cook County.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this resolution shall be implemented through the
following recommendations from the Bureau of Health Services:
1. Provide emergency service and fill prescription for emergency department visits
regardless of county of residence.
2. All clinic visits for out-of-county patients must be referred to Limit of Liability (LOL)
with appointment for screening, etc. before prescription is filled.

3567

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 18, 2007

Limit of Liability (LOL) provides the out-of-county patients who have no form of
payment, with a list of collar counties Public Health Departments and County Board
office numbers for any assistance programs available to indigent patients in their county.
3. All in-patients will be given only a 1 month supply of medication and referred to Limit
of Liability (LOL) (should already be done) for processing. If the patient qualifies for a
program, continue to provide prescription services as we would for an in-county resident.
If not, Limit of Liability (LOL)_ provides the same list of other counties information as in
#2. Patient is advised that they must get their refills through their own county’s system.
4. Recommend that a strong attempt be made to contract with collar counties to pay
Medicaid rates for scripts and clinic visits by their medically indigent patients.
5. No mail order prescriptions will be filled after a letter is sent with the final refill. A
letter should be sent to non-county residents stating that “this will be the last script filled
(one month supply) and to contact their local county public health department.” For
emergency refills, the patient will need to come to the Emergency Room or Ambulatory
Screening Clinic. This would be humane and more than that which is offered in other
places.
