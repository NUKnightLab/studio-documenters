 Understanding Diabetes

•

This means there is too much sugar in your blood. You may not have
enough of a hormone called insulin.

•

If you have Type 1 diabetes your body can no longer make insulin.

•

If you have Type 2 diabetes your body may still make insulin, but your
cells resist its effects or you cannot make enough insulin.

Many patients are well controlled but about one third of our patients are poorly
controlled (A1C>9%) with bad complications.

Significance of this study

What is already known about this subject?

Patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes usu-
ally harbor the disease for a few years before being
diagnosed. These patients occasionally present with
complications at the time of diagnosis.

What are the new findings?

In underinsured ethnic minority patients with newly
diagnosed type 2 diabetes, there is a much high-
er prevalence of complications when compared
with insured patients with newly diagnosed type 2
diabetes.

How might these results change the focus of

research or clinical practice?

The changing landscape of health insurance in the
USA may result in less coverage especially for mi-
nority populations resulting in higher risks of compli-
cations at the time of diagnosis of diabetes.
