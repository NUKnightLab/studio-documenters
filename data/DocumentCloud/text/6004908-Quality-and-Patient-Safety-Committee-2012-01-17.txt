III.

Report from System Chief Medical Officer (continued)
Chairman Ansell inquired regarding the progress on the Regional Outpatient Center (ROC). Dr. Mason
responded that, currently, they are working on the transition of Immediate Care Center to the E Building; he
expects that they will be operational in the E Building by the first of February. He stated that the patient
volume in the Immediate Care Center has decreased to approximately twelve to thirteen patients between
the hours of 11:00 P.M. and 7:00 A.M.; this was anticipated, and will make the transition to the E Building
easier. With regard to the ROC, Dr. Claudia Fegan, Chief Medical Officer of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital
of Cook County, stated that services are being gradually added; nephrology services began to be provided
there in June, and pain services began to be provided in September. Dr. Mason stated that they are in the
process of trying to hire additional specialists, particularly the urologists. He added that they are going to
move to a point-of-care testing so that Laboratory and X-Ray services that were being done twenty-four
hours per day/seven days per week, can be discontinued. Dr. Mason noted that targets have not yet been
met with regards to increasing volumes in other areas; meetings to address this subject are planned.
Death of youth while in custody at the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC)
Dr. Mason reviewed some of the details surrounding the death of a youth while in custody at the JTDC over
the weekend; this involved a sixteen year-old young man who collapsed after playing basketball and became
without pulse or blood pressure. A team was urgently called; the young man was transferred to Stroger
Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The autopsy is still pending; Dr. Mason stated that he hopes to
receive more information once the autopsy has been concluded.
Re-Start Program
The Re-Start Program, a month-long healthy living program that includes weekly meetings, started this year
at the beginning of January; this year’s program includes smoking cessation. The community response to
this healthy living initiative continues to grow. Dr. Mason stated that there were 425 attendees at the first
meeting; the second meeting’s attendance totaled 850. The meeting scheduled for tonight is expected to
draw 1,000 attendees.

IV.

Report from System Interim Chief Nursing Officer
Tanda Russell, System Interim Chief Nursing Officer, provided an update on nurse staffing. She stated that
there were a significant number of retirements in the month of December that impacted the nursing units. A
Med-Surg planning committee was convened to look at bed closures; twenty-four to twenty-eight beds in the
Med-Surg units were closed to reduce the nurse-patient ratios.
The ultimate priority over the next three to four weeks is to aggressively recruit for nursing at all levels to
support the re-opening of those beds. Some additional orientation sessions have been held for agency staffing,
and management has been working closely with the unions to implement some internal shift changes, so that
beds can be re-opened.
This has created some impact on the Emergency Department. Dr. Fegan noted that this has pushed management
to take a further look at throughput issues. In response to a question from Chairman Ansell regarding the time
to onboard a new employee, Ms. Russell stated that once the decision has been made to hire an individual and
an offer has been made and accepted, it generally takes forty-five to sixty days to complete the process (which
includes credentialing, background checks, etc.); she noted that they are working with Human Resources to try
to expedite that process.

IX.

Adjourn
Prior to adjournment of the meeting, an issue that occurred recently was presented by Ms. Driscoll, relating to a
pregnant patient who had believed she was in labor, and was waiting in the Emergency Department at Stroger
Hospital, without being immediately seen. Ms. Driscoll thought that pregnant patients were to go directly to
Labor & Delivery for immediate care, and not be routed through the Emergency Department. Shirley BomarCole, System Deputy Chief Operations Officer, stated that the expectation is that pregnant patients who are
deemed to be in active labor are to go directly to the fourth floor. She stated that she will review the matter to
further investigate, and will report the findings back to the Committee.

Director Butler, seconded by Chairman Ansell, moved to adjourn. The motion carried
unanimously and the meeting was ADJOURNED.

 ABSTRACT
Saint James Hospital in Olympia Fields closed its Level 1 Trauma Center on July 1 2008. This Trauma Center
had cared for acutely injured patients in the southern suburban area of Cook County since the inception of the
Illinois Trauma System in 1988. The Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) has documented the
serious health problems facing southern Cook County, which has been complicated by major demographic
shifts, growing poverty and high injury and homicide rates. As the Cook County Health and Hospitals System
implements its strategic plan, an important policy question is how to address the trauma needs of southern
Cook County. The Cook County Department of Public Health on behalf of the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System contracted with the School of Public Health University of Illinois to assess the impact of the
closure of trauma services at Saint James Hospital at Olympia Fields on southern Cook County. CCDPH
created a Project Management Team to guide the analysis and conclusions and make recommendations. The
Project Management Team included faculty from the School of Public Health, staff from CCDPH, and
multidisciplinary staff from the Department of Trauma at Stroger Hospital as well as Trauma Directors and
surgeons from Advocate Christ Hospital, Loyola University Hospital, and Mt. Sinai Medical Center.
This assessment was done through an analysis of three existing databases. Two of the databases are collected
by the Illinois Department of Public Health and they include the Emergency Medical System Pre-Hospital
database and the Trauma Registry. The analysis includes all acutely injured patients transported by a licensed
ambulance (e.g. fire departments and private), treated in level I or level II trauma centers for more than 12
hours, and/or admitted to a State registered hospital between 2005 and 2009 in the Southern Cook County
region affected by the closure of St. James Olympia Fields trauma unit. The analysis does not include
outpatients treated and released from hospitals without specialized trauma units.
During the first 12 months following the closure of the Saint James Olympia Fields Hospital Trauma Center,
there was no evidence of an increase in in-hospital deaths, an increase in medical complications or the
likelihood of a patient being discharged to an intermediate care facility. The length of hospitalization
increased modestly by 0.4 days (approximately 10 hours on average) among those injured in the most southern
parts of the Saint James Olympia Fields Hospital catchment area. In addition, patients coming from the
southern part of the catchment area were more likely to require mechanical ventilation after the closure of the
trauma unit (adjusted OR =1.58; CI95%: 1.10, 2.26). This finding persisted even when patients transferred by
ambulance between hospitals were excluded from the analysis.
Since the closure of the Saint James Olympia Fields Hospital Trauma Center, the analysis indicates that
seriously injured patients that had formerly been treated at Olympia Fields are now being treated at Advocate
Christ Hospital or Riverside Hospital in Kankakee. Persons suffering minor injuries, in particular orthopedic
injuries, are continuing to be treated at the Saint James Olympia Fields Hospital, although Palos Hospital
showed a significant increase in acutely injured patients admitted during the 12 months after July 1, 2008.
Furthermore, ambulance services from towns in the most southern zone of the Olympia Fields catchment
continue to bring most of the acutely injured patients to Saint James Olympia Fields Hospital regardless of
severity of injury. The moderate and seriously injured patients are then transferred to Advocate Christ
Hospital.
Although there were no immediate adverse effects, Advocate Christ Hospital has picked up the majority of
seriously injured patients that previously would have been treated at Olympia Fields. Advocate Christ
Hospital is the only facility with specialized trauma care within the Southern Cook County area. The system is
not static, population shifts and changes to factors that are associated with injury -- traffic patterns, poverty,
crime, and aging populations -- may result in long term effects missed by this analysis. The Project
Management Team has the following recommendations to improve and safeguard the regional trauma system
in Southern Cook County (1) create a centralized ambulance service in Southern Cook County, (2) develop
pathways to facilitate coordination and planning between hospitals with specialized trauma units independent
of trauma region, (3) create a system in Illinois to designate hospitals as level III and IV trauma units, and (4)
continue surveillance of the long term impacts of closing Saint James Olympia Fields Hospital Trauma Center.

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: Saint James Hospital in Olympia Fields closed its Level 1 Trauma Center on July 1 2008.
This Trauma Center had cared for acutely injured patients in the southern suburban area of Cook County
since the inception of the Illinois Trauma System in 1988. The Cook County Department of Public Health
(CCDPH) has documented the serious health problems facing southern Cook County, which has been
complicated by major demographic shifts, growing poverty and high injury and homicide rates. As the
Cook County Health and Hospitals System implements its strategic plan, an important policy question is
how to address the trauma needs of southern Cook County. The Cook County Department of Public
Health on behalf of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System contracted with the School of Public
Health University of Illinois to assess the impact of the closure of trauma services at Saint James Hospital
at Olympia Fields on southern Cook County. CCDPH created a Project Management Team to guide the
analysis and conclusions and make recommendations. The Project Management Team included faculty from
the School of Public Health, staff from CCDPH, and multidisciplinary staff from the Department of Trauma at
Stroger Hospital as well as Trauma Directors and surgeons from Advocate Christ Hospital, Loyola University
Hospital, and Mt. Sinai Medical Center. The Illinois Trauma System, under the authority of the Illinois
Department of Public Health has a total of 65 adult and pediatric trauma centers with 22 hospitals
designated as a Level 1centers and 43 designated as a Level II.
Importance: Research shows that patients suffering severe traumatic injuries who are undertriaged to
facilities without trauma units suffer more adverse health outcomes and are more likely to die than those
receiving care in level I or II trauma units. Furthermore, delay in treatment resulting from longer
transport times has also been associated with greater in-hospital complications and mortality rates.
Disparities in access to trauma care have important public health and social implications, as well as affect
the functioning of the hospitals that receive an excess of patients because they cover too extensive an
area.
Objectives: The overall goal of this research project was to determine whether the closing of the St.
James Olympia Fields Hospital trauma unit resulted in an increase in adverse outcomes in those injured
across the affected region.
Study Design: This assessment was done through an analysis of three existing databases. Two of the
databases are collected by the Illinois Department of Public Health and they include the Emergency
Medical System Pre-Hospital database and the Trauma Registry. The Hospital Discharge database
originates at the Illinois Hospital Association. We used probabilistic data linkage methods to link two of
the three databases -- the Hospital Discharge database and the Trauma Registry -- to help identify trauma
patients treated in both specialized trauma units and general emergency rooms. We conducted
comprehensive descriptive, spatial, temporal and multivariable analyses of acute traumatic injuries
occurring in the affected communities, in order to determine where trauma patients were treated after the
closure of the St. James Olympia Fields Hospital trauma unit and whether patients from Olympia Fields
the catchment area had more adverse outcomes after the closure. Key personnel were also interviewed to
clarify trauma system issues in the affected region, to decide on appropriate outcomes to measure, and to
assist in interpreting the results.
Participants: All acutely injured patients transported by a licensed ambulance (e.g. fire departments and
private), treated in level I or level II trauma centers for more than 12 hours, and/or admitted to a State
registered hospital between 2005 and 2009 in the Southern Cook County region affected by the closure of
St. James Olympia Fields trauma unit. The analysis does not include outpatients treated and released
from hospitals without specialized trauma units.

 Results:
Data Linkage: The final linkage rate between the hospital discharge dataset and the trauma
registry was 91.2%. Because key linkage variables were either incomplete or missing in the
EMS pre-hospital dataset, we were unable to link to this dataset.
Defining Olympia Fields Catchment Area: A total of 44 ZIP codes defined the principal
catchment zone of St. James Olympia Fields Hospital trauma unit, in which 97.5% of all injuries
occurred (scene of injury) and 87% of the patients resided. Acutely injured patients from this
catchment area were treated in 30 different hospitals. All the hospitals treated at least 25 patients
from the Olympia Fields catchment area between 2005- 2009. The catchment zone was divided
into three regions based on the distance and mean ambulance run times to both St. James
Olympia Fields Hospital and Advocate Christ Hospital. The EMS pre-hospital database was
used to ascertain ambulance run times. (Figure 1)
o Area 1 is the area around St. James Olympia Fields/Chicago Heights and south of the two
hospitals, and it takes 5 minutes or longer to travel to Advocate Christ Hospital as
compared to Olympia Fields/Chicago Heights.
o Area 2 is an area between Christ hospital and Olympia Fields/Chicago Heights, and it
takes 1 to 3 minutes longer to travel to Christ as compared to Olympia Fields/Chicago
Heights.
o Area 3 is the area nearest Advocate Christ Hospital (just south or west of Christ hospital)
and the mean/median run times to either Christ or Olympia Fields/Chicago Heights only
differed by +/-1 minute.
Flow of Trauma Patients at St. James Olympia Fields Hospital: St. James Olympia Fields
Hospital was treating an average of 126.5 trauma patients per month prior to the closure of their
trauma unit. This includes most outpatient cases (hospitalized for 12-23 hours) and all inpatient
cases injured across the Chicagoland area (hospitalized for 24 or more hours). After closing its
trauma unit, the number of trauma patients treated and admitted at St. James Olympia Fields
Hospital for acute traumatic injuries dropped to an average of 41 per month (p<0.001). St James
Olympia Fields Hospital continues to treat trauma patients, but very few of them suffer from
serious injuries (NISS > 16). In fact, only 19 patients with NISS scores of 25 or higher (severe
injuries) were treated and admitted during the immediate year following closure of the trauma
unit. By comparison, St. James Olympia Fields Hospital treated 453 patients with severe injuries
during the 3.5 previous years for an average of 129 severe cases per year. None of the patients
admitted for serious injuries (NISS > 16) died during their hospitalization in the year following
closure. St. James Olympia Fields Hospital saw large declines in the proportion of patients
injured in motor vehicle crashes (20% to 5%) and assaults (10% to 4%) after the closure of their
trauma unit. However, St. James Olympia Fields did have an increase in the proportion of elderly
patients injured from falls.

 St. James Olympia Fields Hospital trauma unit Catchment Area (Figure 1)

*The unincorporated areas inside the St. James Olympia Fields Hospital catchment are cover approximately 7,500 residents.

Primary Hospitals Treating Trauma Patients from Olympia Fields Catchment Area: St. James
Olympia Fields Hospital staff reported to us that St. James Olympia Fields and Chicago Heights
Hospitals are still receiving many acutely injured patients from the southernmost region of Cook
County (and parts of Will and Kankakee counties). This is occurring because many of the
ambulance services of towns in area 1 are reluctant to transport patients so far north to Advocate
Christ, West to Silver Cross, or south to Kankakee Hospital. These long transport times often
means an ambulance unit is unavailable for other services for more than two hours. Therefore,
many area 1 ambulance services are transporting patients to St James Olympia Fields or Chicago
Heights Hospitals to be stabilized, and then these patients are primarily being transferred to
Advocate Christ Hospital. Based on the hospital discharge dataset for inpatients, the number of
transfers to Christ more than doubled after the closure of the Olympia Fields trauma unit
(p<0.001), and the largest increase was from area 1 (p<0.001). Advocate Christ Hospital is
receiving most of the seriously injured patients from Olympia Fields catchment area, but some
are going to Riverside Hospital. During the first 6 months after the closure of the Olympia
Fields trauma unit, some seriously injured cases were admitted to Rush Medical Center in
3

Page 55 of 96

 Chicago. Among minor and moderate injuries, the majority end up at Advocate Christ Hospital,
but a small number of minor injuries are going to Palos Hospital. Because the total loss in
patients is not equivalent to the gain at Advocate Christ and other hospitals with statistically
significant increases in patients from the St. James Olympia Fields Hospital catchment area, it
appears that a proportion of patients are being distributed across multiple hospitals, but the
increase in these hospitals was not detectable. And many patients are simply continuing to be
treated at St. James Olympia Fields Hospital.
Adverse outcomes associated with the closure of the St. James Olympia Fields Hospital trauma
unit: There was no evidence of an association between the closure of the St. James Olympia
Fields Hospital trauma unit and an increase in in-hospital deaths, increase in medical
complications or the likelihood of a patient being discharged to an intermediate care facility. We
did find that patients coming from area 1 of the Olympia Fields catchment area were more likely
to require mechanical ventilation after the closure of the trauma unit (adjusted OR =1.58; CI95%:
1.10, 2.26). Based on the regression model, the predicted probability that a patient would require
mechanical ventilation rose from 5.3% to 8.9% among those coming from area 1. When we
looked at length of stay, patients from area 1 and 3 showed a significant increase in their length of
hospitalization after the closure of the St. James Olympia Fields trauma unit. However, the
average increase was less substantial among patients coming from area 3 (increase of 0.22 days;
approximately 5 hours longer stay) than from area 1 (increase of 0.41 days; approximately 10
hours longer stay). All of the regression models controlled for trend, age, gender, length of stay,
injury severity (NISS), Charlson Comorbidity Index, trauma complications, penetrating injuries,
surgical intervention, penetrating injuries and mechanical ventilation.

 Our goal was to address the following specific research questions:
1. Which hospitals are treating the patients that previously would have been treated by Olympia
Fields? St. James Olympia Fields is continuing to initially treat many of the traumatically injured
in their catchment area. Because most ambulance services from towns in the most southern zone
of the Olympia Fields catchment area are reluctant to transport patients so far north to Advocate
Christ, West to Silver Cross, or south to Kankakee, they are simply bringing injured patients to
St. James. These long transport times often means an ambulance unit is unavailable for other
services for more than 2 hours. However, St. James is effectively transferring nearly all of the
moderate and seriously injured patients to Advocate Christ Hospital. Persons suffering minor
injuries, in particular orthopedic injuries, are being treated at St. James. Patients transported
directly to other facilities are primarily ending up at Advocate Christ Hospital, but Riverside
Hospital (serious injuries) and Palos Hospital (minor injuries) did show a significant increase of
patients coming from the Olympia Fields catchment area. In addition, it appears that a proportion
of traumatically injured patients are being treated across a diffuse number of area hospitals.
2. Are more patients undertriaged in the affected southern communities now that the trauma unit
at Olympia Fields is closed? Among those suffering moderate and serious injuries, there is no
evidence that the number of patients undertriaged to facilities without specialized care increased
after the closure. The regional trauma system appears to have functioned as designed, with
Advocate Christ Hospital and Riverside hospitals being the primary treatment facilities for
moderately and seriously injured patients from the former Olympia Fields catchment area.
3. Have the transport times for patients injured in the southern suburbs increased and by how
much? Depending on the distance and location of the scene of injury, travel times did change.
Travel times from a specific ZIP code to a specific hospital did not change significantly, but there
was a shift in the primary destination of patients. Mean and median travel times for patients in
areas 1 and 2 of the catchment area are longer for those going to Advocate Christ Hospital than
patients sent to Olympia Fields or Chicago Heights.
4. Has the closure of the trauma unit been associated with an increase in adverse effects (more
deaths, more costly hospitalization, greater disability at discharge)? There was no evidence of
an increase in in-hospital deaths, medical complications resulting from traumatic injuries, or
patients requiring intermediate care after discharge. Patients from the southern and northern
sections of the Olympia Fields catchment area showed modest increases in lengths of stay of
approximately 5 to 10 hours. We did find that the proportion of patients requiring mechanical
ventilation rose from 5.3% to 8.9%, but only among those in the southern parts of the catchment
area (furthest from Advocate Christ Hospital).
5. Among the hospitals with trauma units most affected by the closing of Olympia Fields –
Advocate Christ Hospital -- has there been an increase in adverse effects across all the patients
treated in these facilities? It is possible that in facilities over burdened by excess patient volume
because of the closure of Olympia Fields, trauma teams would be activated for a lower proportion
of patients because their resources are over extended. Advocate Christ Hospital did go on bypass
more frequently after the closure of the Olympia Fields trauma unit, but the duration of the
bypass times decreased. In our analysis of patients treated at Advocate Christ Hospital, more
patients required mechanical ventilation (adjusted OR=1.61; CI95%:1.25, 2.09) and the length of
stay was slightly longer after July 1, 2008 (increase of 0.17 days; CI95%: 0.02, 0.32). Among
those transferred from the Olympia Fields catchment area to Advocate Christ Hospital, we found
no evidence of a negative effect across all of the key outcome measures, except that hospital
5

Page 57 of 96

 charges were higher among persons transferred after the closure of the St. James trauma unit
(increase of $2,284; CI95%: 540, 4028).
6. How has Advocate Christ Hospital managed the increased influx of acutely injured patients
since the closure of the St. James Olympia Fields trauma unit? According to interviews, Christ
Hospital has increased staffing by eight trauma surgeons, in part to address an increase in patient
volume as a result to the changes in the trauma system. However, the staffing increase was also
in response to an expansion the type of trauma services Advocate Christ Hospital provides.

Conclusions & Recommendations

Although there were no immediate adverse effects, Advocate Christ Hospital has picked up the
majority of seriously injured patients that previously would have been treated at Olympia Fields.
Advocate Christ Hospital is the only facility with specialized trauma care within the Southern
Cook County area. The system is not static, population shifts and changes to factors that are associated

with injury -- traffic patterns, poverty, crime, and aging populations -- may result in long term effects
missed by this analysis. The Project Management Team has the following recommendations to

improve and safeguard the regional trauma system in Southern Cook County

1. Create a centralized ambulance service in Southern Cook County - Many of the
communities in Southern Cook County have very limited resources to provide adequate prehospital care to persons injured within their cities. St. James Olympia Fields Hospital staff has
reported to us that many ambulance services continue to bring acutely injured patients to St James
Olympia Fields and Chicago Heights Hospitals. This is occurring because many of the
ambulance services of towns in the most southern section of Cook County are reluctant to
transport patients so far north to Advocate Christ, West to Silver Cross, or south to Kankakee
Hospital. These long transport times often means an ambulance unit is unavailable for other
services for more than 2 hours. Therefore, many ambulance services are transporting patients to
St James Olympia Fields or Chicago Heights Hospitals to be stabilized, and then these patients
are primarily being transferred to Advocate Christ Hospital. A centralized ambulance service
would ensure that resources are equitably and efficiently distributed among the Southern Cook
County communities. A centralized system could be (1) owned and managed by the county, (2) a
co-op funded by cities on the southside, or (3) a hybrid system that creates a centralized
management group to oversee a private/public ambulance system.
2. Develop pathways to facilitate coordination and planning between hospitals with
specialized trauma units independent of trauma region - Currently, Advocate Christ Hospital
is the primary facility treating persons suffering serious injuries in Southern Cook County.
Ongoing population shifts may increase the frequency in which Advocate Christ Hospital is
unable to treat all injured patients seeking treatment at their facility. Coordination and planning
between facilities with existing specialized trauma units, independent of trauma region, may help
reduce or prevent disruptions in trauma care.
3. Create a system in Illinois to designate hospitals as level III and IV trauma units Approximately half of all acutely injured persons in Illinois are treated at hospitals without
specialized trauma care. Many hospitals are currently acting as de factor level III trauma
facilities (i.e. a facility used to stabilize patients before transfer to a higher level trauma unit).
Most hospitals coordinate and communicate with other hospitals within and outside their EMS
region, regardless of whether they have specialized trauma teams. A hospital does not have to be
part of an EMS region to be able to access the regional trauma committee. However, creating a
6

Page 58 of 96

 support structure to facilitate and enhance the integration of hospitals without specialized trauma
units into regional trauma systems would (1) improve inter-hospital coordination by facilitating
communication between hospitals (2) bring more active partners to the table, (3) and identify
trauma training needs for the Level III or IV facilities. Additionally, by certifying hospitals as
level III/IV facilities, policy makers will be able to inform local constituencies about trauma
resources that are generally unrecognized within their communities (i.e. nearby community
hospitals that provide trauma care). Expansion of the existing trauma system and providing
adequate training requires an increase of financial and administrative support by the State to both
hospitals with specialized trauma units and hospitals caring for trauma patients without a
recognized/certified trauma team. Without cost sharing arrangements and administrative support
from IDPH, any move to expand the current trauma system will likely be resisted by many
hospitals.
4. Continued active surveillance of the long term impact of closing the Saint James Olympia
Fields Hospital Trauma Center - The current analysis is restricted to the evaluation of the
immediate impact of closing the St. James Olympia Fields Hospital trauma unit. However, the
system is not static, population shifts and changes to factors that are associated with injury -traffic patterns, poverty, crime, aging populations -- may result in long term effects missed by this
analysis. As part of an ongoing surveillance program, an annual report should be generated on
this issue using the data sources made available for this analysis. Developing an annual forum to
share and discuss the annual report with trauma directors within Cook County and the
surrounding region would be an important element of the proposed ongoing surveillance
program. This will enable trauma directors to improve coordination and planning. As part of
developing an ongoing injury surveillance program in Cook County, it is important to work
closely with the State and other important partners to ensure that the data required for the
surveillance program is easily accessible. The Emergency Medical System Pre-Hospital
database, the Illinois Trauma Registry and the Hospital Discharge database are critical to
examining factors that inform and provide evidence for decision making on issue of trauma care.
One major barrier is that the Chicago Fire Department stopped reporting to the state Emergency
Medical System Pre-Hospital database in 2006. Because of the importance of the data, the
Chicago Fire Department should be compelled to report to the State all of its EMS prehospital run
data. Furthermore, EMS reporting should be carefully evaluated statewide to improve completion
of data fields so that the Emergency Medical System Pre-Hospital database can be better utilized
for system evaluations such as this report.

 BACKGROUND
The WePlan of the Cook County Department of Public Health has documented the serious health
problems facing southern Cook County, which has been complicated by major demographic shifts,
growing poverty and high injury and homicide rates. A number of socioeconomic changes impact the
health policy planning for the residents of Cook County. Although there was only a 0.7% increase in the
population in the Cook County Department of Public Health's jurisdiction between 2000 and 2010, there
was a large shift in the racial/ethnic makeup in the CCDPH region. In the areas covered by CCDPH, the
white Hispanic population increased 44% from 302,000 to 437,000 people, the African American
population increased 20% from 310,000 to 371,000 people, and the Asian population increased 30% from
115,000 to 150,000. Furthermore, the proportion of older adults living in Cook County is increasing – an
increase of 12% of older adults between the ages of 45-64. A substantial number of communities in
suburban Cook County have also noted an increase in the number of residents facing extreme poverty
(more than 200% below the poverty line). The population in poverty increased by 34% in CCDPH's
jurisdiction (excluding unincorporated areas; see Map below). The percentage of people living at or
below the 100% federal poverty level increased from 6.4% in 2000 to 8.5% for 2005-2009 estimates,
while 13.6% of residents living in the Southern District lived in poverty in 2009. Furthermore, the near
poor population increased by 23% in suburban Cook County from 2000 to 2009 with the majority of this
increased noted in the southern region of the County. Over this same period the City of Chicago noted a
decrease in the near poor population. Demographic changes across the county will require health policy
planners to tailor resources, communications and outreach to meet the changes needs of the residents in
Cook County.
Access to care continues to be an issue for this area, with increase over the past decade of the medically
underserved populations (MUP: see Map below). In 2009, 11% of adults in Southern Cook County
reported having no healthcare coverage. In addition 13.2% did not have a primary care provider, and
correspondingly 16% of Southern Cook County residents reported that they did not go to a physician for a
routine check-up during the two years prior to the survey.

Southern Cook County incorporates a number of townships which face significant health problems
relating to acute injury. The main causes of injury are motor vehicle crashes, falls and intentional
violence. The rising population and increasing traffic volume will correspond to growing number of
people injured from car crashes in the southern region. The aging population inevitably is associated with
a increasing number of fall related injuries. Furthermore, the areas surrounding St James Hospital have
the highest youth homicide and firearm mortality with 148 intentional firearm deaths in 2007 occurring in
Southern Cook County. Between 2005-2007 in the southern district, homicide was the leading cause of
death for young males (ages 15-24yrs), and nearly 50% the intentional firearm deaths occur in African
American males.
As the Cook County Health and Hospitals System implements it strategic plan, an important policy
question is how to address the trauma needs of southern Cook County. Impacting this policy issue was the
closure of the Level 1 Trauma Center at Saint James Hospital in Olympia Fields on July 1, 2008. This
Trauma Center had cared for severely injured patients in the southern suburban area of Cook County
since the inception of the Illinois Trauma System in 1988. The Illinois Trauma System under the authority
of the Illinois Department of Public Health currently recognizes a total of 65 adult and pediatric trauma
centers with 22 hospitals designated as a Level 1centers and 43 designated as a Level II. These numbers
includes centers from neighboring states (Indiana, Iowa and Missouri.)
The closing of Saint James as a trauma center reflects a national trend of accelerated closures since 2001
with a loss nationally of 339 centers from 1990 to 2005. The loss of these centers have disproportionately
affected communities with high numbers of African Americans; moderate to high share of uninsured
residents; poor communities and people within rural areas. (Hsia) These trends have occurred despite
wide spread evidence of the effectiveness of trauma care and that delay in treatment resulting from longer
transport times has also been associated with greater in-hospital complications and mortality rates. Factors
which have been attributed to the closure of trauma centers are the high cost of trauma care, underfunding
of the system and number of trauma patients that lack a source of payment.
The Cook County Department of Public Health on behalf of the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System contracted with the School of Public Health University of Illinois to assess the impact of the
closure of trauma services at Saint James Hospital at Olympia Fields on southern Cook County. CCDPH
created a Project Management Team to guide the analysis and conclusions and make recommendations. The
Project Management Team included faculty from the School of Public Health, staff from CCDPH, and
multidisciplinary staff from the Department of Trauma at Stroger Hospital as well as Trauma Directors and
11

Page 63 of 96

 surgeons from Advocate Christ Hospital, Loyola University Hospital, and Mt. Sinai Medical Center. The

overall goal of this research project is to determine whether the closing of the St. James Olympia Fields
trauma unit has resulted in an increase in adverse outcomes in those injured since the closing across the
affected region. Where analyzing each IDPH dataset individually would only provide us a snapshot of
each phase of treatment, the data linkage of three trauma related datasets will allow us to evaluate the
impact of closing the St. James Olympia Fields trauma unit across the continuum of care, from prehospital through hospital discharge. We will address the following specific research questions:
1. Which hospitals are treating the patients that formally would have been treated by Olympia
Fields? We will use spatial and temporal analyses to identify the flow of patients to hospitals –
with and without trauma units – which have picked up the care of injured patients in southern
Cook County following the closure of the Olympia Fields trauma unit. We will assess the
magnitude of the change in patient volume in these hospitals, controlling for baseline trend.
2. Are more patients undertriaged in the affected southern communities now that the trauma unit
at Olympia Fields is closed? We will use an interrupted time series analysis to analyze the trend
of traumatically injured patients treated in hospitals without trauma units across the affected
region of southern Cook County.
3. Have the transport times for patients injured in the southern suburbs increased and by how
much? We will use a variety of time-series and multivariable models to assess the impact on
transport times. The simplest models will compare mean transport times before and after the
closure of Olympia Fields. These analyses will also help assess the level of bypass occurring
system-wide, which will increase transport times.
4. Has the increase in transport time and undertriage – if it has occurred -- been associated with
an increase in adverse effects (more deaths, more costly hospitalization, greater disability at
discharge)? Multivariable models will be developed to look at the impact of higher transport
times on a variety of health outcomes, but with emphasis on length of hospitalization, duration of
stay in an intensive care/critical care unit, duration of assisted ventilation, medical complications,
and short-term mortality (in-field and in-hospital case fatality rates).

12

Page 64 of 96

 5. Among the hospitals with trauma units most affected by the closing of Olympia Fields (e.g.
Christ), has there been an increase in undertriage within the hospital (i.e. lower rates of
trauma team activation) and adverse effects across all the patients treated in these facilities?
The trauma registry collects information on trauma team activation. It is possible that in facilities
over burdened by excess patient volume because of the closure of Olympia Fields, may activate
their trauma teams for a lower proportion of patients because their resources have been over
extended.

 METHODS
Data Collection
We have a data sharing agreement with the Illinois Department of Public Health to obtain the Illinois
trauma registry (ITR) and EMS Pre-Hospital Run Data (EMS). Data for the Hospital Discharge (HD)
dataset was obtained through the University of Illinois Business Planning and Decision Support Division.
We received data for years 2005 - 2009 for all three datasets. We have IRB approval from UIC as well as
IDPH. In addition, data on bypass dates for years 2007 to 2011 were provided by the Division of
Emergency Medical Services and Highway Safety at the Illinois Department of Public Health. Table 1,
below, shows the data elements in each of the three databases that were used for this investigation.
Emergency Medical Services Pre-Hospital Run Data
The EMS pre-hospital run data includes ambulance run reports for every emergency pre-hospital
transport, interhospital transport or refusal of care incident for every vehicle service provider in Illinois.
However, beginning in 2006 the Chicago Fire Department EMS service stopped reporting their run data
to IDPH. The Chicago Fire Department pre-hospital run database is managed by the City of Chicago.
The EMS database includes the following variables: total call time (time to definitive care; time the call
was received until the time of arrival at the hospital), mode of transport (ambulance, helicopter),
emergency level of transport (Non-Emergent, Downgraded-No Lights/Sirens, Upgraded-L/S, EmergentL/S), type of extrication used, factors that delayed in EMS access or detection (e.g. adverse road
conditions, adverse weather, crowd control, hazardous materials, language barrier, prolonged extrication,
unsafe scene, vehicle problems), protective equipment in car and passenger location in vehicle for motor
vehicle crashes, patient status information (body part injured, pupil dilation, pulse, blood pressure,
Glasgow coma score, skin temperature, respiratory rate, lung sounds, loss of consciousness, shock,
cardiac arrest, drugs or alcohol, allergies, symptoms, and medical history), patient treatment variables
(e.g. route and type of intravenous, route of medication, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, EKG findings,
airway insertion, assisted ventilation, defibrillation, wound management, medications, cricothyroidotomy,
spinal immobilization).
Illinois Trauma Registry
The Illinois Trauma Registry (ITR) was mandated by the State legislature and is managed by the Illinois
Department of Public Health. All of the State’s level 1 and 2 trauma centers (N=62) are required to report
14

Page 66 of 96

 all patients (1) sustaining traumatic injuries (ICD-9-CM external injury codes E800-995) and admitted to
a trauma center for > 12 hours, (2) transferred to a level I or II center or (3) are dead-on-arrival (DOA) or
die in the emergency department. Level III and IV centers are not included in the ITR. Level III and IV
trauma centers primarily provide advanced life support prior to transfer to a level I or II center, or serve
communities with no access to level I and II centers. We provide an assessment of data quality in the ITR
in a previous paper of ours (Friedman, 2007). The ITR contains data on demographics (age, gender,
race/ethnicity), exposure (mechanism of injury), and health outcomes (diagnoses, measures of injury
severity, hospital procedures, disability status on discharge), and economics (payer source).
Hospital Discharge Database
The University of Illinois at Chicago Hospital is a member of the Illinois Hospital Association, the
organization that compiles and manages the hospital discharge database. As a member of the Illinois
Hospital Association, the PI’s research team has ongoing access to the hospital discharge database. The
hospital discharge database is based on billing records. It includes all patients treated for more than 23
hours in any Illinois hospital (i.e. inpatients only) for any medical reason. The hospital discharge
database includes variables on patient demographics (age, gender), exposure (mechanism of injury),
health outcomes (diagnoses, hospital procedures, discharge status), and economics (hospital charges,
payer source).
Data Cleaning
We merged individual year files to create a single data file for each of the three State datasets for the five
years of interest (2005-2009). For the first step of data cleaning, we identified duplicates within each
database by matching cases (rows) on the following variables - name, date of birth, hospital, residential
ZIP code, place of injury, gender, ethnicity, injury date, hospital admission date, external cause of injury.
Duplicates were identified and coded as duplicates, but were not removed until after the data linkage.
Records of duplicate entries were aggregated instead of deleted to avoid losing important data that may
only be available in one of the two (or more) duplicate entries. We used a series of SAS macros that
identified and removed duplicate cases (Friedman, 2007).

Data

We reviewed every data field to look for non-sense entries. We corrected non-sense entries caused by
blatant data entry errors. For example, a year of injury of 2202 among other cases where the year is 2002
was changed to 2002. We also identified values outside the permitted parameters (e.g., age = 200 years),
and corrected them, when possible. Next, we selected specific data elements to review for accuracy. For
example, dates of injury should be the same, or one day prior to, date of admission (in cases that they are
not related to “late effects”).
We used the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries’ (NAACCR) quality control
criteria to assess the data completeness of the different databases (Table 2). The criteria include missing
16

Page 68 of 96

 data for key variables, timeliness of reporting, and unresolved duplicates (Hofferkamp, 2008). In a
previous assessment of the ITR, we found the data to meet NAACCR’s highest level of data quality
(Friedman, 2007). Both the hospital discharge and trauma registry datasets met the highest quality
criteria set by NAACCR, but the EMS did not because of missing residential ZIP information. However,
the EMS data did have a very high completeness for the county in which the incident occurred (3.5%
missing).

Data Linkage
Our goal was to link individual cases across the three databases in order to establish a single merged
dataset of acute traumatic injuries occurring in the southern towns of Cook County. Because not all
trauma patients are treated in a level 1 or 2 trauma unit, many acutely injured patients appear in the
hospital discharge dataset which captures all inpatients. Both datasets miss outpatients who are treated
and released within 12 hours for the trauma registry or within 23 hours for the hospital discharge dataset.
The linked dataset will capture most patients treated for more than 12-23 hours for a traumatic injury by a
trauma unit in Southern Cook County, and nearly all inpatients. Because the EMS dataset was missing
resident location information and had an incompatible coding system for describing injury type and body
region affected, it was not feasible to link the EMS ambulance run data with the trauma registry and
hospital discharge datasets. The data linkage was restricted to the ITR and HD datasets only.

Page 69 of 96

 We used probabilistic linkage methodology to link the two datasets. The data linkage methodology
entails the linkage of individual case (patient) records across two or more databases, allowing the
formation of a new dataset that includes all the variables collected in each database. There are two main
methods for linking data: “deterministic” and “probabilistic.” Deterministic linkage involves the exact,
one-to-one character matching of pre-designated variables across two or more datasets; this technique is
frequently used when identifiers, such as name and social security number, are available. Although
deterministic linkage methods intuitively provide greater confidence that records from two different
databases describe one case, the idea of deterministic linkage, in practice, is far more complicated. For
example, misspelled names or errors in data entry would prevent matching of cases that describe the same
person. Probabilistic linkage can solve this problem, and is used when identifiers are not available.
Probabilistic linkage requires the researcher to make assumptions regarding the probability that records
from two different databases match, and allows for a decision as to which records should be included in
the combined data file and attributed to a single case that is recorded in two different systems. This
technique allows greater flexibility and offers the ability to match a larger number of cases. The
probabilistic linkage process generates probabilities of a match based on the number of variables that
exactly match and the variables that are close, but not exact, matches.
First, we standardized the format of all of the matching variables across the datasets, ensuring that the
variable types, lengths, and codes were equivalent. A combination of SQL and SAS code was written to
carry out all steps in the linkage, using SAS Version 9.1 (See Appendix 1). We used the following
variables for the data linkage: receiving hospital, date of birth, gender, residential ZIP code, date of
admission/treatment, date of discharge and ICD-9 N-codes describing the injury. Table 2 outlines the
completeness of the key variables used in the data linkage for each dataset.
We ran multiple passes in the linkage process, which allowed for variations in the data caused by data
entry errors. Table 3 presents the variations in matching criteria by each subsequent linkage pass. The
concept of using multiple passes is to begin with the highest level of precision and then modify the
precision with each subsequent step, thereby, ensuring that higher probability matches are identified in the
initial step, and removed from the datasets prior to subsequent steps, so that they don’t match again to
another case when the matching criteria is less rigorous. In the subsequent passes we used “fuzzy”
matching criteria to allow for data entry errors, intentional omissions or differences in coding procedures.
The initial pass identified matches between the datasets that matched exactly on all matching variables
(74.4% of matches). In the second pass, we omitted ZIP code to account for data entry errors or
intentional omission or misrepresentation by the patient (5.9% of matches). In the third pass, we a
18

Page 70 of 96

 allowed dates of admission to vary by +/- 1 day (13.4% of matches). This was important, because some
hospitals' billing departments systematically begin the date of admission at the time a patient becomes an
inpatient, which is 24 hours after the patient arrives at the hospital for treatment. However, the trauma
registry uses the date and time the patient arrives to begin treatment, regardless of patient status
(outpatient vs. inpatient). In the subsequent passes, different fuzzy matching criteria were used (passes 4
through 9: 6.4% of all matches).
The final linkage rate between the TR and HD was 91.2%. There are several reasons the linkage rate was
not 100%. First, the two datasets capture slightly different populations. The trauma registry includes
outpatients (patients held for observation for less than 23 hours), receives data from out of state hospitals,
and has many cases transferred between facilities (ranges from 2.5% to 5.0% of patients each year). In
contrast, the hospital discharge database only includes inpatients (LOS > 23 hours) and is based on billing
records. The second reason for some cases not linking is "split billing" in the HD dataset, which
generally is used when separate bills are issued for treatment by different specialists during a single
hospitalization (e.g. neurologist, endocrinologist, trauma surgeon). The patients will have multiple
records for the same period of time, but the diagnoses may differ substantially based on the treating
physician's specialty. In the hospital discharge dataset, we also identified cases in some hospitals where
patients have multiple records with identical diagnoses, but different and consecutive admission and
discharge dates. These occurred primarily among patients with long lengths of stay. In contrast, the
trauma registry does not appear to have incidents of split billing. Third, in some hospitals, the date of
admission and/or date of discharge systematically differed by one day from the dates listed in the trauma
registry. When screening for matches, the patients' data were identical on all variables except for date of
admission and/or date of discharge. This likely rises from a difference in the definition of the time of
admission to the hospital. The HD dataset is based on billing systems for inpatients. Some systems
differentiate between outpatient and inpatient status, therefore, the first 24 hours (outpatient status) are
billed separately from any subsequent days of hospitalization (inpatient status). In these cases, the date of
admission in the inpatient dataset will systematically be one day after the initiation of treatment. The TR
is a medical record system with a focus on treatment protocols and quality of care, rather than billing,
therefore the day the treatment is initiated is considered the date of admission. Finally, data entry errors
are another possible explanation for non-matches. Both datasets would be affected by data entry errors.

Pass eight accounts for split billing. Some hospitals use split billing to charge for specialists and at some hospitals there was systematic split
billing used to split up the hospital stay of a patients into several continuous hospitalizations.
b
Pass nine allows for variations in billing emphasis. The HD dataset is based on billing records. Hospitals have specialists that are involved in
coding patient diagnoses to maximized billing. Any given patients, may have several billing codes for a certain specific diagnosis or injury. The
code used varies by the experience of the treating medical staff or the coding determined by the billing nurse.

Probability of Mismatches
We expected the data linkage process to be very efficient because the data completeness was very high on
the key matching variables. Because we have the receiving hospital name/code in each dataset, the
linkage was done within hospital strata. Overall, each hospital with and without trauma units in Southern
Cook County receives an average of three new acutely injured patients per day (maximum of 29 in one
day). At St. James Olympia Fields Hospital prior to the closure of its trauma unit, the facility averaged
4.2 new patients per day, and the St. James Chicago Heights facility averages 1.8 new patients per day.
At Christ, there was an average of 8.3 new patients per day. The smaller frame for linking records
improves the efficiency and accuracy of the process.
We used the trauma registry to estimate the real mismatch probability using the linkage variables. The
TR includes patient name, which allows us an additional level of information for confirming matches.
We identified duplicates using a subset of the variables used in the data linkage. Identifying duplicates
within datasets or between datasets involves similar procedures. Across all the patients in the trauma
registry between 2000 and 2009 (N=452,491), we identified 2,467 duplicate records (some were
triplicates) when using receiving hospital, date of birth, gender, date of admission, and date of discharge
(we omitted ZIP code to mirror later passes in the linkage process). Then we manually screened these
20

Page 72 of 96

 duplicates to identify true mismatches using patient name, ICD-9 diagnosis codes, and cause of injury
codes. Of the duplicates, 2,447 (99.2%) were double entries for the same patients within the same
hospital. This means that 0.5% of all trauma records are duplicate entries. This can result from system
errors (e.g. a record is submitted twice after data entry), errors between coders (e.g. two or more coders
accidentally enter a patient's information twice), or from quality control practices at facilities that
intentionally have two coders enter the same patient information. Of the remaining duplicates, 10 records
were clear mismatches and 10 had different variations of the patient name, but identical medical
information on diagnosis and cause of injury codes. Based on this real world exercise, the probability of
mismatches using the five main linkage variables (receiving hospital, date of birth, gender, date of
admission, and date of discharge) is very low (0.002% or 2 per 100,000 records).
Case Definition
This analysis only includes patients suffering acute traumatic injuries identified by ICD-9-CM codes 800956. We exclude patients suffering exclusively from poisoning, late effects, contusions, abrasions,

and superficial injuries.
Defining St. James Olympia Fields Catchment Area
The analysis focused primarily on Southern Cook County, with some patients from Will, Kankakee and
DuPage counties. Based on both scene of injury and patient residence, the main catchment area of focus
in Cook County covered Orland Park in the Northwest corner to Calumet City in the Northeast corner to
Sauk Village in the Southeast corner to University Park in the Southwest corner. Only patient records
from the trauma registry had ZIP codes for the scene of injury. Therefore, for patients without ZIP codes
for the scene of injury, we used the residential ZIP codes instead. Among the 45,979 patient records that
had both a scene and residential ZIP codes, 67% of the patients suffered injuries in the same ZIP code
they resided. Overall, the mean approximate distance between the a patient's home and scene of
injury was 3.4 miles, with 90% of the patients injured within 10 miles of their place of residence.
To identify the catchment area, the ZIP code for scene of injury and patient residence was analyzed for
both St. James Olympia Fields and St. James Chicago Heights. We identified 44 different ZIP codes in
which 97.5% of all injuries occurred (scene of injury). Only those with trauma registry information
had data on scene of injury. In addition, 87% of the patients lived within 44 ZIP codes. The remainder
lived in other parts of Illinois and Indiana, or had undisclosed residence locations.

21

Page 73 of 96

 This catchment area of 44 ZIP codes was divided into three regions based on distance and mean
ambulance run times (See Map 1). We used the EMS pre-hospital run data, to determine the median and
mean run times for patients from the 44 ZIP codes to both St. James Olympia Fields and Advocate Christ
Hospital. (Map 1)
Area 1 is the area around Olympia Fields/Chicago Heights and south of the two hospitals, and it
takes 5 minutes or longer to travel to Advocate Christ hospital as compared to Olympia
Fields/Chicago Heights Hospitals.
Area 2 is an area between Christ hospital and Olympia Fields/Chicago Heights Hospitals, and it
takes 1 to 3 minutes longer to travel to Christ as compared to Olympia Fields/Chicago Heights
Hospitals.
Area 3 is the area nearest Christ (just south or west of Christ hospital) and the mean/median run
times to either Christ or Olympia Fields/Chicago Heights Hospitals only differed by +/-1 minutes.
These three areas are based on ambulance run times and reflect distinct geographic regions
affected by distance from each hospital, proximity and access to highways or major
thoroughfares, as well as level of urban development (i.e. congestion of roadways). Based on the
ZIP code of the scene of injury, 70% of the patients treated at Olympia Fields trauma center were
injured in area 1, approximately 20% in area 2 and 10% in area 3. The ZIP codes for the three
areas are listed below in Table 4.

 Data Analysis
Descriptive Analysis
We used SAS software for all statistical analyses (v.9.2; Cary, NC). We describe type of injuries and
disparities between groups in terms of injury severity, external cause and location of injury (E-Codes),
duration of hospitalization, treatment in an intensive care/critical care unit, required mechanical
ventilation, medical complications, number of surgeries (orthopedic, non-orthopedic and emergency
surgeries), discharge status, and short-term mortality (in-field and in-hospital case fatality rates.
Appropriate parametric (Pearson’s chi-square) and non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon Rank Sum) were used
to evaluate bivariate relationships. Student’s t-test was used to compare mean differences in continuous
metrics such as ISS scores and length of hospitalization. The Levenne test was used to test for equal
variance between samples to determine whether to used equivariant or non-equivariant statistical
measures of significance.
ICD-9 N codes were used to assess body region and type of injury based on the Barell classification
matrix (Barell, 2002; Baker, 1974). We used the two primary measures of severity: (1) injury severity
scores (ISS) and (2) the New Injury Severity Score (NISS). We also included the Charlson Comorbidity
Index (Charlson, 1987) and complications associated with increased mortality in trauma patients. The
trauma complications included in the analysis were general complications with ICD-9-CM codes of 958
to 959, poisoning during the course of medical treatment, acute posthemorrhagic anemia, cerebral
edema/anoxia/encephalopathy, hypotensive shock, pulmonary insufficiency as a result of trauma, acute
respiratory failure, and septicemia. Each patient in the trauma registry has up to 25 ICD-9 diagnosis
codes listed in their record and these were used to calculate the Charlson Comorbidity Index and evaluate
trauma complications.
We also calculated the in-hospital case fatality rate. The CFR is the number of reported deaths divided
by the total number of patients. CFR provides us a proxy measure of severity of injuries and quality of
care. The CFR does not include patients dead on arrival.

25

 Multivariable analyses
Each research question required a different analytic approach because of the distribution of the dependent
variables, and the relationship between the dependent and independent variables varied. To evaluate
changes in trends we used segmented regression analysis. We controlled for trend, autocorrelation, and
injury severity in these models.
To evaluate adverse health outcomes associated with the closure of the trauma unit on July 1, 2008, we
focused on the following outcomes of injury: in-hospital deaths, medical complications, need for
mechanical ventilation, discharge to an intermediate care facility, length of hospitalization, total hospital
charges (in U.S. Dollars). We also looked at the role comorbidities played as effect modifiers
individually and combined using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). A two-sided p-value < 0.05 was
used to determine statistical significance. For the dichotomous dependent variables (in-hospital deaths,
medical complications, need for mechanical ventilation, discharge to an intermediate care facility) we
used multivariable logistic regression models. The continuous dependent variables were not normally
distributed so we used multivariable robust regression models to assess the relationship with the trauma
unit closure. In scenarios with extreme or many outliers causing the data to be skewed, ordinary least
squares (OLS) regression will produce biased parameter estimates. For the multivariable regression
analysis, we used robust M-estimation as implemented in SAS Version 9 (PROC ROBUSTREG; SAS
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) using bisquare weights. The parameter estimates derived from robust regression
are less influenced by outliers. This is generally achieved by weighting observations whose residuals are
large.
The multivariable models controlled for the following covariates trend, age, gender, length of stay, injury
severity (NISS), Charlson Comorbidity Index, trauma complications, penetrating injuries, surgical
intervention, penetrating injuries and mechanical ventilation.

 RESULTS
How many trauma patients were treated at St. James Olympia Fields before and after the closure of the
trauma unit?
St James Olympia Fields Hospital was treating an average of 126.5 trauma patients per month prior to the
closure of their trauma unit. This includes all outpatient and inpatient cases treated from across the
Chicagoland area. After closing its trauma unit, the number of trauma patients admitted at St James
Olympia Fields Hospital for acute traumatic injuries dropped to an average of 41 per month (p<0.001).
Data on outpatients (those treated for more than 12 hours) was no longer available after the trauma unit
closed, but outpatients comprised 27% of all St James Olympia Fields Hospital trauma patients (across all
the hospitals 8.4% of patients were outpatient). Prior to the closure, 29.1% of the trauma patients treated
at St James Olympia Fields Hospital involved serious injuries (NISS > 16; average of 36.8 per month),
which declined to 7.5% of all trauma patients after July 1, 2008 (average of 3.1 per month). Prior to the
closure, 38.6% of the patients at St James Olympia Fields Hospital were minor injuries (NISS<4) and
32.3% were moderate injuries (NISS 5 -15). (Figure 1; Table 6)
In a segmented regression model controlling for trend and injury severity, the decline in average monthly
patients treated at Olympia Fields was most precipitous among the seriously injured patients (NISS 16
and up) showing a decline in mean monthly patients of 42.4 in the period following the closure (p<0.001).
In the moderately injured category (NISS 5 to 15), there was a average decline in the mean monthly
trauma patients treated at Olympia Fields of 22.2 patients (p<0.001). Among those suffering minor
injuries (NISS < 4), there was a decline of 23.9 patients (p<0.001).

 Who are continuing to be treated at St. James Olympia Fields Hospital?
St. James Olympia Fields Hospital, following closure as Level 1 Trauma Center, continued to treat trauma
patients, but very few of them suffer from serious injuries (NISS > 16). In fact, only 19 patients with
NISS scores of 25 or higher (severe injuries) were treated during the immediate year following closure.
By comparison, St. James Olympia Fields Hospital treated 453 patients with NISS 25+ during the 3.5
previous years for an average of 129 severe cases per year. St. James Olympia Fields Hospital staff
treated 37 people with NISS scores between 16 and 24 (serious injuries) treated during the immediate
year following closure, down from several hundred per year. None of the patients admitted for serious
injuries (NISS > 16) died during their hospitalization in the immediate year following closure. Only 3 of
the patients admitted with moderate injuries died (NISS 5 to 15; out of 177; CFR=1.7%).
St. James Olympia Fields Hospital saw large declines in the proportion of patients injured in motor
vehicle crashes (20% to 5%) and assaults (10% to 4%) after the closure of their trauma unit. However, St.
James Olympia Fields did have an increase in the proportion of elderly patients injured from falls, from
50% to 70% of all trauma patients.
When looking at type of injury, nearly all of the trauma patients at St. James Olympia Fields Hospital
were treated for fractures, internal injuries or open wounds. All three injury types showed large drops in
the proportion of patients with serious forms of these injuries (NISS > 16) after the closure of the trauma
unit (Table 7). After closure of its trauma unit, St. James Olympia Fields Hospital continued to treat
primarily minor and moderate fractures involving the upper and lower extremity, with an increase in the
proportion of patients treated for hip and pelvic injuries (elderly injured from falls). St. James Olympia
Fields Hospital did continue to treat some fractures of the vertebral column, but they were all minor
injuries.
There continued to be some patients with moderate and severe internal injuries (N=48; all body parts)
treated and admitted to St. James Olympia Fields Hospital during the year after closing its trauma unit,
but this number is down from an annual average of 372 patients. Although St. James Olympia Fields
Hospital admitted 54 patients with internal injuries of the torso, only five of these patients had severe
injuries. After closing its trauma unit, St. James Olympia Fields Hospital only admitted five severe
injuries involving fractures of the torso, and 11 cases with severe open wounds or fractures of the head
and face. St. James Olympia Fields Hospital did admit 23 patients with severe internal traumatic brain
injuries. St. James Olympia Fields Hospital after closure of its trauma unit did not admit any patients for
30

 moderate or severe burns, crush injuries, and amputations. There were also substantial reductions to near
zero cases of spinal cord injuries, serious chest injuries, abdominal injuries, and face and eye injuries.
How are patients treated at St James Olympia Fields Hospital entering the hospital?
After the closure of the St. James Olympia Fields Hospital trauma unit, 78.8% of admitted trauma patients
came to the emergency department as walk-ins or by ambulance; 14.9% (N=73) were transferred to St.
James Olympia Fields Hospital from an intermediate care facility. Nearly all the cases coming into St.
James Olympia Fields Hospital after the closure of the trauma unit were emergency cases, and only 6.1%
were elective admissions. Only 11 of the admitted trauma patients following the closure of its trauma
unit were transferred to another acute care hospital after they were admitted to the hospital.

Who is being transferred from St. James Olympia Fields Hospital after the closure and where are they
going?
St. James Olympia Fields Hospital staff have reported to us that many ambulance services continue to
bring acutely injured patients to St James Olympia Fields and Chicago Heights Hospitals. This is
31

Page 83 of 96

 occurring because many of the ambulance services of towns in area 1 are reluctant to transport patients so
far north to Advocate Christ, West to Silver Cross, or south to Kankakee. These long transport times
often means an ambulance unit is unavailable for other services for more than 2 hours. Therefore, many
area 1 ambulance services are transporting patients to St James Olympia Fields or Chicago Heights
Hospitals to be stabilized, and then these patients are primarily being transferred to Advocate Christ
Hospital. Based on the hospital discharge dataset for inpatients, the number of transfers to Advocate
Christ Hospital more than doubled after the closure of Olympia Fields trauma (p<0.001) and the largest
increase was from area 1 (p<0.001) (Figure 2).
Where are the trauma patients injured in St. James Olympia Fields Hospital catchment area going?
Because of a failure to report trauma cases in 2008 by many of the trauma centers, the data analysis of the
flow of patients after the closure of the Olympia Fields trauma unit was limited to inpatients (length of
stay > 1 day) reported by the hospital discharge dataset. This removes the outpatients that were not
reported in the trauma registry by Advocate Christ Hospital for the latter half of 2008. The patients
admitted at Christ's trauma unit as inpatients are included. Based on this data series alone, there was a
significant decline of 25.6 seriously injured trauma patients (NISS > 16; p<0.001) and a drop of 7.3
moderately injured trauma patients (NISS 5 to 15; p=0.005) at St. James Olympia Fields. The drop in
minor injuries was not significant (-2.1; p>0.05), but this is not surprising since the majority of minor
injuries are managed as outpatients and this data series includes only inpatients.

Figure 2: Total Transfers to Advocate Christ Hospital, 2005 to 2009

32

Page 84 of 96

 After closing the Olympia Fields trauma unit, an increase of 18-22 severely injured patients per month
were admitted to Advocate Christ (p=0.014), and 1 to 3 per month at Riverside Hospital. During the
initial 6 months after the Olympia Fields trauma unit closure, severely injured patients were also treated at
Rush (2 per month; p=0.001), but after the initial period Advocate Christ Hospital became the
predominate hospital treating the severely injured within the Olympia Fields catchment area. Among the
moderately injured (NISS 5 -15), there was a significant increase of 8.2 patients per month (p=0.008) at
Advocate Christ Hospital, indicating that all of the moderately injured are being treated at Christ Hospital.
Among the minor injuries (NISS <4), nearly all the cases that are hospitalized are remaining at Olympia
Fields, but there were significant increases observed at Christ Hospital (increase of 6.6 cases; p=0.01) and
Palos Hospital (3.1/month; p=0.05).
Because the total loss in patients is not equivalent to the gain at Advocate Christ and other hospitals with
statistically significant increases in patients from the St. James Olympia Fields Hospital catchment area, it
appears that some patients are being distributed across multiple hospitals, but the increase in these
hospitals is not detectable. And many patients are simply continuing to be treated at St. James Olympia
Fields Hospital.
Has Advocate Christ gone on bypass more frequently since the closure of St. James Olympia Fields
Hospital?
From July 2008 through July 2011, Olympia Fields went on bypass 11 times compared to 75 times in the
one year period prior to closure (July 2007 through June 2008). St. James Olympia Fields Hospital went
on bypass an average of once every two months since the closure of their trauma unit. The average bypass
duration was 5 hours before the closure, compared to 4 hours after closure.
In contrast, during the one year prior to Olympia Fields closure of its trauma unit, Advocate Christ was on
bypass for an average of 9.8 days per month, and this increased to an average of 13.3 days per month after
the closure (through July 2011). The average duration of bypass time prior to Olympia Fields closure of
its trauma unit was 4 hours and 36 minutes compared to 4 hours and 14 minutes after the closure. By
comparison, Mt Sinai Hospital goes on bypass approximately one time per month, for a duration of 5 to 6
hours each time. In contrast, the University of Chicago is on bypass nearly every day of the year,
averaging 30 times per month with an average bypass time of 6 hours and 18 minutes for each event.

 Were there any detrimental changes following the closure of the St. James Olympia Fields Hospital
trauma unit in terms of deaths, number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, patients with
medical complications, number of patients discharged to an intermediate care facility, days of
hospitalization or total hospital charges?
There was no association between the closure of the St. James Olympia Fields Hospital trauma unit and
an increase in in-hospital deaths or the likelihood of a patient being discharged to an intermediate care
facility (Table 8). Intermediate care facilities include rehabilitation centers, nursing homes, skilled
nursing facilities, hospice centers and other undefined facilities. There was also no association between
complications as a result of traumatic injury and the closure of the trauma unit. The trauma complications
were analyzed collectively and individually. The trauma complications included in the analysis were
general complications with ICD-9-CM codes of 958 to 959, poisoning during the course of medical
treatment, acute posthemorrhagic anemia, cerebral edema/anoxia/encephalopathy, hypotensive shock,
pulmonary insufficiency as a result of trauma, acute respiratory failure, and septicemia.
There was a significant increase in the odds of a patient requiring mechanical ventilation after the closure
of the St James Olympia Fields Hospital trauma unit among patients coming from area 1 of the Olympia
Fields catchment area (adjusted OR =1.58; CI95%: 1.10, 2.26). Based on the regression model, the
predicted probability that a patient would require mechanical ventilation rose from 5.3% to 8.9% among
those coming from area 1. When we used only patient records from the trauma registry, there was also a
significant association between mechanical ventilation and the closure of the trauma unit among patients
coming from area 3 (Table 8).
Patients from area 1 and 3 showed a significant increase in their total length of hospitalization after the
closure of the St. James Olympia Fields trauma unit, although the increases were modest. However, the
average increase was less substantial among patients coming from area 3 (increase of 0.22 days;
approximately 5 hours longer stay) than from area 1 (increase of 0.41 days; approximately 10 hours
longer stay). (Table 9) Hospital charges showed a slight but significant decline after the closure of the
trauma unit among patients from areas 1 and 2. Trauma patients treated in any of the 30 hospitals
included in this study did not have a significant change in total charges after July 2008, despite .

34

 Among the hospitals with trauma units most affected by the closing of Olympia Fields – specifically
Advocate Christ Hospital -- has there been an increase in adverse effects among the patients treated in
these facilities?
It is conceivable that in facilities overburdened by excess patient volume because of the closure of St
James Olympia Fields Hospital trauma unit, trauma teams would be activated for a lower proportion of
patients because their resources are over extended. Advocate Christ Hospital did go on bypass more
frequently after the closure of the Olympia Fields trauma unit, but the duration of the bypass times
decreased. In addition, Christ Hospital increased staffing by eight trauma surgeons, in part to address an
increase in patient volume as a result to the changes in the trauma system. However, the staffing increase
was also in response to an expansion the type of trauma services Advocate Christ Hospital provides. It
was also reported that even when Advocate Christ Hospital goes on bypass, it accepts severely injured
cases that have only neurosurgical needs. These patients are admitted directly to the neurosurgical
intensive care unit. In our analysis of patients treated at Advocate Christ Hospital, more patients required
mechanical ventilation (adjusted OR=1.61; CI95%:1.25, 2.09; p<0.001) and the length of stay was
slightly longer after July 1, 2008 (increase of 0.17 days; CI95%: 0.02, 0.32; p=0.032). Among those
transferred from the Olympia Fields catchment area to Advocate Christ Hospital, we found no evidence of
a negative effect across any of the key outcome measures, except that hospital charges were higher among
persons transferred after the closure of the St. James trauma unit (increase of $2,284; CI95%: 540, 4028).

 CONCLUSION

Although there were no immediate adverse effects, Advocate Christ Hospital has picked up the
majority of seriously injured patients that previously would have been treated at Olympia Fields.
Advocate Christ Hospital is the only facility with specialized trauma care within the Southern
Cook County area. The system is not static, population shifts and changes to factors that are
associated with injury -- traffic patterns, poverty, crime, and aging populations -- may result in
long term effects missed by this analysis. The Project Management Team for this study
recommends the following policy changes to improve and safeguard the regional trauma system
in Southern Cook County:
1. Create a centralized ambulance service in Southern Cook County - Many of the
communities in Southern Cook County have very limited resources to provide adequate prehospital care to persons injured within their cities. St. James Olympia Fields Hospital staff has
reported to us that many ambulance services continue to bring acutely injured patients to St
James Olympia Fields and Chicago Heights Hospitals. This is occurring because many of the
ambulance services of towns in the most southern section of Cook County are reluctant to
transport patients so far north to Advocate Christ, West to Silver Cross, or south to Kankakee
Hospital. These long transport times often means an ambulance unit is unavailable for other
services for more than 2 hours. Therefore, many ambulance services are transporting patients to
St James Olympia Fields or Chicago Heights Hospitals to be stabilized, and then these patients
are primarily being transferred to Advocate Christ Hospital. A centralized ambulance service
would ensure that resources are equitably and efficiently distributed among the Southern Cook
County communities. A centralized system could be (1) owned and managed by the county, (2)
a co-op funded by cities on the southside, or (3) a hybrid system that creates a centralized
management group to oversee a private/public ambulance system.
2. Develop pathways to facilitate coordination and planning between hospitals with
specialized trauma units independent of trauma region - Currently, Advocate Christ Hospital
is the primary facility treating persons suffering serious injuries in Southern Cook County.
Ongoing population shifts may increase the frequency in which Advocate Christ Hospital is
unable to treat all injured patients seeking treatment at their facility. Coordination and planning
between facilities with existing specialized trauma units, independent of trauma region, may help
reduce or prevent disruptions in trauma care.
3. Create a system in Illinois to designate hospitals as level III and IV trauma units Approximately half of all acutely injured persons in Illinois are treated at hospitals without
specialized trauma care. Many hospitals are currently acting as de factor level III trauma
facilities (i.e. a facility used to stabilize patients before transfer to a higher level trauma unit).
Most hospitals coordinate and communicate with other hospitals within and outside their EMS
region, regardless of whether they have specialized trauma teams. A hospital does not have to be
part of an EMS region to be able to access the regional trauma committee. However, creating a
support structure to facilitate and enhance the integration of hospitals without specialized trauma
units into regional trauma systems would (1) improve inter-hospital coordination by facilitating
communication between hospitals (2) bring more active partners to the table, (3) and identify
trauma training needs at Level III or IV facilities. Additionally, by certifying hospitals as level
III/IV facilities, policy makers will be able to inform local constituencies about trauma resources
36

Page 88 of 96

 that are generally unrecognized within their communities (i.e. nearby community hospitals that
provide trauma care). Expansion of the existing trauma system and providing adequate training
requires an increase of financial and administrative support by the State to both hospitals with
specialized trauma units and hospitals caring for trauma patients without a recognized/certified
trauma team. Without cost sharing arrangements and administrative support from IDPH, any
move to expand the current trauma system will likely be resisted by many hospitals.
4. Continued active surveillance of the long term impact of closing the Saint James
Olympia Fields Hospital Trauma Center - The current analysis is restricted to the evaluation
of the immediate impact of closing the St. James Olympia Fields Hospital trauma unit.
However, the system is not static, population shifts and changes to factors that are associated
with injury -- traffic patterns, poverty, crime, aging populations -- may result in long term effects
missed by this analysis. As part of an ongoing surveillance program, an annual report should be
generated on this issue using the data sources made available for this analysis. Developing an
annual forum to share and discuss the annual report with trauma directors within Cook County
and the surrounding region would be an important element of the proposed ongoing surveillance
program. This will enable trauma directors to improve coordination and planning. As part of
developing an ongoing injury surveillance program in Cook County, it is important to work
closely with the State and other important partners to ensure that the data required for the
surveillance program is easily accessible. The Emergency Medical System Pre-Hospital
database, the Illinois Trauma Registry and the Hospital Discharge database are critical to
examining factors that inform and provide evidence for decision making on issue of trauma care.
One major barrier is that the Chicago Fire Department stopped reporting to the state Emergency
Medical System Pre-Hospital database in 2006. Because of the importance of the data, the
Chicago Fire Department should be compelled to report to the State all of its EMS prehospital
run data. Furthermore, EMS reporting should be carefully evaluated statewide to improve
completion of data fields so that the Emergency Medical System Pre-Hospital database can be
better utilized for system evaluations such as this report.
