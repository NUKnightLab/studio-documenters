programs are available on the DPL website, detroitpubliclibrary.org.
Midtown Plaza Project
Mrs. Mondowney reported that Main Library is currently hosting the three finalist design
concept models for the proposed Midtown Plaza Project. The models represent ideas
for an urban and landscape design strategy and connection framework for the twelve
institutions located in the Cultural Center that include the Detroit Institute of Arts, the
Charles Wright Museum, Detroit Historical Museum and Main Library. The firms are
Agence Ter (Paris, France), Mikyoung Kim Design (Boston, Massachusetts) and Ten x
Ten (Minneapolis, Minnesota). A final selection is scheduled to be announced at Main
Library on Monday, June 10, 2019.
Musical Instruments & DPSCD
Mrs. Mondowney reported that DPL branches and Main Library will serve as collection
points for gently used musical instruments donated to the Detroit Public Schools
Community District. The school district is rebuilding its music programs by developing
bands, orchestras and jazz bands in all high schools. DPSCD will advertise DPL
locations as instrument drop off points and will collect the instruments from library
locations during the summer.
Spanish Language Movies
Mrs. Mondowney reported that for the second year, classic movies in Spanish for
families were shown at the Campbell Branch Library on Saturday from January – April.
The movies, which are not generally available in the U.S., have been recently restored
and have had English sub-titles added. During the 15-week series, 350 people viewed
the movies that were provided to the Campbell Branch by the Mexican Consulate.
Princess & Prince Tea Party
Mrs. Mondowney reported that “Tea and Books: Two of Life’s finest Pleasures,” is the
theme of the 2019 Princess and Prince Annual Tea Party, which will be held at noon, on
Saturday, June 1, 2019, at Main Library. The party includes stories, magic, free books,
and games.
Branch Activities
Mrs. Mondowney reported that the Bowen, Campbell, Chaney, Douglass, Duffield and
Knapp branches will provide opportunities for children to create a special Father’s Day
craft, June 11-14, 2019.

Tax Program

program at Main Library’s Business, Science and Technology Department ended on
April 13, 2019. Approximately 800 clients were served by Accounting Aid Society
volunteers in an appointment-only format. Prior to this year, clients were served on a

COMMITTEE ON BUILDINGS/COMMITTEE ON FINANCE

Approval to Install a Mini-Split Ductless HVAC System at Bowen Branch Library
The Facilities Department is seeking approval of a contract to provide labor, materials
and equipment for the installation of a Mini-Split Ductless HVAC system at Bowen
Branch Library, located at 3648 W. Vernor Avenue, Detroit, MI 48216.
Minutes were approved at the June 18, 2019 Commission Meeting

The high temperatures during the summer months cause health and safety issues at the
Bowen Branch forcing it to close on extremely warm days. The proposed HVAC system
would provide cooling to the branch and allow it to remain open on the warmer summer
days.
An Invitation for Bid (IFB), IFB-CL-1917, was posted on DPL’s website and sent to the
MITN (Michigan Inter-Governmental Trade Network) on March 1, 2019. The solicitation
period was from March 1, 2019 until bid closing at 2:00 p.m. on March 27, 2019, at
which time the bid documents were no longer available for download. The bid was
downloaded from the MITN website by twenty-three (23) contractors. Nine (9)
contractors attended the mandatory site visit and four (4) companies submitted bids on
the project, as follows:
A/C Building Systems, Inc.
47448 Pontiac Trail, Suite 333
Wixom, MI 48393

$68,000

Alpha Mechanical Service Group
33200 Schoolcraft
Livonia, MI 48150

$73,400

Temperature Services, Inc.
36769 Schoolcraft
Livonia, MI 48150

$79,888

Allied Building Services
1801 Howard
Detroit, MI 48216

$93,000

The Facilities Department reviewed all of the bids submitted. The bid from A/C Building
Systems Inc. of Wixom, MI, in the amount of $68,000 was rejected because the
company failed to provide a detailed price breakdown and the exhaust cut sheets and
CFM exhaust performance curve, as required by the IFB. The missing details were
critical to determining the company’s ability to meet the requirements of this project.
The Facilities Department recommends Alpha Mechanical, Inc., the second lowest,
acceptable bidder, qualified to complete this project.
Therefore, the Procurement Department is recommending approval to contract with
Alpha Mechanical, Inc. for an amount not to exceed $73,400.

COMMISSION ACTION
Commissioner Bellant moved approval. Commissioner Friley supported. The motion
passed unanimously
