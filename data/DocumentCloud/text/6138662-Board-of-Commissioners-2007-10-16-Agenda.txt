EXEMPTION ORDINANCE ("N.P.H.E.")
PREAMBLE
WHEREAS, the County of Cook, Illinois, is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article
VII, Section 6( a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and pursuant to the authority therein granted, may
exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the reassessment system in the County of Cook causes a shift of the tax burden; and
WHEREAS, the residential real estate property values over the last ten years have grown significantly
faster than any other segment of the real estate market, and as a result, residential property taxpayers have
seen their property tax bills and their share of the tax burden increase more rapidly than other taxpayers;
and
WHEREAS, the reassessment increases and the shifting tax burden often results in homeowners
receiving significant, unpredictable increases in their property tax bills, causing severe financial hardship
for them; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners previously recognized this issue for mixed use
residential property and Class 3 rental property by reducing the applicable assessment levels; and
WHEREAS, on July 12, 2004, the 93rd General Assembly of Illinois enacted Public Act 93-0715, which
authorized a county to adopt an alternative general homestead exemption, 35 TLCS 200/15-176, ("7%
assessment cap"); and
WHEREAS, on July 13, 2004, the Cook County Board of Commissioners adopted by ordinance (04-033) the provisions of the alternative general homestead exemption, 35 ILCS 200/ 15-176; and
WHEREAS, the 7% assessment cap resulted in a taxable value that grows more predictably, allowing
homeowners the peace of mind of being able to plan and anticipate their tax bills; and
WHEREAS, the 7% assessment cap provided an immediate and effective form of property tax relief
available to homeowners in the County of Cook; and

3780

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 16, 2007

WHEREAS, effective October 12, 2007, the 95th General Assembly of Illinois overrode the Governor's
Amendatory Veto (Public Act 95-XXXX), and extended the alternative general homestead exemption for
another triennial for each reassessment district; and

WHEREAS, the 7% assessment cap is but one aspect of the effort to stop the ever increasing tax burden
on the neighborhoods of Chicago and Cook County, with the long-term goal of restructuring a fairer and
more predictable property tax system; and
WHEREAS, Illinois' tax structure is over-reliant on property taxes to fund schools and loca l taxi ng
districts and is in need of major reform; and
WHEREAS, the County Board is desirous of implementing the provisions of 7% assessment cap as
provided in Public Act 95-XXXX.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
COUNTY OF COOK, ILLINOIS, PURSUANT TO PUBLIC ACT 95-XXXX, THE COUNTY OF

WHEREAS, Cook County is the 19th largest unit of government in the nation representing more than
five million residents in 128 municipalities and 30 townships; and

3787

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 16, 2007

WHEREAS, as mandated by State Jaw, County government has principal responsibility for the protection
of persons and property, the provision for public health services and the maintenance of County
highways; and
WHEREAS, Cook County is the largest provider of indigent health care in the state and the third largest
provider of such care in the nation, operates one of the largest unified courts systems in the world and
operates the largest single site jail complex in the country; and
WHEREAS, the County and the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability have concluded that the
County' s revenues are not keeping pace with the County 's statutory obligations and thus has created a
structural deficit of which the County cannot simply cut its way out; and
WHEREAS, the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability has analyzed the County's expenditures and
revenues and concluded that the County needs to generate more revenue to eliminate its structural deficit;
and
WHEREAS, like other local governments, Cook County uses a mix of revenue sources to fund public
services, including sales taxes, cigarette taxes, a variety of fees for specific services delivered, and a
property tax levy which has been frozen for the last ten years; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has not raised the County's property tax levy,
the County largest source of revenue, in a decade which has effectively lost 23% of its value since 1997;
and
WHEREAS, there are very few options for the County to generate the revenue necessary to eliminate its
structural deficit and the Cook County Board of Commissioners does not want to make it difficult for
homeowners to remain in their homes by increasing the County's property tax levy; and
WHEREAS, raising the County sales tax levy is not the most desirable option for increasing revenue, but
may be necessary; and
WHEREAS, every quarter percent of the County 's sales tax levy generates approximately $100 million;
and
WHEREAS, the County has searched for new sources of revenue and will continue to look to the federal
and state governments for new major sources of revenues that do not put additional burdens on the
County's taxpayers; and
WHEREAS, the County shall consider abating taxes if it finds new sources of revenue to help fix the
County' s structural deficit.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, if the Cook County Board of Commissioners increases the
County 's sales tax levy, that the County continues to find new efficiencies to reduce County expenditures
and continues to work with the federal and state governments to find new sources of revenue that do not
burden the taxpayers and eliminates the structural deficit; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, if the Cook County Board of Commissioners does decide to increase
the County's sales tax levy, that in the future, for every new recurring sources of revenue the County
receives, equaling $100 million, the County will abate the County portion of the sales tax by a quarter
percent until the levy is reduced to its current level of three-quarters percent (0.75%).

RESOLUTION TO RESCIND COLAS IN FAVOR OF ESSENTIAL
HEALTHCARE SERVICES FOR THE POOR
WHEREAS, on July 31, 2007, the Cook County Board of Commissioners passed a Substitute Fund
Transfer Resolution, Resolution 07-R-312, to ensure that the non-union employees of Cook County
received a Cost of Living Adjustment ("COLA"); and
WHEREAS, on September 6, 2007, the Cook County Board of Commissioners passed an additional
Fund Transfer Resolution, Resolution 07-R-347, with the purpose of ensuring that grant program funded
non-union employees of Cook County also received a COLA; and
WHEREAS, on July 31, 2007, the Cook County Board of Commissioners made clear there existed an
understanding during the 2007 budget discussions that COLAs would be funded upon the availability of
additional revenues; and
WHEREAS, the additional revenues utilized to fund said COLAs are one-time revenues, which have
now been exhausted because of the COLAs. The application of one-time revenues to fund reoccurring
future expenses, without additional and consistent future revenues, is void of logic and financially
irresponsible; and
WHEREAS, federal and state subsidies for county health care programs have decreased as county cost
pressures have increased and most of its revenue sources have either remained flat or actually declined.
This enduring disparity of revenue growth performance below inflation and service costs growth at rates
above inflation has created chronic annual budget deficits; and
WHEREAS, Cook County's annual expenditures have exceeded annual revenues over the past five
years, the Board of Commissioners must act responsibly. Decisions made during a deficit environment to
further burden the amount of expenses must be accompanied by decisions to increase revenues; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners should remain true to their mission to provide a
comprehensive program of quality healthcare with respect and dignity to the residents of Cook County in
accordance with their ability to pay. The poor and sick of this County must have access to essential
healthcare services, closing more clinics and reductions in the Bureau of Health Services is not an
acceptable option in confronting these fiscal challenges.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
Board of Commissioners shall be financially responsible when making decisions during a deficit
environment and restrain from committing itself to the funding of reoccurring future expenses by way of
application of one-time revenues. The Board of Commissioners shall not forsake the poor in need of
essential healthcare services in favor of funding COLAs; and

Resolution, Resolution 07-R-347, passed on September 6, 2007, until such time when the funding of said
Resolutions shall not prejudice the poor, nor stand to jeopardize access to essential healthcare services;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners shall rescind the Substitute Fund
Transfer Resolution, Resolution 07-R-312, passed on July 31 , 2007, and the additional Fund Transfer
Resolution, Resolution 07-R-347, passed on September 6, 2007, until such time when the funding of said

Transmitting a Communication from
TIMOTHY C. EV ANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a five-year county-wide contract with
LexisNexis, Inc., a division of Reed Elsevier, Inc., Dayton, Ohio, for online legal research services. This
request is on behalf of all Cook County departments and agencies that use these services. LexisNexis,
Inc. currently provides these services to Cook County under Contract No. 05-43-87, which expires
November 30, 2007.
Reason:

For the past several months, a committee comprising representatives from the Office of the
Chief Judge, the Office of the Cook County State 's Attorney, the Law Office of the Cook
County Public Defender and the Bureau of Information Technology and Automation
conducted a Request for Proposals ("RFP"). Based upon this process, the committee
unanimously recommends that Cook County accept the proposal from LexisNexis, Inc. for
on line legal research services. The committee's recommendation is based on low pricing,
significant price discounts on hard copy publications, reductions in shipping costs for hard
copy publications, enhanced investigatory tools and the high quality of services provided by
LexisNexis, Inc. over the past several years.

The proposed contract provides unlimited access to the most frequently used research libraries, unlimited
training support, printing, citation checking and customized services. The contract would also add
"Accurint for Law Enforcement,'' a superior public-records tool, for up to I 00 authorized users.
The pricing for 2008 of $40,700.00 per month, reflects a modest increase from the current monthly price
of $38,500.00, primarily due to the incorporation of Accurint services. However, this increase will be
offset by di scounts on book purchases and related shipping and handling costs. Overall, the cost of the
proposed contract would still be substantially below costs incurred in the past. The proposed price for
2008 of $488,400.00 would be 3 1 percent less than the actual contract cost for the year 2001, $71 1,880.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $2,404,922.40. [FY 2008 - $469,450.08 ($39, 120.84 per month); FY 2009 $475,2 17.28 ($39,60 1.44 per month); FY 2010 - $480,984.48 ($40,082.04 per month); FY 2011 $486,751.68 ($40,562 .64 per month); and FY 20 12 - $492,5 18.88 ($41 ,043.24 per month)). (various
departments - 353). Grant funded amount: $97,077.60 [FY 2008 - $ 18,949.92 ($1 ,579.16 per month) ;
FY 2009 - $ 19,182.72 ($1 ,598.56 per month); FY 2010 - $19,415.52 ($ 1,617.96 per month); FY 201 1 $ 19,648.32 ($ 1,637.36 per month); and FY 2012 - $ 19,881.12 ($1 ,656.76 per month)). (655-220
Account). Contract period: December 1, 2007 through November 30, 2012.

actual payments made during the ten year interval and the determination, at the end of this interval, of the
amount required to satisfy any future IMRF obligations to former SCCTSD employees.
It is further requested that the Treasurer be directed pursuant to County Resolution 07-R-258 approved
and adopted June 5, 2007 to deposit any funds paid to the County as a result of this intergovernmental

Stroger, President and Joseph Mario Moreno, County Commissioner; Co-Sponsored by
John P. Daley, Forrest Claypool, Peter N. Silvestri, Gregg Goslin, Elizabeth "Liz"

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
COOK COUNTY AUTOMATED RED LIGHT TRAFFIC SAFETY SYSTEM

provide for the protection of persons and property; and
WHEREAS, certain intersections can be dangerous due to various reasons including,
but not limited to, motorists not respecting traffic lights; and

3852

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 16, 2007

WHEREAS, many c1t1es, including Chicago, have successfully installed and used
video cameras to assist law enforcement agencies in enforcing traffic laws; and

WHEREAS, the system would also serve as a passive deterrent, helping ensure the
public safety by reducing the number of accidents and resulting injuries or deaths.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, that Chapter 82 Traffic and Vehicles, Article IV, Sections 82-101
through 82-104 of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
ARTICLE IV. Automated Red Light Traffic Safety System
Sec. 82-101. Purpose--Establishment of automated red light traffic safety system.
Sec. 82-102. Automated red light violation.
Sec. 82-103. Citation notice.

Mark Etzbach, Sales Director, Redflex
George Blakemore, Concerned Citizen
Greg Zito, Redspeed Illinois

Commissioner Silvestri stated that he received a correspondence from the Police Chief of the Village of
Glenview, which he distributed a copy to all of the committee members. Because of this correspondence,
he will be introducing an amendment to the proposed ordinance, which allows the County to enter into
Intergovernmental Agreements with local municipalities on County jurisdiction roads in villages.
Further, Commissioner Silvestri stated that as a general concept when the Highway Department Sheriffs
Office are doing anything in any incorporated area they should be consulting with the local jurisdiction.
Commissioner Daley inquired as to whom instructed Redflex to conduct a feasibility study.
Chairman Moreno stated that it was through President Stroger' s office to check the feasibility .
Vice Chairman Gorman inquired as to how the cameras will be funded.
Chairman Moreno stated that based upon the studies that have been conducted by the two companies,
Redflex and Redspeed 11linois, in connection with President Stroger's office the estimated revenues that
could possibly be generated would be more than enough to cover the cost of the cameras.

3853

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 16, 2007

Chairman Moreno further stated that there has been actual data collected by the City of Chicago and other
municipalities that it has been estimated that in just twenty-five intersections the County would be able to
generate approximately $1. 7 million per year per intersection and the cost of the installation and
maintenance of the cameras is well below the revenues that could be generated.
Vice Chairman Gorman inquired as to the cost of installing the cameras and what the practice is of the
municipalities or the local governments on the payments of the hard costs.
Mark Etzbach, with Redflex responded that there would not be any cost to the County. The vendor
installs the cameras at their own capital expense.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved to approve the Ordinance
(Communication No. 289087).
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved to accept Amendment No. 1,
to remove the reference of the Highway Department in Section 82-103 and add the following
language "a copy of the recorded images; a warning that failure to pay the penalty or to contest
liability in a timely manner is an admission of liability and may result in a suspension of the driving
privileges of the registered owner." The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved to accept Amendment No. 2, to
add the following language to Section 82-101 (c): "Upon application by a local municipality, the
County may permit through intergovernmental agreement, the local municipality to install and
maintain such a system and issue citations, with all costs paid by and all fines paid to the local
municipality, at intersections which are under the maintenance and operation jurisdiction of the
County, but within the police jurisdiction of such municipality." The motion carried unanimously.
On the main motion made by Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, to
approve and adopt the Ordinance (Communication No. 289087), as amended. Commissioner
Peraica called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays being as follows:

Appeal of John & Margaret Jasinski, Amish Investment Corp., and Ron Brunsfeld.

Appeal No. APP-001-02-2002, 001-03-2002 & 001-04-2002
The property involved consists of six (6) vacant lots of record in Arthur Mcintosh and Company's
Hillside Addition to Barrington, a platted subdivision in unincorporated Barrington Township, Cook
County, Illinois, commonly described as 11 70 S. Summit Ave.; 1166-1170 S. Grove Ave; and, 1164-1166
S. Summit Ave. in the R-5 Single Family Residence District. Each lot is in excess of 21 ,000 sq. ft. in
area, District # 14.
Pursuant to the Cook County Zoning Ordinance, Article 13.3.5, the Cook County Board of
Commissioners shall consider the decision of the Zoning Administrator per Appeal Docket Nos. 001-022020, 001-03-2002 and 001-04-2002 in unincorporated Barrington Township.
The Zoning
Administrator's decision aggrieved the applicant seeking permit applications to build single-family homes
on parcels deemed "environmentally sensitive" by the Cook County Comprehensive Land Use and
Policies Plan.
On January 15, 2003 the Zoning Board of Appeals overturned the ruling of the Administrator, citing a
Supreme Court case limiting the jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers.
On March 18, 2003 the County Board approved the Zoning & Building Committee Report of March 11 ,
2003, in which the Committee voted to stay the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals, remand the
matter to that body for reconsideration and to report back to the Zoning & Building Committee by April
18, 2003 (moved by Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Commissioner Butler).
Commissioner Quigley voted no on this matter.

3865

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 16, 2007
Recommendation: The recommendation is based on the fact that the only unambiguous statement by the
Corps is that this property does not contain wetlands under the jurisdiction of the Corps. If the Appeals
Division of the Corps sends a further letter before the County Board makes its decision, we recommend
that the terms of that letter be followed by the County Board. That means, if the Corps reiterates that this
property does not include wetlands subject to the jurisdiction of the Corps, the building permit or permits
should be issued. However, if the Appeal Decision is that the property does include such wetlands, the
permit or permits should not be issued.
Commissioner Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Quigley, moved to reject the recommendation
made by the Zoning Board of Appeals, and deny the appeal of the applicant of the decision of the
Zoning Administrator. The motion carried unanimously.
Vice Chairman Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved to adjourn. The motion carried
and the meeting was adjourned.

existence in unincorporated Cook County. He added that there are annual inspections of these signs.

WHEREAS, under the Cook County Wheel Tax on Motor Vehicles Ordinance of the

$40; and
WHEREAS, under the present ordinance the cost of the vehicle sticker doubles to
$80 for residents after July I st; and
WHEREAS, a review of late fees for Cook County municipalities shows late fee
penalties ranging from $10 to $15 dollars; and
WHEREAS, Cook County 's late fees are excessive and a hardship for many
residents of the unincorporated areas; and
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 74,
Article XIV Wheel Tax, Section 74-568 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended
as follows:

3876

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 16, 2007

Sec. 74-568. Penalty for ordinance violation.
(a) Late fee. Any owner as defined in Section 74-551 or 74-552 who
purchases a license after July 1 or other due date as defined in Section 74-55 9(b) or
Section 74-559(c) shall pay a late fee penalty equal to the amount due for the lieense
fee but not less than $25.00 per lieense, whiehever is more. Persons over age 05,
physieally handieapped individuals, or disabled veterans shall not be eharged more
than $25 .00 for a late fee of $15.00.

*Referred to the Committee on Finance on 07/31107.
Commissioner Goslin began by stating that other governmental entities who require the purchase of
annual vehicle stickers charge minimal late fees for those stickers purchased after the required deadline.
It currently costs $40 to purchase a Cook County vehicle sticker, and the late fee added to this price is
$40. This essentially doubles the price of the vehicle sticker for those who purchase it late. He has
received many complaints from township clerks and supervisors regarding the steep late fee.
Commissioner Gorman inquired whether Commissioner Goslin believed that township clerks' complaints
would be alleviated if this proposed fee reduction was approved.
Commissioner Goslin responded that he believed the complaints would be minimal.
Barbara Bruno, Director of the Cook County Department of Revenue, spoke to the Committee on the
fiscal impact of the proposed amendment. She stated that in 2005, the County did not have a penalty
structure in place, and as a result received $0 in penalties. In 2006, the County received $487,000 in
penalties. This represents more than one quarter of the $2. l million received as a result of the tax. She
stated that the County would lose approximately $307 thousand if the penalty decrease was passed.
Commissioner Goslin asked Ms. Bruno to explain the communication process used by the Department of
Revenue to inform or remind residents to purchase their vehicle stickers.
Ms. Bruno explained that the Department begins each year with a new database from the Illinois
Secretary of State containing information on residents who have registered their cars at an unincorporated
Cook County address. Working with the County's Department for Management of Information Systems,
the Department of Revenue compiles a list of residents who would be required to purchase a Cook
County vehicle sticker. Applications are sent to these residents, infonnation is posted on the Department
of Revenue's website and public service announcements are issued. She stated that communication with
the townships is continuous during the process.
Commissioner Peraica expressed concern over the excessive fee currently charged to low income and
senior residents.
Commissioner Schneider pointed out that senior residents living in unincorporated Cook County pay
$5.00 for a vehicle sticker that is good for that vehicle for the rest of their lives. He added that there was
some confusion related to this that could be resolved through further communication with senior residents
of unincorporated Cook County.
Chairman Daley asked Ms. Bruno if township clerks were taking it upon themselves to waive the penalty
for the vehicle sticker.

3877

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 16, 2007
Ms. Bruno responded that one Clerk was doing so. However, as a result of several meetings with
township clerks and supervisors, there appeared to be a greater level of communication between the
County and townships.
Commissioner Sims asked Ms. Bruno if additional methods or locations used to purchase stickers had
been explored.
Ms. Bruno responded that this year the townships will receive the stickers for purchase by residents when
the applications are mailed out, allowing for those residents to purchase in person at the township offices,
rather than by mail.
Chairman Daley suggested that the Department of Revenue explore the possibility of selling the vehicle
stickers at suburban commissioners' offices.
Commissioner Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Schneider, moved that the Ordinance
Amendment (Communication No. 288469) be approved and adopted. Commissioner Peraica called
for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays being as follows:

WHEREAS, the month of October is recognized as Breast Cancer Awareness Month; and
WHEREAS, in the United States, an estimated 180,510 new invasive cases of breast cancer are expected
to occur among women in the year 2007 and about 2,030 new cases of breast cancer are expected to be
diagnosed in men; and
WHEREAS, an estimated 40,910 breast cancer deaths are anticipated this year (40,460 women, and 450
men); and
WHEREAS, there are slightly more than two million women living in the United States who have been
diagnosed with and treated for breast cancer; and
WHEREAS, in the most recent time period (1987-2000) breast cancer incidence rates have increased
only in women age 50 and older; and
WHEREAS, the risk of breast cancer increases with age. The risk is higher in women who have a
personal or family history of breast cancer. Mammography exams are especia lly valuable as an early
diagnostic tool because they can identify breast abnormalities that may be cancer at an early stage before
physical symptoms develop. Numerous studies have shown that early detection increases survival and
treatment options; and
WHEREAS, the American Cancer Society recommends that women age 40 and older have an annual
mammogram and an annual clinical breast examination by a healthcare professional, and perform
monthly breast self-examination.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Members of the Board of
