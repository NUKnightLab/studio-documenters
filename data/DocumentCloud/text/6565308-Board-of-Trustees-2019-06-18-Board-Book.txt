Finance Committee Report:
Finance Committee Chair Leonard reminded us that the Finance Committee met prior to the
Board meeting, and Director Morgan gave an in-depth review of the financials.
Director Morgan gave highlights from the Finance report. He stated in general property taxes
we received another small distribution in April and that along with the intergovernmental
reimbursement from the State of Ohio for Homestead Exemptions and Rollback it brings us well
within budget for month of April.
Director Morgan stated the Public Library Fund (PLF) distribution for this month was slightly
larger than anticipated. Last year we started the year with smaller distributions than expected
and as the year progressed, we received what we had budgeted. It looks like the same pattern
as last year, and a lot will depend on the Governors biennium budget in the second half of the
year. He stated we will continue to monitor this account closely. Salaries and benefits are all
within budget.
Director Morgan stated many of the other expense accounts percentages are high because we
have blanket purchase orders in those accounts. All other general fund expense accounts are
where we would expect them to be for the month and the year.
(See under FINANCE)
Investments - April
Director Morgan stated we purchased a US Treasury on April 30, 2019 at a yield of 2.40% with
a very short maturity date of two weeks and we also purchased a piece of commercial paper
from Bnp Paribas NY with a yield of 2.58% with a six-month maturity date.
We also had a CD that matured during the month and reinvested the principal into another CD
with Wells Fargo Bank with a yield of 2.35% that will mature in a little over a year.
We have changed our investment strategy within our Money Market funds by keeping a larger
balance in STAR Ohio, which is offering a higher rate than what we are receiving at Key Bank.
Transfers
Director Morgan stated there were two transfers made for the month, one from the Brecksville
special trust to the general fund for $30,406.56 to reimburse the expense of the renovation of
the meeting room space at CCPL Brecksville Branch, and another transfer from the general
fund to the special revenue fund for $71,400.00 to fund our match for the ASPIRE program.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE
Shared Values
In May, we held staff development sessions which featured a
presentation by Eric Klinenberg, author of the fascinating and
insightful book, Palaces for the People: How Social Infrastructure Can
Help Fight Inequality, Polarization and the Decline of Civic Life. In the
book, Klinenberg asserts that libraries are essential infrastructure for
healthy communities because they are places where neighbors can
debate big topics like immigration, access critical social beneﬁts and
connect with one another in meaningful ways.
One of the things I appreciate about Klinenberg is that he sees libraries
for what they have become – not simply places where people can ﬁnd
books and information, but places where people can ﬁnd themselves
and ﬁnd one another. Libraries, he asserts, bring people together to
build better, stronger communities and improve lives.
I am a big reader. What initially drew me to libraries as a career more
than 40 years ago was my love of books, reading and helping people
solve complex problems. Those three things are still our core values
today. It is only how we deliver on those core values that has changed.
There’s no question that the work of libraries looks different today than
it did yesterday – but it is still critically important. It may, perhaps, be
more important that it has ever been. We have evolved to meet the
needs of the communities we serve, but our evolution is far from over.
No matter what changes may come, if we remain true to our shared
beliefs – service to each other and to our communities – and let those
beliefs guide our work, we will always be impactful and relevant.

Regards,

Executive Director

@samanthacje, May 23, 2019

The Collection Development team, led by Mary Schrieber, hosted a successful “Youth Book Buzz” event at the ParmaSnow Branch. The event brought great new titles to the attention of staff and librarians visiting from other library
systems. The total attendance was 102.
The aroma of freshly baked cookies ﬁlled the Brooklyn Branch as 10 early elementary students and their parents
learned how to bake cookies using a Charlie Cart convection oven. The children followed the recipe, cracked eggs,
measured oil, mixed batter and dropped scoops of dough onto the cookie sheets to make the cookies. They also made
fruit parfaits by measuring milk, stirring pudding mix and cutting fresh fruit. The program combined math and literacy
skills for some of the branch’s youngest customers.
Fifty-four kids and caregivers enjoyed the “May the Fourth be With You” program at the Parma Heights Branch. At
this intergenerational Star Wars Day celebration, families snacked on Princess Leia buns, lightsaber pretzel rods and
Yoda soda while making construction paper Yodas. Many attendees came in costume, ready to pose for a fun green
screen picture.
The Brook Park Branch continues to evolve as a Family Place Library. The children’s area has been renovated with new
toys and storage units, and the car donated by Ford Motor Company has been relocated. The new play components
include a large ﬂoor play rug featuring roadways, runways and lakefront, along with accessories such as blocks,
wooden town buildings and vehicles. Additionally, a new play kitchen and grocery store checkout station have been
installed. As the area was being set up, several children jumped right in and started to use the play spaces with happy
smiling faces.
The North Olmsted Branch again partnered with North Olmsted City Schools to host AP testing for students. The
students enjoyed the opportunity to take their tests outside of their school environment, and they found the branch’s
meeting rooms to be quieter and less distracting than rooms available at the high school. Over the span of two weeks,
the branch hosted AP tests on 16 different subjects, which were attended by 292 students.

Olmsted Falls BSL I Lee Ikimis hosted the ﬁnal day of an eight-week “Design a Game Controller With Arduino” deep
dive program. Ten teens each made a unique and fully functional video game controller. They ﬁrst wired and coded the
insides of the controllers using Arduino, then they designed and built external cases on a 3-D printer. ITL Programming
Specialist Matt Skvasik collaborated with Lee to present this program.
The Strongsville Branch held its annual “Teen Volunteer Fair.” More than a dozen community organizations were
represented, including MedWish International, Camp Cheerful, W.A.G.S. for Kids and the Strongsville Emergency
Foodbank. Forty-three teens and parents attended.
The Parma Branch children’s staff presented 12 summer reading game assemblies at six schools for 2,215 elementary
students and teachers in May. Many excited students visited the branch to ask about the Grand Slam Summer Reading
Game and the books featured in the assemblies.
A community garden mural, designed by artist Augusto Bordelois and painted by local teens, was unveiled at the
Warrensville Heights Branch on May 16. The mural contains various cultural elements that represent the community’s
rich heritage. Among the event attendees were Deputy Director Tracy Strobel and City of Warrensville Heights Mayor
Bradley Sellers. The Russo and Kulp families – funders of the project – were also in attendance. The presentation was
facilitated by BSL I Isabel Klein, Branch Manager Ali Boyd, and Assistant Development Director Meghann Marnecheck.
After the unveiling, there was a Charlie Cart demonstration led by Culinary Literacy Manager Ron Block. Everyone
loved the art and enjoyed green smoothies and snacks!
Teens at the Southeast Branch used GarageBand to create their own songs and beats, in a program let by BSA II Tessa
Baer. Amid frustrations and laughter, some unique beats were developed. Two participants created beats that could
easily accompany a video game soundtrack while another, who is a member of a dance team, started choreographing
a dance routine to her song.
The Beachwood Branch’s eight-week current events discussion series, “Great Decisions,” wrapped up May 20 with
special guest Ambassador Heather Hodges, from the Cleveland Council on World Affairs. Ambassador Hodges spent
31 years working in the U.S. Foreign Service. She had many interesting stories to share related to the day’s topic (the
state of the State Department and diplomacy in the U.S.). Twenty-four adults enjoyed the ﬁnal program in this series,
which was arranged and facilitated by BSL Supervisor David McNally, with support from the Friends of the Beachwood
Library.
The Greater Cleveland Food Bank Mobile Pantry visited the Maple Heights Branch May 14. The mobile pantry brought
triple the quantity of food (6,000 pounds) compared to last year. Attendees were happy to bring home corn, apples,
potatoes and various other produce items. There were over 85 people in attendance for this event, which was facilitated
by BSL Supervisor Regina Stopper. Four more visits from the mobile pantry are planned this summer.
Seven Solon middle and high school students used the Solon Branch’s new 3-D pens for the ﬁrst time during a
Connected Learning program in May. The pens were a gift of the Friends of the Solon Library. They were a huge hit.
The same students have requested the pens every day since. Plans are underway to make them available on a regular
basis.
Disabled children from Greenview Upper Elementary School visited the South Euclid-Lyndhurst Branch one ﬁnal time
this school year. The students posed in front of the green screen for some exciting photos. They also created a booklet
in which each child wrote a thank you letter and detailed their favorite visit from the 2018-19 school year.

Financial Statement Analysis
May 2019

Revenues
For General Property Taxes we received another distribution for the first half settlement.
We should begin to see in June or July our next large advance for the second half of the
year. With this distribution we are on budget for property taxes.
Our May distribution for the PLF was larger than what we received last year. As I
mentioned last month, we believe the collections moving forward should be slightly
larger to bring us back to budget but, as we do every month, we will monitor this
account closely. With this larger distribution we are on budget for the PLF.
Interest is also exceeding our original estimates. The larger increase in rates than
expected has brought in additional revenue. Based on some of our recent maturities we
are beginning to see some of those increases leveling off.
Patron Fines and Fees in total are currently exceeding our estimates. Once again it is
passport fees and photos which are the reason for the increase. Sale of Resale
Supplies is also slightly exceeding our estimates.
All other revenue accounts are where we would expect them to be for the month and
the year.

Expenses
Expenses for Salaries and Benefits show a slight increase over budget which is
expected because the month of May has three payrolls posted to the account. This
expense will smooth out over the next several months. Our next three pay month is
later in the year. And as we have mentioned since the beginning of the year, we see
the account for health insurance is much closer to being back in budget with those early
funding of the HSA accounts.
Many of the other expense accounts have higher than expected percentages for
expenses and encumbrances because many of these accounts have standing orders
encumbered against them to pay monthly and recurring expenses.
All other General Fund expense accounts are where we would expect them to be for the
month and the year.
In the Capital Fund projects the final expenses for the Maple Heights renovation were
paid. The only projects open are the Bay Village and Richmond Heights Branches.

 25

Investments
We purchased two pieces of commercial paper – one from Coca Cola Company with a
yield of 2.49% and a little over a six month maturity and another one from Toyota Motor
Credit with a yield of 2.46% with a six month maturity.
We also purchased three CDs from Multi-Bank Securities with yields of 2.50% with a
two year maturity, 2.55% with a three year maturity and 2.65% with a four year maturity.
Our advisor from RedTree Investments felt these yields were good yields for us to look
at some longer maturities for those securities.

Transfers
There was one transfer for the month in the amount of $4,665,506.00 from the General
Fund to the Note Retirement Fund to pay our debt service for principal and interest for
the year. The first half of the payment (interest only) was paid this month.

Whereas, the Executive Director, or designee, did so advertise and pursuant to the
procedures contained in the Ohio Revised Code for the selection of
