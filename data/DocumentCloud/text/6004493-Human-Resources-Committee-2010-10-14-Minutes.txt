**Report from System Director of Human Resources (Attachment #1)
Deborah Tate, System Director of Human Resources, provided an update on the following activities:
implementation of the Taleo System; 100 in 100 – A Targeted Nursing Recruitment Campaign; and update on
the Personnel Rules.
During the discussion of the update on the Taleo System, Director Golden inquired whether there would be an
additional cost associated with the contract extension, or whether the contract was based upon deliverables. Ms.
Tate responded that she was unsure if there was a cost associated with the extension, but indicated that the Taleo
contract is with the County, not with the System.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Leadership Report – Organizational Re-design (continued)
Director Lyne inquired regarding the use of consultants. Mr. Foley indicated that, in terms of consulting
services, the following are companies providing the majority of consulting services at the System:
PricewaterhouseCoopers - providing services as part of the performance improvement initiative, which
includes Revenue Cycle activities; ACS - providing services as a partial outsourcing of information
technology services, and some services relating to the Lawson System; and Health Management Associates
(HMA) - providing consulting services relating to Medicaid strategies. He noted that a request for proposals
(RFP) has been issued for the partial outsourcing of information technology services; these services are meant
to supplement staffing, as many of these types of positions are difficult to recruit.
The Committee discussed some of the positions listed within the organization, with regard to functions and
whether they were expected to be needed only for a specific period, or whether they were expected to be
permanent. Director Golden inquired regarding the position title of System Director of Human Resources;
she asked whether this position should instead be titled Chief of Human Resources. Mr. Foley responded that
he has discussed the subject with Ms. Tate; the title that would be consistent with the industry would be Chief
Human Resources Officer.
With regard to the performance improvement initiative activities of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Director Golden
asked how ownership is shown for each of the initiatives. Mr. Foley responded that he can provide an
organizational structure for the performance improvement project, which includes an executive sponsor and
statement of work for each of the eight initiatives.

B. Update on employee influenza vaccination program
Dr. Patricia Kelleher, Director of Employee Health Services at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County,
provided an update on the employee influenza vaccination program. She presented a program summary
through April 30, 2010 (Attachment #3).
Dr. Kelleher provided information on employee educational efforts. She stated that the educational programs
will be System-wide, and will include online training for all employees.
