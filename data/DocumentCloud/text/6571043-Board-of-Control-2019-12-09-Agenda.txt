Jeremy Mio and Jeanelle Greene, Department of Information Technology, presented.
James Boyle commented that this item did not go through the entire OnBase workflow to secure all
appropriate approvals.
Michael Chambers indicated that it was his understanding that all approvals had not yet been received
and asked if the approval process will be complete once approved by the Office of Budget and
Management, as indicated in Ms. Greene’s presentation.
Andria Richardson, Clerk of the Board of Control explained how items route to various approvers from
different departments in OnBase and, in this case, several approvals were still required.
Mr. Boyle stated that the Board generally discourages walk-on requests and it was his inclination to hold
the item until all approvals were complete and asked what the urgency for approval of this amendment
was.
Mr. Chambers asked if the department had intended to begin services upon approval.
Nan Baker asked for confirmation that the Law Department has approved this amendment.
Mr. Chambers stated that the Board does not want items submitted late; however, the department does
not want to miss out on an opportunity for the necessary services during the time the provider is available.
Jerad Zibritosky, Department of Law, stated that he would need to follow up with his colleague in the Law
Department to confirm approval has been received.
Dale Miller recommended to hold the item until the end of the meeting until confirmation is received that
the Law Department has approved this request.
Jonathan McGory, Department of Law, stated that this amendment has received Law Department
approval.
Lenora Lockett indicated that this request had received cursory review as a department order but still
needs to be reviewed by the Office of Procurement and Diversity’s Purchasing Agent for all required
documents for a contract amendment.
Mr. Boyle expressed his concern that this is not the proper process for items coming to the Board for
approval as the Office of Procurement and Diversity and the Office of Budget and Management serve as
quality control mechanisms that are in place to ensure that rules, regulations and contracting provisions
are compliant.

19

 Mr. Chambers asked if this would be returned for approval as a mission critical service, if the item was
held.
Ms. Baker stated that she understands the need for services and that the Board should move forward with
this request to provide the department with the necessary services but acknowledged that this should not
be the normal course for approval.

NOTE:
Initially the expenses will be covered by HHS Levy Funds and will be reimbursed by Annie E. Casey Foundation
Purpose:
The Annie E. Casey Foundation is exploring a new training method called ShadowBox that aims to help child welfare
workers make the best decisions for kids and families. Named after the boxing practice of sparring with an imaginary
foe before a big bout, ShadowBox is designed to help people in high-stakes jobs – such as firefighters, military
personnel and nurses – think strategically. Gary Klein, a senior scientist at MacroCognition LLC, helped develop both
the training and the field of naturalistic decision making, which examines how people react and perform in
demanding situations. The Casey Foundation has worked with Klein’s team to pilot a ShadowBox approach tailored
for child protective workers in three sites: Jefferson County, Colorado, Cuyahoga County, Ohio; and Allegheny County,
Pennsylvania. The training goal? Promote a problem-solving mindset that emphasizes going above and beyond rules
and procedures to ensure a child’s well-being.

JAIL ELEVATOR CAMERA UPGRADES
Scope of Work Summary
Department of Information Technology on behalf of the Sheriff’s Office requesting approval of a RFP
Exemption for purchase and installation with Integrated Precisions Systems, Inc in the amount of
$53,892.44.
The County operates an Enterprise, Networked Physical Security System throughout the County. There
are over 200 existing cameras in Jails 1 and 2. Upon review of the issues presented by various assessments
of the facilities and a review with current Corrections’ Management, products and recommendations
were determined. The purchase of these cameras will assist staff in monitoring those inmates who are
being transported on any of the Correction Center’s 16 elevator cars. This procurement and installation
will allow for better monitoring of inmates and staff as prisoners are escorted throughout the Correction
Center.
The equipment being purchased is expanding the currently installed system that IPS is under contract to
maintain. Any additions to the current system will have to involve our current vendor (IPS) due to the
architecture and infrastructure that has been built out. Introducing other vendors and equipment is not
32

 cost effective or functionally appropriate. Should other vendors start supplying “pieces parts” to this
system, the County runs the risk of having multiple points of failure and complicates the management and
troubleshooting of the system. Doing so would compromise the integrity of the systems and create
confusion in the management and support of the systems. When the County required Whiting-Turner to
bid the security equipment for the new Maintenance Yard, months of additional time was added to the
project completion time line. In addition, tens of thousands of dollars was added to the cost of the project
for contractors and subcontractors. Further delays in the scope of work may place the health and safety
of inmates and/or staff at risk.
The costs provided are under IPS’s state term schedule pricing. The pricing for this equipment has been
vetted and reviewed by the State of Ohio’s Department of Administrative Services. In addition, some of
the pricing provided by IPS is below STS pricing. In the last six months, an RFQ and Bid were released for
work in County facilities. Only one vendor came back as qualified and responsive.
IT Approval occurs after Briefing Memo submission
Procurement
The procurement method for this project was RFP Exemption – State Contract. The total value of the
RFP Exemption is $53,892.44.
Integrated Precision Systems, Inc. (IPS) is able to provide the needed Access Control and Security Camera
and Storage solutions under Ohio STS #800545 which expires on January 31, 2021. The costs provided are
under IPS’s state term schedule pricing. The pricing for this equipment has been vetted and reviewed by
the State of Ohio’s Department of Administrative Services. In addition, some of the pricing provided by
IPS is below STS pricing.
