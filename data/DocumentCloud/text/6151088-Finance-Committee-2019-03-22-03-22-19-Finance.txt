 Project 1: Opioid Prescribing Social Network, CountyCare
Implications and Response
• Highly interconnected prescribers in the network’s core were clinicians of CCH’s chronic pain
management center. Their model of chronic pain management may be part of a national
solution.

• Prescribers in the network’s periphery and specialties like emergency medicine and procedural
specialties were vulnerable to exposing patients to high daily dose opioids through discoordinated
prescriptions.
• Cook County Department of Public Health targeted public health detailing toward
prescribers among procedural specialists.
• Illinois legislation (SB 1607) mandating prescribers to use the Prescription Monitoring Program for
first time opioid prescriptions to each patients went into effect January 2018. Evaluation of its
impact on CountyCare members planned.
