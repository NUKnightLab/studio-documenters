BOARD AGENDA

In order to close out an account for ADT professional security services for the 6th District office in the
end of the Commissioner’s term, the balance was paid from our facilities and office space rental budget.
This left a shortfall for the duration of the lease for facilities and office space rental budget and the utility
budget for the 6th district office which was approaching as the Commissioner’s term in office was coming
to an end. The transfer amount from the salary and wages fund to the facilities rental and utility funds is to
make the final payments for the rental of the district office and the final utility bills through the end of the
lease agreement which is also the conclusion of the Commissioner’s term in office.

To Account(s): 11306.1525.10830.520259/Postage $ 420,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $420,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date,
and what was the balance 30 days prior to that date?

On 7/13/2018 the Board determined that it would need $ 420,000.00 in postage funds for the balance of
Fiscal 2018. The balance at that time was $132,880.73. Those funds have been used and the account
balance at this time is $0.00. The balance in the postage account 30 days prior was $700,000.00.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified?
accounts that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.

This account supports election related professional services, the largest percentage of which is for
temporary staffing.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result
in the account that funds are transferred from.

NONE. The Board expends a significant amount of the appropriation on temporary staffing. It would be
acceptable to reduce the level of temporary staffing to provide sufficient funds for this transfer.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was
originally budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in
the fiscal year.

The need for professional services for the Primary Election was expected to be greater than the expenses
actually incurred.
