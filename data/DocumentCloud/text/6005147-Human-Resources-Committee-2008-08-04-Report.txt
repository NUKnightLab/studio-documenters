Chairman Zopp introduced Laura Lechowicz-Felicione, Special Counsel to Cook County Board President
Todd H. Stroger.
Ms. Lechowicz-Felicione introduced Patrick Blanchard, Assistant State's Attorney on Cook County
Shakrnan's Compliance, to provide background on the Shakrnan Decree and the Supplemental Relief
Order.
Mr. Blanchard began by stating that he, along with Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State's Attorney,
Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, are the attorneys who represent Cook County in the Shakman Litigation. He
then stated that in 1969, Michael Shakman, who was an independent running for a delegate position in the
Illinois Constitutional Convention, filed the class action lawsuit challenging the fairness of the elections.
He claimed that the Democratic Machine as it existed back in 1969 prevented him from engaging in a fair
electoral process. That litigation partly culminated in the 1972 Consent Judgment which dealt with
prohibiting employment action with regards to current employees insofar that employment action relates
to political considerations.
In 1983, the City of Chicago settled the remainder of that lawsuit insofar as prohibiting political
considerations from coming into play with regards to future employees.
In 1994, Cook County entered into a plan of compliance joining the City of Chicago and agreed to refrain
from using political considerations with regard to any aspect of employment, whether that be hiring,
firing, transfer, and the provision of overtime with regard to the vast majority of Cook County employees.
Political considerations, on the other hand, can be used with regard to a select number of positions. In
1996 Cook County agreed with the plaintiffs and identified 500 of those positions; those positions are
Shakrnan-exempt. Exempt positions are,those which are properly appointed by the President of the Cook
County Board; he or she is permitted to use political considerations in making those appointments.
Political considerations may involve Democrat/Republican considerations in a typical sense, but more
routinely involves policy loyalty where the President could not rely upon individuals that he or she selects
at the very highest part of the government to carry through with the campaign platform ideas.
In September 2006, the plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt and enforcement action in the United States
District Court; that action claimed that there were a series of identifiable instances of violation of the
Consent Decrees. Cook County filed a motion to dismiss that petition, however, over a period of several
months Cook County elected to enter into another settlement agreement with the plaintiffs that is now
known as the Supplemental Relief Order (SRO).
In October 2006, Cook County passed an Ordinance which reaffirmed and prohibited political
considerations in every aspect of employment decision-making, with the exception of Shakrnan-exempt
positions. The Cook County Ordinance went further than it ever had before when it placed the duty on
Cook County employees not only to not use political considerations with regard to making employment
decisions but it also placed a duty on every Cook County employee who witnesses or comes to know of
political discrimination to report that to the proper County authority. The failure of a County employee to
do that could result in his/herdischarge or other disciplinary action.

In February 2007, United States District Court Judge Wayne Anderson approved the Supplemental Relief
Order (SRO). The SRO involved the employment of former Judge Julia Nowicki to serve as Compliance
Administrator. Her basic duties can be summarized in the adjudication of claims of discrimination. Her
office received approximately 206 claims last year. She is also responsible for monitoring compliance
with the SRO and the prohibitions of the prior Consent Judgments. As part of the SRO, Cook County had
agreed to negotiate a new exempt list and undertake additional affirmative action to comply with the SRO
and prior Consent Judgments. (e.g. preparation of a new County hiring plan which is designed to offer
complete transparency to the hiring process).
Chairman Zopp asked where the employees report their complaints.
Mr. Blanchard stated that the Ordinance specifically refers to the Inspector General.
Chairman Zopp asked who is responsible for developing the new hiring plan and what involvement do
each of the hospitals have in ensuring that their interests are protected under that plan .

.

Jonathan Rothstein, Acting Bureau Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources of Cook County, responded
that his office is taking the lead in developing the new hiring plan. His office has had discussions with
Judge Nowicki and she indicated that a draft plan would be prepared by August 8, but it may be a week or
two off that schedule. Once the draft is completed it will be distributed to the System for input.
Director Carvalho inquired as to how many exempt positions are identified in the SRO.
Mr. Blanchard stated that the SRO calls for the renegotiation of the exempt list; currently the Plaintiffs
and Cook County representatives are negotiating the exempt list.
Ms. Lechowicz-Felicione stated that there are approximately 137 current exempt positions for the Bureau
of Health or currently now the Health and Hospitals System Board. Approximately 166 exempt positions
were presented to the Plaintiffs for the new exempt list. Furthermore, she stressed that it is not about the
number, rather, it is about whether the position falls into one of the defined categories for an exempt
position.
Director Carvalho stated that he was familiar with the standards. In fact, he participated in negotiations of
the settlement in 1994 and is interested to see whether there were any changes over the last year in
anticipation of the Bureau changing to the System.

Ms. Lechowicz-Felicione responded that few positions went from exempt to non-exempt and stated that
there are some creations of new exempt positions. She added that further discussion of the specifics
should take place in closed session.
Director Carvalho agreed.
Chairman Zopp suggested that the Committee first go through the presentation before going into
executive session.
Director Golden asked whether an employee can contact the Inspector General anonymously.

Mr. Blanchard responded that both the Shakman Ordinance in November 2006 and the Office of the
Independence Inspector General Ordinance from last year allow the report to remain anonymous.
Ms. Lechowicz-Felicione gave a training presentation to the Committee regarding the Shakman Decree
Unlawful Political Discrimination. (Attachment - "Backup for Item #3")
Ms. Lechowicz-Felicione stated that one of the things that President Stroger is doing to be in compliance
with the Supplemental Relief Order is to offer training to the County employees, especially the Bureau
Chiefs, Department Heads and anybody who is involved in the hiring/employment process. In addition to
the training session, the County has implemented certifications by County personnel who are involved in
the hiring process, as well as applicants who are coming into the County. At this time the County is in the
process of developing a new hiring plan and implementing practices that prevent Unlawful Political
Discrimination.
Chairman Zopp asked how many reports had been given to the Inspector General in the last year.
Ms. Lechowicz-Felicione stated that at this time she does not have the exact number but there might have
been two reports. She also stated that she has not seen a quarterly report from the Inspector General.
Chairman Zopp asked if the Inspector General does a report on just this issue or whether they do an
overall report.
Ms. Lechowicz-Felicione stated that th~ Inspector General does an overall report to the Board on claims
that have been filed to the Inspector General, which includes whether the investigation is ongoing and
whether the allegations and the complaint were sustained or not sustained.
Ms. Lechowicz-Felicione stated that she will provide the report to the Committee.
Ms. Lechowicz-Felicione stated that between August 2004 through February 2006, persons could file a
claim to Judge Nowicki, alleging that they were discriminated against for unlawful political reasons.
Approximately 204 claims were filed with her office and at this time she is in the process of adjudicating
those claims.
Director Carvahlo asked if it was public information to see which employees are exempt and which are
not.
Ms. Lechowicz-Felicione responded that it is public information and the list of employees that are exempt
is posted in the Bureau of Health Administrative Offices as well as in the Human Resource Department in
the Cook County Building on the eight floor.
Director Golden asked if she can have a copy of the presentation emailed to her.
Ms. Lechowicz-Felicione stated that she will email the presentation to the Committee.
Chairman Zopp introduced Judge Julia Nowicki, who addressed the Committee on her role as
Compliance Administrator.

Judge Nowicki stated that she has been primarily focusing on Human Resource practices and has found
that the Human Resource department at the County is understaffed and is not well equipped. A search
committee was charged with the duty of conducting a search for a new Human Resources Chief and the
results of that should be forthcoming.
Judge Nowicki stated that in her opinion in order to get any real changes there has to be dramatic changes
at the top. Furthermore, she stated that the new System Board needs a Human Resource Chief by way of
a selection committee process that is similar to that at the County.
Judge Nowicki stated that she has filed a number of reports; these reports identify problems and include
proposals for solutions. Her next report ,:"jIl be due in October.
Judge Nowicki introduced Leslye Jones-Beatty who is an attorney that works with her and has been
assigned along with other individuals to investigate some of the claims that were filed by those employees
associated with the Bureau of Health.
In conclusion, Judge Nowicki stated that she wants to be involved as much as the new board will allow
her to be.
Chairman Zopp thanked Judge Nowicki for her remarks. She stated that it is the Board's intent to ensure
that they have an independent head of Human Resource for the hospital system.
Chairman Zopp asked Judge Nowicki for her perspective on what she believes are critical to the existing
personnel policies that the System must keep or are critical to ensuring an open and transparent process.
Judge Nowicki stated that she has no intention of making anything more complicated then it should be.
Overall, she believed that the System needed an expert in Human Resources. Additionally, she stated that
the System Board needs to have a Human Resource Chief that has different policies for different kinds of
jobs.
Director Carvalho inquired into the length of Judge Nowicki's term.
Judge Nowicki responded that her term ends when Judge Anderson finds the County to be in substantial
compliance. The earliest that the County can make a motion to be found in compliance is December 31,
2008. But she did not believe that the County would file at that time, without having a new Independent
Inspector General, not having a Human Resource Director, and not having a hiring plan.
Director Carvalho asked what degree of freedom the System Board will have going forward in
establishing a personnel system, and whether the Board's needs to identify more people as at-will could
be addressed.
Ms. Nowicki believed that it would be a positive move if the System Board would start to have control
over the Shakman-exempt positions.

Chairman Zopp stated that David Small, Chief Operating Officer of the Cook County Bureau of Health
Services, drafted a letter for the Directors' review to be sent to administrators on the ability to hire into
those exempt positions.

Presentation on proposed physician salary reclassifications
Discussion and approval of proposed reclassifications.

Chairman Zopp invited the Chief Medical Officers that would be addressing the topic to
themselves: Maurice Lemon, MD, MPH - Interim Medical Director, Stroger Hospital of Cook
David Barker, MD - Chief Medical Officer, Ruth Rothstein Core Center; Judith Frigo, MD
Medical Officer, Oak Forest Hospital; Stephen Stabile, MD - Associate Chief Medical
Ambulatory and Community Health Network; Clifton Clarke - Chairman, Department of
Medicine, Provident HospitaL

County;
- Chief
Officer,
Internal

Chairman Zopp thanked the Chief Medical Officers for being patient when the Board decided to delay the
reclassification, which caused a lot of static with them and their staff. Chairman Zopp stated that she is
committed to getting the reclassifications resolved today and to make a recommendation to the Board so
that it can be voted on at Thursday's Boarq meeting.
Mr. Small asked Dr. Lemon to address the Committee.
Dr; Lemon stated that the first thing is to understand that the discrepancy in salaries has been realized and
appreciated for a long time and there has been an effort made over a year ago to address some of the
salaries. A look at individuals on the chart shows that it is not uniform across departments. Starting in
April of 2007 through September of 2007 there were a number of salary adjustments made in a number of
different departments.
Dr. Lemon stated that during planning for the fiscal year 2008 budget year, there was an effort to address
salary uniformity for the remainder of the physicians and non-physicians. With the delays in approving
the Fiscal Year 2008 budget, the reclassifications were put on hold. Subsequent to approving the 2008
budget there was a renewal effort beginning in March 2008 to revisit the list. The Department Chairs
were asked to resubmit their list; these were reviewed by the then Medical Director, Dr. Bradley Langer.
Between March and into May 2008, the list was further refined.
Dr. Lemon stated that it was his understanding that there was concern that putting everybody on one
request list at one time would not be received as well as breaking them down into separate lists; that is
why there was a group approved in June and another group that was submitted in July.
Chairman Zopp asked whether the Board should anticipate more increase requests, or whether the Board
should be done with upgrades after this group for 2008.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COOK COUNTY
HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM

PAGE 7

Dr. Lemon stated that the majority of upgrades are included in the list, there are a couple of departments
that wanted more time because they know that the list needs to contain the most critical individuals. He
has asked that every department at Stroger Hospital put together a list of any further upgrades that are
most critical within the next two weeks.
Chairman Zopp stated that her main concem as she understands from Mr. Small is that there is about four
million dollars, and if the Board approves the list as is, the Board will be spending a little more than three
million dollars. That doesn't leave a lot of money; the Board would not want to have a critical set of
positions that cannot be addressed.
Director Golden asked Dr. Lemon to state the written criteria for the reclassifications and inquired
whether their supporting documentation was included with the summary list.
Mr. Small indicated that he had circulated a list of the names for the Committee's consideration.
Director Golden asked whether positions were eliminated as a result of the reclassifications completed.
Mr. Small stated that in almost the overwhelming majority it was not the usual practice to eliminate
positions in order to fund upgrades. There were one or two instances that he is aware of in the documents
that he has seen. He stated that Dr. Simon's instructions were that there was a separate allocated amount
of money that had been approved in the budget for this purpose and that is largely how this was agreed to
be handled.
Director Carvalho asked if the County still allows for special earnings; he asked for an explanation of
what it is and how it works.
Dr. Lemon stated that within the last couple of years there were strenuous efforts by Dr. Simon to
eliminate or remove most of the special eamings categories. In general, it had to do with other work that
physicians did sometimes at home or outside that was additional to their salary.
Director Carvalho inquired whether there is still compensation on top of the compensation that the
committee is discussing today and if so, in what areas.
Mr. Small stated that he will provide that information to the Committee.
Director Carvalho stated that there are two things that he would like to know how they were taken into
account. First, does the System Board pick up individuals' malpractice insurance and how are the salary
comparisons adjusted for the fact that, especially in some practice areas, malpractice is a costly item.
Secondly, for example, in many areas being on-call is just part of the job, and special earnings on top of
your salary are not paid for being on-call. He inquired how salary comparisons are adjusted for these
factors.
Dr. Lemon stated that the Bureau uses in terms of comparison a report by the Association of America
Medical Colleges (AAMC). Each year they publish by region a breakdown of salaries for physicians in
the various specialties, which are further broken down by level at the academic level.

In response to Director Carvalho's question regarding special earnings, Dr. Lemon understood that many
years ago overtime or special earnings were used liberally in order to bring physipians' salaries up to or
close to standard. The problem was that sometimes it was not recognized in the budget very well and in
the last of couple of years there has been an attempt to get a handle on all of the budget costs.
In response to Director Carvalho's question regarding the $950,000 request, Mr. Small stated that it is
specifically for the Department of Medicine. The request addresses issues similar to the ones that are
shown above in terms of market position, etc. This list is not meant to fully address union versus nonÂ­
union; the full analysis would stilI have to be done. Mr. Small stated that this is largely an attempt simply
to deal with some supervisor/non-supervisors issues; there probably are a few union and non-union issues
included as well, but most of it is driven by market comparison and position in the market place.
Chairman Zopp stated that it is very important for the System Board to understand that the Chief Medical
Officers support the list which they have analyzed. Part of the issue is that the System Board does not
want to interpose their judgment for the Chief Medical Officers' judgment about what they need to run
their hospitaL
Dr. Frigo, Dr. Stabile, and Dr. Clarke briefly explained the reclassifications for their institutions.
Director Carvalho stated that at this committee meeting the Committee was provided with a list but didn't
have the opportunity to look at it. He was disconcerted with the fact that the information only included
the amounts of the salary increase, and did not include the current salary for the individuals.
Chairman Zopp stated that there were items that needed to be discussed in closed session; she thanked
everyone for being at the meeting and also stated that the Committee would be voting on reclassifications
after the closed session adjourned.
Chairman Zopp stated that in closed session she would like for Mr. Rothstein to address the preparations
for the collective bargaining negotiations as well as updating the Committee on the strategy.
Additionally, she requested that Ms. Lechowicz-Felicione address the Committee regarding the ShakmanÂ­
exempt positions.
