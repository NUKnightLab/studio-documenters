GENERAL BACKGROUND

Since 2001 CHA has partnered with professional ?rms to assist CHA in its governance, risk
mitigation, and compliance responsibilities by performing duties as an internal audit service
provider. Firms were requested to propose rates for performance of audit and professional
consulting services approved by the Audit Committee. Key responsibilities of the
provider include updating an annual risk assessment and audit plan, updating and verifying that
CHA is addressing the identi?ed risks, testing and evaluating audit areas, and validating
compliance with applicable regulations, policies and procedures.

Annually, the CHA Audit Committee approves an audit plan of projects based upon the risk
assessment. Director, Audit Management and Compliance, working with the internal
audit service provider, issues engagement scoping memos to stakeholders involved in the audit
projects. The internal audit service provider must understand the overall scope, budget, and
develop an audit approach for speci?c projects. Upon completion of the audit process, reports are
communicated to the Audit Committee.

It is essential that CHA has the capability to review, assess and monitor the effectiveness and
efficiency of operations and practices. The internal audit function serves a critical role as an
objective partner with management to address organizational risks, and process improvements in
operations, while con?rming adherence to existing policy and procedures.

Performing validation and advisory services, CHA internal audit function adds value to the
organization by updating staff and commissioners on the latest signi?cant governance, risk, and
compliance issues.

The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.

provide lntemal Audit Services in an amount not-to-exceed $3,000,000.00 for the period of
November 1, 2012 through October 31, 2015.
