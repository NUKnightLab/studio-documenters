Summary: Requesting authorization to enter into contract with Axon Enterprise to allow the Sheriff's
Office to upgrade and expand its existing body worn camera and TASER weapon inventory to outfit more
sworn members. This upgrade and expansion will provide the public and sworn members with additional
safety and security. This contract includes cloud storage for video footage recorded on body worn
cameras to Axon Evidence (Evidence.com), which provides seamless end user accessibility. Additionally,
this contract with Axon includes the TASER Assurance Plan (TAP) which is comprised of hardware
extended coverage, spare products for Axon cameras, upgrade models, Axon body camera and Axon
docking stations, only available through Axon Enterprise, Inc. Axon exclusively maintains their products

and services. Any work completed/attempted to be completed outside of the original manufacturer
renders the manufacturer's warranty void.
Axon is the only company that sells law enforcement grade weapons which are sold strictly to law
enforcement agencies. The TASER brand weapon is the only weapon that will activate the body worn
camera (v3) manufactured by Axon. Axon is the sole distributor of all TASER brand products. The body
worn camera and TASER weapon both manufactured by Axon are one of a kind because when the
TASER weapon is utilized, the body worn camera is activated. Axon cloud storage is unique to the Axon
weapon and Axon camera because when docked on the respective docking station, the data/video uploads
directly to the cloud without the user having to do anything more than dock the camera/weapon.
Public Defender: Axon Justice Systems provides body worn cameras by contract with the Chicago Police
Department and several other law enforcement agencies in Cook County. Each of those agencies has a
duty, through the pre-trial discovery process, to share the videos recorded by those cameras with the
Public Defender's Office. The only means of sharing those videos which won't require the Public
Defender's Office to buy and maintain permanent storage is to maintain an account with Axon Justice
System. This account would allow us to receive and keep videos that are essential to the representation of
our clients. Axon Justice System is the only provider we could use for this as their body cameras and the
videos they create are designed to work with an account with their agency. No other system would allow
us to watch and store the videos.
This is a Sole Source Procurement pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.

Reason: To pay for the expansion of the body worn camera / taser project, and additionally purchase
tough books, laptops and desktops.
From Account(s): $2,400,000 from 11100.1239.501010 (Salaries and Wages of Regular Employees)
and $627,006 from 11100.1499.540135 (Maintenance of Data Processing Equipment) and $412,904.50
from 11100.1217.540135 (Maintenance of Data Processing Equipment)
To Account(s): $3,027,006- 11100.1217.560155 (Institutional Supplies for Taser/Body Camera
Equipment) and $412,904.50- 11100.1217.560225 (Computer Equipment for tough books, laptops, and
desktops).
Total Amount of Transfer: $3,439,910.50- Requesting to increase the FY19 capital
appropriation/authority by this amount
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
The Sheriff’s Office has been working with the Procurement Department to expand the body worn
camera program. The contract negotiations recently concluded. The balance of the account in August is
$3,464,677.00, the balance of this account was $3,588,059.00 in July.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The Sheriff’s Office limited hiring at the beginning of fiscal year 2019. This created a surplus in the
Department of Correction’s salary account. This was the only account identified.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
The Sheriff’s Office limited hiring during the year to allow a surplus in the Department of Correction’s
salary account. There will be no deferrals, delays or cancellations of Sheriff’s Office projects.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The Sheriff’s Office limited hiring at the beginning of fiscal year 2019. This created a surplus in the
Department of Correction’s salary account.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REQUESTING A HEARING OF THE HEALTH AND HOSPITALS COMMITTEE OF THE
COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS TO DISCUSS THE PRACTICES OF COOK
COUNTY HEALTH (CCH) RELATED TO COUNTYCARE FINANCES AS DISCUSSED IN THE
INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT (IIG 18-0100)
WHEREAS, in 2012, the State of Illinois obtained a federal Section 1115 demonstration waiver to get an
early start on Medicaid expansion as a result of provisions in the Affordable Care Act, which allowed adults
living in Cook County and making less than roughly $15,860 (or 133% below the federal poverty level) to
get Medicaid; and
WHEREAS, the initiative was named “CountyCare” and was designed to help the state and CCH build
capacity and experience to support implementation of the official Medicaid expansion in January 2014, as
more than 618,000 uninsured adults were estimated to be eligible for the ACA’s Medicaid expansion in
Illinois, with over 341,000 of them residing in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, as part of this initiative CountyCare had to handle management of its waiver from the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and needed a third party to evaluate the effectiveness of the waiver
showing that it enrolled enough patients; that those patients were geographically acceptable enough to
encourage providers to participate in the plan; and showing that CountyCare could deliver and generate

Journal of Proceedings

enough medically necessary claims processed through the state Medicaid agency; and
WHEREAS, the program is considered crucial to the financial survival of the health system, and to the
county itself, which subsidizes the system with tax dollars; Before CountyCare, the system historically had
been spending $500 million to $600 million a year for uncompensated care; and
WHEREAS, in 2014, CountyCare transformed its health plan to also accept traditional Medicaid
populations and as a result is now one of the largest Medicaid managed health plans in the State;
CountyCare currently has a healthcare network of approximately 4,500 primary care providers, 15,000
specialists, 50 hospitals, and 335,000 Members; and
WHEREAS, on June 21st, 2019, the Office of the Independent Inspector General (OIIG) released a report
on CountyCare Healthcare Expenses (IIG 18-0100), which was prompted after receiving information during
the course of their review of CCH bad debt expense and claim denials; and
WHEREAS, the OIIG report identified key managerial decisions and financial policies associated with
large volumes of unpaid healthcare expenses related to the CountyCare program including outstanding
liabilities of $701 million for the 2018 fiscal year-end compared to the small amounts the State tends to
owe CountyCare at the end of the year and according to the report can only pay 2% of the outstanding
liabilities; and
WHEREAS, according to the report, CountyCare does not generate enough revenue to pay all the
outstanding healthcare expenses at the end of the fiscal year and has a practice of using subsequent period
budgetary funds to pay prior period bills, such that CountyCare's unpaid healthcare expenses are steadily
growing and could become too large to pay without an extraordinary contribution from another funding
source in the future; and
WHEREAS, the report further states that CCH routinely changes revenue and expense figures between
CCH's operating units (e.g., Stroger, CountyCare, etc.) to reach desired financial goals for CountyCare and
Stroger Hospital in CCH's monthly and annual financial reports, and as a result, these practices make it
difficult for the CCH Board and Cook County Board of Commissioners to have a sound baseline to evaluate
the performance of the individual operating units that make-up CCH; and
WHEREAS, CCH has stated that they are absolutely confident in the integrity of the CountyCare program
and will respond in a comprehensive manner in time; and
WHEREAS, with the FY2020 budget process already started, the time is now to address this report and
provide answers to the Board and the Public;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby
request that a meeting of the Health and Hospitals Committee be convened to discuss the CountyCare
program and financial and reporting practices of Cook County Health as it relates said program; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the OIIG appear before the Committee and be prepared to explain
its review of CountyCare, CCH, and the five report recommendations; and

REFUND RECOVERY AGENT REFUND CHECK REISSUANCE FEE ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, Cook County (“the County”) is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII,
Section 6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such, may exercise any power and perform any
function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the efficient and effective operation of the Cook County Treasurer’s Office (“CCTO”)
pertains to the County’s government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Illinois Property Tax Code, 35 ILCS 200/ 20-175, the CCTO is responsible
for issuing property tax refunds arising from overpayments and erroneous assessments to eligible refund
applicants, including, but not limited to, refund recovery agents, as hereinafter defined, and taxpayers; and
WHEREAS, it has come to the attention of Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas (“Treasurer”) that the
CCTO mailed nearly 1,000 refund checks in January and February of 2018 to a law firm for refunds arising
from successful tax objections filed with respect to condominiums at 180 East Pearson Street, and that that
law firm did not deliver these refund checks to the property management company for the subject
condominiums, Lieberman Condominium and Property Management Services (“Lieberman”), until August
of 2018, and subsequently, Lieberman failed to distribute these refund checks to the taxpayers of these
properties until December of 2018 and January of 2019, almost a year after the issuance date of the checks;
and
WHEREAS, in the wake of this event, the CCTO conducted research and found that, on average, refund
recovery agents, such as the law firm mentioned above, fail to cash or deposit refund checks for a longer
duration than other refund applicants; and
WHEREAS, refund recovery agents who fail to distribute refund checks issued by the CCTO to their
clients in a timely manner or otherwise delay the negotiation of refund checks issued by the CCTO
undermine the efficient administration of the CCTO’s statutory duty to issue refunds to County taxpayers;
and

161

 Board of Commissioners

WHEREAS, refund recovery agents submit a significant number of requests to the CCTO for the
cancellation and reissuance of refund checks previously issued by the CCTO, but never cashed or deposited;
and
WHEREAS, the CCTO’s resources must be employed and expenses incurred to conduct research regarding
whether the applicant for the reissuance of the check is the proper claimant, and to complete the
administrative processes necessary to reissue refund checks; and
WHEREAS, enhancements to the existing core information technology systems would enable the CCTO
to upgrade its electronic systems, which would result in significant operational efficiencies, cost reductions,
and improved services, including, but not limited to:
(1) facilitating the electronic exchange of refund application information between refund applicants
and the CCTO to expedite the issuance of refunds to refund applicants; and
(2) enabling the electronic exchange of a twenty-year history of property tax collection and
payment information to taxpayers; and
(3) enabling the electronic exchange of available refund information, including those arising from

(b) Fee. The County Treasurer shall charge and collect a fee of $30.00 for any request made by a
refund recovery agent, that the County Treasurer reissue any refund check previously issued, because the
original refund check was not cashed or deposited before the refund check’s expiration date, as noted on
the face of the refund check.
(c) Tax Sale Automation Fund. The County Treasurer shall deposit all fees collected under this
section into the Tax Sale Automation Fund, as established in Section 74-40.

165

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

September 5, 2019

WHEREAS, a 2012 Property Tax Code Act amendment (35 ILCS 200/18-178) permits the governing body
of any county or municipality, by ordinance, to require the abatement of any percentage of the property
taxes levied by the county or municipality on each parcel of a qualified property within the boundaries of

active service of a fire, rescue, or emergency medical service; or (3) while on active duty as a member of
the United States Armed Services, including the National Guard, serving in Iraq or Afghanistan; and
WHEREAS, fallen police officers, soldiers, and rescue workers have put their lives on the line and have
sacrificed for their family as a result of fulfilling their duties or aiding others; and
WHEREAS, the families of these brave individuals who have died in the line of duty should be supported
as there are overwhelming financial, emotional and psychological costs associated with the loss of a loved

and
WHEREAS, the Board of Review should make itself available to the City of Chicago and any other
municipality in the County of Cook to vet applications for such abatements permitted under 35 ILCS
200/18-178 and make recommendations for abatement eligibility to the applicable governing body for
abatement authorization.
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 74 Taxation, Article II
Real Property Taxation, Division 1 Generally, Section 74-47 the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as
Follows:
Sec. 74-47. Surviving Spouse Tax Abatement.
(a) Purpose. To permit application to the Cook County Board of Review (“Board of Review”) for
the abatement of Cook County’s portion of property taxes levied on a qualified property for surviving

receipt of said application to the Board of Review for a surviving spouse tax abatement, the Board of
166

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

recommended by the Board of Review by Ordinance and order the abatement of the County’s portion of
the taxes levied on the qualified property.
(b) Definitions.
Fallen police officer, soldier, or rescue worker means an individual who dies: (1) as a result of or
in the course of employment as a police officer; (2) while in the active service of a fire, rescue, or emergency
medical service; or (3) while on active duty as a member of the United States Armed Services, including

was the balance 30 days prior to that date?

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

September 5, 2019

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The detainee population lodged at other counties during fiscal year 2019 has been less than was originally
anticipated. This has allowed a surplus to grow in this account which can be used for this transfer. This
was the only account identified.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
The Sheriff’s Office made adjustments through the year which limit the number of detainees needed to be
lodged at other counties. This created a surplus in this account. There will be no deferrals, delays or
cancellations of Sheriff’s Office projects.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The Sheriff’s Office budgeted enough funding for the historical population of detainees lodged at other
counties, however management changes reduced the population which needed to be housed at outside
locations.

ARTICLE VII, ETHICS, DIVISION 2. - CODE OF ETHICAL CONDUCT, SUBDIVISION II, CODE
OF ETHICAL CONDUCT, SECTION 2-580 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as Follows:
Sec. 2-580. - Post-employment restrictions.
(a) No former official or employee shall assist or represent any person other than the County in any
judicial or administrative proceeding involving the County if the official or employee was counsel of record
or participated personally and substantially in the proceeding during his or her term of office or
employment.
(b) No former official or employee shall assist or represent any person in any business transaction
involving the County, if the official or employee participated personally and substantially in that transaction
during his or her term of office or employment.
(c) No former official or employee may, for a period of one year after the termination of his or her term
of office or employment, knowingly accept employment or receive compensation or fees for services from
an employer if the employee or official, during the year immediately preceding termination of County
employment and on behalf of the County, participated personally and substantially in the decision to award
County contracts with a cumulative value of over $10,000.00 to a person the employer.
(d) No former official or employee may, for a period of one year after the termination of his or her term
of office or employment, knowingly and for compensation lobby any County official or employee on behalf
of any other entity.
(e) No former official or employee may, for a period of one year after the termination of his or her term
of office or employment, contract with the County to provide more than $5,000.00 in compensated
professional services to the County or otherwise receive more than $5,000.00 in compensation for his or
her labor from the County, unless the agency seeking to retain the former official or employee’s services
provides a certification to the Board of Ethics that the former official or employee’s County experience or

Secretary of the Cook County Board of Commissioners.
(f) The requirements of this Section may be waived by the Board of Ethics upon a showing by the
former official or employee that such waiver would not result in a conflict of interest, disclosure of the
County's confidential information or the appearance of impropriety. Additional requirements for waiver
may be further defined by rules adopted by the Board of Ethics, as authorized.
(g) This Section applies only to persons who terminate an affected position on or after the effective date
of this article.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.
