PROPOSED ORDINANCE

ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SPACE STANDARDS ORDINANCE

BE IT by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 2, ADMINISTRATION,
Article XII, Asset Management, Division 1, Sections 2-1000 through 2-1025, is hereby enacted as follows:

Chapter 2, ADMINISTRATION, Article 12, AS SET MANAGEMENT AND SPACE STANDARDS

Sec. 2-1000. Legislative ?ndings and purpose.

Section 5/5 of the Counties Code (55 ILCS 5/5-1106) provides that ?it shall be the duty of the county board
"to provide proper rooms and of?ces for the accommodation of the county board, State's attorney, county clerk,
county treasurer, recorder and sheriff . . . .

In ful?lling that obligation, the County of Cook owns or occupies over 19 million square feet of real estate
assets.

(0) The County expends millions of dollars each year to operate those real estate assets.

In addition to operating costs, hundreds of millions of dollars in deferred maintenance and capital needs will
be required to continue to operate County real estate, which will require constant capital expenditures over many
years.

Ef?cient use of the County?s real estate assets could save the County millions of dollars in operating and
capital costs by facilitating consolidation of space into fewer facilities and reducing space needs for many users.

Ef?cient use of the County?s real estate assets requires a centralized and consistent approach, with
participation by various agencies and departments having knowledge and responsibilities bearing on the use and
maintenance of real estate, and cooperation among using departments and agencies in modernizing space use.

In order to promote ef?cient use of real estate assets, in 2011 the Real Estate Management Division, the
Of?ce of Capital Planning and Policy, the Department of Facilities Management, the Budget and Management
Services Department, and the Bureau of Administration, under the authority of President Toni Preckwinkle,
created the Space Allocation Committee, charged which instituting processes and procedures for departments and
agencies requesting additional space or recon?guration to existing space.

The Space Allocation Committee has implemented a process for allocating real estate assets, and has begun
reallocating unused or underutilized space, with signi?cant cooperation from many departments and elected
of?cials.

Page 3 of 17

 In 2012, the County undertook a Real Estate Asset Strategic Realignment Plan project (the REASRP) which
has assessed both the physical condition and the space utilization of County real estate assets.

The REASRP recommends re-structuring the management of real estate assets by combining the departments
of Capital Planning, Facilities Management and Real Estate into one group, under the leadership of an Asset
Manager.

The REASRP has revealed that administrative and other space is often underutilized, based upon modern
of?ce standards, whereas other agencies and departments operate in cramped and therefore inef?cient space
which hampers the delivery of public services.

(1) The REASRP has developed Of?ce Standards and procedures for applying those standards, which, if fully
implemented, could reduce administrative occupancy by over 300,000 square feet, as well as data on employee
counts and uses of space which will enable the Space Allocation Committee to analyze space needs and promote
fair and ef?cient use.

The data generated by the REASRP requires continuous updating in order to support ef?cient space
allocations, which can only be accomplished through cooperation and open exchange of information regarding
space use between the Space Allocation Committee and Elected Of?cials.

The purpose of this article is to:

(1) Establish an Asset Management Steering Committee in order to achieve the goals of the REASRP and
implement its recommendations, to provide for participation by Elected Of?cials and to foster cooperation in
furthering the goals of the 

(2) Formally adopt the Of?ce Standards; and

(3) Empower the Space Allocation Committee to apply and enforce the Of?ce Standards, to develop and enforce
Furniture and Fixture Standards, to continue the process of space allocation, and to develop additional standards
and procedures to further the goals of the REASRP.

Sec. 2-1001. Establishment of the Asset Management Steering Committee
The County Board hereby establishes an Asset Management Steering Committee (AMSC).
The AMSC will fall under the auspices of the Asset Manager.

The AMSC shall consist of representatives from each of the following Cook County agencies and Elected
Of?cials:

(1) the Of?ce of the President;
(2) the Bureau of Finance, including the Department of Budget and Management Services;

(3) the Asset Manager, representatives of the Department of Facilities Management (DFM), the Of?ce of
Capital Planning and Policy (OCPP), and the Real Estate Management Division 

Page 4 of 17

(4) the Bureau of Administration

(8) The Chair of the Subcommittee on Real Estate and Economic Development;
(9) The Assessor;

(10) The Board of Review;

(11) The Chief Judge;

(12) The Clerk of the Circuit Court;

(13) The County Clerk;

(14) The Recorder of Deeds;

(15) The Sheriff;

(16) The State?s Attorney; and

(17) The Treasurer.

AMSC shall be chaired by the Deputy Bureau Chief for Asset Management, or such other member of AMSC
as may be designated by the President. AMSC shall meet semi-annually, or as otherwise requested by the
President.

The President shall have the authority to appoint additional member departments and remove departments as
necessary to accomplish the goals of the AMSC.

Sec. 2-1002. Authority of Asset Management Steering Committee
AMSC shall have the following responsibilities:

(1) Reviewing the implementation of the Of?ce Standards and other policies developed for ef?cient space use by
the Space Allocation Committee;

(2) Modifying and adopting policies and standards, based on the recommendations of SAC, to further the goals

Page 5 of 17

(3) Administering and ensuring compliance with this Article;

(4) Receiving and reviewing reports by the Space Allocation Committee advising AMSC of progress in the goals
of improving space utilization.

(5) All members of AMSC shall be responsible for ensuring that their respective agencies comply with the
procedures of the SAC and that the policies of the AMSC are administered and adhered to by employees within
their of?ces.

(6) Submitting an annual report to the Board describing progress toward the goals of the REASRP, any
modi?cations of standards or policies adopted throughout the preceding year, failure to participate or cooperate
on the part of any department, agency or Elected Of?cial, and any cost savings achieved through consolidation or
increased ef?ciency in use of real estate.

Sec. 2-1003. Authority of Space Allocation Committee

The County Board hereby establishes the Space Allocation Committee (SAC) as previously authorized by the
President.

SAC shall serve under the auspices of and report to the President.

SAC shall consist of representatives from the County departments designated by the President of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners, and shall include the Asset Management Group and its constituent
departments, the Bureau of Administration, the Department of Budget and Management Services, and the Cook
County Health and Hospitals System. The chairperson of SAC shall be the Real Estate Director, or such other
SAC member as is designated by the Asset Manager.

No Elected Of?cial, Bureau Chief, Department Head or other County employee or of?cial shall have the
authority to assign, allocate, or change the use of space in any County facility or in or on any County-owned or
occupied real estate other than by participating in the process established and administered by the Space
Allocation Committee.

SAC has the authority to make and deny allocations of space, changes to space use, renovations, reductions
of space, and all other changes affecting the use of real estate assets; to develop and implement standards for
space use, apply such standards to space requests and existing uses, investigate existing space uses and
re-allocate space that is determined to be underutilized, prioritize space needs, develop and implement policies
and procedures regarding the use and allocation of real estate assets, approve and deny furniture procurements
not in accordance with the Furniture and Finishes Standards, and take other actions as necessary to optimize the
County?s use and expenditures for its real estate assets. SAC will report to AMSC on progress in the space
allocation process, on issues requiring policy decisions, and on progress in consolidation and ef?cient asset
management.

All Elected Of?cials, Bureau Chiefs, department heads and other County employees or of?cials for whom
the County provides real estate in which to conduct County business, will be required to cooperate with the SAC
space allocation process in making any alterations, improvements, recon?guration or other changes to space or to
use of space, expanding or reducing occupancy of space, relocating staff within or between facilities,
reallocating existing space among departments of the using agency, and procurement of furniture, regardless of
source of funding.

Page 6 of 17

 Due to the cost of operating and maintaining real estate assets, all Elected Of?cials, Bureau Chiefs,
department heads and other County of?cials or employees for whom the County provides real estate will notify
the SAC of any vacated space in order that such space can be re-purposed.

Upon request, Elected Of?cials, Bureau Chiefs, department heads and other County of?cials will provide
SAC with updated information as to the number of staff at any location, and other information regarding space
use as may be necessary to carry out the responsibilities of the SAC.

Sec. 2-1004. Standards

The Of?ce Space Standards recommended in the Real Estate Asset Strategic Realignment Plan, and
incorporated in this Ordinance by this reference, are hereby adopted as a policy of Cook County. SAC shall apply
the Of?ce Space Standards for all administrative and of?ce space, with adaptation to speci?c uses being within
the discretion of SAC.

It is recognized that fully implementing the Of?ce Space Standards requires capital investment, and will
occur over a number of years. Therefore, SAC will endeavor to adhere to the Of?ce Space Standards as much as
practicable in all requests for space and recon?guration, while balancing the costs to achieve the goals with other
factors such as the length of time the space will be occupied, the eventual plan for the facility in which it is
located and similar factors.

The implementation of the Of?ce Space Standards depends in large part on procurement of appropriate sizes
and con?gurations of modular and other of?ce furniture, ?xtures and certain of?ce equipment such as printers
and similar devices that impact space use (Furniture and Fixtures). In addition, in order to provide ?exibility in
re-purposing of space, fairness and a consistent and productive of?ce environment, it is important to apply
standards to the design and allocation of Furniture and Fixtures. Therefore, SAC is further charged with the
development of furniture, ?xtures, equipment and ?nishes standards (Furniture and Finishes Standards), and the
application of such standards. The Chief Procurement Of?cer shall provide to SAC copies of all procurement
requests involving Furniture and Fixtures and using departments shall cooperate with SAC in conforming
purchases to the Furniture and Finishes Standards. Orders for items covered by the Furniture and Finishes
Standards will not be placed without concurrence from the SAC Chair.

The implementation of the Of?ce Space Standards is also impacted by the use and adoption of technology,
such as printing and multifunctional devices, broadband availability, and network connectivity. Therefore, the
Bureau of Technology will collaborate with SAC to promote ef?cient use of technology to minimize space use,
and to adopt standards and procedures for the distribution and use of such technology so as to improve the
ef?ciency of space utilization. As technology is adopted, and as space use and standards evolve, the Bureau of
Technology will cooperate with SAC to review the Of?ce Space Standards from time to time and adopt
modi?cations as appropriate to enhance space utilization and cost effectiveness.

The provision of adequate conference rooms and maximizing use of conference rooms are critical elements in
the ef?cient use of space. Therefore, SAC is further charged with developing procedures for sharing and
scheduling of conference facilities accommodating more than 10 individuals.

Page 7 of 17

Sec. 2-1005. Procedures

SAC shall develop procedures for ef?cient use of space and for submitting, evaluating and deciding upon
requests for space, requests for changes, procurement and installation of furniture, and other actions regarding or
impacting space use, space ef?ciency, and improvements.

Sec. 2-1006 through 1025. Reserved.
