of a ?catalyst development project" (as defined in Act 197), including the development of the Little
Caesars Arena (the in December, 2014, the DDA and the Michigan Strategic Fund issued
tax~exempt bonds of $250,000,00000 (the Bonds?) to finance a portion of the development
costs of the LCA and in August, 2017, the DDA issued tax?exempt bonds of $36,000,00000 (the
"2017 Bonds") for additional development costs to assist with the relocation of the Detroit Pistons
to the LCA.

Under the transaction structure for both the 2014A Bonds and the 2017 Bonds, the bonds are
subject to mandatory remarketing or refinancing prior to January 1, 2019 (the ?Bond Refinancing?).
In anticipation of certain requirements that will have a longer lead time, such as the commissioning
of a new tax increment revenue projection feasibility study and a public solicitation process for bond
underwriter, staff believes it is prudent to begin working towards the Bond Refinancing as soon as
possible. As such, staff recommends the rte?engagement of Hilltop Securities Inc (fka
FirstSouthwest) ("Hilltop") as financial advisor for Bond Refinancing.

Hilltop served as lead financial advisor for the 2014A Bonds and served as financial advisor to the
DDA for the 2017 Bonds. Given Hilltop?s extensive knowledge of the 2014A Bonds and the 2017
Bonds, as wait as the financial capacity, staff recommends the engagement of Hilltop as the
?nancial adviser for the Bond Refinancing upon the following terms:

. Scope will encompass the customary tasks necessary to serve as municipal advisor to
DDA in connection with the Bond Re?nancing, including but not limited to attendance at
DDA meetings, attendance at City Council meetings, assistance in selection of the
feasibility consultant, assistance in selection the underwriteds) for the transaction,
presentations and negotiations with the credit rating agencies, presentations and
negotiations with credit enhancement providers, analysis and recommendation of various
bond structures, presentations and negotiations with Olympia Entertainment, and other
tasks as directed by DDA.

all documented expenses incurred by Hilltop for the Bond Refinancing.
A resolution was included in the Board book for consideration.

Mr. Naglick added that the City uses FirstSouthwest and Mr. Long and Ms. Navin were able to
negotiate so that DDA could take advantage of the City?s fee schedule and he is totally in favor of
what is being proposed.

Subsequent to the discussion, the Board took the following action:

On a motion by Mr. Hosey, seconded by Mr. Blaszkiewicz, Resolution Code DDA 17-12?
