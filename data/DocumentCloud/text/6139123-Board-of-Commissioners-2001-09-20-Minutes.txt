Reason:

Microsoft does not sell its products directly to consumers. ASAP Software is an authorized
large accou nt reseller of Microsoft products and was the successful bidder, winning the State
of Illinois contract for Microsoft products. Because of the substantial volume of Microsoft
products purchased by the State through ASAP Software, the State receives Microsoft's
highest available discount of up to 50% on software and software support services. The Chief
Information Officer will reduce the amount spent on the 200 I County-wide computer contract
by $ 1,292,691.41, transferring that amount to this contract to purchase Microsoft products
from ASAP Software. The net fi scal impact of this request, therefore, is no increase in
spending, but rather a more efficient use of dollars already allocated.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1 ,292,691.4 1. One time purchase. (717/various-579 Accounts). Requisition
No. 1009001 3.

Transmitting a Communication, dated August 31 , 200 I from
JOHN W. DA VIS, Director, Real Estate Management Division
requesting authorization to exercise an option of renewal contained in the second amendment to lease for
space located at I 0 IO West Lake Street, Oak Park, Illinois. The Cook County Board of Commissioners
approved the second amendment on August 9, 2000. Also requested is the authority to change the base
year provided in the Lease that is currently ( 1996) to the year (2000), for the purpose of determining any
additional rent due for common area expenses and real estate taxes. Since the County is obligated to pay
its proportionate share of the excess of taxes and expenses in any given lease year over those for the base
year, the amount of additional rent paid by the County during the renewal period shall therefore be
reduced. The Cook County Department of Public Health currently utilizes this space for its main offices
and storage.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 200 I

PROPOSED ORDINANCE

AN ORDINANCE OF THE COUNTY OF COOK, ILLINOIS
APPROVING EXECUTION OF A
TAX RE IMBURSEMENT PAYMENT AGREEMENT
WITH THE BOEING COMPANY
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Corporate Headquarters Relocation Act, (PA 92-0207), signed into
law on August I, 200 I, as amended from time to time (the "Relocation Act"), the General Assembly of
the State of lllinois (the " State") has determined that the relocation of the international headquarters of
large, multinational corporations from outside of the State to a location within the State creates a
substantial public benefit and will foster economic growth and development; and
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF COOK COUNTY:
SECTION 1. The President of the Board of Commissioners authorized, negotiate, execute and
deliver the Agreement between the County and Boeing in s ubstantially in the form submitted herewith as
Exhibit A and made a part hereof, and such other supporting documents as may be necessary to carry out
and comply with the provisions of the Agreement, with such changes, deletions and insertions as shall be

*Referred to the Committee on Finance August 9, 2001.
Chairman Daley asked Robert Kunze, Deputy Commissioner, Department of Planning and Development,
City of Chicago, to address the committee on the Boeing Company item.
Mr. Kunze stated that the Boeing Company recently moved into its new international headquarters at I 00
North Riverside Plaza in Chicago, where its management team will create and coordinate business
strategies. He said Boeing is the world ' s largest aerospace company that has annual revenues of $51
billion, and the location to Chicago was a major and important achievement for the State of Illinois. He
stated the C ity of C hicago is offering to reimburse Boeing's share of real estate taxes for its headquarters
over a period of 20 years. The C ity of Chicago has authority to do this through the recently adopted State
Corporate Headquarters Relocation Act. He indicated that Chicago passed legislation under which the

3253

 JO URNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 200 I

City will re imburse Boeing for the portion of taxes going to the Chicago Public Schools and the City of
Chicago, that is about 73% of the taxes that Boeing will pay. The City is asking the C hicago Park
District, communi ty colleges, Metropolitan Water Reclamation District and Cook County to rebate their
taxes to Boeing. Mr. Kunze said this is an unprecedented request for the City of Chicago, but the request
would not be made unless there were substantial economic benefits to the region. Estimates of the total
economic benefits to the Chicago area are $4.3 billion with approximately $3 to $4 billion to be within
suburban Cook County. Mr. Kunze continued to explain that some of the taxes will come back to the
county in some form of tax revenues from new workers and residences.
Mr. Kunze indicated that the County's investment wi ll be protected since Boeing must maintain its
corporate headquarters in Chicago in order to receive the reimbursement and must maintain 500 jobs in
C hicago. He noted if the jobs fall below 500 but above 400, there is a pro-rated reduction in taxes. In
addition, he noted if the number of j obs falls below 400 in the city, and Boeing is unable to rectify this
during the first ten years, Boeing would have to pay all its reimbursement. He noted that Boeing will
have a corporate benefits program and has agreed to compl y with the City's MBE/ WBE requirements in
the renovation of their offices, which is over $50 million.
Commissioner Lechowicz thought that the residual effects of Boeing' s move would be greater than $4.3
billion. He asked Thomas Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, what would be the fi scal impact on Cook
County?
C hairman Daley noted, for the record, that representati ves of Boeing had planned to attend the meeting,
but are not present due to flights being cancelled.
Mr. Glaser replied that it is anticipated that the County will be rebating taxes that would approximate
$230,000 in year one, and over the 20 year period, the amount would increase to about $330,000. He said
it is expected that the County would assume the Forest Preserve District share of the property tax rebate,
which would be $25,000 this year to $35,000 in year twenty.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked ifthe County' s growth is great enough to absorb this kind of impact?
Mr. Glaser responded in the affirmative and indicated that the direct and indi rect incremental benefits
would help on the revenue side.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked if Mr. Glaser had any projections of growth in this area?
Mr. Glaser answered the total county benefits are $2.8 billion over a 20 year period.
Commissioner Lechowicz requested a detailed statement on the benefici al impacts to Cook County.
Commiss ioner Collins recognized the project and its financial benefits to the County. She stated that
more definitive data is needed before a vote is taken.
C hairman Daley stated that since thi s item was referred to committee on August 9, 200 I, representatives
from the President's staff have been available to respond to questions from commissioners. He stated it is
necessary to vote on this matter today.
Commissioner Collins inquired what will next year' s fiscal impact be and how w ill the deficit be
rectified?

3254

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 200 1

Mr. Glaser responded that the County would find the ability to appropriate next year' s tax payment
through current revenues.
Commissioner Collins asked ifthe amount rebated inc ludes the amount for the Forest Preserve as well?
Mr. Glaser stated that it would be included.
Commissioner Silvestri indicated the Boeing relocation would benefit the City, County, suburbs and
regional counties. He stated it is an important step that could result in more Boeing employees moving to
this region and providing more jobs. The Commissioner said this could be the first wave of other
corporate relocations to the city.
Commissioner Moran expressed initial opposition to the ordinance, but concluded by stating hi s support
and noting that the County should look fo r economic deve lopment in the southern suburbs.
President Stroger stated that financially, this is a good deal and its impact will be inconsequential.
Commissioner Moreno indicated that this project is economic development at its best. It wi ll cost the
County less than I% while the benefits wi ll be in excess of $2.5 billion over 20 years. Boeing anticipates
spending approximately $50 million for the build-out and construction through the use of minority
business enterprises and women business enterprises. When one looks at the Illinois Corporate
Headquarters Relocation Act and its intentions, this is a win-win situation. Commissioner Moreno asked
if Boeing would actively pursue job recruitment of minorities from different levels at the corporate
headquarters?
David Reifman, Attorney for Boeing, Piper, Marbury, Rudnick and Wolfe, answered the Boeing
Company held a successful job fair in Chicago before the corporate relocation and received 7000
applications from throughout the region. One of the reasons Boeing moved to Chicago was to have
access to a diverse community as it seeks to enhance its global image. He concluded by saying that there
is an agreement to maintain a certain number of jobs, and employees will come from everywhere
throughout Cook County and the State of Illinois.
Commissioner Sutker asked Mr. Kunze to explain the 73% reimbursement?
Mr. Kunze noted that 73% of Boeing' s taxes will be rebated by the City of Chicago. The other 27% will
be rebated by the other taxing districts includ ing Cook County, community colleges, the Chicago Park
District and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation. He said Boeing would not want an incentive package
that would harm schools. For clarification purposes, Mr. Kunze stated the schools will not be directly or
indirectly affected by this proposal.
Commissioner Schumann is glad to see that the County is a part of this incentive package and noted it is a
very small amount of money compared to the projected benefits and regional significance.
Vice-Chairman Carr spoke in favor of the item and commented on Tax Increment Financing (TIF). He
noted that Cicero is the largest TIF district producer in tenns of returns coming back in the State of
Illinois. He said economic development is a slow process that involves risk.
Chairman Daley stated the relocation of Boeing is a great day for the City of Chicago and Cook County.
This was brought forth as a result of the leadership of President Stroger, Mayor Daley and Governor
Ryan. He thanked the Boeing Company for locating to Chicago and said he looks forwa rd to working
with the company.

3255

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 2001

Commissioner Lechowicz asked the State's Attorney's Office to address whether the County has the legal
authority to approve Boeing's req uest.
In response to Commissioner Lechow icz's question, Patrick Driscoll, Deputy State's Attorney, stated that
the proposed ordinance follows the State statute. He said Boeing has met all the conditions by volume of
business a nd the like to meet the State requirements. He concluded by saying that the ordinance, on its
face, appears to be valid. He noted that the State's Attorney's Office is not aware of any potential
challenges to the ordinance should it pass. (A letter from the Office of the State's Attorney regarding the
legal a uthority of the Board to enter into this Agreement is on file in the Office of the County Clerk).

HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE, Chicago, Illinois, to exercise ·an
option for a one-year extension of the contract for the Substance Abuse Treatment program
for persons assigned to the Pre-Release Center.
Reason:

The existing contract, approved by the County Board on September 9, 1999,

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $55 1,304.00. Contract period: October 12, 200 I through October
11 , 2002. (236-298 Account). Requisition No. 12360047.

* Referred to the Committee on Finance September 6, 2001.
Chairman Daley stated that the President' s Office as well as other commissioners have asked to have
these offices meet to determine if there is any duplication of services.
Jim Anderson, Director of Financial Control, Office of the Chief Judge, stated that his office will
cooperate in the study.
Commissioner Silvestri asked how long these programs have been in existence and inq uired as to the
success of the programs in terms of recidivism?
Mr. Anderson stated the juvenile programs started in 1995 and the adult program began in 1998, all of
which have been extraordinary in the ir success. The Juvenile Drug Program has seen about a 60%
success rate where juveniles are off drugs and back in school. The Evening Reporting Center has seen a
95% success rate for over 7,000 juveniles. There has been several hundred participants in the Adult Drug
Program with over 50% success rate. These programs have been extremely cost effective and successfu l.
Finall y, he said the South Suburban Council on Alcoholism and Substance Abuse is one of the contracts
for the adult drug court program at District 6 in Markham and it has also been successful.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if there have been written reports on these programs which would indicate,
among other things, how many people have used the services since 1995 and 1998 respectively?
Mr. Anderson commented that Loyola University completed a study on programs at Di stricts 4 and 6 as
wel l as the Criminal Division Adult Court. He said that he will have the reports distributed to the
members of the Board.
Commissioner Sutker asked if these programs have been working with families as well as the juveniles
them selves?
Mr. Anderson responded in the affirmative.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked Mr. Anderson to provide this information to the Board prior to
presentation of their budget.

3262

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 200 I

Commissioner Butler stated that duplication is not an area of concern, and additional funds should be
al located and more programs should exist to expand these types of services in the county.
Commissioner Moran asked if there is a registration fee?
Mr. Anderson stated that the cost of the contracts before the Finance Committee today are paid by fees
collected from probationers. However he noted these programs used to be grant funded. With respect to
charging fees to juveniles, the biggest problem is most of the kids are poor and there is not enough
evidence to s upport that charging the kids would make a difference.
Commissioner Collins asked if the county receives third party reimbursement for providing drug
treatment?
Mr. Anderson answered in the affirmati ve and noted access to state Medicaid funding is available.
Chainnan Daley reiterated that the Sheriffs Office wi ll look at the programs and work together wi th the
Chief Judge's Office to provide reports to the County Board .
Undersheriff Whittler stated that a report was provided in March 200 I from a contract with HRDI
(Human Resources Development Institute) regardi ng the current program.
Commissioner Steele addressed the issue of coordinating these programs and maximizing their benefits.
She commented that the Bureau of Public Safety and Judic ia l Coordination was responsible for feedback
on the s uccess of the programs. The Commissioner noted that programs under the C hief Judge, Sheriff s
Office, State 's Attorney 's Office and the Judicial Advisory Council should be coordinated under one
office.
C ha irman Daley stated the report prepared by the University of Illinois (U. of I.) as Phase I, was
approved. The Chairman said the Board should consider the possibility of commissioning the University
of Illinois to complete Phase 2 to ascertain whether or not there is duplication of services, identify sources
o f funding, success ratio and recidivism.

Vice Chairman Carr, seconded by Commissioner Lechowicz, moved approval of Communication
Nos. 246131, 246132 as amended, 246133 as amended, 246134 as amended, 246135 and 246136. The

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 2001

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Law Enforcement and Corrections Committee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met
pursuant to notice on Wednesday, May 23, 2001 at the hour of 10:30 A.M . in the Board Room, Room
569, of the County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Jllinois.
Your Committee has discussed and made the following requests for additional information for further
consideration on the subject matter as follows:
Following the Call of the Meeting, Chairman Moreno introduced representatives from various public
safety agencies he had invited to provide testimony and referred to a Chicago Sun-Times news article,
dated April J I, 200 I, which addressed the inmate population at the Cook County Department of
Correction facilities. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk).
Chairman Moreno said the news article raised serious public safety concerns and moved him to call the
meeting due to the lack of information the Board had received to date on the issue. He stated the intended
purpose of the meeting was to brief the County Commissioners on the issue and to set a foundation that
would assist in the gathering and coordination of information between the various state and county public
safety agencies involved in the parole, court and corrections system in order to address the overcrowding
problem and alleviate the public safety concerns. To accomplish this goal, he stressed the importance of
working together to come up with recommendations to expedite the parole hearing and adjudication
process, and agree upon a written plan to address the legal and fiscal problems the county is currently
facing due to the overcrowding situation at the county jail.
Chairman Moreno then gave a brief opening statement on the subject matter. (The referenced document
is on file in the Office of the County Clerk).
In summary, he suggested that as a result of a new State law initiated by the Illinois Department of
Corrections to enable the implementation of an aggressive State parole strategy (called "Operation Windy
City"), an additional 1000 to 1500 prisoners had been added to Cook County's daily jail population in the
past year. He stated that while the county supports such public safety initiatives, the planning behind this
new aggressive parole policy unfortunately failed to take into account its impact on the county's public
safety budget, agencies and facilities. Consequently, he said Cook County has been left to deal with the
fiscal and legal aftermath of the State's actions.
Also, due to the lack of coordination between the state, city and county prior to launching "Operation
Windy City", he said the Committee did not have a proactive plan to refer to in its discussion of the
problem and must instead use a reactive approach in an attempt to gather information and agree on a plan
to address the overcrowding problem.
In closing, Chairman Moreno stressed the importance of working together and the need to receive all
logistical data and pertinent information from the various agencies involved in order to provide a viable
solution to the current problem in the near future. Also to insure the Board is kept informed of the
Committee's discussions and actions, the Chairman requested that the Secretary to the Board include, as
Attachments to the Committee's report, all written testimony and requested information submitted to the
Chairman from the various agencies.
The Chairman then proceeded to the first item on the agenda.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 200 I

1.

Office of the Cook County Sheriff, Department of Corrections

Chairman Moreno called Sheriff Michael F. Sheahan to speak on the overcrowding issue at the Cook
County Department of Corrections.
Sheriff Sheahan provided testimony on what he called "a very serious population management problem"
at the Cook County Jail. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk).
In summary, he stated that the steady rise in the county's jail population over the past ten months was the
direct result of the increasing number of"parole holds" issued against arrestees by the lllinois Department
of Corrections (IDOC) under the new "Operation Windy City" parole enforcement policy.
He explained that arrestees remanded to the county jail with an IDOC "parole hold" are prohibited from
posting bond (regardless of the amount) and are ineligible for any of the Sheriff's alternative programs
(such as electronic monitoring). As a result, he said the county has been forced to hold state parole
violators in the custody of the Cook County Department of Corrections for time frames far longer than the
average inmate and is powerless to lift the " parole holds" until a parole hearing takes place on the parole
violation by the Illinois Parole Review Board (PRB).
In addition, he stated the county is forced to absorb the increased costs of housing such inmates and must
deal with safety concerns that arise daily with managing an overcrowded jail facility. Referencing a
graph and summary sheet on the jail population (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the
County Clerk), the Sheriff pointed out that the number of active "parole holds" in the county's custody
had jumped from 482 last July 2000 to nearly 1,400 as of May 2001. He stated these increases are
directly reflected in the county's total jail population, which had climbed to an all-time record high of
11 ,803 inmates as of May 14, 200 I, even though bookings at the jail have decreased by two percent (2%).
The Sheriff advised that the county pays on average $60 dollars per day to house, feed and provide basic
medical services to each inmate and said he believed the State of Illinois should bear some of the fiscal
responsibility for holding state inmates (parolees) in the county correction facilities since 'parole holds'
represent I 0% of the jails population. He stressed that currently the State places the total financial burden
of these mandated increased costs on the county, which is solely subsidized by the property owners and
taxpayers of Cook County.
Sheriff Sheahan also expressed frustration with the lack of a coordinated or proactive plan that took into
account the county's fi scal and legal responsibilities prior to implementing the new aggressive "Operation
Windy City" parole strategy. With the absence of such a plan, he said the progress the county has made
in managing the jail population over the past ten years to bring the problem of overcrowding under
control has been jeopardized. He explained that before the new parole initiative was implemented, the
county had begun talks with the federal judiciary on lifting the federal consent decree placed on Cook
County in 1974. However, with the recent record level jump in the county's jail population, he said
further discussion on this topic have been put on hold.
Sheriff Sheahan stated that when his office began to see the impact of the state' s new parole initiative, last
fall, he directed his staff to work toward identifying possible solutions. Since that time, he said his staff
has been apart of several meetings held with the various agencies involved, including, the Cook County
State's Attorney's Office, the Judiciary, the Illinois Department of Corrections, the Illinois Prisoner
Review Board and the John Howard Association. In these meetings, the Sheriff stated his office has
discussed and recommended the following three actions to the State: I) the establishment of a special
court to handle only parole violation cases where " parole holds" and any new pending criminal charges
could be presented simultaneously to the court in order to expedite the hearing and adjudication process (a

3315

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 2001

so called "one-stop-shop"); 2) the opening of a temporary housing facility by the State of Illinois for
processing and holding parolees arrested in the Chicago metropolitan area under Operation Windy City;
and 3) a fiscal commitment by the State to fund the local expansion of electronic monitoring programs for
non-violent parolees in order to combat the rising jail population caused by having to hold these
individuals in the jail while the await their parole hearings or due process in court.
In closing, Sheriff Sheahan stated that absent any realistic solution or financial commitment by the State
to assist the county in relieving the current jail overcrowding problem, he was preparing to begin shipping
inmates with parole holds back to the lllinois Department of Corrections. He recognized that this action
may turn out to be only a short-term solution; but with the lack of response by the State to the County's
recommendations to unclog the process and expedite adjudication, he said there seems to be no other
option.
The Sheriff ended his remarks stating that if nothing is done to relieve the overcrowding problem, Cook
County could be mandated by the Federal Court to pay fines of $I 000 per day until the problem is
resolved, as it did back in the early 1980s.
In response to Commissioner Silvestri's question regarding if the statutory responsibility for parole
violators is with the State of Illinois or the county, Sheriff Sheahan stated that straight parole violators are
the responsibility of the State. However, he said both the State and county have statutory responsibilities
with parole violators picked up with new criminal charges. He explained that when the IDOC places
"parole holds" on parolees with new criminal charges, it slows the whole court process down and
increases the jail population since the county is not allowed to bond out or place these inmates into any
alternative program until the hold is lifted by the state.
Sheriff Sheahan suggested that the court should order the State to pay for the costs associated with the
detention of an inmate with a "parole hold" on behalf of the taxpayers in Cook County. He referred to
what he thought was a statutory provision that calls for the State to reimburse a county for costs
associated with housing state inmates who are remanded back to the county jail on a court order.

Commissioner Silvestri requested information from the State's Attorney's Office regarding any
statutory provision that calls for the State of Illinois to reimburse counties for costs associated with
housing state inmates or parole violators in county jails while they await parole hearings or due
process in the court system. He also asked that any reimbursement other Illinois counties might
receive from the State for parolees be included with the information.
Commissioner Maldonado asked if the Sheriffs Office had a fi scal impact statement or statistics
comparing the average length of stay for inmates with felony charges versus inmates with parole holds.
Sheriff Sheahan responded he did not have that information with him, but would ask his staff to look into
the question.

Commissioner Maldonado requested information in writing from the Sheriff on the number of
parole violators represented in the total jail population figures, including data on the average
length of stay for state parole inmates compared to the average stay for county inmates, along with
a fiscal impact statement.
Jn response to Commissioner Quigley's question on when the new parole initiative (referenced as
"Operation Windy City") began, Sheriff Sheahan stated the initiative of the IDOC was part of a new state
law that became effective July I , 2000. However, he said there was a 6-month implementation window
attached to allow for training of IDOC parole officers and Chicago police officers on the new policy.

3316

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 200 I

In response to Commissioner Quigley's question regarding when the county jail population began to rise
above its norm, Sheriff Sheahan stated that the number of inmates significantly began to rise in February
of2001 when the population jumped in one month from 9,263 to 10,498.
In response to Commissioner Quigley's request for more information on the parole hearing process,
Sheriff Sheahan stated the county holds preliminary hearings on charges daily and handles approximately
125 to 150 cases per week. However, he noted the state parole hearings take place only once or twice a
month.
Sheriff Sheahan stated that the current lack of expedited parole hearings and adjudication of parole cases
will only further the overcrowding situation at the jail during the summer months. He said this is why last
fall the county recommended the establishment of a special court or dedicated Chicago Parole Review
Board to meet several times a week to handle parole violation cases, and the opening of a temporary
housing facility in the Chicago area by the State of Illinois for the holding and processing of parole
violators.
In response to Commissioner Quigley' s question regarding upon what authority would the Sheriff be
acting if he did begin sending parole violators back to the Illinois Department of Corrections, Sheriff
Sheahan stated he currently has the statutory authority and transfers approximately 300 state inmates daily
to IDOC facilities.
Commissioner Carr expressed concern regarding the fiscal impact state parole violators have on the
pocketbooks of county taxpayers. He stated that if the Sheriff's figure of a 1,400 increase in parole
inmates is the average monthly increase in 2001 , at a cost of $60/day he estimated the county will spend
approximately $3 million dollars on these individuals this fiscal year. He recommended the County send
the State of Illinois a bill on behalf of the taxpayers of Cook County and take them to court if they refuse
to pay.
Commissioner Carr said that he and other commissioners had recently been given a tour of various
facilities and programs under the Cook County Department of Corrections, and commended the Sheriff
on the work hi s office is doing to improve the overcrowding issue, as well as other problems at the
county's correctional facilities.
In response to Commissioner Butler's inquiry on whether a parolee stopped for a minor traffic violation
would be considered a parole violator for which a parole hold would apply, Sheriff Sheahan stated that if
stopped in Chicago this individual would likely be arrested for a parole violation and held in the county
jail until a state parole hearing could take place. He noted there are instances his office has recently found
of parolees charged with minor violations that have been sitting in the county jail for over a year awaiting
their cases to be heard and adjudicated by the state.
Commissioner Butler expressed concern with the financial burden placed on the county, but recognized
that seeking reimbursement from the state was a separate issue since it still would not alleviate the
overcrowding situation. Therefore, he stated he supports the Sheriff's recommendations to the State to
address alleviating the county jail population of parole violators, improve the coordination of the parole
hearing process and expedite the adjudication of these cases in court.
The Chairman then moved to second item on the agenda.

Office of the Cook County State's Attorney, Civil Actions Bureau

Chairman Moreno called Mr. Patrick Driscoll, Chief of the Civil Action Bureau, to speak on the issue in
the courts on behalf of the Cook County State's Attorney's Office.
Mr. Driscoll provided testimony on the most recent in-chamber meeting with Judge Marovich on the
Duran consent decree, as well as background from a legal perspective on the County's history in the
courts regarding the overcrowding issue at the Cook County Department of Corrections. He also
informed the committee of recent meetings with Judge Paul Biebel and various county and state agencies
on the parole hearing process and court adjudication of parole violators' cases. He noted the purpose of
these meetings has been to discuss problems and recommend active solutions to improve the parole and
court systems. He also agreed with the Sheriffs concern relating to the recent increase in the parole
inmate population at the county jail and the need to alleviate this situation in the near future in order to
continue the progress the county has made in terms of compliance with the consent decree.
In summary, Mr. Driscoll stated that the Sheriff of Cook County operates the county jail under a federal
consent decree that has been in effect for over 25 years, referenced now as Duran v. Sheahan, with Judge
George Marovich presiding over the case. He explained the county must periodically file written status
reports with the Judge for the purpose of keeping the court and plaintiffs informed of the County's
progress at the Cook County Department of Corrections facilities.
In regards to the recent overcrowding situation at the Cook County jail and the affect on the case, Mr.
Driscoll informed the committee that the Sheriff has been very proactive on the issue. He said the Sheriff
brought his concerns to the State's Attorney's attention last year, which allowed the county to bring the
matter to the Court's attention in the fall of 2000 as part of the County's periodically filed written status
report to the court on the Cook County Department of Correction's facilities. At that time, he noted the
population at the jail was low, but the possible impact the State's new parole initiative might have on the
county ' s jail population was addressed in the report.
Mr. Driscoll stated that when the jail population jumped in the first halfof2001 , the county again brought
the issue to the Court's attention prior to the plaintiff's attorney filing a complaint and Judge Marovich
called an in-chambers, hearing on the issue on May 8, 2001. He said the meeting resulted in a very
candid discussion with the judge and with representatives of the John Howard Association, counsel for
the Sheriff and counsel for the plaintiffs.
In closing, Mr. Driscoll stated that to date the plaintiffs attorneys have not made any contempt request
before the court, but are obviously concerned with the situation. He said the county continues to work on
a resolution with all the respective parties involved, and the Board should have received the most recent
report from the John Howard Association. He noted that the county will be responding to the court on the
report (a standard procedure under the court order) and the next hearing on the county's status report has
been set by the court to take place in August 2001.
Mr. Driscoll assured the committee that the State's Attorney's Office is making all attempts to comply
with the decree and will keep the Board informed of any new information that may arise on the issue in
court. He also said the State' s Attorney's Office will look into the committee's request for information on
any statutory provisions that could enforce state reimbursement of county expenses for housing state
parole violators in county correctional facilities.

3318

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 200 I

In response to Chairman Moreno's question on whether the Office of the Chief Judge and the State's
Attorney's Office have had discussions relative to speeding up the disposition of cases in order to shorten
the time parole inmates stay in the county jail, Mr. Driscoll stated that solutions to speed up the court
process are difficult in tenns of time each case takes, since each case is different and each must receive
due process under the law, including the right to counsel and the right to a jury trial on any pending new
criminal case.
Chairman Moreno asked that a representative from the Chief Judges Office give the committee insight
from the judiciary's perspective on the court process and any recommendation the court might have to
shorten parolee inmates' length of stay in the county jail.
Judge Paul Biebel gave testimony on the problems the court has had in the past with the number of judges
available and the lack of adequate courtroom space. He informed the committee that many courtrooms
have been doubled up and special calls have been instituted for all traffic cases.
Judge Biebel stated that he agreed with Mr. Driscoll on the need to treat each case based on its
individuality to ensure due process. He noted that two meetings have already taken place in his chambers
with a collective group of 20 persons from the various criminal and public safety agencies for the purpose
of discussing active solutions, with another meeting scheduled for June I 9, 200 I. Judge Biebel stated
these meetings would continue to be held in order to assist the cooperative discussion of possible
solutions for appropriate cases amongst the various offices and agencies.
Judge Biebel also informed the committee that he had just received infonnation from Bill Quinlan, the
Chairman of the Cook County Judicial Advisory Council , that he was meeting with representatives of the
Governor's Office and the Cook County Sheriffs Office to discuss the state's assistance in tenns of
funding for the expansion of the Sheriffs electronic monitoring program. Judge Biebel stated this type of
cooperation on alternative programs for non-violent offenders is good to see and may be a solution in a
limited number of appropriate parole violation cases.
In response to Commissioner Quigley's question on whether a centralized system or unifonned procedure
has been discussed or implemented in the administration of cases in Bond Court, Judge Biebel stated
there has been some innovative solutions implemented under Chief Judge Donald P. O'Connell and Judge
Robert P. Bastone relating to the administration of cases in Bond Court. He said all bond cases now fall
under 5 judges, which has resulted in a centralized and more unifonned fashion of issuing bonds.
Commissioner Maldonado asked for Judge Biebel' s opinion of Sheriff Sheahan's recommendation to
establish a specialized courtroom or "one-stop-shop" system for parole violators. Judge Biebel responded
that it would be difficult, administratively as well as constitutionally, to present and adjudicate parole
cases in this manner since the charges in these cases range from misdemeanor offenses to Class X felony
offenses and parolees have the same basic rights as any other offender has in a court of law.
In response to Commissioner Butler's question on whether a specialized courtroom for parole violators
would be implemented by the Court if the space was available, Judge Biebel stated that these cases are
best handled through the Parole Board and presented to the court with the input of the State's Attorney
Office and Public Defender's Office.
The Chairman then proceeded to third item on the agenda.

Office of the lllinois Department of Corrections (IDOC)

Chairman Moreno called Mr. George DeTella, Associate Director of the Illinois Department of
Corrections, to speak on the agency's role in the new parole system reforms.
Mr. DeTella provided testimony on Illinois's parole system and its current policy revisions relating to
state inmates who violate their parole agreement. He assured the Committee that the Illinois Department
of Corrections has and would continue to stand ready to work with the judiciary, state's attorneys, and
county officials on their concerns involving the parole system and the impact it might have on county
jails.
In summary, Mr. DeTella gave a brief description of Illinois's parole system, before July 2000, and the
history on what brought about implementing IDOC's new initiative implementing policy revisions
relating to parolees. Going back to January 1999, he stated there were six months of public hearings
through the Illinois Pri son Management Reform Committee on Illinois's parole system. As a result of
these hearings, he said it was determined that the State of Illinois did not have an adequate parole system.
He noted at that time there were 32,000 state inmates on parole and 160 state parole agents employed to
monitor these parolees. However, he explained that only 80 of the 160 parole agents actually worked the
street to monitor parolees, which resulted in less than 5 percent of the 32,000 parolees on the street being
monitored, contacted and tracked for new charges in the criminal court system.
Mr. DeTella stated in July of 2000 the IDOC began implementing new policy revisions to the state parole
system, with an initial training regiment for parole agents and police officers. He noted that during the
six-month training period, the IDOC also attempted to get the word out on the new parole initiative
through the various state law enforcement organizations (i.e. the Sheriff's Association, Illinois
Correctional Association and Illinois Police Association). Mr. DeTella admitted that the IDOC did not
articulate to the best of their ability the particulars of the policy revisions when the new initiative was
being discussed, but said at that time no one could have predicted the impact it would have on the state
parole and county courts system.
However, on the issue of overcrowding at the Cook County Department of Corrections facilities, Mr.
DeTella stated that the !DOC does not believe the number of parolees in Cook County's jails is much
greater today than there were in the past. He said the only significant difference seen under the revised
parole system is that a larger percentage of parolees are being contacted and monitored by parole agents
and police.
In response to the county's claims that the new parole policy has caused the recent population increase at
the county jail, Mr. DeTella said the !DOC administrative staff has met with the State's Attorney' s and
Sheriff' s staff to discuss their concerns and has offered any assistance within the agency ' s scope of
responsibility to hasten the transfer of parole violators to IDOC's facilities.
In reference to Sheriff Sheahan's comment that the county has seen an increase of approximately 1,500
parole inmates in its jails since January 2001 under the new " Operation Windy City" initiative, Mr.
DeTella disagreed that the number given by the Sheriff is a factor caused by the new revisions to the
state' s parole system. He said instead it represent a strong misconception of "Operation Windy City" --a
parole initiative started in Chicago with the cooperation of the Chicago Police Department, which !DOC
would like to expand throughout the State of Illinois. On that point, he stated the 1,500 parolees in the
county ' s jails as of May I, 200 I represent the number still awaiting the disposition of new felony charges
and who' s cases remain in the county' s criminal courts system. To backup this statement, he cited !DOC
statistics and stated from January 200 I to May 200 I : 63% of parolees arrested in Cook County were
charged with new felony crimes and 37% were arrested on technical violations under the terms of their

3320

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 200 I

parole agreement or minor crimes involving property and drugs. During the same time frame, he noted
approximately 8,800 parole violators were returned to the !DOC under "Operation Windy City" and only
2 were brought and remain in the county's jail.
Mr. DeTella admitted that when "Operation Windy City" was first rolled out, parolees found to have
technical parole violations or arrested on misdemeanors charges were brought to the Cook County jail to
await their parole hearings and court cases. However since that time, he said the !DOC recognized an
impact on the county jail population and responded by instituting a change in operation procedures by
telling parole agents to first bring parolees apprehended for technical violations back to the !DOC to await
parole hearings.
On the issue of the county jail's recent population rise with concern of overcrowding at the Cook County
Department of Corrections and the Sheriffs recommendation for a so called ' one-stop-shop' court
parolee cases, Mr. DeTella agreed with the comments previously made by the State' s Attorney ' s Office
and Judge Biebel. He reiterated the need to take the totality of cases into factor due to the fact that the
parolees in the county' s facilities are awaiting adjudication of new felony charges and not technical parole
violations and there is a need to insure individuals due process rights. He explained that of the 1500
inmates arrested while on parole, 63% were charged with committing either Class X, aggravated battery
or felony weapon offenses and therefore were not released on bond by the court or found suitable for
alternative programs (such as electronic monitoring) based on the State's Attorney 's felony review teams
recommendations or the Sheriffs program criteria.
Mr. DeTella explained that the Illinois Department of Corrections is the supervising authority and in
charge of prisoners in the state prison system, as well as those released on "mandatory supervised release"
(MSR). Otherwise, state inmates are re leased on parole, which is granted through the Illinois Prisoner
Review Board, who is the releasing and revocation authority.
In September of 2000 is when the !DOC kicked off the operational phase of "Operation Windy City" and
to date 99% of individuals released on MSR or parole are returned to the !DOC due to technical parole
violations.
In response to Commissioner Quigley's question regarding if !DOC has agreed to work with the Sheriffs
Office to review certain criteria and set some standards to allow a segment of the parole hold inmate to be
placed on alternative programs, Mr. DeTella stated his office was in the process of dialoging with the
Sheriff on this issue including the possibility of expanding the eligibility criteria for electronic monitoring
program to include non-violent inmates. Mr. DeTella said the intended purpose of these discussions is to
assist the CCDOC and alleviate the overcrowding situation with the alternate supervision programs of
such parole inmates while on bond by possibly using state parole officers.
ln response to Commissioner Quigley's question regarding what financial assistance does the IDOC
supply to counties to assist them with the costs of housing state inmates or parole violators in county
facilities, Mr. DeTella stated he was not aware of the dollar amount but would provide this information in
writing to the Chairman and the President's Office.
In response to Commissioner Butler's question regarding the warrant process and how probable cause is
detem1ined, Nancy Miller stated that the arresting officer handles warrants and determines probable cause
with the State's Attorney's Office. However, from a state parole agents standpoint, probable cause is
necessary to determine whether the revocation of parole due to a technical violation.

3321

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 2001

In response to Commissioner Maldonado' s request for information on what the IDOC is currently doing
to assist the county on alleviating the impact of new parole system has had on the CCDOC in terms of the
increase in the parole inmate population, Mr. DeTella stated that the IDOC is currently apart of meetings
with various county officials/ agencies and is assisting in the discussion for the purpose of finding an
agreed upon solution to the situation in the near future.

Chairman Moreno requested written testimony or documentation be submitted to the Chairman's
Office from the Illinois Department of Corrections to substantiate their statements, including the
claim that the number of parole violators held in Cook County Department of Corrections in the
past year has not increased since July 2000.
The Chairman also asked that the Illinois Department of Corrections keep in mind and
communicate with the County on any future legislative initiatives they may be considering in the
future that relates to this issue so that we can work collectively to assist with the legal and fiscal
problems the county is currently facing as a result of Illinois's improved parole system.
The Chairman then proceeded to fourth Item on the agenda.

4.

Illinois Prisoner Review Board

Chairman Moreno called Mr. Jorge Montes, Member of the Illinois Prisoner Review Board, to give
testimony on the Board role in the new parole system.
Mr. Montes gave a brief statement on behalf of Anne Taylor, Chairman of the Illinois Prisoner Review
Board and the other Members of the Board regarding the Board's work and provided some suggestions to
improve the system and alleviate the jail overcrowding situation .
In summary, he stated under the new policy revisions the parole system is working better, but due to its
success implementation has resulted in a greater number of parole violators being placed back in the
county's court system. He said pointing fault for the overcrowding at the jail is difficult to do, since each
entity involved in the process is simply trying to do their job as the law dictates and in a criminal justice
system that already has a number of significant underlying problems that also add to the overcrowding
situation. He noted most of these problems involve due process, speedy trials, unfunded mandates and
liabi lity issues that all agencies involved must confront.
Beyond these issues, Mr. Montes stated the 14 members of the Illinois Prisoner Review Board have been
working with the other agencies and Judge Biebel to contribute some suggestions and solutions to assist
moving non-violent parole violators out of the county jails by expediting the parole hearing process. He
said one recent change the Board has begun is meeting twice a month in Cook County ( instead of once a
month) to conduct parole revocation hearings, which has resulted in approximately 120 cases being heard
every two weeks. He noted that most of the cases in Cook County do not involve what is referred to as
"technical violators". He also pointed out that increasing the number of hearings in Cook County has
caused logistical problems for the Board since they must cover the entire State, but due to the
overcrowding problem in Cook County, the Board felt it was necessary. He stated the Board would
continue to work on this problem and try increasing the number of parole hearings in Cook County in the
near future.
Mr. Montes a lso reviewed other recent changes the Parole Review Board has made involving shaving
cases at the preliminary stages by: 1) telling inmates they can waive their hearing if they are near their
release date or past discharge, which allows the Board to fill out the order in abstentia hearings; and 2)
training IDOC staff to assist the process by conducting preliminary hearings at the County jail.

3322

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 200 I

In closing, Mr. Montes made the following three suggestions which he stated might further assist in
alleviating the jail population of parole inmates: I) explore other means of identifying cases of parolees
that are near or past discharge in order to bypass bringing them into the system and further clogging the
backlog; 2) better identifying those cases involving parolees with drug charges who might qualify as
candidates for T.A.S.C. programs; and 3) getting stricter on permitting continuances of cases at the parole
revocation hearing stage, which occurs in about 20% of the cases before the Board each month since most
inmates would rather stay in Cook County near family and friends than be sent back to a State corrections
facility. He also suggested that, if it were possible, increasing the number of Chicago area members of
the Prisoner Review Board would be helpful in solving the logistical problem the current 14 member
Board is facing and could result in more parole hearings taking place each month in Cook County.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question on what he thought of Sheriff Sheahan's so called
"one-stop-shop" courtroom for parolees, Mr. Montes stated he thought the concept was worth exploring
since the "courtroom crush" is a negative factor in trying to process cases in the limited time the Board
has in Cook County. He explained that the Board now must wait for an open courtroom before it can
begin its hearings and with only 2 meetings a month in Chicago time and space are important factors in
processing the caseloads. Again, he noted that the number of Chicago area members would have to be
increased if weekly hearing were to take place as the Sheriff suggested.
In response to Commissioner Butler's question on what is the definition for a technical violation, Mr.
Montes stated there are numerous violation and the parole agent or arresting officer indicates these on the
parole form or case report submitted to the Board at the time of the hearing. He gave examples of a few
violations such as drug use, not checking in with the parole agent, and misdemeanor theft. He noted that
the Board has discretion in its review of these technical violations and again stated that very few of the
cases before the Board in Cook County involve technical violations.
Commissioner Butler stated his concern that even though the Prisoner Review Board might not see many
of these, he feel s that the number of technical parole violators in Cook County jails are a problem
especially when the population is reaching capacity.
The Chairman preceded to the last item on the agenda.

Judicial Advisory Council

Chairman Moreno called Mr. James O' Rourke, Executive Director of the Judicial Advisory Council, to
provide a summary of the information he had submitted to the Chair on the overcrowding population at
the county jail (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk).
Mr. O'Rourke provided some historical statistical information on the county's population and briefly
reviewed what the President's Office was currently working on in respect to legislative initiatives in
Springfield. He noted the initiatives were still pending and he would be happy to provide an update on
this information at the next meeting of this Committee.
In response to Commissioner Quigley's question relating to I Bonds and why the number of these bonds
have dramatically reduced, Mr. O'Rourke stated that over the years certain resources and alternative
sentencing programs have been utilized to address those inmates who in the past used the I Bonds.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question on if the Judicial Advisory Council agrees with
IDOC's opinion that the rate of parolees in the county jail population has not significantly increased
compared to past years, Mr. O'Rourke stated there simply are more parole agents, more warrants and
more parolees back in the court system and the county jail as a result of Illinois improving its parole
system .

3323

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 2001

In response to Commissioner Butler's request for any suggestions from the Judicial Advisory Council on
how to decrease the population or overcrowding at the Cook County Department of Corrections, Mr.
O'Rourke stated that penalty enhancement laws have significantly increased inmates time in the county
jail and the county has tried to tie this fact to fiscal impact statements in hope of at least having the State
assist county taxpayers in paying for the cost associated with the increased stay. Beyond this, increasing
the electronic monitoring program and seeking the State's fiscal assistance in purchasing this equipment
especially for parolees would be helpful.

Following the testimony and with no further discussion, Chairman Moreno thanked all the agencies
for providing information to the Committee and asked that the responses on information requested
and any recommendation the agencies could provide to alleviate the problem be submitted in
writing to the Chairman and the President's Office for further consideration. He stated the
information received by the Chairman's Office would be placed in the record, as part of the
Chairman's report, for future discussion at the next meeting called by the Chairman.
Commissioner Maldonado moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Butler. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

suddenly crash in Philadelphia; and

all share; and
