EXPLANATION
On January 6, 2000, the Chicago Housing Authority (“CHA”) Board of Commissioners
approved the Plan for Transformation, which upon approval by HUD was incorporated into a
Moving to Work (“MTW”) Agreement. Per the MTW, the CHA is required to submit an annual
plan to HUD outlining the steps it will take during the applicable fiscal year to achieve the goals
and commitments of the Plan for Transformation. The Board previously approved and HUD
agreed to the demolition of six dwelling buildings, which was completed in 2009. The FY2010
Annual Plan was approved by the Board of Commissioners on October 20, 2009 and included
the intention to demolish the remaining properties as part of the process of the revitalization of
Harold L. Ickes Homes. Per HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 970.7, permission to demolish all
or a portion of a development must be requested via submission of HUD form 52860, and must
include a copy of a resolution by the Authority’s Board of Commissioners approving the
application.
Based on the foregoing, the CHA requests that the Board of Commissioners approve the attached
resolution authorizing the submission of a demolition application to HUD for the six (6)
properties referenced above, and to demolish said properties immediately upon receipt of
approval from HUD.
