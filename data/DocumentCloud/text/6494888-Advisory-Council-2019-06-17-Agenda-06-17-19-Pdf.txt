Please remember that this is a well-attend meeting with many, many people participating all over the State. To make
sure that everyone has the best chance of hearing the conversation, PLEASE MUTE YOUR PHONE. Do Not place the
call on hold. Hold music and other hold tones are very disruptive to the entire group.
Please remember to identify yourself, whether you are in person in Chicago, on the phone or in Springfield. This
makes it easier for the note taker and for those who don’t recognize your voice.
