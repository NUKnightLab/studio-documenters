 DRAFT
PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
July 1, 2010
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on June 3, at 1:15 p.m. The meeting was held at 33
N. LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

Ben Weese
John Baird
Phyllis Ellin
Edward Torrez
Ernest Wong

Staff:

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Historic Preservation Division, Department
of Zoning and Land Use Planning
Eleanor Gorski, Assistant Commissioner
Dijana Cuvalo
Cynthia Roubik
Beth Johnson
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

1401 N. Astor Street
(Astor Street District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed modifications to existing rear garage addition including
alterations to the masonry window opening, new canopy, railing atop the
garage, and cladding changes and other alterations.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1.

2.
3.

4.

The plans shall be revised to eliminate the proposed stone cladding
at the base of the west façade of the garage to be more compatible
with the character of the historic building;
The new metal canopy shall be of a simple design; dimensioned
drawings and details shall be included with the permit pla ns;
Should any new brick be required to complete the proposed work,
the new brick shall match existing brick of the garage in size,
color, and texture. Historic Preservation staff shall review a brick
sample prior to order and installation; and,
Information on the proposed new lighting fixture shall be included
with the permit application.

 2.

2325 N. Clark
(Reebie Storage Warehouse – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed interior tenant build-out for daycare center (designated interior
features).

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1.
2.

3.

4.

3.

Attachment details of the new partitions and curtain rods shall be
submitted as part of the permit documents;
Details and additional information of the proposed modifications to
the north interior wall in order to meet building and fire code
requirements shall be provided;
The multi-colored Egyptian-themed plaster ornamentation which
appears to be the original colors shall not be repainted and shall be
protected. The “field” portion of the walls, ceiling, etc., currently
painted a cream color, may be repainted subject to Historic
Preservation staff review and approval. Paint color samples shall
be provided as part of the permit application; and,
The location of the proposed tenant sign is approved. Additional
information on the size and type of the proposed letters shall be
submitted for Historic Preservation staff review and approval prior
to order and installation. A separate permit shall be obtained for
the installation of the sign.

2045 W. Evergreen
(Wicker Park District – 1st Ward)
Proposal:

Violation / Work done without permit: Proposed infill of original building
entrance opening with double-hung window and common-brick.

Action:

The Committee voted unanimously to preliminarily find that the infill of
the original building entrance on the front façade without a permit did not
meet the Commission’s criteria, standards, and guidelines, and had an
adverse effect on the significant historical and architectural features of the
landmark district; and advised the applicant that the violation should be
remedied as follows:
1.

The two casement windows and wood-paneled knee walls
(resembling double-doors) shall be installed pursuant to permit
#100341167 or a comparable scheme to be reviewed and approved
by Historic Preservation staff. Any replacement window(s) or
door(s) should extend the full width of the opening from side-toside and from the sill to the underside of the historic lintel. The
design should be similar to a pair of double-doors, or a single-door
with a side- lite, consistent with the historic building entrances of
similar building types.

 Furthermore, the Committee voted unanimously to advise the applicant
that failure to remedy violations under the Chicago Building Code and
Landmarks Ordinance may incur fines assessed on a daily basis for the
period that the violations have existed.
4.

100-114 W. Germania Place
(Germania Club Building – Proposed Landmark – 42nd Ward)
Proposal:

Continued Review: Proposed conceptual review and approval of the
following changes to identified exterior and interior significant historic
and architecture features and spaces of the building, depending upon
future tenant needs and uses:
1.
Insert new mezzanine floors within both the ballroom and the
dining room spaces. Construct a new ramp in the ballroom and
new stairs in the dining room.
Since the January 2010
presentation, the size of the mezzanine in the ballroom has been
reduced and the ‘bridge’ at the east end of the mezzanine has been
eliminated.
2.
Raise the roof to the top of the existing parapet to accommodate
new habitable space within the attic level; and new window
openings in the north and west elevations at the attic level.
3.
Create an accessible lobby at the first-floor east of the main
entrance stair, including a new elevator that would access all floors
of the building.
4.
Infill the existing north lightwell to create space for a new freight
elevator and mechanical equipment.
5.
Create an accessible lobby at the north of the Clark Street
elevation, to access a new elevator.
6.
Remove portions of walls in the three connecting rooms and the
enclosed porch on the mezzanine level (between the first and
second floors) and in the solarium on the second floor.

Action:

The Committee voted unanimously that the proposed work meets, on a
conceptual basis, the Commission’s permit review standards and criteria
subject to further design development and review, and depending on the
ultimate design, dimensions, materials, details, and other information such
as programmatic and code issues that impact the proposed changes. The
Committee unanimously approved the project in concept, subject to the
final determination of the Commission and City Council as part of the
designation ordinance regarding the incorporation of additional guidelines
pertaining to the interior and the following conditions:
1.

Approval in Concept (no further Permit Review Committee
review anticipated)
Approval of the following work, as proposed in the Record Set or

 described herein, (i) conditioned upon the submittal of final design,
dimensions, details, materials, and additional information to be
reviewed and approved at the staff level, and (ii) provided that the
specific work is consistent with what was presented and approved
by the Permit Review Committee:
(a) Exterior (submitted information was only schematic, without
dimensions, details, etc.):
• Lightwell enclosure on north elevation for new
stairs/elevator
• Non-habitable rooftop penthouse for stair access and
elevator override, provided that the size and height of
the penthouse is minimized to the extent possible (e.g.,
elevator override and mechanical room per elevator
specifications)
• Storefront entrances for new Clark Street and/or
Germania Place lobbies
• Removal of basement (Ace Hardware) entrance
• New punched window openings on north and west
elevations
• Attic-story window openings for new residential Units
(b) Interior (submitted information was only schematic, without

Staff is authorized to approve minor changes to what was approved
by the Committee, pursuant to the Committee’s Rules and
Regulations, for the foregoing items.
2.

Approval in concept, to return to Permit Review Committee for
final design review and approval. The following work is approved
in concept (i.e., schematic approval), conditioned upon the project
returning to the Permit Review Committee for review and approval

 of the final design, dimensions, details, materials and related
information:
a) Inserted mezzanine floors within the Ballroom and Dining
Room (including the bridges connecting these floors to the gallery
level and the new stairs in the Dining Room) as depicted in the
Record set, and provided that:
(i) Ballroom:
The location, size and shape of the new inserted
floor (including bridge connections) as depicted in
the Record Set ( ‘4th Level-Proposed’) and a
substantial separation as proposed is maintained
along the north and south walls of the room; and
• Unless two separate bridge connections are
otherwise required by the Chicago Building Code or
the American Disabilities Act, only one bridge
between the inserted floor and the gallery along the
north wall is provided, and the bridge connection is
located as far as possible from the projecting,
bowed bay of the gallery; and no additional bridge
connecting to the east end of the room is proposed.
(ii) Dining Room:
• As proposed, no visible additional structural
support, reinforcement or other modifications to the
walls are necessary to support the new inserted
floors, spanning wall to wall with no added vertical
supports or brackets; and
• The two new openings on the south wall to connect
the inserted floors with the existing corner atticlevel space (the “Capone Room”) will be of equal
size and symmetrical around the mid-point of the
wall, as depicted on : ‘4th Level-Proposed’ and
‘Building Section 2’ in the Record Set.
(iii) Both Rooms:
• As proposed, the design (including the structure,
structural attachments and railings) of the new
inserted floors is as reversible as possible,
minimizing any damage to the historic features and
finishes; and is as structurally minimal, visually
unobtrusive and transparent, as possible, as depicted
in the Snapshots labeled as ‘Small Ballroom 1 &
2’and ‘Large Ballroom 1 & 2’
• A structural analysis and code analysis both confirm

 •
•

that the work can be done, as proposed, without
adversely impacting the building (including during
construction);
The property owner has made “commercially
reasonable efforts” to market the space both with
and without the proposed inserted floors; and
“Commercially reasonable efforts” have been made
to maintain the unobstructed visual openness and
character of the room as part of a new use for these
rooms, such as relative to any built- in fixtures or
other such changes.

(b) New elevator within the protected interior spaces on
existing mezzanine level (between first and second floors)
and in the second-floor solarium as it pertains solely to
location, dimensions and configuration, and provided that:
•

•

•

As proposed, the elevator override and mechanical
room will not extend higher than the existing
parapet or otherwise affect the exterior appearance
of the building;

approved at the staff level and staff is authorized to approve
most requests as to the following, as long as they are
consistent with the Commission’s adopted criteria,
standards and guidelines:
• Exterior mechanical equipment and vents/grilles.
Any rooftop mechanical equipment should be
located to minimize visibility from the public way
as much as possible, especially relative to the two
street elevations;
• Any window replacement and/or retrofit;
• Any storefront changes beyond proposed new lobby
entrances;
• Work to the protected interior spaces, such as new
HVAC systems, etc.; and

etc., within the protected interior spaces.

4.

No information was submitted regarding proposed signage.
While signs are typically reviewed and approved at the
staff level, signage, depending upon what is proposed, and
particularly regarding any upper-floor tenants, may need to
be reviewed by the Permit Review Committee.
