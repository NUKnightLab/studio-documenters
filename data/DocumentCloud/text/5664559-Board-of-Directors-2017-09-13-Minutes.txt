PROJECTS
Hudson?s Qtock Presentation (For Information Only)

Mr. Lewand informed the Board members that the agenda had been revised and there would be
an informational presentation by Bedrock on the Hudson?s Block development.

Ms. Navin reported that as the Board will recall, earlier this year the Bedrock folks came in and
gave a presentation on the Hudson?s Block development. Under the development agreement the
DDA has with Roscoe Development Company, they have a right to update the development plan
from time to time as long as it meets certain minimum requirements, so they have an updated
development plan and they wanted to take this opportunity to update the Board on the Plan.

Mr. Jozef Guziewicz, and Mr. James Witherspoon presented the updated development plan for the
Board?s information and responded to questions.

Mr. Crain requested that they come back at some point in the future with their plans to utilize Detroit
businesses, Detroit residents, what the outreach may be, how to get some smaller businesses
included and involved.

Mr. Guziewicz responded that Dan Gilbert is very committed to including Detroiters. The ?rst
outreach event will be in the next three weeks or so and there will be huge efforts put forward on
engaging the public, whether it be the actual workers on site or the businesses. It is atop priority.

Mr. Lewand requested a presentation on this and also the Randolph Center in the future because
we are trying to get more people into the trades.

Mr. Brown advised that the 4.1c Committee members met and reviewed in detail the Change Order
Requests in a meeting on September 7, 2017 and requested that the Committee Chair, Mr.
Hollowell report on the Committee's findings.

Mr. Hollowell stated that they looked at this based on a different type of bidding because they were
operating under very significant time pressures. When you look at the ratio of the amount of the
change order versus the original amount of the contract, they jump off the page. For example,
Motor City Electric on the electrical work where you had a base contract of $20,372,000 and then
a change order request of almost $18 million, which is almost the amount of the contract. The
Committee went through these and the numbers require explanation. Why did they get so out of
whack on these? There is timing, guesstimates and they had to work quickly. The Committee felt
they needed to raise these questions and get an explanation on the questions.

Mr. Lewand said that if the committee has not fully vetted the proposed change orders to its
complete satisfaction, he would like to defer until such time as he could get a complete analysis on
a contract that jumps that much and an analysis of its impact on Detroiters in particular, as
employees and as business owners.

Mr. Holiowell stated that he would like to defer to the Committee members that were at the
meeting?"Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Crain. Mr. Jenkins agreed with Mr. Lewand and stated that he would
like it to be brought back to the Committee.

Mr. Hollowell informed that the numbers may very well be justified, but the ratio is abnormal.

Mr. Crain added that there was another concern by the Committee. Both Motor City and MSL 
Limbach were procured under a different process?ea design build assist?"which the Committee
vetted and approved, and subsequently monitored. In the case of Motor City Electric, they are a
Detroit headquartered firm and have had a significant amount of Detroit based and Detroit
headquartered utilization at the sub?contract level as well. The MSL Limbach contract had a lower
threshold for a goal and an update on their procurement processes to meet that goal and/or exceed
it is needed.

Mr. Lewand stated that a complete and thorough detailed report from Heritage is needed and they
should be involved in discussions with the Committee.

Mr. Ogden requested that when this comes back to the Board, that the responses to the questions
that were raised be in writing.

Mr. Hosey said that it would be helpful to have an understanding of how the costs are covered.

Mr. Lewand replied that it is his understanding that the llitchesjust write a check. They have a side
agreement with Gore?s team and, between the two teams, they are covering ail cost overruns.
DOA is not spending any more money. Mr. Brown said that ali of the items here exceed the bonds.

Mr. Nagiick added that the Board should recognize and feel comfortable with the fact that the total
value of the asset will be on books.

Mr. Lewand called for a motion to defer this item.

On a motion by Mr. Hollowell, seconded by Mr. Crain, Resolution Code DDA 17-09-123~
54 was tabled,

Events Center Protect: Approval of Subcontract Change Orders?-
. Barton Mallow, Midwest Steei, Motor City Electric, StageRight, MOD interiors, KONE,

Mr. Lewand advised that this item will also be deferred.

ADMINISTRATION

COMMENT

Mr. Lewand called for public comment and stated that two minutes would be given.
Mr. John Lauve of Holly, Michigan stated the following:

?The kids have been cheated out of their tickets for years and this needs to be concluded
and resolved. i gave you a letter that needs to be sent to the llitch clan stating that they
are in default and they have 45 days to shape up. This re?ects on your ability to manage
this thing because you haven't done the season. i know they
don't want to see a losing team but still, that is their obligation. it is not some dream that 
dreamed up. They passed out at the last meeting this letter from the school saying they
got wonderful help from the Tigers. i called the number on the paper and they were
disconnected?the guy didn?t work there anymore. i would be willing to take that job on.

The second thing is, it is good to see what Gilbert is doing. He is doing the right thing for
the city. Here is what we have from liitch. This was 2005. Forget it. We don?t want to
bother with this one. Forget this one. Forget this promise. They were going to fix these
buildings up. Forget this, they?ve got a scaffolding around the building collecting debris.
Oh, here is the Masonic Temple and they own this piece of relic right next to it. Oh, these
guys pay taxes. llitch doesn't pay taxes so forget that. Here is the one he wanted to tear
down and the City Council stopped this right across the street. What did he want to do?
He wanted to do his development plan for the catalyst. What was his development plan?
Demolish it and make a parking lot. That is sit they are creating down here. Here is the
plan that was for the Wayne State but it kind of changed ail of a sudden. That is what it is
supposed to look like. Here is what it looks like. And they have an obligation to come up
with development plans by December."

Mr. Lewand advised Mr. Lauve that his time was up and thanked him for his comments.

OTHER MATTERS
