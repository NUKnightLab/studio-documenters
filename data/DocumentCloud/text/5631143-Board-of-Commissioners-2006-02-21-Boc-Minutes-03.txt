In the absence of Commissioner O’Keefe, Chairperson of the Finance & Audit Committee,
Commissioner Ponce presented her report. Per Commissioner Ponce, the Finance & Audit
Committee Meeting was held on Wednesday, March 15, 2006 at 1:00 p.m. at the 626 W. Jackson
Corporate Offices. The Chief Financial Officer and her staff presented the Committee with the
Treasury Report for the month of February 2006.
Commissioner Ponce then introduced an Omnibus Motion for adoption of resolutions for Items
A1 and A2, discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Finance Committee.
(Item A1)
In December 2005, the Board awarded a 2-year contract to Aon as Broker of Record. As the
Broker of Record, Aon has been granted authority to competitively solicit bids for insurance on
behalf of the CHA. In January 2006, Aon released bid packets and directly solicited 30
prospective insurance carriers. Bids were only received by a few carriers, as many insurance
carriers are still not interested in writing public housing risks, due to either treaty exclusions or
specific underwriting guidelines. The General Liability program received quotations from
Lexington, the incumbent, ACE, and Munich American Re. With respect to the Excess Liability,
only Lexington, the incumbent, provided a quotation. American Home Assurance Company was
the most competitive for Commercial Crime coverage offering a premium quote less than the
incumbent Great American Insurance Corporation. In the past, the marketing of the Workers
Compensation coverage has been the most difficult piece of the program. ACE/USA (ACE), the
incumbent Workers Compensation carrier was the only market to offer a bid. Accordingly, the
resolution for Item A1 approves award of contract with the named carriers in the aggregate
amount not-to-exceed $2,369,139.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-30
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated February 4, 2005
entitled “Authorization to enter into contracts with Lexington Insurance Company
American Home Assurance Company, and ACE/USA for the Private Managers
Insurance Program’s Liability, Workers Compensation and Commercial Crime
Coverages”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

3

 THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a contract with Lexington Insurance Company American
Home Assurance Company, and ACE/USA for the Private Managers Insurance
Program’s Liability, Workers Compensation and Commercial Crime Coverages”
in the aggregate amount not-to-exceed $2,369,139 for the period April 1, 2006
through March 31, 2007.

(Item A2)
The resolution for Item A2 waives post-employment restrictions for Brenda Parker. The Habitat
Company has hired Brenda Parker, former Senior Asset Manager at the CHA, to manage the
Dearborn Homes. The Habitat Company recently assumed management of this property that
presents a unique set of management challenges due to the development’s age, size,
configuration, and physical condition. The property generates a large number of work orders,
which requires intense management of resources and oversight of staff as well as the constant
monitoring of the development’s budget. As a former employee of the CHA’s Asset
Management Department, Ms. Parker is familiar with the management of public housing
properties. She understands the CHA’s operating procedures, the Authority’s admissions and
continued occupancy policies, the budgeting and expenditure processes, and the federal
regulations governing public housing properties. Her understanding of these areas will enable
The Habitat Company to institute best practices to improve both the day-to-day operation of the
property and residents’ living conditions within the limits of available CHA funding.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-31
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 1, 2006,
entitled “Authorization to Waive Post-Employment Restrictions to Improve
Management of a Family Development,”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to waive the Post-Employment Restrictions in the CHA Ethics Policy
where The Habitat Company has hired former CHA Senior Asset Manager
Brenda Parker to serve as property manager for the Dearborn Homes.

Committee, the Joint Operations and Tenant Services Committee meeting scheduled for
Wednesday, March 15, 2006 was not held. However, the Committee was briefed on items
appearing on the Agenda, but no votes or actions were taken.
(Item B1)

documents to HUD for the rehabilitation of Fountain View Apartments, 3718-28 W. Douglas.

rehabilitate Fountain View Apartments. Fountain View will be rehabilitated into a 45 unit mixed
income development of which 14 of the units will be CHA rental. The building is located in the

 CHA currently holds title to the building and land. The CHA will convey the building to the
developer at closing and the land will be subject to a 99 year ground lease. The City of Chicago
holds title to the adjacent vacant land and has agreed to convey the parcel to the project at
closing for parking and the development of a small tot-lot for use by the building residents. The
ownership entity will be Fountain View Apartments Limited Partnership. The general partner is
LCDC/Safeway Joint Venture. LCDC/Safeway Joint Venture is a partnership comprised of
Safeway Construction Company and Lawndale Christian Development Corporation (“LCDC”), a
not-for-profit organization. The equity investor is the limited partner with a 99.99% ownership
interest. Safeway is also the construction contractor and construction manager for the project.
CHA has procured a consultant to provide the required independent review of costs to verify cost
reasonableness. The budget for Fountain View Apartments is projected to be $10,107,155 and
will be financed through a mix of public and private sources.

(Item B4)
From January through September 2004, HUD conducted a compliance review under the
authorities of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities
Act of 1990. HUD reviewed CHA’s programs, services and activities, including the designated
accessible housing units, associated common areas, on-site management offices, CHA’s
administrative offices, including occupancy, housing programs, and non-housing programs and
activities. HUD’s review revealed deficiencies related to the physical accessibility of the
common areas, on-site management offices, and individual housing units, as well as alleged
deficiencies in the CHA’s polices and procedures. Accordingly, the resolution for Item B4
approves execution of a Voluntary Compliance Agreement between HUD and CHA in order to
address the compliance issues raised by HUD’s review and to comply with its responsibilities
under the Moving to Work Demonstration Agreement. In general, the VCA will recommit CHA
to its obligation to provide 5.3% fully accessible units for persons with mobility impairments and
2.1% units for persons with sensory impairments throughout CHA’s entire housing inventory of
25,000 units by the end of the Plan for Transformation. One of the major undertakings of the
VCA is for CHA to create a Transition Plan. That Plan will be both an inventory of CHA’s
accessible units and a work plan to describe how the CHA plans to bring all of its Housing and
Non-Housing programs into full compliance with Section 504 and the ADA by the completion of
the Plan for Transformation. CHA will report on and update its progress every six months and
conduct semi-annual meetings with HUD. The VCA will remain in effect until the CHA has
satisfactorily completed its obligation under the agreement or for seven years, whichever is later.
Commissioner Young then introduced a Motion for the adoption of Resolution for Item B4.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-35
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 1, 2006
requesting authorization to execute the VCA between HUD and the CHA and
concurs in the recommendation contained therein;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

designee to execute a Voluntary Compliance Agreement with HUD addressing
CHA’s compliance with accessibility requirements.
