III. Action Items (continued)
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #2)
Doug Elwell, Deputy CEO of Finance and Strategy, and Interim Deputy CEO of Operations, provided an
overview of the requests presented for the Committee’s consideration.
The Committee reviewed and
discussed the requests.
Review of some of the requests by Contract Compliance has not yet been completed; it was respectfully
requested that the Committee conditionally approve these requests, pending the completion of review by
Contract Compliance.
Director Butler, seconded by Director Estrada, moved the approval of request number
1. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
With regard to request number 3, in response to comments from Directors Butler and Estrada regarding the
timeline to bring the services in-house and the cost/benefit analysis, Mr. Elwell stated that he will make that
information available. After determining that this request to extend and increase the current contract was not
competitively bid, Board Chairman Hammock requested that the transmittal specifically reflect this detail; it
was noted that the original contract, which was approved and executed in 2011, was the result of a Request for
Proposals process. Additionally, Board Chairman Hammock requested information on how much McKesson
was paid for just the contingent portion of the contract and how that compares.
With regard to request number 6, Director Estrada stated that, for a full perspective, in addition to the
information provided regarding maintenance or whether the equipment is being purchased with capital funds, it
would be good to also understand the community benefit and revenue that is going to be generated by this
technology. Chairman Collens concurred; he indicated that this is planned, and will be part of the presentation
going forward.
Request numbers 4 and 8 were reviewed and discussed together, as the two proposed contracts are the products
of a Request for Proposals package that contained several components. Mr. Scheer recused himself from the
discussion relating to request number 4. Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, provided an overview
of the two requests. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Estrada, seconded by Director Butler, moved the approval of request numbers
2 through 8, subject to completion of review by Contract Compliance where
appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Mr. Scheer recused himself with regard to request number 4.
Note: at the February 27, 2015 Meeting of the CCHHS Board of Directors, request number 3, under the Contracts
and Procurement Items, was conditionally approved, pending being found responsive to the Minority- and WomenOwned Business Enterprise provisions in the Cook County Ordinance on Procurement and Contracting, which
provisions are included in the Cook County Health and Hospitals System Procurement Policy.

Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided an overview of the information contained in the
CountyCare Update. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
On slide 7 of the presentation, Mr. Glass noted that a correction needed to be made to the header of the 4th
column from the right – the header should be listed as “Change From Dec’14.” He also provided information
regarding the gap between the membership totals for January 2015 and the FY2015 Budget (FY2015 budgeted
membership for the month of January). With regard to the Family Health Plan (FHP) population, when the
administration crafted its budget for 2015 in May 2014, the State was under a plan to start implementing the
choice process for FHP members in July; it actually got implemented in September, so CCHHS is a little bit
behind budget simply because the State was behind. In March, there will be a deep dive on Managed Care at
the full Board Meeting; he expects to project out to reflect how the administration thinks it will become aligned
between actual and budgeted membership in the coming months. With regard to the Affordable Care Act
(ACA) Adult population, he stated that the actual membership is below budget due to the redetermination
process. With regard to the Seniors and Persons with Disabilities population (SPD), he stated that this is a
number that the administration had kept deliberately low, as they are a very expensive population; adding that
population as a product within the Health Plan was simply to make sure that existing patients stay with
CCHHS.
Director Butler, seconded by Director Estrada, moved to receive and file the reports
under Section IV. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Honorable Members

FINANCE COMMITTEE

Cook County Health Hospitals System
1900 Polk St.

2nd Floor

Chicago, IL 60612

Dear Sir/Madam:

I am president of CompuBill Inc. CompuBill was incorporated on January 20, 1980 in
Orland Park, IL, Cook County. Most of our employees live in Cook County.

We have, for the past 35 years, managed revenue cycle and patient accounts receivable
and billing for physicians and hospitals. In calendar year 2014 we managed over $110
million in patient accounts receivable for the professional component of medical services
provided at 15 different medical facilities in and around Cook County.

From September, 1983 to February, 1992 CompuBill managed all the Medicaid billing
for all the freestanding medical clinics operated by the City of Chicago. We lost this
contract in 1992 due mainly to our lack of political connections. This contract was
unjustly awarded to a sole-source contractor.

I have tried to be of service to the residents of Cook County by offering our services to
manage patient accounts receivable and billing for medical services provided at Stroger
Cook County Hospital and other medical facilities operated by My ?rst attempt
in this regard was on October 31, 2007.

Today I am addressing the following item listed in the agenda in Section (B) and hope
that Finance Committee and staff will not approve the request to extend and
increase the contact amount for the following vendor/supplier:

1. McKesson Revenue Management Solutions, Alpharetta, GA, contract number
H11-25-034. This request is for extending and increasing the contract by
$1,540,000. The original contact was for 3 years and expired on April 30, 2014.
Following this expiration date I am not aware of an RFP being issued to allow
quali?ed vendors to submit competing proposals to manage revenue cycle and

Page 5 of 60

 Finance Committee .. 2 - February 20, 2015

patient accounts receivable and billing for Further, paying McKesson
$13,039,527 to collect estimated revenue to of $32,762,520 is an
outrageously high price. On a percentage basis this fee amounts to 39.8%, almost
40%, of the revenue collected. CompuBill?s current fee schedule for managing
revenue cycle and patient accounts receivable and billing varies from 4.00% for
the professional component of neonatology services to 7.5% for the professional
component of diagnostic imaging services. I believe this fee schedule is normal
for the medical practices that are similar in payer class distribution and levels of
medical services provided to patients at various facilities.

2. As indicated in the request submitted to you (request 3) this contract was
extended from May 1, 2014 to January 31, 2015 by the of?ce of Supply Chain
Management. I believe prior to the end of this contract period the procedure for
competitive selection methodology should have been followed. I believe a
Request for Proposals (RFP) should have been duly issued and published to allow
organizations such as CompuBill to submit a competing bid. CompuBill has been
on the list of potential vendors and neither I nor our project management staff is
aware of any such RFP. Further, I am not aware of the original RFP either even
though CompuBill is a on the Cook County list of potential vendors.

3. CompuBill?s analysis, using our propriety volume and revenue mathematical
models and Stroger Hospital patient census data from 2006, showed that
for diagnostic imaging interpretation services the total number of examinations
billed should be 1,788,901. Using the prevailing usual and customary fee schedule
at the 90th percentile level for Medicare area 16 we estimated the gross billing to
be $203,819,970. The payer class distribution was assumed to be similar to an
average of the inner-city hospitals we service and was 63.12% Medicaid, 11.36%
Medicare, 10.06% private insurance, 6.86% contractual insurance and 8.60% self
pay. Our analysis using the revenue model showed the projected net revenue to be
$67,620,387. Please note that this projected revenue is only for the professional
component of diagnostic imaging examinations and procedures.

4. In an attempt to calibrate the result of our mathematical modeling, based on actual
data, on November 3, 2011 I had met with Ms. Juanita Stith, CMRP, and Director
of Supply Chain Management and presented a detailed explanation of our
analysis. Present at this meeting and CompuBill?s detailed presentation were
Jackie Edwards, Neida Rosario, Larry Patrick, Bill Luallen and John Cookinham.
I had speci?cally requested certain data from Mr. Cookinham. This data would
allow me to more accurately project revenue from the professional
component of physician services. However, this data was never provided.

5. I urge the Finance Committee to mandate release of this data so that
interested vendors can make a concerted effort to apprise you of the projected
goal of the revenue that should be collected and the fees for managing revenue
cycle and patient accounts receivable and billing.

Page 6 of 60

 Finance Committee 3 - February 20, 2015

6. In defense of CompuBill?s performance I have included in Appendix A our
performance metrics based on calendar year 2014 billing.

It is my fervent hope that will issue an RFP for managing revenue cycle and
patient accounts receivable and billing. The detailed requirements that should be included
in this RFP have been submitted by CompuBill earlier, both Via email to all the members
of the Board of Directors and one printed copy that was submitted at the
September 28, 2011 meeting. These requirements are fairly universal and would allow for
submission of competitive bids by quali?ed vendors.

Thus far my attempts to establish a business relationship with the Government of Cook
County have not been successful. Please give us the opportunity to present to you
information and data showing how reimbursement revenue for the professional and
technical component of medical services can be improved and optimized at all the
medical facilities operated by Cook County. All I need is about 30 minutes of your or
your staff 3 time to make this presentation.

In anticipation of a favorable reply, and for your time and attention, thank you very
much.

Sincerely,
G. Narender Reddy
President
