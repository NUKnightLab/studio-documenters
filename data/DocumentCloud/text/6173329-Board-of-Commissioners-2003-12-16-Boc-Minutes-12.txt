revisions therein from the documents approved hereby.

(Item C5)
In support of the CHA’s Plan for Transformation self-sufficiency objective, the CHA desires to
partner with the City Colleges of Chicago (CCC) to establish educational and training programs
for residents and Housing Choice voucher holders. The goal of the partnership with CCC is to
create a continuum of education and training supportive services that will allow CHA residents
to advance over time to progressively higher levels of education, certification and employment.

Intergovernmental Agreement with CCC for a term of two years. Existing degree and
certification programs will be made available to CHA residents at reduced costs in areas such as
