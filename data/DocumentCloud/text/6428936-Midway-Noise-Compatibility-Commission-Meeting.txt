 FINAL Minutes of the October 26, 2017, Meeting of the
Midway Noise Compatibility Commission
APPROVAL OF MINUTES
A. July 27, 2017 Meeting Minutes

minutes. A motion to approve the minutes as distributed was made by Trustee

REPORT OF THE CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF AVIATION (“CDA”)
A. Update Regarding Odorous Windows
 Mr. Frame provided an update regarding odorous vinyl windows. Recently, some
homeowners have raised concerns about odors emitted from a small percentage
of the acoustical windows manufactured by Sound Solutions. The CDA is taking
action to address the concerns of these homeowners as quickly and thoroughly as
possible while determining the root cause of the odors to understand any potential
impacts better. In 2015, the CDA received calls for two Midway homes that were
experiencing odors from their windows. The nature of these calls was unusual to
the CDA, and did not represent a trend or a pattern within the 8,000 homes we had
sound-insulated. Because Sound Solutions Windows & Doors, LLC, had gone out
of business and was not honoring its warranty obligations, the CDA volunteered to
replace those windows. To determine the root cause of the odor issue and whether
it is actually affecting air quality, the City has retained a specialized environmental
and industrial hygiene consultant, Amec Foster Wheeler Environment &
Infrastructure, Inc., to test for the cause of the odors that emit from some windows.
This testing – both a lab test of the materials and indoor air quality testing – is
underway. This week the CDA sent a letter to approximately 3,000 Midway
homeowners who received Sound Solutions windows and are still under warranty.
The purpose of the letter is to inform the community about this odorous window
issue and to let the homeowners know that the CDA is taking steps to resolve the
issue. To date, we have received 320 inquiries for Midway homes. Of those 320,
we have completed odor inspections for 201 homes and have 119 odor indoor
inspections scheduled over the next four weeks. The CDA is committed to
performing odor inspections in every RSIP home which reports a concern to us.
B. 2nd Quarter 2017 Airport Noise Management System (ANMS) Report
Mr. Frame asked Mr. Jackson of Landrum & Brown to present the 3rd Quarter 2017
Airport Noise Management System Report.
