activities related to CHA’s Plan Forward, including planned rehabilitation or demolition of CHA units,
CHA-initiated transfers in accordance with CHA’s Admissions and Continued Occupancy Policy
(ACOP), moves for families satisfying their Right of Return under the Relocation Rights Contract, and
emergency relocation situations. CHA estimates more than 3,000 families will require moving
assistance during the base term of the awarded contracts, not inclusive of emergency transfers and
other move types. In February 2013, the CHA advertised a Request for Proposal (RFP) to provide
moving services for CHA residents. Of the 7 respondents to the RFP, the Evaluating Committee
recommended award of contract to the following 4 highest scored vendors to ensure capacity for the
volume of moves and provide adequate coverage for emergency relocations: Big O Moving &
Storage, Inc., Smith Movers, Inc., Midway Moving & Storage, Inc. and Aaron Brothers Moving
System, Inc. Big O has provided moving services to the Chicagoland area for more than 30 years.
Smith has provided residential and government moving services in the Chicagoland area for more than
41 years. Midway has provided residential moving services in Chicago since 1987. Aaron Brothers has
provided moving services to the Chicago area for more than 40 years. All four (4) contractors have the
ability to conduct multiple daily moves, emergency transfers and provide long term storage.
Accordingly, the resolution for Item 2 recommends award of contract to the below stated 4 companies.

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

(Item 3)
The Resident Services Division provides a wide range of housing and social services to residents who
utilize its public housing and Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) subsidy programs. Services include,
but are not limited to, housing stability services, education and employment, youth and senior services
and clinical mental health services. As part of CHA’s Plan Forward, Resident Services has reimagined
its service model to provide individual targeted services to residents. In order to better understand and
communicate the impact of the services offered to residents, Resident Services desires to have an
impact analysis completed. The impact analysis will measure both fiscal and social return on CHA’s
investment in the services offered through its more than 50 contracted service providers. Additionally,
the data gathered will be utilized to continuously inform ongoing decisions in improving CHA’s
service provision. Based on the solicitation released by CHA in April 2013 and advertised in area
newspapers, BuySpeed and the CHA website, two proposals were received. Based on the
recommendation of the Evaluation Committee, the resolution for Item 3 approves award of contract to
Mission Measurement, LLC. Mission Measurement is an evaluation and strategy consulting firm that
helps clients measure and evaluate social impact and create value through social change. They focus
on solving social problems and solutions that are measureable, enduring and that deliver social and
economic value. Since 2005, Mission Measurement has helped government agencies, foundations,
non-profits and private companies to solve social problems by measuring, maximizing and selling their
impact.

(Item 4)
A Request for Proposal (RFP) was advertised in March 2013 requesting oversight, maintenance and
program coordination services at CHA Computer labs. CHA operates and maintains computer labs in
senior and family buildings and community buildings throughout its housing portfolio that assist in
bridging the technology gap that exists in many low income communities. Currently, there are eight
fully operational labs that will be supported through this initiative and two additional labs scheduled to
be completed by July. This solicitation was advertised in area newspapers and on the CHA website.
Thirty-five vendors picked up a copy of the RFP, however, only one company, TEC Services,
responded to the solicitation. Accordingly, the resolution for Item 4 approves award of contract to
3

 TEC Services to provide oversight, maintenance and program coordinating at CHA Computer Labs.
Staff contacted vendors who picked up the RFP to understand why they did not respond. The 10 who
responded to the inquiry provided reasons including not having the technical support needed, timing
and not having the capability to complete the scope of work. For more than 20 years, TEC Services
has provided education and technology solutions for a large client base, including multiple public and
governmental agencies. Since 2008 TEC Services has served as a partner in CHA’s workforce
development initiatives, first through the Resident Opportunity for Self Sufficiency grant from HUD
and then through the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program. Through these programs, TEC
Services has trained and/or employed hundreds of CHA residents. TEC Services will utilize the
relationships it has created over the past five (5) years to continue to provide high quality and
customized education and technology services for CHA residents. The proposed program will provide:
1) oversight and supervision during lab hours; 2) maintenance of CHA computer lab equipment; and 3)
coordination of a menu of programming for CHA residents. Additionally, the program will provide
intensive technology, customer services and workforce development training to CHA residents and
assistance in placing successful completers in employment opportunities both in the CHA labs and
within the technology industry.

residential units (1,498 Altgeld Gardens and 500 Phillip Murray Homes). To date, the CHA’s Capital
Improvement program rehabilitated 1,323 units (1,009 units at Altgeld Gardens and 314 units at Phillip
Murray Homes) with new renovated bathrooms, updated kitchens, modern lighting fixtures and
heating/cooling systems as well as exterior work that included landscaping, laundry facilities, street
improvements, and underground infrastructure systems. Currently 635 units remain un-rehabilitated

combination of consolidation, de-concentration, rehabilitation, renovation and new construction. The
Master Site Plan deliverable will address physical and economic isolation including issues of
inadequate access to retail and non-residential amenities, connectivity to broader community, natural
and manmade barriers and vacant sites. It will identify the appropriate number of total units, unit
density levels, housing tenancy, and building configurations that will establish a welcoming, diverse
and empowered community that is economically viable and environmentally sustainable.

Program at an interest rate not-to-exceed 1.5% for period not to exceed 36 months. This is the first

needed for purchases or rehabilitation of properties as identified by CHA Plan of Unit Acquisition
Program. HUD approval will be obtained prior to pledging collateral sourced with Federal cash or
sourced with securities obtained with Federal funds. By undertaking this initiative, CHA leverages its
existing investment with Government National Mortgage Association notes as a collateral source from
non-federal funds; is able to obtain better timing and lower rates than other options and develops the
CHA and FHLB partnership for future alternative funding mechanisms.

A report from Mr. Charles Woodyard, Chief Executive Officer, then followed. Per Mr. Woodyard,
Heartland Housing and the Center on Halsted broke ground earlier in the month to begin construction
on the Midwest’s first LGBTQ-friendly senior housing facility at 3600 N. Halsted Street in Lakeview.
The project will provide 79 units of senior housing and will preserve a portion of the 23rd District
Town Hall police station for the new facility. Like all CHA properties, the units will be available to all
seniors regardless of sexual orientation. Construction is expected to be completed by Fall 2014. Mr.
Woodyard then continued by announcing the opening of the IIT Coder Camp, a new summer program
for CHA youth to show youth how to develop websites. IIT Coder Camp has received a high-volume
response, with only 20 spots available. At completion of the camp, youth will have an online portfolio
that can be used to market themselves as a freelancer. The CEO concluded his report by recapping the
recent visit of former Chicago Bears Israel Idonije at the Seventh Annual All-Star Football and Cheer
Camp held in West Pullman. Over 200 youth from the Chicagoland area participated in the free, oneday camp where youth practiced football drills with Idonije and prepared a cheer routine to perform at
the end of the day.
Chairwoman Scott then invited residents and the public at large to address the Board.
There being no further business to come before the Commissioners, upon Motion made, seconded and
