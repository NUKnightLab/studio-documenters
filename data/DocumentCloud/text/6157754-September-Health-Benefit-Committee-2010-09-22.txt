3. 2011 Health Benefit Premiums
The Committee explored multiple scenarios using an interactive premium calculation tool
with the assistance of Segal and Ms. Finch. After much review and consideration, it was
determined that the 4 year strategy to establish a Non-Unified claims experience for the
fully insured plans be extended 1 additional year, decreasing the 2011 premium rate for
the HMO Non-Medicare Plans.
It was also determined that the HMO Classic plan, while lower in premium, has the same
network, physicians and benefit level as the HMOIL plan. That being identified, the
Committee directed Ms. Finch to develop a communication plan to educate members on
the value of moving to this lower cost, yet identical in benefit, plan.
The Committee then reviewed the plan design changes considered at the August
Committee meeting and decided to increase the PPO Medicare and Non-Medicare
deductibles as follows;
Individual:
Family:

$200
$400

The Committee directed Ms. Finch to work with Segal to finalize the 2011 premiums and
present to the Committee for approval on October 6, 2010.
