STAFF REPORT: 11-13-2019 MEETING
ADDRESS: 150 BAGLEY
HISTORIC DISTRICT: ADJACENT TO GRAND CIRCUS PARK
APPLICANT: EMMETT MOTEN

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

UNITED ARTISTS THEATER DEMOLITION/REHABILITATION
• The building located at 150 Bagley is known as the United Artist Theater. It was erected in 1928
and was designed by C. Howard Crane, architect of several historic-age theatres in Detroit. The
current storefront at the multi-story office tower was installed in 1960
• The applicant has submitted the attached documentation to the Detroit Historic District
Commission as required by Detroit City Code, Chapter 21 “History” because the building located at
150 Bagley is adjacent to the Grand Circus Park Local Historic District
• See the attached, which indicates that current project proposes the following:
o The demolition of the theatre wing and rotunda connector
o The expansion of the existing parking/paved area within the footprint of the theatre wing
o The installation of a “memorial plaza” and “pocket park” within the footprint of the theatre
wing
o The erection of a service area enclosure
o The replacement of the existing 1960s International Style storefront with a new storefront
o Rehabilitation of the high-rise office tower.
• The applicant has submitted an application to the City of Detroit for approval to establish an
Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District and a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone at the property
• The applicant is seeking Historic Preservation Tax Credits to support the project
• The applicant is also seeking funds from the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development to support the project. The expenditure of any such funds will require that the project
be reviewed for compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
GRAND CIRCUS PARK LOCAL HISTORIC DISTRICT
• The Grand Circus Park Historic District was locally designated in 2001
• The City of Detroit designated the district in recognition of Grand Circus as “…one of
downtown Detroit’ s major open spaces which contains significant historic landscape features
and public monuments.” The buildings within the district “…form a rim around Grand Circus
Park. The result is an open-air drawing room for the city, defined by the open space and the
structures which form a non-continuous wall at its edges.”
• The City also determined that the district is significant because it remains as “…a collection of
early twentieth century commercial buildings by noted architects including Albert Kahn, C.
Howard Crane, George Post and Smith Hinchman & Grylls; for its Gothic Revival Church by
Gordon W. Lloyd; and as the hub for the social, cultural and business activities that took place
during the early decades of dynamic growth of the City of Detroit as the automobilemanufacturing capitol of the world”
• The National Park Service (NPS) listed the Grand Circus Park Historic District in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1995. Please see the NRHP district boundaries, which
include the United Artists Theater Building/150 Bagley
• The boundaries of the Local historic district are slightly different from the National Register
Historic district boundaries. Specifically, 150 Bagley was not included in the local district’s
boundary, although it is included within the boundaries of the National Register district.
STAFF OBSERVATIONS

 •
•
•
•
•
.

The project will result in the rehab of the building’s commercial tower
The parking lot to the rear of the property is expansive and represents the most significant break in
the building wall /”rim” around Grand Circus Park
The demolition of the theatre will increase the expanse of open/paved parking area that opens onto
Grand Circus Park
The project will result in the removal of a yet another mid-century storefront from Grand Circus
Park NRHP District.
The HDC’s role in providing comment to the Mayor and City Council is to determine the
“…demonstrated effect of the proposed development…” on the adjacent Grand Circus Park Local
Historic District

5. Description of physical appearance

Facing southeast on Bagley, the eighteen story tall United Artists Building is clad in red orange
brick with terra cotta decoration and trim. It has a tripartite design executed in the Renaissance
Revival style. The building has an L?shaped footprint with the theater building tucked into the
west side or rear of the building. The front facade of the office building is ten bays wide and
has a two story tall commercial base. The northernmost bay contains the theater entrance and is
clad in terra cotta with Rennaissance Revival details that is in poor condition. Many of the
details are missing but there are two decorative carved panels and the remains of a blind
balustrade running across the top. The storefront below the cladding has been boarded closed. The
south nine bays were re?done in the 19605 in the International Style. The bays are separated by
aluminum clad piers. The first floor storefronts are recessed and capped by shallow arches. The
building entrance is located in the center of the building. A separate commercial space entrance
is located toward the south end of the elevation and has a projecting flat metal canopy. Above the
storefronts the wall is clad in green granite or marble. There is a row of fixed windows with
aluminum frames across the second floor. The shaft of the building, floors three through fifteen,
has two one?over?one double hung windows in each bay at every floor. The bays are separated by
brick clad piers. The spandrel panels between the third, fourth, and fifth floor windows are green
granite to match the storefront. The remainder of the spandrel panels on the building are terra
cotta and alternate between the floors with a round medallion or diamond pattern in the center.

The fifteenth floor windows have arched tops, the wall is clad in terra cotta around them. There
is a terra cotta band giving the appearance of dentils at the sill line of the sixteenth floor
windows marking the top of the building. The sixteenth through eighteenth floor windows are one?
over?one windows with metal spandrel panels between floors. The eighteenth floor windows haVe
arched tops and terra cotta surrounds. A blind arcade executed in terra cotta caps the building.

The south elevation is five bays wide and duplicates the detailing of the facade. The two story
base has aluminum clad piers and the bays are infilled with fixed aluminum frame windows. The
upper stories match the facade, there are green granite spandrel panels between the third, fourth
an fifth floor windows with terra cotta spandrel panels above. The brick cladding has been
stripped on the piers between bays beginning at the fifth floor.

The southern three bays of the west elevation project forward of the remainder of the building and
duplicate the detailing and decoration of the front and south facades. The remainder of the
elevation is clad in matching brick and has pairs of one?over?one windows at every floor in almost
every bay. One bay has a single small one?over-one window at every floor and one bay is void of
openings. A two to three story brick clad penthouse projects above the roof. The shorter west
wall of the theater has boarded doors at the ground level and a metal fire escape.

The north elevation of the office building is three bays wide, the four-story tall theater building
extends to the west. The theater portion of the elevation has no openings and has a limestone
coping at the top of the wall. The office building is a solid brick wall for the first three
stories. Beginning at the fourth floor there are two three-over?three windows in each bay at every
floor, except for at the tenth and eighteenth floors. A solid terra cotta band runs across the
elevation at the sixteenth floor window sills.

The theater vestibule and lobby are rectangular in plan and lead to a rotunda shaped foyer. The 2
story ceiling consists of vaulted plaster. The walls are lined with laced plaster details,
sculptured Indian maidens, mirrors, ornamental metal wainscoting and a granite base. the flooring
consists of marble in the lobby and mosaic tile in the vestibule. The floor slopes up from the
exterior doors along Bagley Street to the theater level.

The Theater itself was the smallest of the Detroit movie palaces, seating approximately 2,000
people. Although built primarily for films, the theater had an orchestra pit that provided sound
for silent films, and a stage for live performances. It was decorated throughout with Gothic
plaster. The walls were adorned with lacy plaster and the ceiling a plaster dome. The stage was
flanked with projecting canopies over the proscenium and organ grilles.

The retail spaces were located on the first floor, and Were designed to house small shops. The

walls and ceilings of these tenant spaces have a smooth plaster finish. Mechanical ductwork is left
exposed. And, mezzanines are located toward the rear of the spaces.

6. Statement of significance

The United Artists Building contributes to the Grand Circus Park Historic District. The district
is significant for its collection of early 20th century buildings designed by notable Detroit
architects such as Albert Kahn, C. Howard Crane and Louis Kamper in architectural styles popular at
the time surrounding Grand Circus Park which is significant for its association with civic events
and landscape design, including notable monuments. In the 19205 the district became a popular
entertainment district due to the large number of theaters constructed in the area. The United
Artists Building was constructed within the district's period of significance which is c. 1860
through 1950.

The United Artists Building and movie theater opened in 1928, the theater was designed in the
Spanish Gothic style. Designed by noted Detroit theater architect C. Howard Crane. The building
was one of many constructed across the United States by the United Artists Movie Studio. The
studio was founded in 1919 by movie stars including Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas
Fairbanks.

In 1957 the building was sold to the Detroit Automobile Inter?Insurance Exchange of the Automobile
Association of Michigan. In the early 19605 the new owner remodeled the building and added the
International style detailing of the first two floors and a new bank lobby. The building has been
vacant since 1974 when the Automobile Association moved out of the building.
