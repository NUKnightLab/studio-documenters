Dear Ryan Kattoo,

This correspondence serves as a follow up to our meeting on Thursday, October 3, 2019, at CNS
Healthcare?s clinic at 15560 Joy Road, Detroit, Michigan 48228.

in that meeting, the CNS Healthcare (CNS) team made you aware that we are hosting three events,

during the next couple of months, including:

CNS Healthcare?s 1St Annual Turkey Giveaway on Saturday, November 23, 2019. We will start
setting up at 8 am. The actual turkey giveaway will start at 11 am and ends when, CNS has given
away all 1,000 turkeys. We agreed to host the event directly in front of clinic and out into
the parking lot for approximately 50 50 square feet, which we will block off. Last Thursday,
you asked Allen from US Quality Super Market to come to facility and we discussed that
CNS is giving away 1,000 turkeys. Allen does not have a problem that CNS is giving away 1,000
free turkeys. You asked that CNS clean up once, the turkey give away is over, and we will do so.

>k Ribbon Cutting Ceremony on Monday, December 9, 2019 from 10 am to noon. This event
will occur inside clinic. We are inviting elected officials, dignitaries, other guests and the
media. We agreed it is OK to tie a ribbon on the yellow posts in front of CNS, the ribbon we will

cut
*3 Open House Event on Monday, December 9, 2019 from 4 pm to 7 pm. This event will also
occur inside clinic. We are inviting elected officials, dignitaries and other guests.

Please let me know, If I captured your understanding about three upcoming events. If you have

questions and/or require clarifications, please advise.

Thank you in advance for your consideration in this matter.

Best,
gLJ-be?m
