·1· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Let's convene.· We will
·2· ·also hold off on the approval of minutes.· Why
·3· ·don't we start then with the status of prior
·4· ·projects?
·5· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Sure.
·6· · · · · · · · · So here just a quick list of all the
·7· ·transactions that have closed since CDF's inception.
·8· · · · · · · · · So so far in 2012, we're still
·9· ·sitting with four transactions closed.· We do have
10· ·two in closing that were both approved in the last
11· ·meeting in September, the ACE deal and the Shops
12· ·and Lofts deal.
13· · · · · · · · · · · ·(Enter Alderman Austin.)
14· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Since we were just
15· ·starting, why don't we go back to the top of the
16· ·agenda.· We have a quorum; Alderman Austin here,
17· ·Alderman Tunney here, Lois Scott here, and Andy
18· ·Mooney here.
19· · · · · · · · · Okay.· Let's -- I would take a
20· ·motion to approve the minutes of the September 11th
21· ·meeting.
22· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· So move.
23· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· Second.

·3· · · · · · · · · Third item on the agenda is the
·4· ·status report, which we were just getting into.
·5· · · · · · · · · So, Tony ...
·6· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Thank you.
·7· · · · · · · · · So just running through the 16
·8· ·transactions closed to date here, four so far have
·9· ·closed in 2012:· Oakwood Shores Terraces, Chicago
10· ·Family Health Center, Swedish Covenant Hospital,
11· ·and Shankman Orthogenic and Hyde Park Day School.
12· · · · · · · · · We do have two transactions beyond
13· ·this list that are in closing that were both
14· ·approved at the last meeting.· That's the ACE Solar
15· ·transaction and the Shops and Lofts at 47th
16· ·transaction.· Those are both still pending, but
17· ·going smoothly.
18· · · · · · · · · Here we see a map of those closed
19· ·transactions to date, the 16 deals, as they
20· ·distribute across the City of Chicago.
21· · · · · · · · · As far as construction status,
22· ·basically anything that was approved prior to 2012
23· ·is complete, substantially open.· Truong
24· ·Enterprises had a grand opening back in September.

·1· ·I think Treasurer Neely attended or was at least
·2· ·slated to attend.· It's a good looking facility at
·3· ·22nd and Halsted -- or 23rd and Halsted.
·4· · · · · · · · · And then anything that was approved
·5· ·in 2012 is under construction.· I just drove by the
·6· ·Mercy Oakwood Shores site a couple days ago, and
·7· ·it's -- the building is up.· It looks like a
·8· ·substantial structure already.· The other projects
·9· ·are earlier on in their construction.
10· · · · · · · · · As far as -11· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· I just want to make sure
12· ·and point out that everyone has copies, hard copies
13· ·of what Tony is showing you.· We're on page -- I'm
14· ·not sure the pages are numbered, but on the Deals
15· ·Summary.· Okay.· Tony.
16· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Thank you.
17· · · · · · · · · Just an updated breakdown of the
18· ·closed transactions by project type and by dollar
19· ·amount.· So CDF to date has had heavy weighting in
20· ·the community facility space; so nonprofit21· ·sponsored facilities providing services essentially
22· ·to neighborhood residents, with five transactions
23· ·in education, four in healthcare, and two in other.
24· · · · · · · · · So here we have job training and the

YVer1f

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 5

·1· ·vast array of services provided by the Kroc Center.
·2· ·And then five industrial transactions.
·3· · · · · · · · · In terms of dollar amounts, the
·4· ·education deals are still the heaviest sector,
·5· ·78 million.· The other community facilities, the
·6· ·lightest sector, at 29 million.
·7· · · · · · · · · In terms of overall status of CDF's
·8· ·tax credit allocations, this graph depicts the
·9· ·obtaining of allocation by CDF.· Each of the
10· ·different colors represents a different round of
11· ·allocation that CDF received starting in 2007, and
12· ·then you see the cumulative amount of allocation
13· ·that CDF had at any given time and its utilization
14· ·rate.· I guess the general pattern being that CDF
15· ·has had credits consistently since its inception
16· ·and has gotten faster at utilizing allocations
17· ·essentially.
18· · · · · · · · · So 196.3 million has been funded to
19· ·date.· That's because CDF prefunded the Shops and
20· ·Lofts transaction to meet a Treasury deadline.
21· ·That happened back on October 29th.· So at this
22· ·point there's 41.7 million of allocation remaining
23· ·unfunded.
24· · · · · · · · · In terms of looking at the breakdown

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 6

·1· ·of that allocation, there's 238 million in total
·2· ·allocation authority that has been received to date
·3· ·by CDF.· 184.6 million has been closed and pushed
·4· ·down to the project in terms of disbursed loans.
·5· ·The Shops and Lofts transaction prefunding is
·6· ·another 11.75 million on top of that that is funded
·7· ·down to CDF, but not loaned to the project yet.· So
·8· ·18 million currently in closing; that includes the
·9· ·Shops and Lofts amount and the ACE Solar amount.
10· · · · · · · · · In terms of allocation being
11· ·considered today for transaction, 9 -- up to
12· ·9 million for the SCR Transportation deal.· We have
13· ·12.3 million sort of tentatively sitting there as
14· ·being available for the Roseland Plaza transaction
15· ·since it's in restructuring.· Northern Trust is
16· ·still the proposed senior lender and tax credit
17· ·investor, and they're still in heavy discussions
18· ·with the developer.· The deal would need about
19· ·12.3 million in credits if it were to go forward.
20· ·So those credits aren't committed currently, the
21· ·12.3.· Those would require further board action.
22· ·But in terms of sort of mentally setting credits
23· ·aside, that's where we're sitting today.
24· · · · · · · · · So assuming those 12.3 do end up

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 7

·1· ·going to Roseland Plaza and the 9.0 million -- up
·2· ·to 9.0 million that are on the table for SCR
·3· ·Transportation are approved and closed, that will
·4· ·leave 14.1 million of uncommitted allocation.· So
·5· ·getting another allocation would be quite nice for
·6· ·CDF, I guess would be the way to sum it up.
·7· · · · · · · · · Jumping to the next slide, we have a
·8· ·new illustration of the job impacts that CDF has
·9· ·created to date.· Seems like there's a lot of
10· ·interest in that based on the questions we're
11· ·getting from the board in each meeting, so we
12· ·wanted to summarize it in a new way.
13· · · · · · · · · So the red bars represent the
14· ·projected total jobs that CDF's borrowers have said
15· ·that they anticipate creating when they're fully
16· ·stabilized.· The blue bars represent actual
17· ·outcomes that have been measured to date based on
18· ·CDF's periodic check-ins with its borrowers.
19· · · · · · · · · So if you look at -- up through
20· ·Truong Enterprises, sort of in the middle of the
21· ·chart, those are the projects that are complete and
22· ·open and actually have measurable job impacts to
23· ·report at this point.
24· · · · · · · · · So in aggregate, those transactions

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 8

·1· ·project 1,078 full-time equivalent jobs, and
·2· ·86 percent of that number, or 924, full-time
·3· ·equivalents have actually been created.· Many of
·4· ·those projects have opened recently, and they're
·5· ·still in the process of ramping up the full
·6· ·operation.· So we do anticipate that they'll meet
·7· ·or exceed in aggregate their projected targets they
·8· ·reported to CDF.
·9· · · · · · · · · So that works out to about 77 jobs
10· ·per project on average, about 24-1/2 jobs per
11· ·$1 million in net New Markets benefit.· So it's
12· ·about $40,000 per job.
13· · · · · · · · · And these jobs are fairly high
14· ·quality.· The vast majority are full-time; I think
15· ·it's well over 90 percent created to date are full16· ·time.· And the average salary among all the jobs is
17· ·about $45,000 a year.
18· · · · · · · · · You see also on the right side -19· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Excuse me.
20· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Yes.
21· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· When you're talking about
22· ·this, this 45,000, does that include health
23· ·benefits?
24· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· The vast majority of the jobs

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 9

·1· ·have benefits as well.
·2· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· And is that in the 45 -·3· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· No.
·4· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· -- or is that 45 plus
·5· ·health?
·6· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· That's in addition to that.
·7· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Because that's becoming
·8· ·huge as moving forward with the Affordable
·9· ·Healthcare Act and how that relates to
10· ·compensation, benefits, and taxes, you know.· So
11· ·it's just interesting, you know, that this is going
12· ·to become a huge issue in the next couple years.
13· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· We do see typically somewhere in
14· ·the neighborhood of 6 to $7,000 of benefits per
15· ·employee layered onto that salary from the
16· ·borrowers that do offer benefits, which is the vast
17· ·majority.
18· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· And if we were to look at how
19· ·many retained versus created on that chart, what's
20· ·the ballpark?· I mean, I know that Testa was mostly
21· ·retained, right?
22· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Yes.· I'm sorry.· I don't have
23· ·that number at my fingertips.
24· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· What's your gut feeling?· I mean --

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 10

·1· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· I think it's probably -·2· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· 50/50?
·3· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Yeah, 50/50 or maybe 60 percent
·4· ·retained, 40 percent new, somewhere in that range.
·5· ·We'll definitely give you an update on that.· Sorry
·6· ·it's not on here.
·7· · · · · · · · · And then in terms of transactions
·8· ·that are pending -- or, I guess, first going to the
·9· ·right of the Truong transaction, these are all
10· ·projected job outcomes for Mercy Oakwood Shores,
11· ·Chicago Family Health Center, Swedish Covenant, and
12· ·Shankman Orthogenic.· Since these projects are all
13· ·under construction, we don't have actuals yet, but
14· ·there's a significant number of new jobs projected
15· ·from those deals.
16· · · · · · · · · And then further to the right, we
17· ·have the deals that are in closing right now, the
18· ·ACE and Shops and Lofts.· And then on the far
19· ·right, we have our pending deal today, SCR
20· ·Transportation.
21· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· Are why are there no jobs with
22· ·ACE?
23· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Because it's a solar installation
24· ·on a number of rental housing buildings.· ACE has

YVer1f

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012

·1· ·two employees at this point.· It is -- it's kind
·2· ·of a pilot project to launch an energy service
·3· ·company for affordable housing.
·4· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· I thought there would be some
·5· ·maintenance jobs or something created with it; no?
·6· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· There may be.· We're not counting
·7· ·those in the impact.
·8· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· Okay.
·9· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· So that's definitely something -10· ·if it scales over time, we'll definitely have
11· ·measurable outcomes.
12· · · · · · · · · There's also interesting
13· ·construction impacts there where it's teaching
14· ·reconstruction methods to local firms.· But we
15· ·don't -- we're not -- we're only looking at
16· ·permanent jobs in this chart.
17· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· And where is Chicago Family
18· ·Health being constructed at?
19· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· It's 115th and -20· · · · ·MR. WILSON:· It's right by the Sherwin
21· ·Williams plant.
22· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Yes.
23· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· Oh.
24· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Exactly.

·1· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· So off the expressway?
·2· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Right.
·3· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· Yeah, that's right off -·4· ·okay.
·5· · · · ·MS. SANCHEZ:· 115th and Lawrence?
·6· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· 115th and Lawrence, that's what
·7· ·it is.· Thank you, Tracy.
·8· · · · · · · · · Yeah, Sherwin Williams actually gave
·9· ·them that piece of land for their parking lot.
10· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· It's clean and everything?
11· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Yes.
12· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· Who cleaned it?
13· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· I think it was clean when they
14· ·received it.
15· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· Really?· That's great.
16· ·That's great.· Okay.· Thank you.
17· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· In terms of prospects for
18· ·additional credits, Chicago Development Fund, the
19· ·day after -- or actually the day of the last board
20· ·meeting did submit its most recent application for
21· ·more tax credits, requested $100 million, the
22· ·maximum in that 2012 round.
23· · · · · · · · · This is definitely contingent on
24· ·Congressional action to extend the program.· So the

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 13

·1· ·New Markets program, as far as legislative
·2· ·authority, expired at the end of 2011, and CDF
·3· ·received an allocation from that final bucket of
·4· ·authorized credits.
·5· · · · · · · · · So New Markets are among the many,
·6· ·many programs -- you know, wind power, production
·7· ·tax credits, all sorts of -- the AMT patch, I mean,
·8· ·there's all sorts of tax issues that are wrapped up
·9· ·in the fiscal cliff debate that's going on now.
10· · · · · · · · · It's not within my purview or
11· ·ability to predict what's going to happen in the
12· ·next few weeks.· But, you know, generally the
13· ·signals are pretty positive for New Markets.
14· ·There's bipartisan support for the program.
15· · · · · · · · · Prior to the elections, 12 freshman
16· ·House Republicans had signed a support letter for
17· ·reauthorization.· I don't have a count yet of how
18· ·many of them got reelected or not.· But it
19· ·definitely has, you know, support on both sides of
20· ·the aisle.· There have been a lot of great outcomes
21· ·in many, many Congressional districts from the
22· ·program.· And it's a relatively small, inexpensive
23· ·program.· So reasons to be optimistic, but reasons
24· ·to be watchful as well.

Page 14

·1· · · · · · · · · CDF did meet its minimum QEI
·2· ·deployment thresholds to be eligible for this
·3· ·round.· So we see here on the middle of the chart
·4· ·on this page the minimums that were needed to be
·5· ·closed in order for CDF to be eligible for this
·6· ·allocation round; and then on the right side what
·7· ·CDF has actually achieved.
·8· · · · · · · · · So if you may recall, at the last
·9· ·meeting, this board approved a prefunding of the
10· ·Shops and Lofts transaction specifically to meet
11· ·these targets, and that happened on October 29th,
12· ·two days before the deadline.
13· · · · · · · · · In terms of potential projects in
14· ·the pipeline, the pipeline remains pretty
15· ·extensive, pretty robust in terms of total demand
16· ·for allocation.· 24 projects currently in
17· ·discussions or some form of structuring, closing
18· ·application.· So 289.3 million in approximate
19· ·demand for tax credits from those 24 projects.
20· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· But the grocery chain has
21· ·not increased that much, though, has it?
22· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Yeah.· Correct.· On the next
23· ·slide, grocery, there's only three grocery projects
24· ·out of that total number.

·1· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· Is it a -- is it -- do you
·2· ·know if there's a reason why it's struggling so?
·3· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· I think -- you know, I've talked
·4· ·to a number of folks in the New Markets industry.
·5· ·Grocery operators are generally difficult to do New
·6· ·Markets deals with.· They tend to be very cautious
·7· ·about their financing structures.· They can be very
·8· ·focused on operating their business as opposed to
·9· ·the brain damage associated with programs like New
10· ·Markets.
11· · · · · · · · · Nonprofits, on the other hand, are
12· ·very used to jumping through a lot of hoops to get
13· ·money; so they've been heavy users.
14· · · · · · · · · But there's definitely a lot of
15· ·action in the grocery sector across the country in
16· ·New Markets.· There's a lot of policy interest in
17· ·the healthy foods and food desert issue, so ...
18· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· 'Cause that's my reason for
19· ·asking, because in the majority of the food desert,
20· ·with just three, and it's at least 20 that I can
21· ·count in regards to deserts, and development with
22· ·three just doesn't seem to cut it very much.· I'm
23· ·trying to think of how we can give them incentives
24· ·in order to utilize CDF funds.

·1· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· Who are the three from?· Are they
·2· ·from big corporate grocery chains, or are they -·3· ·because my guess is they come -- a big chain like a
·4· ·Dominick's has got its own financial stuff that
·5· ·they do at a corporate level; so finding an
·6· ·individual project for one neighborhood, they're
·7· ·going to be more reluctant.· Can we find smaller
·8· ·companies that are willing to sort of -·9· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· You know, we're trying to do some
10· ·outreach to -- we had some discussion with Pete's
11· ·Produce about their Madison and Western project.
12· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· Yes.· Yeah.
13· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· They ended up deciding, you know,
14· ·couldn't be bothered essentially for New Markets.
15· · · · · · · · · We are trying to get in contact with
16· ·Cermak Produce.
17· · · · · · · · · So, yeah, there's a couple of
18· ·independents that seem like decent prospects in the
19· ·Chicago region.· We have spoken to Save-a-Lot and
20· ·Supervalu at the corporate level.
21· · · · · · · · · I think there may be more
22· ·opportunities with local franchisees.· So we're
23· ·trying to get plugged into that.· In fact, I'd like
24· ·to talk to you, but there's a developer active in

·1· ·your ward that may be doing some of that.· So we
·2· ·should talk.
·3· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· That's why I'm asking,
·4· ·because -·5· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Yeah.
·6· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· -- the bigger guys don't
·7· ·seem to want to really do anything.
·8· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· Yeah.
·9· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· But then when they
10· ·franchise off, then you get more bang for the buck.
11· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Right.
12· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· And hope that we, you know,
13· ·can jumpstart that with the one that we have, you
14· ·know, to do more, because even with that one that
15· ·we have, we still need even more of that, because I
16· ·don't have anything on my east end, which would

·1· ·an employer, this healthcare bill is not
·2· ·affordable.· So the question is, you know -- and
·3· ·it's very complicated.· So, I mean, it's really
·4· ·going to be interesting to see how companies will
·5· ·hire and what kind of people they'll hire and what
·6· ·kind of incentives they will have to hire,
·7· ·because -- you know, we just had our renewal for

10· ·costs or -- kind of the arc is -- it is whatever,
11· ·it's not -- and the reality, it's not doing it.
12· · · · · · · · · I mean, we've got a family of four;
13· ·their healthcare premium now went from 15 to $1900
14· ·a month.· They only make $40,000 a year.· So it's
15· ·hard -- the employee can't afford it and -16· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· And the employer can't afford it,

18· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· -- the employer can't
19· ·afford it.· So what are we going to do?· You know.
20· ·And then they say, Well, there's paperwork for

·7· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· We'll add a little more detail on

10· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Okay.· Let's move on then
11· ·to SCR Medical Transportation.
12· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Very apropos of our discussion
13· ·about jobs and healthcare, by the way.
14· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Well, we think the
15· ·healthcare industry has jobs.
16· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· Yeah, lots of them.
17· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· So SCR is -- it's a local
18· ·Chicago-based firm that's been around since 1986.
19· ·They're based in the Burnside neighborhood down at
20· ·88th and Greenwood.· You may -- much like Testa
21· ·Produce, their vehicles are kind of ubiquitous.
22· ·You probably see their Chrysler minivans that are
23· ·configured as paratransit vehicles all over the
24· ·city.

·1· · · · · · · · · So the project in question here is
·2· ·the site preparation and construction of a new
·3· ·18,000 square foot building to expand their
·4· ·existing facility at 88th and Greenwood.
·5· · · · · · · · · So this would be a number of things
·6· ·for the company, but primarily expanding their call
·7· ·center operations.· There's a lot of call
·8· ·coordination that goes into paratransit scheduling.
·9· ·But also increasing their vehicle capacity and
10· ·their administrative office capacity.
11· · · · · · · · · This is a moving -- the deal's
12· ·moving along fairly well.· It's projected to close
13· ·in early 2013.
14· · · · · · · · · Here's an aerial showing the project
15· ·site contact.· SCR's already located right next
16· ·door to the proposed expansion site in a kind of
17· ·industrial cluster here down at Burnside
18· ·neighborhood just south of 87th Street.
19· · · · · · · · · So they're primarily a paratransit
20· ·provider.· They do provide medical transportation
21· ·as well to the VA Hospital as well as for private
22· ·clients.· But PACE is their primary contracting
23· ·party; that's about 85 percent of their revenue.
24· · · · · · · · · They have a 300-vehicle fleet

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 24

·1· ·primarily minivans.· They already employ 680 full·2· ·time equivalent employees.· 75 percent of that
·3· ·employee base live in Chicago, and 91 percent of
·4· ·that Chicago resident base live in low-income
·5· ·census tracts, primarily South Side.
·6· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· Wow.· That's great.
·7· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· That's super.
·8· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· So they -- their passenger count
·9· ·1.67 million that are provided over 1.3 million
10· ·trips.· So once in a while, you have multiple
11· ·riders per trip.· Usually not.
12· · · · · · · · · Primarily the PACE ridership base -13· ·or the paratransit ridership base they serve is
14· ·also low income since they -- their geography is
15· ·the South Side of Chicago first and foremost.· They
16· ·do provide some service in the south suburbs as
17· ·well.
18· · · · · · · · · And they're kind of bursting at the
19· ·seams.· Paratransit demand in general is going up
20· ·due to an aging population primarily.· But SCR is
21· ·also performing well and anticipates that they may
22· ·be able to compete for an additional share of PACE
23· ·business, which is -- it's re- -- contracts are
24· ·relet periodically.

·1· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· How long is their contract with
·2· ·PACE?
·3· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· I believe it's a three-year
·4· ·contract.
·5· · · · ·MR. HEGARTY:· Goes through 2014.· The
·6· ·original contract was three years, and they've had
·7· ·three extensions.· So it's up for renewal in 2013,
·8· ·2014.
·9· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Right.
10· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· If they lost that contract,
11· ·though, this is -- everything's gone.
12· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Absolutely.· That is precisely
13· ·the -14· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Or change the rules.
15· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Right.
16· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Or the reimbursement.
17· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Yeah.
18· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· And the future of PACE is far
19· ·from certain too.· It's a little scary.
20· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· This particular service they
21· ·provide, it seems like the outlook is stable since
22· ·this is a mandated function of transit agencies
23· ·under ADA.· But certainly we've been in a lot of
24· ·discussion with Bank of America, their senior

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012

·1· ·lender, about the concentration of risk and the
·2· ·PACE contract.· And there's a covenant to the loan
·3· ·if you don't get that contract, then you're in
·4· ·default.· So it's definitely the issue in this
·5· ·contract.
·6· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· I would point out, though -·7· ·or should mention too this is a minority-owned
·8· ·company.· This is exactly the kind of company I
·9· ·think that we want to use New Markets for.
10· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· Oh, yeah.
11· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· It does have a risk, but ...
12· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· They all have risks.· I'm just
13· ·saying it's a little scary.
14· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Yeah.
15· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Sure.· And we've looked at
16· ·available reports on their performance relative to
17· ·the other PACE contractors, and they seem very
18· ·solid.· In fact, their weakest segment is their
19· ·call center operations.· So it seems like they're
20· ·really addressing that with this project.
21· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· And their costs in comparison to
22· ·other PACE -23· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Right in line.
24· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· So it's right in line?

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 27

·1· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Yeah.
·2· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· So it's not like they're -- okay.
·3· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· What is the ratio of this
·4· ·medical versus PACE?· What is -·5· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· He said it's 85 percent of their
·6· ·revenues, right?
·7· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Comes from what?
·8· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· PACE.
·9· · · · ·MR. HEGARTY:· 85 percent comes from contracts
10· ·with PACE.· Then they have relationships with VA
11· ·hospitals.· And they do some private work as well.
12· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Might be -- might be an
13· ·expansion opportunity on the other side.
14· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· Could be.
15· · · · ·MR. HEGARTY:· Yeah.· Then they have
16· ·subsidiaries that are -- or companies related that
17· ·are doing more private contracting work, and
18· ·they're expanding pretty rapidly.· But that's not
19· ·really part of this necessarily.
20· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· So the impacts from the
21· ·transaction, I mean, first and foremost, it's
22· ·expanding an active, successful business in a
23· ·pretty distressed area.· The census tract in
24· ·question has median family income that's only

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012

·1· ·47 percent of the regional median, unemployment
·2· ·rate of over three times the national average, and
·3· ·a poverty rate of over 30 percent.
·4· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· And that's where they're -- that's
·5· ·where this building will be?
·6· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Correct.
·7· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· Okay.
·8· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Yes.· So they're adding a hundred
·9· ·new FTE jobs projected over the next couple of
10· ·years in that specific location.· These jobs are
11· ·also pretty intriguing for New Markets purposes
12· ·because they're accessible jobs.· The barriers to
13· ·entry here are not tremendous in terms of required
14· ·education.· You do have to have a clean driving
15· ·record.· You can't have a felony more recently than
16· ·five years ago.· You have to be drug-free.· But
17· ·that's really the basic qualification.· So really
18· ·accessible jobs.
19· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· And a valid driver's
20· ·license.
21· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Correct.· Yes, you have to know
22· ·how to drive just a little bit.
23· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· And they do the training,
24· ·right?

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 29

·1· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· They do.· Yeah.· $2800 per
·2· ·employee is the typical training expenditure.· So
·3· ·that includes special training on how to handle
·4· ·elderly and medically disabled or special needs
·5· ·passengers as well as getting a commercial driver's
·6· ·license.· So a highly transferable skill set to
·7· ·other fields if you have that CDL license.
·8· · · · · · · · · So they believe they're going to
·9· ·expand their service by 15 percent over the next
10· ·several years to 1.9 million passengers per year.
11· ·They're going to purchase additional vehicles.· In
12· ·fact, they have to reinvest in their fleet pretty
13· ·frequently.· That's part of their sort of capital
14· ·expenditure needs that we're indirectly supporting
15· ·with the CDF transaction.
16· · · · · · · · · As Commissioner Mooney mentioned,
17· ·President and Chairman Mooney mentioned for CDF,
18· ·it's a minority-owned business; in fact, named the
19· ·Outstanding Business of the Year by the Illinois
20· ·Black Chamber of Commerce recently.· And they spend
21· ·about $2 million a year with minority, women-owned,
22· ·and DBE companies in terms of their purchasing as a
23· ·business.
24· · · · · · · · · The deal also has some sustainability

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 30

·1· ·features in terms of cleaning up a vacant,
·2· ·foreclosed site.· That's what they acquired to do
·3· ·this expansion.· It's a LEED building with a green
·4· ·roof and a rain garden.· And they actually recently
·5· ·launched a pilot using compressed natural gas
·6· ·vehicles, only a few in their fleet, but so far
·7· ·it's going well.
·8· · · · · · · · · In terms of the proposed
·9· ·transaction, we have a little bit of a range in
10· ·terms of the amount of allocation CDF would
11· ·provide.· Basically, the appraisal, which is
12· ·pending, is going to be a major factor in this
13· ·transaction.· We've seen this pattern where owner14· ·occupied facilities over the last couple of years
15· ·were appraised out below cost.· So, in turn, banks
16· ·have lending limits that they're going to need to
17· ·put in effect.· In this case, Bank of America will
18· ·only lend 80 percent of the appraised value.· That
19· ·will almost certainly be less than the project
20· ·cost.· So, in turn, that's going to put pressure on
21· ·a New Markets Tax Credit equity and perhaps some
22· ·owner's equity needed to come into the deal.
23· · · · · · · · · So the range that's proposed here
24· ·of 7 to 9 million would be basically calibrated to

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 31

·1· ·make sure that they can build both phases of their
·2· ·project, 8849, which is the new building, and then
·3· ·they want to renovate 8801 South Greenwood, which
·4· ·is their current building.
·5· · · · · · · · · Bank of America is the proposed New
·6· ·Markets investor.· Lot of asterisks on this page
·7· ·since B of A is not an entity CDF has worked with
·8· ·yet, and they have a somewhat different structure,
·9· ·kind of a more classic structure from the early
10· ·days of the New Markets program in terms of how the
11· ·debt flows through.· So we're working through some
12· ·of the details on what the indemnities would need
13· ·to look like from CDF to the investor and what sort
14· ·of rights and remedies in a foreclosure situation.
15· ·So hopefully we'll get there.· So far, so good, but
16· ·the -17· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· But B of A is their current
18· ·lender, corporate lender?
19· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Correct.· Yes.
20· · · · · · · · · And so we're basically -- we're
21· ·seeking flexibility to do it with B of A as the
22· ·primary possibility, but as a backup, if the lender
23· ·ends up being someone else that CDF's worked with
24· ·before, that the approval would cover that too.

·3· ·Very good.
·4· · · · · · · · · Any questions or comments?
·5· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· It sounds like a terrific project.
·6· · · · · · · · · So if they -- if B of A can't come
·7· ·to terms and they move it to JP Chase, whatever -·8· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Or Harris or whatever.
·9· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· -- they'd probably have to move
10· ·their entire banking relationship, I would imagine.
11· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Most likely.
12· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· So that's fairly disruptive to
13· ·their company.· Are they prepared to do that?· Is
14· ·that something -15· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· I don't think they want to.
16· ·We're really just trying to make sure we have a

18· ·unpalatable about the terms B of A requires on the

·5· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Well, it'll be interesting
·6· ·to see if there's some competition.· A lot of these
·7· ·companies, the banks have gotten so big.· You know,
·8· ·B of A used to be LaSalle.· So we knew LaSalle.· We
·9· ·don't know -- we don't have a relationship.
10· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· Right.
11· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· So you talk about business.
12· ·I think you're seeing more of that flow because the
13· ·big banks are getting too big, and they're just -14· ·they don't have that kind of relationships that may
15· ·have originally started.

17· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· Why we're not working with
18· ·smaller banks?
19· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· We work with whoever will do the
20· ·deal.· In this case -- and this answers Lois'
21· ·question as well.· B of A actually brought the deal
22· ·to CDF because they didn't have tax credits
23· ·available from their own allocation to serve this
24· ·transaction.· But they wanted to help the company

·1· ·and thought it would be a good fit, and we agreed.
·2· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· And how many banks have we worked
·3· ·with at this point?
·4· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Investment side, Chase, US Bank,
·5· ·Northern Trust, and PNC.
·6· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· I thought we did an MB as well.
·7· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· On the debt side, yeah.· MB -·8· ·we're actually talking to MB about doing their
·9· ·first investment side deal; that's a couple
10· ·meetings away probably from being ready for
11· ·approval.· But they're interested.
12· · · · · · · · · And then Harris and Private Bank on
13· ·the debt side only.· So far Harris and Private have
14· ·not had appetite to buy the tax credit.· It's
15· ·definitely more the bigger institutions that
16· ·actually want to put the equity side of the deal
17· ·in.· So we've had to sort of mix and match between
18· ·local lenders and national tax credit investors for
19· ·the most part.
20· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· So five on the equity side and an
21· ·additional three or four on the debt side?
22· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Yes.
23· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Tell me about -- because
24· ·it's another intriguing aspect of the owner-

·1· ·occupied valuations and where there might need to
·2· ·be future capital based on this.· Tell me a little
·3· ·bit more about that.
·4· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· So we saw this, for example, in
·5· ·the Truong Enterprises deal where they were
·6· ·building a $10 million facility.· It appraised out
·7· ·at something like $7 million.· The issue being it's
·8· ·very purpose built, it's very configured to that
·9· ·specific end user, and the appraiser has to think
10· ·about if that end user went bankrupt and there was
11· ·a, you know, disposition sale, what's the generic
12· ·end user going to pay for it.· And so they apply a
13· ·discount, particularly in this recession real
14· ·estate climate, for that issue.
15· · · · · · · · · And so in turn, banks typically have
16· ·pretty strict lending limits that keep them below
17· ·80 or 75 percent of appraised value no matter what.
18· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· So that's the Truong.· What
19· ·about this one?
20· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· So similar issue here.· We don't
21· ·know what the appraisal's going to come in at, but
22· ·we strongly suspect it'll come in, you know, maybe
23· ·75 percent of cost or so.· That's what we've been
24· ·seeing.· And so New Markets --

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 36

·1· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· When I look at this
·2· ·refinancing, that's the problem.· You know, when we
·3· ·refinance, your appraisals are not coming out to
·4· ·value, you know, and so you have a combination of
·5· ·trying to get lower interest rates and yet the
·6· ·appraisals are not substantiating their equity.
·7· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· My guess is the refinancing is -·8· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· And so we don't have
·9· ·enough -- you don't have enough equity.· We need
10· ·more equity from you to refinance the loan at a
11· ·more reasonable rate.· So that's the interesting
12· ·crux we have, and that's why I wanted to kind of
13· ·explain that a little bit further.
14· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Sure.
15· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· But the refinancing, I think,
16· ·probably relates to the flow of funds so that you
17· ·don't have different disparate loan agreements.· So
18· ·it's probably an integration of both to make sure
19· ·that they actually hang together, which is pretty
20· ·common when you're doing it.
21· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Yeah, I think they have a small
22· ·loan currently secured by the property that's also
23· ·coming due shortly, and so it just makes sense to
24· ·roll it all together.

·1· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· Right, and have a single loan
·2· ·agreement.
·3· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Which is that 550.
·4· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Correct.
·5· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· That would make sense.
·6· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· But New Markets is actually
·7· ·particularly well designed to deal with that issue
·8· ·because the tax credit equity sort of layers on
·9· ·top of the normal debt in the structure, and CDF
10· ·doesn't have to worry about loan to value
11· ·essentially.· It can just worry about is there
12· ·enough cash flow to service the loan, if the
13· ·company looks viable for the next seven years plus.
14· ·So that's actually kind of the legislative intent
15· ·of the program.· It's worked well in the recession
16· ·actually.
17· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Let me call the question.
18· · · · · · · · · Is there a motion to approve the
19· ·investment in SCR?
20· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Motion.
21· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Moved.
22· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· Second.

·2· · · · · · · · · Thank you.
·3· · · · · · · · · We have one other matter that -·4· ·I'm sorry.· We have, before we get to that, the
·5· ·prefunding for ACE Solar.
·6· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Sure.
·7· · · · · · · · · So this is a question for the board
·8· ·essentially related to competitiveness for CDF.
·9· ·There's an arms race among CDEs out there in terms
10· ·of getting your credits out quickly and positioning
11· ·yourself for another award and another award that's
12· ·of a decent size.· And so deployment rates of the
13· ·tax credits do matter in this discussion.
14· · · · · · · · · So we -- the ACE Solar transaction
15· ·is moving along well towards closing, but it's not
16· ·closed yet.· Probably by year end is a reasonable
17· ·projection.· There may be a meaningful competitive
18· ·benefit for CDF to prefund that transaction to the
19· ·tune of 6-1/4 million during the month of November
20· ·because we have indications from Treasury that
21· ·they're going to take a look at CDEs' deployment
22· ·progress roughly the first week of December, and
23· ·that'll help them make their decisions about who
24· ·gets credits and how much.

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012

·1· · · · · · · · · So we wanted to ask the board if it
·2· ·was willing to think about flexibility to do that,
·3· ·prefunding in November, if it seems like it's
·4· ·prudent competitively for CDF to do that.
·5· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· So if we go back to this page on
·6· ·the benchmarks -·7· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Yes.
·8· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· -- that we need to meet?
·9· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· This is the minimum thresholds.
10· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· Right.· So where would it put us?
11· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· So that would put us -- gosh.· It
12· ·would be all ninth round credits.· So that's -- it
13· ·would be roughly another 10 percent of the ninth
14· ·round allocation.
15· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· To get to 53 percent.
16· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Yeah.
17· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· What are the issues on the
18· ·closing that are delaying the closing?
19· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Well, the main issue is that
20· ·there's 12 existing properties that would be
21· ·receiving rooftop solar installations.· Each of
22· ·those 12 properties has a lender, including the
23· ·City of Chicago, actually, for a couple of the
24· ·buildings.

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 40

·1· · · · · · · · · Those lenders need to sign non·2· ·disturbance agreements saying, you know, if we
·3· ·foreclose on this rental housing building, we won't
·4· ·take the solar equipment too; we'll continue to
·5· ·grant access to ACE to get to the equipment.· So
·6· ·it's essentially inter-creditor transactions
·7· ·between the New Markets transaction and those real
·8· ·estate lenders.· And that's a lot of different
·9· ·signatures and a lot of different explanations that
10· ·ACE has been having to go through.· It's going
11· ·well, but it's taking some time.
12· · · · ·MS. SANCHEZ:· Mostly we're waiting for our
13· ·own law department to tell us whether we -14· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· Can do it.
15· · · · ·MS. SANCHEZ:· -- we're going to need a
16· ·Council action to do it.· We're hoping we don't,
17· ·but we're actually still awaiting to hear back from
18· ·the law department to find out if we do.
19· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· I think I -- these folks told me
20· ·the other day that they heard that they do not,
21· ·but -- I'm hoping they're not just making that up.
22· · · · ·MS. SANCHEZ:· I know staff was still working
23· ·with the different attorneys.
24· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· What's the risk to CDF if

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 41

·1· ·we do the prefunding?
·2· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· So in a prefunding situation, you
·3· ·receive temporary capital from the New Markets
·4· ·investor, you sign an unwind agreement.· What that
·5· ·says is that if the capital is not deployed to a
·6· ·qualified project within a one-year period, the
·7· ·investor can either -- they can take their ball and
·8· ·go home essentially.· And so that means that that
·9· ·6 million of allocation would be gone forever.
10· ·It's probably a significant black eye for CDF.· So
11· ·the ramifications would be serious.
12· · · · · · · · · In general -- and there's never been
13· ·a recapture in the tax credit program.· What
14· ·investors tend to do in this situation is work very
15· ·closely with the CDE to find a replacement deal if
16· ·the primary project doesn't close for some reason.
17· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· So we could substitute
18· ·another deal?
19· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· We could.· Absolutely.· That
20· ·would be plan -- plan A would be to substitute
21· ·rather than unwind.
22· · · · ·MS. SANCHEZ:· And we have approximately a
23· ·year to find another project, correct?
24· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Yes, 12 months.

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 42

·1· · · · ·MS. SANCHEZ:· So we have a year to find
·2· ·another project to invest -·3· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· We have couple hundred million
·4· ·dollar pipeline.· That doesn't seem like a
·5· ·significant risk.
·6· · · · · · · · · But I don't want the Fund to get a
·7· ·giant black eye if they can't close and make sure
·8· ·that we're not harming ourselves for the next
·9· ·round.
10· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Right.
11· · · · · · · · · So the -- so to contrast with the
12· ·Shops and Lofts deal, that was needed to stay
13· ·eligible for this application round.· Prefunding
14· ·ACE would be a bit more aggressive essentially to
15· ·be a bit more competitive for future credits in the
16· ·next round.· So it's definitely optional.· It's
17· ·kind of more about the board's risk tolerance and a
18· ·desire to be maximally competitive.
19· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· So we're 50 percent ahead of
20· ·where they -- the minimum, right?
21· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Um-hmm.
22· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· And is that -- I mean, how
23· ·stellar is that performance if you were to look at
24· ·other entities?· Is that average?· Is it below

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 43

·1· ·average?
·2· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· It's really fantastic for a
·3· ·municipal CDE.· For a national CDE, many of the
·4· ·topflight CDEs that have a national geography have
·5· ·either fully deployed their most recent allocation
·6· ·or they're, you know, 70-plus percent through that
·7· ·with deals in closing for the balance of their
·8· ·credits.· But a local CDE, you really can't match
·9· ·that deployment rate without compromising on the
10· ·quality of the deals.
11· · · · · · · · · So we're trying to strike a balance
12· ·between being a fast deployer, but also being, you
13· ·know, true to the mission.
14· · · · ·MR. LEON:· Can I ask a question?
15· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Sure.· Rafael.
16· · · · ·MR. LEÓN:· This is the Hispanic housing
17· ·transaction, right?
18· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Yes.
19· · · · ·MR. LEÓN:· Do you have any other transactions
20· ·that you can prefund?· Because if I recall
21· ·correctly, these are Low-Income Housing Tax
22· ·Credits, and you will need the approval of the
23· ·limited partners as well to enter into some kind of
24· ·agreement.· It's not just the lenders.

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 44

·1· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Right.
·2· · · · ·MR. LEÓN:· And that may take some time.
·3· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· That's -- I was oversimplifying
·4· ·it.· Indeed, those limited partners are also part
·5· ·of the group that have been asked for their
·6· ·approval.· And it's kind of on the same timeline as
·7· ·the lenders.
·8· · · · ·MR. LEÓN:· Okay.
·9· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· But Rafael asked you a
10· ·question.· Is there another project in the pipeline
11· ·we could prefund?
12· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· I mean, there's nothing far
13· ·enough along with -- you know, PNC committed as the
14· ·investor.· That would make -- I mean -- well, I
15· ·guess to clarify, when you prefund a transaction,
16· ·nothing legally ties those dollars to the
17· ·transaction unless and until you close the full
18· ·loan to the project.· But really it's when you
19· ·discuss prefunding with an investor, they like to
20· ·have a deal that they have pending with you that's
21· ·in documentation in mind when you do the
22· ·prefunding.
23· · · · · · · · · So really ACE is the only
24· ·transaction that we could conceivably prefund.· In

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 45

·1· ·some cases, CDEs take blind prefundings when they
·2· ·don't have an end deal in mind.· That's really not
·3· ·recommended for a local CDE or a government·4· ·affiliated CDE.· So really ACE would be the only
·5· ·option for CDF.
·6· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· In your mind, how important
·7· ·would it be come December that we have the -- move
·8· ·up to the 53 percent?· How many more points would
·9· ·it give?
10· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· I wish I knew.· I mean, it's very
11· ·hard to decipher what kind of formula the CDFI fund
12· ·looks for.· It's basically how much allocation they
13· ·think you need.· And it's based on reading your
14· ·application, looking at your past track record, gut
15· ·feeling kind of thing.· That's the best indication
16· ·we have.
17· · · · · · · · · But they have made it clear they
18· ·look at QEI deployment.· They don't track the
19· ·deployment of the dollars down to the projects for
20· ·this specific decision that they make.· So
21· ·prefunding is definitely something that they
22· ·reaffirm that -- their scoring essentially takes
23· ·that into account, prefunding.
24· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· I'd be -- I guess over 50 percent

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

Page 46

·1· ·done is a -- it's certainly a nice round number
·2· ·when you're looking at something like that in the
·3· ·first year effectively of funding.· I'd be
·4· ·favorably inclined to grant it given that we could
·5· ·find a substitute project within 12 months.· It's a
·6· ·fairly long way with a $250 million pipeline
·7· ·backing it up.
·8· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· PNC has a tremendous community
·9· ·reinvestment appetite in the City of Chicago.· I
10· ·mean, they're really eager to do more deals here.
11· ·So I have a feeling that a substitute transaction
12· ·could be located if needed.
13· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Okay.
14· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· So tell me the worst case
15· ·scenario.
16· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· So worst case scenario is that we
17· ·get to -- you know, it's actually probably more
18· ·like 18 months from the prefunding and haven't
19· ·found a transaction because there's a six-month,
20· ·one-time cure period that's available in the tax
21· ·code.· Nobody likes to rely on that, but ...
22· · · · · · · · · So 12 to 18 months after the prefund
23· ·we haven't found a deal, the investor could either
24· ·just take the allocation essentially and push money

·1· ·down to whatever project they want, or they could
·2· ·unwind the qualified equity investment.
·3· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· And, I'm sorry, Rafael,
·4· ·would you explain what your concern is?
·5· · · · ·MR. LEÓN:· Sometimes getting approval from
·6· ·the limited partners in a low-income housing tax
·7· ·credit transaction takes some time.· It's not just
·8· ·contacting any -- or one of the institutions and
·9· ·getting an approval.· So that they have to consult
10· ·with the limited partners.· And there are a lot of
11· ·banks and investors that get involved in that.· So
12· ·the question is whether they will do it efficiently
13· ·and quickly.· Sometimes they do, sometimes they
14· ·don't.
15· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· That would definitely be one of
16· ·the practical considerations before pulling the
17· ·trigger on prefunding is making sure we had, you
18· ·now, a detailed understanding of how far along
19· ·those conversation are, how close they are to
20· ·signing the document.
21· · · · ·MR. LEÓN:· And also make sure that it doesn't
22· ·affect the tax credits.

·1· · · · ·MR. LEÓN:· Yeah.
·2· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· It wouldn't.· I mean, there's no
·3· ·co-mingling of basis.· And that's really the only
·4· ·restriction here in this.· This is totally funded
·5· ·with non-LIHTC capital.
·6· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· This one's not as clear to
·7· ·me as perhaps the others in part because of the
·8· ·caution that Rafael raised.· And I'm -- I'm erring
·9· ·on the side of caution on this one, I think, more
10· ·so.· I like Lois' aggressive stance on this, but I
11· ·think I'm a little cautious because we're dealing
12· ·with six buildings and multiple parties.· If it was
13· ·one building and two or three parties, it would be
14· ·a different matter.· But I'm just a little worried
15· ·about getting ourselves overcommitted.
16· · · · · · · · · So I think on this one, I would
17· ·prefer to hold back.· But I'll do whatever the
18· ·board ...
19· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· But let's explore that.
20· · · · · · · · · So we hold back, and at what point
21· ·do we know whether they're going to close?
22· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· I mean, the closer you get to
23· ·closing, the more certainty you feel.· I think that
24· ·we would certainly want to know the status of all

·1· ·of those agreements with the existing investors and

·5· ·It's really just a ministerial matter of getting

·7· ·threshold for doing this.
·8· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· So perhaps we need a little bit
·9· ·more information then to get to that comfort zone
10· ·in terms of where they are.
11· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Why don't -- if the board's
12· ·comfortable with this, why don't we -- why don't

·4· ·issues -- employment policy issues of the

·6· · · · · · · · · So at the direction of the board, we
·7· ·stepped back.· We asked our law department to work

21· ·you don't, I think Tony has extra copies here.
22· · · · · · · · · So the policy as stated here, which
23· ·can also, of course, in the future be changed from
24· ·time to time depending on further practice and

·1· ·further experience, but at the moment this is
·2· ·largely based on the precedence that we have had
·3· ·prior to North Park.
·4· · · · · · · · · I have discussed this and run it by
·5· ·the president at North Park University.· They
·6· ·understand that this would likely prohibit them
·7· ·from their own perspective in pursuing the
·8· ·application.· They will be able to do the project.
·9· ·They'll have to finance it in a -- either out of
10· ·their pocket or with using some tax credits from
11· ·another provider.· But they are aware of it, and
12· ·they understand the issues.
13· · · · · · · · · So I have discussed it with them in
14· ·quite a bit of detail.
15· · · · · · · · · Tony, do you want to add anything?
16· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· I guess I can give a quick
17· ·summary of the gist of the policy.· I would say
18· ·that for those that were on this body back during
19· ·the Kroc Center approval, this is designed to sort
20· ·of ratify the framework that was used there, kind
21· ·of put it more into a policy that can be applied to
22· ·future deals.
23· · · · · · · · · Basically, there's three components
24· ·to the antidiscrimination policy.· As a given, just

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 53

·1· ·compliance with applicable law.· That's just kind
·2· ·of just to get that out of the way.
·3· · · · · · · · · But employment nondiscrimination -·4· ·so this policy relies on this concept of ministry
·5· ·positions.· So, for example, in the Kroc Center
·6· ·transaction, the Salvation Army covenanted that no
·7· ·more than 20 percent of the employees in the
·8· ·facility would be ministry positions, meaning
·9· ·essentially that under First Amendment protections,
10· ·they do have the right to discriminate broadly
11· ·primarily based on religion, but anything that's
12· ·tied to religion.· So that can include sexual
13· ·orientation, probably family structure, family
14· ·status, issues like that.· But that that -- the
15· ·ability to discriminate on that basis will be
16· ·limited to a defined percentage of the employees.
17· · · · · · · · · What this policy says is that CDF's
18· ·board has to think that that percentage is
19· ·reasonable for what the facility is, that it's not
20· ·excessive.
21· · · · · · · · · And so I guess just to tie it back
22· ·to the North Park transaction, essentially they
23· ·would have had to define over 80 percent of their
24· ·positions as ministry positions.· It's based on how

YVer1f

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012
Page 54

·1· ·the university likes to tie their educational
·2· ·mission to the religious grounding.· And I would
·3· ·not anticipate that this board would think that's a
·4· ·proportion it can live with.· So that's employment.
·5· · · · · · · · · On the user perspective, generally
·6· ·CDF is funding facilities that are open to the
·7· ·public in some fashion.· So the borrower must agree
·8· ·that the facility is open to all and not discriminate
·9· ·on usage rights based on any protected class as
10· ·defined in the Chicago human rights ordinance.
11· ·They can put limited operational guidelines that
12· ·are consistently applied among all users without
13· ·regard to protected class status; so things like no
14· ·religious ceremonies other than the sponsoring
15· ·denomination, no electioneering, no lobbying.· So
16· ·these are things that many 501(c)3s, regardless of
17· ·religiously affiliated or not, will be very
18· ·cautious about those issues on their facility.
19· · · · · · · · · So, again, that's something
20· ·Salvation Army negotiated.· They didn't want -21· ·they didn't want to have to allow political events
22· ·to happen on site, so they wanted to keep certain
23· ·carveouts.
24· · · · · · · · · And then finally as far as -- no, I

 · Deposition of HEARING· , 11/13/2012

·1· ·guess those are the three.· It's really the user
·2· ·population, the events on site, and the employment
·3· ·are really the three buckets that are covered here.
·4· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· I want to make really sure that
·5· ·we're being consistent with everyone.· So Christ
·6· ·the King, is that boys only?
·7· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· No, it's coed.
·8· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· All right.
·9· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· So what is the recommendation?
10· ·I mean, especially going back to the Swedish
11· ·Covenant, so that makes that deal fall apart?
12· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· No, no.· The North Park
13· ·University.
14· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· North Park.
15· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Swedish has -16· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· Oh, the North Park?
17· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Um-hmm.· That -- most
18· ·likely they would withdraw their application then
19· ·as a result of this.
20· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· It would have to be.
21· · · · ·MS. SANCHEZ:· Because they get -- with
22· ·Salvation Army, 20 percent of their -23· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· So how does that affect our
24· ·performance?

·1· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· We had not included them in
·2· ·the pipeline.
·3· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· Right.
·4· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· In view of what we expected
·5· ·to happen.
·6· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· It's a shame.· But a good project
·7· ·in conflict with our core values.· It's a shame.
·8· ·It really was an important neighborhood development.
·9· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Well, the project itself,
10· ·I'm over 90 percent certain, is going to move
11· ·ahead.· In fact, I think they're already in for
12· ·permitting.· So it was -- this was a -- if you
13· ·recall from the presentation, it would have either
14· ·been New Market Tax Credits or out of their
15· ·endowment or a substitute New Markets Tax Credit
16· ·provider, which we also tried to help out on.
17· · · · · · · · · So the project itself will go ahead.
18· ·It's just that, again, as you say, it's unfortunate
19· ·that because of the way they define themselves
20· ·versus the way we define our policy that it's
21· ·unlikely that they would be able to apply and pass
22· ·the policy.
23· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· As I recall, this was a school
24· ·that served predominantly first-time college

·1· ·students in low-income areas, and it was going
·2· ·to -- if they use the endowment for it, they'll
·3· ·have less ability to provide scholarships to that
·4· ·population.
·5· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· This is not a -- this is a
·6· ·Hobson's choice.
·7· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· It is a Hobson's choice.
·8· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· They -- yeah.· And they would
·9· ·have passed the user test with flying colors.· In
10· ·other words, they don't discriminate on their
11· ·admissions policy.· So it's primarily the
12· ·employment issue where they were just really not
13· ·structurally compatible with this.
14· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· One of the reasons, of
15· ·course, for having this policy is that as
16· ·applicants come in the door, we want them to be
17· ·aware at the very beginning rather than at the end,
18· ·and so this would provide us with a screen.
19· · · · ·MS. SCOTT:· And they're one, I was going to
20· ·say, they found out at the end.
21· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· And they did.
22· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· It's not going backwards,
23· ·though; it's just only going forward?
24· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Going forward.

·1· · · · ·MS. SANCHEZ:· And just so we have a written
·2· ·policy in our framework of operations.· If anybody
·3· ·asks us, we can just give this to them.· So, you
·4· ·know, from the minute they start the conversation
·5· ·with us, we can clearly tell them this is our
·6· ·policy instead of having -·7· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· So it has to be a
·8· ·reasonable percentage.
·9· · · · ·MS. SANCHEZ:· Right.
10· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· And not whatever is
11· ·reasonable to them.
12· · · · ·ALDERMAN AUSTIN:· The majority -13· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Right.
14· · · · ·MR. SMITH:· That's where the board's
15· ·discretion really comes in, is you look at the
16· ·ministry positions versus non-ministry and decide
17· ·if you think that the community benefit is broad
18· ·enough and significant enough that it outweighs the
19· ·employment -- the discrimination rights that they
20· ·have on certain employment.
21· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Any further discussion?
22· · · · ·ALDERMAN TUNNEY:· So we -- the motion is to
23· ·adopt this?
24· · · · ·CHAIRMAN MOONEY:· Correct.
