A RESOLUTION DIRECTING NEW REVENUE FROM LOLLAPALOOZA TICKETS SALES
TO FUND YOUTH SUMMER JOBS WITHIN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, according to the United States Census Bureau, the youth labor force, sharply increases
between April and July each year. During these months, large numbers of high school and college
students pursue and obtain summer jobs, and many graduates enter the labor market for work experience
that later contributes to the beginnings of their professional careers. Last summer, the youth labor force
grew by 2.4 million, or 11.8 percent; and,
WHEREAS, for every willing young person, a summer job is sometimes the first step in the transition to
adulthood, that encourages independence and self-reliance. For children and young people living in

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2012
poverty and in other disadvantaged situations, employment is often the only path for attaining a better life
and away from neighborhood violence; and,
WHEREAS, data from the 2010 American Community Survey and U.S. Census show teen employment
has fallen to 26 percent nationally, from 45 percent in 1999-2000, the lowest rate since World War II. In
Illinois, teen employment has fallen 22.2 percentage points, putting the state among the 10 worst states in
the country for rate of decrease during that period; and,
WHEREAS, according to the Alternative Schools Network, “African American teens in the city of
Chicago face the toughest picture, with only 10 percent of them employed, including 7.4 percent of those
from families with incomes under $40,000, while middle- and upper-middle-income whites were nearly
four times as likely to hold a job;” and,
WHEREAS, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and Mayor Rahm Emanuel recently
announced One Summer Plus, a partnership with Cook County, City of Chicago departments and
community groups to lay a foundation for bright futures ahead specifically aimed at youth who are at
increased risk of exposure to violence due to the communities where the crime rates are traditionally
higher and/or incidents of violent crimes are much greater, especially during the summer months.
WHEREAS, The PLUS program is focused on providing opportunities to at least 500 youth from
Morgan Park, Julian, Hyde Park, Simeon, Dunbar, Robeson, Gage Park, Orr, Kenwood, Harlan, Farragut,
Fenger, and Marshall high schools; and,
WHEREAS, an amendment sponsored by Commissioners Gainer, Collins, Gorman, Murphy and Sims to
the Amusement Tax Ordinance approved and adopted on February 1, 2012 which closed a tax loophole
that had been providing outdated exceptions has since generated over $150,000 for the County in revenue;
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the unanticipated funds received by the County as a
result of the recent amendment to the Amusement Tax Ordinance be used to hire more young people for
summer jobs within the One Summer Chicago Plus program for Summer 2012.

WHEREAS, since Brookfield Zoo opened on July 1, 1934, the Chicago Zoological Society has cared for
more than 115,000 animals at the zoo; and
WHEREAS, animals at Brookfield Zoo can live long and enriched lives because of the Chicago
Zoological Society’s role as a global leader in the field of animal welfare; and

from the zoo’s original 1934 collection; and
WHEREAS, Cookie is a Major Mitchell’s cockatoo who came to Brookfield Zoo from the Taronga Zoo
in Australia as part of the Chicago Zoological Society’s original 1934 animal collection; and
WHEREAS, Cookie is turning an astounding 79 years of age this year and will have a birthday
celebration on Saturday, June 30, 2012 at Brookfield Zoo; and
WHEREAS, the festivities get underway at 10:30 a.m. at the zoo’s Reptiles and Birds exhibit. There,
guests can join zoo staff in singing a rousing chorus of “Happy Birthday” to the birthday bird. For a treat,
Cookie will receive a birthday cake made of his favorite foods. In addition, guests will have the
opportunity to send birthday wishes and greetings to Cookie by signing an enormous birthday card; and
WHEREAS, as the world’s oldest Major Mitchell’s cockatoo and as Brookfield Zoo’s most famous

called “Cookie’s Groupies”; and
WHEREAS, although Cookie has been retired for three years, he makes an annual appearance for his
fans on his big day each year; and

URGING GOVERNOR PAT QUINN AND THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO LOOK
AT MEDICAID SAVINGS ALTERNATIVES
WHEREAS, the health care needs of the residents of Cook County are provided for by a safety network
of hospitals comprised of Medicaid safety net hospitals, children’s hospitals, public hospitals, academic
medical centers and community hospitals; and
WHEREAS, this hospital safety network also provides financial support and services to a variety of
community health care clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers to further meet the health care
needs of the county’s residents; and
WHEREAS, in a time of economic instability, hospitals support one of Illinois’ economic engines,
employing directly and indirectly over 407,000 people and driving more than $78 billion in economic
stimulus in the State of Illinois; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners recognizes that hospitals are strong anchors of
their communities, directly and indirectly supporting nearly 277,000 jobs in the Chicago metropolitan
area; and
WHEREAS, Medicaid spending in Illinois is financially not sustainable and must change; and
WHEREAS, Governor Pat Quinn has proposed to balance the State of Illinois budget by cutting
Medicaid by $2.7 billion threatening this critical program, which is a lifeline to hospitals and many
residents of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, further cuts to hospital reimbursement could reduce access to care to some of Cook
County’s most vulnerable patient populations, including the elderly, disabled, children and destitute; and,
WHEREAS, cutting Medicaid reimbursement will not only jeopardize the provision of services, but also
the jobs of those who provide them; and
WHEREAS, hospitals have identified nearly $1.4 billion in savings available to the State from hospital
Medicaid programs and policies; and
WHEREAS, the hospital community understands the budget crisis facing the State and has adopted these
cost-saving alternatives as a shared position; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2012
WHEREAS, Governor Quinn and the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS), in
collaboration with the Cook County Board of Commissioners and the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System (CCHHS) has requested an 1115 waiver from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS), to cover the current uninsured population that will become eligible for Medicaid in 2014; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners is concerned for the physical and economic
health and well-being of the citizens of Cook County and the State of Illinois.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that state legislators and hospitals work together to find
solutions that will not impact patient care or jeopardize access to health care for the State’s most
underserved communities while maintaining the financial health of hospitals; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that it is incumbent on the State of Illinois to enact operational and
eligibility reforms before reducing hospital and physician rates that will result in immediate job cuts and a
reduction in access to care for society’s neediest members; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Illinois General Assembly take action to pass the state plan
amendment to the existing Hospital Assessment program and the 1115 waiver request that will bring in
additional revenue through Federal match; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners call upon Governor
Quinn to proceed expeditiously to achieve any savings identified by Illinois hospitals in their list of
“potential Medicaid Savings Alternatives” and to identify and implement any other systematic savings
available to the Medicaid program; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution is spread upon the official
proceedings of this Honorable Body and that an official copy of the same be tendered to Governor Pat
Quinn and the members of the Illinois State General Assembly.

Exhibit A
Agreement between the President and the Mayor
Term Sheet

Purpose
Describe agreements between the President and the Mayor with respect to the new Local
Workforce Investment Board (the “LWIB”) to be established pursuant to WIA.
Parties The President and the Mayor.
Establishment of LWIB
The parties acknowledge and agree that the LWIB has been certified by the Governor as the
LWIB for Local Workforce Investment Area 7 (“LWIA 7”) and that the membership of the LWIB as set
forth in the LWIB Bylaws (the “LWIB Bylaws”) have been approved by the State and DOL
.
Appointment of LWIB Members
The parties have the exclusive responsibility to appoint members
to the LWIB from the individuals recommended or nominated pursuant to the appointment process set
forth in the LWIB Bylaws.
Cooperation with LWIB
The parties will cooperate with the LWIB as required by WIA, in areas
that may include, without limitation, (a) local plan development and submission; (b) selection of one-stop
operators and other service providers; (c) approval of the LWIB’s budget; (d) WIA program oversight;
and (e) appointment of the youth council; (f) agreement on the memorandum of understanding.
Cooperation with the Governor and the State The parties will cooperate with the LWIB in

Role of the Partnership
The parties agree that the Partnership shall be designated as the fiscal
agent with respect to WIA funding for LWIA 7 and function as the administrative entity for LWIA 7.
The Partnership shall be designated as the grant recipient under the WIA for LWIA 7 and that WIA Title I
funds will flow from the State directly to the Partnership.
The Partnership will engage third-party providers (e.g. delegate agencies) to provide direct services. The
Partnership itself will not provide direct services. In addition, the Partnership will support the work of the
LWIB.
The parties agree that they will enter into all necessary agreements with the State with respect to such
WIA funding and that all such grant provisions will be jointly and severally binding on the President and
the Mayor.
Partnership performance measures The Partnership would be required to meet County targets and
City targets (based on the prior three years’ performance) in categories such as entered employment rate
(both as a percentage of clients served and per $1 million in WIA funds), employment retention, average

Between themselves, the County and the City would agree to allocate disallowed costs and other
liabilities as follows: (a) those incurred by delegate agencies relating to direct client services would be

the Partnership, and any other disallowed costs not described in (a), would be charged equally to the
Count and the City.

Partnership’s key executives; (c) inform DCEO that they have decided to appoint a different fiscal agent
and grant recipient, or (d) seek automatic designation as an LWIA with the support of the other party,
which would result in separate LWIAs for each of the County and the City.
Bylaws The agreement would include as attachments forms of Bylaws as described below:

Mayor and the President all grant funds associated with Title I of the WIA for LWIA 7 from the State,
including funds available under the Trade Adjustment Act (TAA).

State for any misspent WIA funds or disallowed costs under WIA.
The President and the Mayor delegate to the Partnership the power and responsibility to enter into
contracts, subcontracts, and other agreements, to receive, expend, and distribute funds, to develop and

WIA requirements, the service provider’s negligence, the service provider’s failure to follow accepted
standards of financial management or other failures by the service provider to safeguard WIA funds on
behalf of the President and the Mayor.
If any costs are disallowed, the Partnership will reimburse the President and the Mayor on behalf of the
County and the City for all such disallowed costs and must repay these costs with non-Federal sources of
funds.

risks and to indemnify the County and the City for such risks.

Resolution sponsored by John A. Fritchey, County Commissioner.

Submitting a Proposed

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
COOK COUNTY CEMETERY
WHEREAS, recent events as well as investigations by the Cook County Sheriff have brought into serious
question and unfortunate light, the manner by which the Cook County’s indigent, unclaimed and
unknown individuals have been buried; and
WHEREAS, disturbing practices have included persons stacked eight coffins high, bodies placed in
coffins with unidentified limbs and skeletal remains from other bodies, medical waste and non-human

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2012
debris, and coffins buried haphazardly in a manner making future location for personal or law
enforcement purposes, difficult if not impossible; and
WHEREAS, such practices not only demonstrate an unacceptable lack of respect for the least fortunate
among us and are unbecoming of a civilized society, but additionally impede ongoing criminal
investigations in cases of unknown decedents, as the identifying characteristics of hundreds of
unidentified remains buried by the County have failed to be entered into the NCIC (National Crime
Information Center), the nationally recognized database for tracking crime-related information; and
WHEREAS, the discovery of the above-mentioned practices led to the introduction and passage of an
ordinance on May 4, 2011, setting new standards and safeguards for the manner in which burials of the
indigent, unclaimed and unknown are handled in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, said ordinance clarified the role and responsibilities of the Office of the Medical Examiner
in preparing the bodies for burial as well as the methods by which burials are to be conducted by
cemeteries that have contracts with the county for such burials; and
WHEREAS, this Government is ultimately responsible for these individuals, and consequently it is the in
the best interest of the County and its residents for the County to once again operate a cemetery for the
burial of our County’s indigent, unclaimed and unknown persons; and
WHEREAS, for over a century, from 1854-1971, Cook County operated, maintained and administered its
own cemetery, the most recent site having been located on the land adjacent to the Oak Forest Hospital,
known as the Cook County Cemetery for the Indigent, where tens of thousands of individuals have
previously been laid to rest; and
WHEREAS, the reestablishment of a permanent Cook County Cemetery would not only ensure that our
indigent are put to rest in a respectful manner, but it would also facilitate proper documentation for law
enforcement purposes, proper maintenance, as well as save the County millions of dollars; and
WHEREAS, with the use of approximately 5 acres of land contiguous to the location of the former Cook
County Cemetery for the Indigent, the County could establish a cemetery capable of meeting the needs of
the County for the next 100 years; and
WHEREAS, the aforesaid land is presently owned and maintained by the Forest Preserve District of Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, since the Forest Preserve acquired said cemetery, no plan for addressing the former cemetery
site has been forthcoming, and as such, ample opportunity still exists to determine a proper use of that
parcel and the surrounding areas; and
WHEREAS, there exist several precedents for the co-existence of cemeteries on Forest Preserve property,
including Bachelors Grove Cemetery, Sauerbier-Burkhardt Cemetery and the above-mentioned Cook
County Cemetery for the Indigent; and
WHEREAS, the County Highway Department already owns the equipment necessary to operate and
maintain such a cemetery; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Sheriff has expressed a willingness and ability to provide sufficient labor
necessary to operate and maintain such a cemetery; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2012
WHEREAS, based upon anticipated costs for the currently mandated indigent burial program, the
reestablishment of a County cemetery can reasonably expect to save Cook County taxpayers in excess of
$175 million over the next 100 years.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the Office
of the Medical Examiner, the Office of the Cook County Sheriff, the Cook County Bureau of
Administration, the Cook County Real Estate Management Division, the Cook County Highway
Department, the Forest Preserve District of Cook County and any other agency deemed necessary are
hereby directed to cause a plan to be completed and presented to the Board of Commissioners for the
reestablishment of a Cook County Cemetery at the aforementioned site for the purpose of indigent,
unclaimed and unknown burials; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that said plan shall include the creation of an intergovernmental
agreement between the County of Cook and the Forest Preserve District of Cook County to locate said
cemetery on the 5 acres to the immediate west of the old Cook County Cemetery for the Indigent; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that said intergovernmental agreement shall stipulate that the
reestablished Cook County Cemetery shall remain Forest Preserve property in order to ensure its
permanency; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that said plan shall provide the structure by which the affected agencies
shall coordinate and delegate responsibilities in order to establish, operate and maintain such a cemetery;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the results of the aforementioned plan shall be delivered to the Cook
County Board of Commissioners no later than August 1, 2012, with an implementation date of January 1,
2013.
Effective Date: This Resolution shall be effective upon passage.

DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
2012 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CDBG AND ESG PROJECTS, AND THE PROPOSED USE
OF HOME FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 15, 2012 from
HERMAN BREWER, Chief, Bureau of Economic Development
transmitted herewith are the proposed uses for the 2012 Program Year for the Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG); Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) (formerly known as the Emergency Shelter
Grant); and HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) programs as well as specific project
recommendations for CDBG. These funds are provided to Cook County via an annual formula grant
through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and are restricted for use within
Suburban Cook County. The Cook County Community Development Advisory Council (CDAC) adopted
these recommendations at a public hearing held on May 10, 2012.
The 2012 Program Year CDBG allocation is $9,318,878.00. Related project funding requests exceeded
$20,000,000.00. The proposed uses of CDBG funds will benefit low- and moderate- income persons as
detailed in the enclosed project recommendations.
The 2012 Program Year ESG allocation is $767,133.00. The proposed uses of ESG funds include the
provision of essential services, support of maintenance/operations costs for homeless shelters, and
assistance for homelessness prevention. Given the ongoing HUD transition of the ESG program from the
Emergency Shelter Grant to the Emergency Solutions Grant model including changing rules and
regulations, the Cook County release of a request for applications has been temporarily placed on hold.
Therefore, ESG project recommendations are not provided at this time.
The 2012 Program Year HOME allocation is $3,677,940.00. The proposed uses of HOME funds include
program administration and affordable housing development for the benefit of low-income persons.
Given the cyclical nature of affordable housing development, HOME project applications are accepted
throughout the year and presented to the Board for review and approval as required. No HOME project
recommendations are provided at this time.
The proposed uses of all program funds including project recommendations for CDBG will be
incorporated into the County’s Annual Action Plan which will be made available for public comment
prior to submittal to HUD by August 15, 2012.
I respectfully request approval of the recommended proposed uses and project recommendations as
specified for the 2012 CDBG, ESG, and HOME funds; and that the Bureau Chief of Economic
Development or his/her designee be authorized to execute, on behalf of the County of Cook any and all
documents necessary to further the programs approval herein, including but not limited to, subrecipient
agreements, intergovernmental agreements, amendments, and modifications thereto, loan documents, lien
assignments, releases of mortgages and liens, and mortgage assumptions.
