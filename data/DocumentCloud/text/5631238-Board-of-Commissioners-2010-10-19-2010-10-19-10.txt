GENERAL BACKGROUND
The Habitat Company (“Habitat”), the court-appointed Gautreaux Development Manager, on behalf of
the Chicago Housing Authority (“CHA”), issued a Request For Qualifications for a Master Developer
and Property Management Team for the Redevelopment of the Julia C. Lathrop Homes to lead its multi-year, multi-phase redevelopment, in order to achieve the vision of the Lathrop Homes Working
Group. The Working Group’s vision is for sustainable affordability and opportunity in the heart of
Chicago that develops a large scale mixed-income community that achieves LEED for Neighborhood
Development Gold or Platinum level certification.

 The RFQ sought firms with demonstrated experience and expertise in:
 Sustainable Development -- especially LEED for Neighborhood Development and Clean Technology
 Affordable Housing Development – especially in the development of large-scale mixed-income,
mixed-use housing developments and HUD mixed finance regulations
 Community Development Planning – especially those with demonstrated ability to manage an
open, public planning process with a wide range of participants
 Redevelopment of Historic Properties - including use of Historic Preservation Tax Credits
 Residential Property Management – especially large mixed-income developments
 Supportive Services – especially services aimed at low-income families
 Job Creation – a proven track record of consistent Section 3 resident hiring and providing
business opportunities to MBE/WBE/DBE certified firms
 Accessibility – expertise in ADA/ Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards according to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973
The RFQ specified that the redevelopment scope must provide both ownership and rental on the site of
the present Julia C. Lathrop Homes property. In addition, it must provide appropriate space for existing on-site community institutions, including the Mary Crane Community Center and Daniel Cotter
Boys & Girls Club or successor institutions. CHA has committed to return 400 public housing rental
units which are to be no more than one-third of the total units of the development.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
Habitat advertised the Request for Qualifications (the “RFQ”) on January 7, 2010 for a Master Developer and Property Management Team for the Redevelopment of the Julia C. Lathrop Homes. Habitat
advertised the RFQ in the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Defender, Hoy, and on the United States Green
Building Council Chicago Chapter and CHA websites. Habitat also directly solicited two hundred thirty one (231) firms, including twenty-three (23) assist agencies. A Pre-Submittal Conference was held
on January 20, 2010. An email to everyone who filed a Notice of Intent to Respond was issued on February 11, 2010 to respond to vendor Requests for Information and to announce a deadline for all final
questions of February 22, 2010. Habitat received six (6) proposals on March 8, 2010.
The Evaluation Committee, comprised of members of the Lathrop Homes Working Group, reviewed
the proposals and developed its recommendation to CHA/Habitat based on the criteria and requirements outlined in the RFQ. The Evaluation Committee reviewed and scored the proposals, and Habitat
determined that five (5) of the Respondents were within the Competitive Range. Each of the five (5)
teams made oral presentations. Upon further consideration of each Respondent following the presentations, the Evaluation Committee recommended that the highest-ranked team be asked to lead an open
community planning process for the redevelopment of Lathrop Homes. LCP was the highest ranked
team based on the Evaluation Committee scoring of the qualifications criteria. The second- and thirdranked teams have also been identified, in the event negotiations with the highest-ranked team do not
conclude with an executed MDA.
The Execution of a Master Development Agreement is subject to the Developer’s compliance with
CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA for the Board of Commissioners to approve
the recommended Development Team, Lathrop Community Partners (LCP), and to authorize the Chief
Executive Officer or his designee to enter into negotiations for a Master Development Agreement
(MDA) and initiate revitalization planning for Lathrop Homes.
