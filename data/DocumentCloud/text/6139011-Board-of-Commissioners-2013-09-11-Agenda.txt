The City will retain legal counsel and pay all costs for tax deeds. The City will report as required to the
Cook County Bureau Economic Development annually from the date of sale on each parcel for five (5)
years or until the development is completed. If a City of Harvey lien is cleared by the no cash bid, the
City agrees to this in that the future redevelopment is more valuable to the City than the cost of the
municipal lien. If a Cook County lien is on a parcel, the City agrees to reinstate the lien after the tax sale
for the County with an intergovernmental agreement to be recorded.

PROPOSED CONTRACT
ITEM #24
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 21, 2013 from
CARL R. BYRD, Acting Chief Administrative Officer
and
SHANNON E. ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute Contract No. 13-8412815 with Konica Minolta Business Solutions U.S.A., Inc., Ramsey, New Jersey, for the leasing of 325
multifunction photocopiers on a cost per copy basis. All County departments participate in the
photocopier leasing program. The following offices will be receiving equipment from this contract:
Office of the Chief Judge, Clerk of the Circuit Court, Office of the Sheriff, Forest Preserve District of
Cook County, and various offices under the President. All equipment will be capable of network printing,
faxing and scanning. Cost per copy includes the use of the equipment, maintenance services and all
supplies (excluding paper).
Reason:

Four (4) bids were received and opened on August 9, 2013. Konica Minolta Business
Solutions U.S.A., Inc. was the lowest, qualified bidder meeting specifications. It has been
determined that leasing of multifunction photocopier equipment saves the County an average
of $1,000,000.00 annually versus purchasing and maintaining the same equipment.
Additionally, photocopier leasing contracts allow the County to keep up with technology by
replacing the equipment every five (5) years. Finally, multifunction photocopier equipment
allows departments to eliminate stand alone printers and fax machines which reduce capital,
maintenance and supply costs.
This contract will replace an existing multifunction photocopier contract which will expire on
November 1, 2013. The new contract has a savings of $224,616.00 from the previous
contract.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $2,083,024.00 (FY 2013: $34,717.00; FY 2014: $416,604.00; FY 2015:
$416,604.00; FY 2016: $416,604.00; FY 2017: $416,604.00; and FY 2018: $381,891.00). Contract
period: November 2, 2013 through November 1, 2018. (490-630 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 funds.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.

On August 13, 2013 it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds in order to meet FY 2013 obligations for professional and managerial services. The balance
on this account was $27,394.00, and the balance 30 days prior was at $2,621.00.
2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The 235 - Contractual Maintenance Services account had an unencumbered balance of more than
$50,000.00 and all remaining FY 2013 expenditures were considered.
The 353 - Books, Periodicals, Publications, Archives and Data Services account had an
unencumbered balance of more than $20,000.00 in which all FY 2013 expenditures have been
considered.
The 367 - X-ray (Radiology) Supplies account had an unencumbered balance of more than
$30,000.00 in which all FY 2013 expenditures have been considered.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
The 353 account for Books, Periodicals, Publications, Archives and Data Services purchases will be
delayed until the FY 2014 budget. This delay of funds does not allow the library at the Medical
Examiner’s office to obtain needed library resources, books and periodicals for the doctors.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
235 - Contractual Maintenance Services. Due to a new janitorial services contract which was
budgeted at a much higher amount, the contract was approximately 5% lower than expected.
Snow removal is under this account, and due to the mild winter last year, enough funds have
remained on the purchase order. All other contracts under the 235 account have already
encumbered enough funds for FY 2013.
The 367 - X-ray (Radiology) Supplies account had budgeted a much higher amount for the service
agreement for the x-ray table. This contract was being procured during budget preparations, so it
was overestimated before the contract was complete.

The Budget Department has reviewed and has no objection to this transfer.

On May 16, 2013, it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds.
The balance in the account at that time was $0, and the balance 30 days prior to that was $0. The
account was not budgeted for FY 2013, as this program was not expected to be implemented in
2013.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 016-110 was identified as the source of transferred funds since there was the availability of
funds resulting from hiring delays in vacancies. No other accounts were considered for as the
source of the transferred funds.

PROPOSED AGREEMENT
ITEM #40
Transmitting a Communication from
JOHN COOKE, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
I hereby transmit for your approval a request for the Office of Capital Planning and Policy, as authorized
by the Cook County Chief Procurement Officer, to participate in the Cook County’s Job Order Contract
(JOC) program to complete the three (3) capital projects listed below. JOC is a quantity based
procurement process that allows facility owners to complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and
construction projects with a single, competitively bid contract. The JOC process generally involves first
selecting a pool of potential contractors through a competitive procurement process, and then identifying
projects for such selected contractors.
Reason:

The County has already completed a JOC competitive procurement process, and it has created
the pool of general contractors to perform certain projects generally associated with
maintenance, repairs, and routine work. Participating in the County’s existing JOC contract,
would allow the County to enjoy the myriad cost savings achieved through volume purchases.
The JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group. The
Gordian Group maintains an area price book, which captures the prices for specific
construction work items within this region. JOC contractors bid against the prices included in
the price book. The cost, therefore, of any work performed by the contractor is a contractor
markup from the price book. The Gordian Group would receive a 5 % administrative fee from
Cook County based on the total project cost of the work.
The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, request authorization for the Chief Procurement
Officer, to:
1.

Enter into and execute an agreement with the Gordian Group on the same terms as, and
actively participate in the County’s JOC agreement for the coordination and
administrative management of the JOC program.

2.

Do all such acts and things and to execute all contracts necessary to complete the Projects
using vendors selected through the County’s JOC program.

3.

The following projects would be included and assigned by the Gordian Group to
participating JOC contractors:
1. Oak Forest UPS System
2. Oak Forest Condensing Unit
3. DOC Central Kitchen Condensing Units

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $3,250,000.00.
20000 County Physical Plant and 33000 Oak Forest Hospital.

PROPOSED INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT
ITEM #41
Transmitting a Communication from
JOHN COOKE, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
requesting approval and execution of an intergovernmental agreement between the County of Cook, a
body politic and corporate of the State of Illinois, on behalf of the Office of Capital Planning and Policy
(OCPP) and the Cook County Health and Hospitals System (CCHHS), and the Illinois Medical District
Commission (IMDC), a body politic and corporate and unit of local government of the State of Illinois.
Per Article VII, Section 10 of the 1970 Illinois Constitution and the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act
(5 ILCS 220/1 et seq.), and other applicable law, units of local government are permitted to cooperate
with and support each other in exercise of their authority and the performance of their responsibilities.
The purpose of the proposed Intergovernmental Agreement (“Agreement”) will be to allow the IMDC,
OCPP and CCHHS to collaborate on redevelopment opportunities within the Illinois Medical District, to
better account for existing and future needs of the County and CCHHS as well as the IMDC, including
but not limited to the best and highest uses for the County, CCHHS and IMDC properties within the
Illinois Medical District.
The Agreement will also promote quality comprehensive re-development opportunities for the County,
CCHHS and the IMDC within the Illinois Medical District. The Agreement between the County and the
IMDC allows for the exploration of redevelopment opportunities and will allow the parties to determine
strategies to enhance the services provided to the medical district community, develop a vibrant mixeduse campus for CCHHS and the surrounding IMDC community, and benefit the overall medical district
community.
The Agreement shall commence upon execution by all parties and shall be effective for a period of two
(2) years thereafter. This Agreement may be extended or amended upon the mutual written agreement of
the parties. Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time by providing the other party with
thirty (30) days prior written notice of such termination.

and
SHANNON E. ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute Contract No. 13-2312582 with Holabird & Root, Chicago, Illinois, for Architectural/Engineering services for the Women's
Justice Services Center at South Campus. The Competitive bidding procedures were followed in
accordance with the Cook County Procurement Ordinance. Holabrid & Root was the lowest, responsive
and responsible bidder and is recommended for award. This project will provide a new home at South
Campus Buildings 3 and 4 for the Cook County Sheriff's Women's Justice Programs (SWJP) located at
the Department of Corrections Campus (DOC). It will consolidate the Women’s Justice Service program,
currently housed in various locations throughout the DOC campus, making it a more efficient program.
Reason

The consolidation will not only enable SWJP to move both Administrative Offices and all onsite programming to one location, it will also allow for expansion of intensive case
management which provides successful linkages to unmet needs, such as housing and job
training. Its current programming capabilities in Women’s Residential are 160 beds,
expanding to 375 beds; Sheriff’s Female Furlough from 135 reporting participants to 225
reporting participants; facilitate the continuity of care between all program services to its
clients through the Empowerment Center; and provide living and training environments in
compliance with Department of Justice mandates and Illinois Jail Standards.
The project includes, but is not limited to civil/site, architectural, structural, HVAC, electrical,
plumbing, telecommunications/structured wiring, security and fire protection and sprinkler
systems, landscaping, new furniture, fixtures and equipment. This building will incorporate
“green” features. Upgrade/install HVAC system at South Campus Buildings 3 and 4 to
accommodate current and future needs to each building.

310-225, Postage to Account 300-260, Professional and Managerial Services to supplement the budget for
court-ordered, hearing-impaired sign language interpreter services.
Reason:

There has been an unforeseen rise in FY 2013 in the use of sign language interpreters in court
proceedings. Additional funds are needed due to the significant increase in both interpreter
appearances and the vendor service rates. Courts are required to provide these services to the
deaf and hard of hearing pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/8-1402 and the Americans with Disabilities
Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101, et seq.

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
Shortly after the four-month period ended March 31, 2013, it became evident that the Circuit
Court’s budget for hearing-impaired sign language services would be insufficient to keep pace with
the legislatively mandated requirement to provide services for the deaf and hard of hearing.
Billings from the court’s primary vendor through that date totaled more than $38,000.00, compared
to the adjusted 2013 annual budget of $49,470.00. Through February 2013, billings totaled about
$21,700.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The postage account was identified after a detailed review of expenditure forecasts.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 310-225.
The reduction in the Circuit Court's postage account 310-225 will cause no deferrals, delays or
cancellations.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The court’s postage account is used mainly for petit juror summons mailings. The court had
budgeted for an equal number of mailings in FY 2013 as in FY 2012, because the number of case
filings have stabilized in recent years. To date in FY 2013, however, the mailings have declined
approximately ten percent from the previous fiscal year.

The Budget Department has reviewed and has no objection to this transfer.

PROPOSED CONTRACT continued
ITEM #63 cont’d
Reason:

Aunt Martha's is recommended based upon a Request for Proposal (RFP) No. 13-23001. Aunt Martha's was the only vendor to respond to the RFP.
The Evening Reporting Centers Program combines community-based alternative detention
sites with electronic monitoring. Judges order selected, nonviolent minors, both male and
female, who would otherwise qualify for detention in the Cook County Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center (JTDC) to one of six centers. Approximately 40 percent of the minors
subject to probation pretrial supervision are ordered to the program for up to 21 days. The
Centers provide minors with highly structured and well supervised group activities during
high risk periods. The program's goal is to reduce the likelihood of re-arrest and to allow
minors to continue to attend school and remain at home. Juveniles are supervised five (5)
days per week from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. in five (5) Chicago locations and one (1) suburban
location. Staff members offer minors educational activities, recreational programming and
life development workshops. Center staff also teach social/life skills to reinforce pro-social
behaviors and provide tutoring support for school work. The centers provide transportation
for the minors to and from home. In calendar 2012, more than 1,850 minors were admitted,
for a total of more than 15,100 center service days.
In addition to the Evening Reporting Centers Program, the contract provides for pretrial
services for youth, ages 10-18, who have pending juvenile charges. Directed by judicial
order, pretrial services are provided seven (7) days a week and include group therapy, home
visitation, curfew and school attendance monitoring, and referrals to services in the
community. Services are coordinated by two (2) full-time Aunt Martha’s case managers,
who conduct thorough assessments of the adolescent and family situations and develop
responsive case plans. On average, approximately 60 juveniles every day participate in the
program from 21 to 30 days.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $5,192,166.00 (FY 2013: $574,776.00; FY 2014: $1,724,320.00; FY 2015:
$1,730,720.00; and FY 2016: $1,162,350.00). Contract period: August 1, 2013 through July 31, 2016.
(326-298 Account).
Approval of this item would commit funds for Fiscal Years 2014, 2015 and 2016.

TRANSFER OF FUNDS continued
ITEM #76 cont’d
Reason:

This transfer of funds, which represents less than one-tenth of one percent of our 2013
budget, should be sufficient to fulfill our obligations for the remainder of the fiscal year for
three accounts with projected shortages. These accounts are: 225 Postage, where we have
seen an increase in certified mailings; 388 Computer Operation Supplies, mainly due to the
high number of CD and DVD storage disks for video interrogations and the related
discoveries, as well as the increasing cost of printer toner; and 444 Maintenance and Repair
of Automotive Equipment, where the expiration of warrantees on a large portion of our fleet
has resulted in repair costs slightly higher than anticipated.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On June 1, Account 225 had a balance of approximately $46,000.00; on May 1 the balance was
$86,000.00.
On July 1, Account 388 had a balance of only $4,000.00; on June 1 the balance was $25,000.00.
The balance in Account 444 has been depleted for most of the year, since almost all of the funding
each year is encumbered early as Purchase Orders (POs) are issued to various vendors in
accordance with the annual county wide contracts for automotive repair. At the beginning of July
we realized that the remaining balances in these POs might not be sufficient, and that a transfer was
advisable.

requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $50,000.00 from and to the

records of the victims in criminal cases, particularly in our Juvenile Justice Bureau, where
every case of alleged abuse or neglect of a minor requires the acquisition of full medical
records, often including x-rays.

562-264

Training Programs for Staff Personnel
Transportation and Other Travel Expenses for Employees
