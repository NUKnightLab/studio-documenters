(ITEM A1)
The Authority is required to submit for approval by the Board, a balanced annual Comprehensive
Budget detailing each of its funding sources. The impact of this budget revision resulted in the
following changes: General Fund: Total revenue and associated expenditures increased by
$5,550,000 for a fund total of $675.5 million; City/State: Total revenue and associated
2

 expenditures increased by $1,660,347 for a total fund of $15.5million. This is due to increase in
housing assistance payments based on new contracts for the City/State properties; HOPE VI: Total
revenue and associated expenditures increased by $8,625,000 for a fund total of $72.9 million.
This is due to carryover of unspent grant funds; Other Grant Programs: Net revenue increased by
$1,586,041 for a total of $33.0 million. This is mainly due to the addition grant funding from the
MacArthur and Summer Food Grants. The estimated sum of all revenues for the fiscal year 2001
and the amount of the fiscal year 2001 Fund Balance available for appropriation is equal to the
estimated sum of all expenditures to be made or incurred during fiscal year 2001.
RESOLUTION NO. 2001-CHA-89
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board letter, entitled APPROVAL
OF THE REVISED 2001 COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET, dated June 15, 2001 and
concurs with the recommendations contained therein, it is now appropriate for the
Board to adopt a Revised Comprehensive Budget for the Year 2001.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners for the Chicago Housing Authority, hereby approves
the attached budget amendments, “APPROVAL OF THE REVISED 2001
COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET”, and finds with respect to said Budget:

1.

that the proposed expenditures are necessary for the efficient and economical operation of
the CHA for the purpose of serving low-income families;

2.

that the financial plan is reasonable in that it indicates funding sources adequate to cover all
proposed expenditures, and does not provide for use of Federal funding in excess of that
payable under the provisions of the applicable Federal regulations; and

3.

that all proposed rental charges and expenditures will be consistent with provisions of law
and the Annual Contributions Contract in accordance with the Moving To Work
Demonstration Agreement of the CHA with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development.

THAT,

the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are authorized to execute
and forward to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development all
necessary budget documents and supporting information when applicable.

(ITEM A2)
The resolution for Item A2 approves amendment of the existing contract with Hamilton,
Rabinovitz & Alschuler for financial advisory services by allocating $100,000 from bond related
fees to hourly fees for professional services subject to HUD’s approval. These services will be
needed for a third party review in connection with CHA moving forward with several mixed
income real estate transactions over the next six months. Reviews may include assessment of the
efficiency of proposed transaction structures in the use of CHA assets and other resources, CHA’s
return on investment, and comparability assessments with respect to best practices in the relevant
sectors of finance industry.
RESOLUTION NO. 2001–CHA-90

 (ITEM A3)
In March 2001, the Authority submitted an application for funding in the amount of $1,035,950 to
the MacArthur Foundation to allow CHA to develop and implement the Tenant Relocation
Tracking System. Since the Authority has received an informal verbal notice that the request for
funding has been approved, the resolution for Item A3 approves acceptance of the grant.
Implementation of a new integrated information technology system will enable the CHA to
accurately document the progress being made to achieve the Plan for Transformation goals.
Property and Asset Managers will have real time access to accurate information and will be able to
track service requests, resident leases and relocation status. The Tenant Relocation tracking
System will present a streamlined, centralized solution to the issues the CHA faces in adapting its
approach to tenant management. The Authority has already invested $300,000 for the purchase of
hardware, the development of the initial database, and the initial training for the property
managers. An additional amount of in-kind support from the CHA will be necessary to provide the
balance of the funding for this $4.5 million project. HUD, through the MTW Technical Assistance
Fund, will provide a portion of these resources. The remaining resources will be provided by the
CHA over the next two years.
RESOLUTION NO. 2001-CHA-91
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated June 18, 2001, entitled, “Authorization to Accept Grants from
the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation to Implement Relocation
Activities, the Quality Control Program, and the Tenant Relocation Tracking
System”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority hereby authorizes
the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to accept the award of three grants from
the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in the total amount of
$1,735,950.00 to implement the CHA’s relocation activities, Quality Control
Program, and Tenant Relocation Tracking System, subject to receipt of formal
notice of the award, and of the grants in such form that is acceptable form to the
CHA.

(ITEM A4)
In March 2000, the Authority submitted an application for funding to HUD for resources that
would support the CHA Transformation Plan. Since the Authority has received written notice
from HUD that the application for funding was approved for $225,000, the resolution for Item A4
grants approval for acceptance of these funds. Since most CHA residents will move from their
homes at least once over the next 7-10 years, the CHA is committed to frequent and honest
communication with residents in order to ease the transitions. A core element is a training
program on the Relocation Rights Contracts, the new lease, the Housing Choice Survey, and the
Admissions and Occupancy procedures. Understanding these complex documents is tantamount to
residents undergoing a smooth relocation process.
The grant from HUD will help fund
components of the training activities related to resident training. Private funding has been sought
to cover other relocation training and technical assistance costs. The CHA will contribute
$6,750,000 of its current budget for Relocation and Mobility Counseling, Moving Costs and Good
Neighbor Counseling.
RESOLUTION NO. 2001-CHA-92
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated July 3, 2001, entitled, “Authorization to Accept a Grant from the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to Provide Relocation
Training and Technical Assistance”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

The Board of commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority hereby authorizes
the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to accept a grant of $225,000 from the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to support relocation training
and technical assistance.

Commissioner Gates then moved the adoption of the following Resolution for Item B2:

(ITEM B3, B4 and B5)
The resolutions for Items B3, B4 and B5 approves contract modifications for Blinderman
Construction, Star & Crest Corporation and C&H Joint Ventures respectively, for Time and
Material for general maintenance and repairs at various CHA developments. The Authority’s Plan
for Transformation includes the rehabilitation of over 2,900 Scattered Sites units. These dwelling
units, located in communities throughout Chicago neighborhoods, require a wide variety of repairs
and rehabilitation. Because the conditions in these units vary so widely, each dwelling unit must
be assessed and repaired based on its particular needs. The flexibility of the “Time and Materials”
6

 contracts for working with general contractors allows the CHA to work in collaboration with
qualified Construction Managers, Property Managers and residents to develop the exact scope of
work needed in each unit and to assign the general contractors to respond appropriately and
expeditiously to complete necessary repairs and rehabilitation. Although the Scattered Sites
portion of the Capital Improvement Program will extend throughout the end of calendar year 2003,
the Authority has made a commitment to repair 750 of the Scattered Sites units by the end of 2001.
Increasing the resources available to the contractors who are already working on this program will
enable the Authority to meet their commitment.
