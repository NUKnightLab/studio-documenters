 III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to request number 5, Director Richardson-Lowry stated that it is important to report, in terms of
the hospitals that are engaged in receiving this, where they are monitoring safety-net versus university or other
kinds of systems, in order for the Committee to have a robust discussion around what they think is a
presentation of like systems and outcomes. Mr. Elwell agreed; he stated that anytime a report is produced, a
list of the comparison group will also be provided. He expects that the first reports will be produced by April.
Mr. Elwell provided information relating to the question of sole source methodology for request number 6. He
stated that this contract is for the provision of case management services in the community relating to
CountyCare members; this vendor will provide those services for the non-MHN providers. This type of
service was previously provided by the former third party administrator (TPA); CCHHS as a provider will now
be taking it on as its responsibility, under the leadership of Mary Sajdak, Senior Director of Integrated Care
Management. In terms of being able to hire and train people, this was not something that could be internally
assembled in the short-term; this is presented as a contract for a period of only one (1) year, which should
provide enough time to internally staff-up. In response to questions regarding why this was determined to be
sole source and whether no local companies exist that do this type of work, Mr. Elwell stated that there are
other companies out there, but there is specific software involved and critical timing associated with passing a
readiness review for CountyCare in February – CountyCare has to be able to prove that it will have the staff on
board. This vendor has familiarity with the software and were already working with Lurie’s Coordinated Care
Entity (CCE); the vendor already had staff doing complex case management, and the Lurie CCE is shutting
down, so the vendor’s staff became available. Ms. Sajdak provided additional information. She stated that
there will be 42 people associated with this contract; of those 42 people, 40 are direct care providers. Director
Richardson-Lowry requested that, following the readiness review, the Committee should receive a report on
that process so this body understands where the organization is in the process, and to ensure that the internal
cross-training that is expected to take place happens. She added that there should be some basis of checking
on a quarterly basis to ensure the organization hit its mark on the cross-training.
Following the review of request number 8, Chairman Collens requested that Mr. Elwell provide a report on
effectively the return on investment on this contract, towards the end of the year, to see the actual net benefit of
this product and service.
During the discussion of request number 14, Mr. Elwell noted that the request should be amended to retract the
inclusion of an antennae.
During the discussion of request number 15, Director Estrada noted that he will be abstaining on this matter.
With regard to request number 17, Board Chairman Hammock referenced the amount of administrative fees
being paid for these services; at $31 million per year, he asked how that compares to what was paid to the
former TPA. Mr. Glass stated that he will find out and provide a response.
Following the review of request number 18, Director Richardson-Lowry noted that she had raised the issue of
screening mammograms in November, after becoming aware of where the organization stands with respect to
limitations with its screening capacity. She stated that, of the 250,000 people being served here, a good
percentage of those served are women; many of those women were sent away for their screening
mammograms, and when they were sent away, they fell through the cracks. The organization now has an

Page 2 of 50

B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
opportunity to do and be better. She added that there has been some discussion about potential federal or state
dollars coming this way regarding this subject; previously, the organization was not quite positioned to be able
to receive them, but now it is better positioned.
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, stated that this is a moving target. It is a known fact that
African American women suffer disproportionately from mortality from breast cancer. In recent years, or
within the past ten (10) years, this organization has been woefully understaffed in its capability to provide
services, both from a radiologist standpoint and from an equipment standpoint. To adequately care for its
primary care patients, this request helps to provide the opportunity to do that.
Director Richardson-Lowry stated for the record that there is a higher percentage (60% higher) of African
American women who are adversely impacted in terms of having triple-negative breast cancer, which can be
more aggressive and harder to treat than other types of breast cancer. The rate for Hispanic women is 40%
higher, and Indian women’s rates are not even measured. This organization has an opportunity because it has
this population. Once services are this fully ramped up, there are ample opportunities to go out and have
people doing public services announcements on local radio stations so that people are aware that this
organization is now engaged around this topic. She thanked the administration for the very quick response on
this issue; she stated that she is incredibly grateful, as this organization has an opportunity to save lives and
improve health outcomes for these women, and this is the right thing to do.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Richardson-Lowry, moved the approval of
request numbers 1 through 18. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Director Estrada abstained and voted PRESENT on request number 15.
Note: at the January 29, 2016 CCHHS Board Meeting, request numbers 6 and 8
received conditional approval, pending completion of review by Contract Compliance.

CountyCare Update

Mr. Elwell reviewed the presentation that included information on Metrics, Preliminary Financial Statements
through November 2015 and an update on CountyCare. The Committee discussed the information.
Mr. Elwell provided an update on the State’s budget and its impact on CCHHS and the County. The impact on
CCHHS is less than that on the County; there are a number of court cases out there that require the State to continue
to make payments for Medicaid fees. The State continues to run 60-90 days behind in capitation payments for the
Family Health Plan (FHP) population, and on time for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Adult population; that status
is similar to how the State typically runs when it has a budget, so there is no real change there.

Report from the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy (continued)
Mr. Elwell stated that the issue comes down to grants; for the County, this is a very big issue involving
approximately $55 million. For CCHHS, about $2.1 million in grant funding is involved. The administration is
working with the County right now on the issue. Of the $2.1 million, $2 million of that relates to a grant received
from the State that is just to perform what is required of a local health department; realistically, those services will
have to continue whether the grant funding is received or not, because those services are required of any local health
department. The other grant that the State has not funded is the tobacco-free grant. The exposure on that is
approximately $100,000; a decision may be needed to potentially trim back activity.
In response to questions raised regarding the amount owed by the State, Mr. Elwell stated that the State owes
CCHHS approximately $25 million, plus another $2 million relating to the grants that were mentioned earlier.
With regard to the subject of net days in accounts receivable, Mr. Elwell stated that 49.8 is industry standard on net;
CCHHS’ figure is 33. This is an area of concern for him; although everything looks really good, the organization is
behind in its coding - if you’re behind on coding you’re behind on billing. This is a major focus. If the Committee
recalls, a lot of coding services were moved in-house; between the combination of bringing it in-house and the
transition to ICD-10, the organization is not doing quite as well as the administration would like. Therefore, there
may be a need to enter into another contract for coding services until CCHHS is able to completely do it on its own,
as the organization cannot afford not to bill. Director Richardson-Lowry inquired as to the expected timeline to
catch up on coding. Mr. Elwell responded that, without help, progress is not being seen; with help, it is expected to
be brought together in the next 30-45 days. He does not want to take the pressure off being able to keep this
internal, but there may be no other choice but to enter into another short-term coding contract; he noted that there
are two (2) such contracts in place right now to assist in catching up and making sure coding is up to date within the
next 45 days.
Following the discussion of the information on slide 10 regarding operating margin as a percentage of total
operating revenue, Board Chairman Hammock asked Mr. Elwell to review the goal of a 2% margin and perhaps
adjust it to a more appropriate figure, based on the high amount of indigent care provided. Mr. Elwell responded
affirmatively; he noted that it will be helpful to now have access to the UHC database in order to determine and
make that adjustment.
With regard to slide 20, Director Wiese requested information regarding the percentage of CountyCare members
who are not using their insurance. Mr. Elwell responded that he can provide that information.
Director Junge noted that automatic screening of detainees for eligibility has been taking place at Cermak Health
Services over the past year; post-detention, CountyCare should be able to capture these individuals in terms of visits
to clinics – she asked whether that data is tracked yet. Mr. Elwell responded in the negative; he stated that there
have been some disconnects there, but staff are working hard to make the handoff better.
Director Gugenheim inquired regarding the sources of revenue relating to the Community Triage Centers. Mr.
Elwell responded that they will be considered a part of Ambulatory Services; with regard to revenue sources, it is
mostly indirect or cost-reduction strategies that will produce a net benefit. Examples of this include the following:
most of the individuals receiving services are expected to be covered by Medicaid; the utilization of Community
Triage Centers is expected to ultimately reduce Emergency Department visits and inpatient stays; and potential
grant award opportunities. With regard to grants, he offered to have Mr. Glass and Kathy Chan, CCHHS Policy
Director, present to the Committee in the future about grant activity that has been going on relating to the behavioral
health consortium and learning collaborative.
