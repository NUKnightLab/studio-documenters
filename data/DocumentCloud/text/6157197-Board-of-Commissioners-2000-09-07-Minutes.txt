WHEREAS, throughout our nation' s history, the men and women of America's armed forces have
preserved our freedom, protected our security, and upheld our democratic values; and
WHEREAS, from the battles of the American Revolution, through the crucible of two world wars, to the
challenging peacekeeping and humanitarian missions of today' s post cold-war era, our men and women in
uniform have stood proudly in defense of the United States and the cause of liberty; and
WHEREAS, in the two centuries since our nation's birth, more than a million servicemen and women
have paid the price of that liberty with their lives; and
WHEREAS, joining the ranks of these heroes are the thousands who have been held as prisoners of war
or whose fate has never been resolved; and
WHEREAS, many have been lost in the chaos of battle, and the grief of their loss made more acute for
their families and fellow Americans because of the inability to determine whether they perished or
survived; and
WHEREAS, captive Americans, cruelly stripped of their freedom , treated with contempt and brutality, or
used as pawns by their captors in a larger political struggle, have fought long, lonely battles against
despair, physical and psychological torture, and the ultimate fear of being forgotten ; and
WHEREAS, Americans will never forget those who have borne the indignities and sufferings of
captivity in service to our country, those missing in action, or those who died as prisoners of war, far from
their home and family ; and
WHEREAS, on National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we affirm our commitment to those still missing
