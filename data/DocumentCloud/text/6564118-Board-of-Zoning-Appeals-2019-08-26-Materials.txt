What WPC Relied Upon
•

NEORSD Testing and Documentation

 NEORSD Samples from Old Denison Rd. sewer of 2/13/2019 that found four volatile organic
compound (VOCs) pollutants and 1 byproduct of VOCs, same VOCs processed by CSI and
in CSI plume; (See City’s Ex. J);
 NEORSD Reports by NEORSD’s Environmental Consultants/Experts;
 Report of EA Group, 2/18/2019 (City’s Ex. K);
 Report of Partners Environmental, 10/28/2014 (City’s Ex. R);
 NEORSD’s Analysis of Report of CSI, 6/14/2016 (City’s Ex. L);

•

Over 25 NEORSD Violation Notices to CSI (City’s Ex. C);

•

Ohio EPA Order to Complete Corrective Action of Pollution Plume on CSI’s
Jennings’ Facility property. Plume is VOC Pollutants. (OEPA Order of 1/16/2013, City’s Ex. E.)
(Pollutants in plume match pollutants that NEORSD found in Old Denison sewer);

•

USEPA Violation Notices to CSI & US EPA v. Chemical Solvents Federal
Consent Decree: US EPA NOVs. Recently summarized in Federal Consent Decree including
“violations of the pretreatment requirements of administrative orders issued by NEORSD” and
requiring sewer rehabilitation of “pumps, piping, and valves at the (Jennings) Facility.” Also
requires a professional pipe audit and a proposal for “additional modifications of its piping as
necessary to eliminate any piping that poses a hazard for unauthorized discharge, bypass and
overflow.” (City’s Exs. Q & S).

Evidence WPC Relied Upon That
Pollution is Not from Another Source
•

Ohio EPA Comments of 1/16/2013 regarding historical sources:
(City’s Ex. G, pgs 4-5):
“Data from the Steel Yard Commons Target Store Area indicate that the
groundwater flow direction is to the east northeast. In addition, groundwater
constituent levels for methylene chloride, trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene are
significantly higher on the Chemical Solvents Jennings Road facility versus the Steel
Yard Commons Target property.”

•

NEORSD’s analysis corroborates Ohio EPA comments of 1/16/2013 with regard to
groundwater flow and direction and they have determined that upstream sewer is bulkheaded and there are no other upstream users of collection system in which VOC
pollutants were found and Steel Yard and Everyready are not the source;

•

Ohio EPA’s groundwater expert Rich Kurlich’s analysis that shallow fill zone
(0 to 6 feet) is heavily contaminated with CSI plume pollution, and can infiltrate into 0
to 6 feet lateral sewers and line sewer at 7 feet. Upstream properties are residences
and a restaurant.

 History of Solvents and VOCs at
CSI’s Jennings Road and Denison Properties:
Chemical Solvents has been processing solvents
and other chemicals at the site for 49 years.
• “Ed Pavlish founded Chemical Solvents Inc., in 1970…In addition to
distribution of a full range of chemicals.…Our blending capabilities include
being able to handle flammable, viscous and complex solvent and liquid
blends.” (From CSI’s website.)
• “Chemical Solvents, Inc., is primarily engaged in the business of recycling
dirty or spent halogenated and non-halogenated solvents on the subject
property owned by Pavlish Real Estate.” (Signed statement of Ed Pavlish in
Ohio EPA Environmental Covenant.)
