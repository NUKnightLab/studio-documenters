PROPER AUDIT AND ASSESSMENT OF FINANCIAL, LOGISTICAL,
AND OPERATIONAL IMPACT OF THE
COOK COUNTY BOTTLED WATER BAN
WHEREAS, according to the Cook County Bottled Water Ban approved and passed on

until February 4, 2008 to conduct a water audit as set forth in the November 6, 2007
version of Resolution 07-R-436; and
WHEREAS, according to the Cook County Bottled Water Ban approved and passed on
November 6, 2007, the bottled water ban is to take effect on February 1, 2008; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bottled Water Ban calls for the premature implementation of
the bottled water ban in that said Resolution 07-R-436 requires the ban of bottled water
prior to the due date for the water audit required of the Purchasing Agent and the Bureau of
Administration; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners must be apprised of and given the
opportunity to review and digest the analysis and results of the water audit so as to properly
determine whether a bottled water ban is in the best financial, logistical, and operational
interest of the various departments and agencies of Cook County government; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners can only exercise their fiduciary
duty and proper due diligence by first reviewing and digesting the analysis and results of
the water audit and subsequently evaluating whether to implement the Cook County Bottled
Water Ban, Resolution No. 07-R-436; and
WHEREAS, the Purchasing Agent and the Bureau of Administration absolutely require
greater than 90 days to exercise proper due diligence and conduct an audit which fully
accesses the needs of the various departments and agencies of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the financial, logistical and operational impact of the bottled water ban require
more than the 90 day period, allocated in the November 6, 2007 version of Resolution 07R-436, to develop a complete assessment and implementation plan; and
WHEREAS, a water audit and report is currently in progress by the Administration to
assess the status and quantity of the water cooler contracts and equipment; and
WHEREAS, preliminary assessments have detailed that not all department and agency
locations can use such a system or even have the ability to connect to a municipal water
tap source; and
WHEREAS, the cost of the installation of water filtration system at the various locations
could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and tens of thousands of dollars yearly for
additional filters and maintenance parts.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, subsequent to the Cook County Board of Commissioners’
exercise of their fiduciary duty and proper due diligence, in the event the Board deems
action to implement a bottled water ban is appropriate, then said bottled water ban shall not
be effective until such time greater than 90 days after said determination so as to allow the
Bureau of Administration the proper lead time for implementation of an alternative water
filtration system;
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Purchasing Agent and the Comptroller shall
