PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY HUMAN RIGHTS ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, Cook County seeks to protect its citizens in the enjoyment of civil rights and to promote
mutual understanding and respect among all who live within the County; and
WHEREAS, discrimination, prejudice, intolerance and bigotry directly and profoundly threaten the rights
and freedom of Cook County residents; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has passed ordinances to protect the civil rights of those who live and work
within the County, including the prohibition of discrimination based on source of income in rental real
estate transactions; and
WHEREAS, the prohibition of discrimination based on source of income in rental real estate transactions
does not protect persons with housing choice vouchers, participants in the federal Section 8 Housing
Assistance Program (42 U.S.C. 1437f) from discrimination on the basis of their source of housing-related
income; and
WHEREAS, the housing choice voucher program is the federal government's largest rental assistance
program for providing aid to low-income households who need assistance with their rent as well as the
primary source of rental assistance for Cook County residents; and
WHEREAS, discrimination against families, women, persons of color, persons with disabilities, and
senior citizens who use housing choice vouchers to supplement their rental income is a pervasive and
growing problem within Cook County, leading to the concentration of persons with housing choice
vouchers in certain parts of Cook County, undermining economic and racial diversity, limiting where
people can choose to live, forcing people to live far from work, and generally undermining the quality of
lives; and
WHEREAS, in order to achieve racial and economic diversity throughout Cook County, and end the
racial isolation and poverty concentration in certain parts of Cook County, prohibition against denying
rental housing to housing choice voucher holders on the basis of their source of housing-related income is
necessary.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, in order to protect these citizens, the Cook County Board of
Commissioners proposes that the term "source of income", shall be defined to include all lawful sources
of income, including housing choice vouchers, as defined, and be added as an amendment to the Cook

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
FISCAL IMPACT OF MENTALLY ILL ARRESTEES ON COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII, Section 6a of
the Illinois Constitution of 1970 with powers to regulate those matters which pertain to its government
and affairs; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has the power and responsibility to conduct public hearings regarding certain
matters pertaining to Cook County Government; and
WHEREAS, the fiscal impact of Mentally III Arrestees on Cook County Jail and the Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center is unknown, Cook County Jail is reported to have approximately 800 Mentally Ill
Arrestees in the system according to 2002 statistics; and
WHEREAS, the rate of recidivism among the mental ill population, commonly referred to as the
"revolving door syndrome", poses a financial hardship on the Cook County budget, and makes it more
difficult to comply with the Federal Consent Decree on overcrowding; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois has relinquished most of its responsibilities for adequate care for the
mentally ill without adequate plans for services and housing at the local level which has contributed
greatly to our jail populations.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners shall
conduct informational hearings to ascertain the fiscal impact of Mentally Ill Arrestees on the Cook
County Budget, and the ability of the Cook County Jail system to comply with the Federal Consent
Decree on overcrowding; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners seek legal remedies to
insure that the State of Illinois assumes its responsibilities for decentralization of mentally ill patients to
local communities in accordance with Federal regulations.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 2 I, 2003
(RECESSED AND RECONVENED ON OCTOBER 24, 2003)
Joy Wykowski stated that Commissioner Collins is speaking in regards to two different issues. The
Journal of Proceedings which contain everything that took place at a particular Board Meeting include all
Ordinances and Resolutions that were passed at the meeting. Further, she stated that there is a contract
which was approved by the Board on July 1, 2003 with Municipal Code Corporation (MCC) for the
compilation of the Ordinances for Cook County. The last time the ordinances were compiled was in
I 990. Municipal Code Corporation was supplied with all the Ordinances and after each Cook County
Board meeting the County Clerk forwards new ordinances to Municipal Code Corporation. At this time
MCC is in the process of compiling information. Once a draft is received, it will be reviewed by the
State's Attorney's Office for accuracy, and then it will be referred to the Legislation and
Intergovernmental Relations Committee. Ordinances will continue to be updated.
Commissioner Collins asked when the Commissioners can expect to receive a copy of the Ordinance
book.
Joy Wykowski stated that she will defer to Helen Haynes to respond to her question.
Helen Haynes, State' s Attorney ' s Office, stated that under the contract with Municipal Code Corporation
the State's Attorney' s Office is expecting the first draft within 45 days. Once the draft is received the
State' s Attorney's Office will review what has been organized, the proper fonnat, including notes
showing the history of when the various Ordinances were passed. Further she stated that the tum-around
time is very tight. Then the State's Attorney' s Office wil l go through the changes with Municipal Code
Corporation, the County Clerk' s Office, the President's Office and the Legislation and Intergovernmental
Relations Committee.
Commissioner Collins asked who detennines that this would fall under the role of the State' s Attorney' s
Office.
Helen Haynes stated that the State's Attorney by law advises the County and the Cook County Board.
The State's Attorney' s Office is providing a review based on the statutory role of the legal aspects of the
ordinances maintained by the County Clerk' s Office.
Chainnan Hansen stated that it is not the role of the State' s Attorney's Office to tell the Cook County
Commissioners how to pass laws, but to provide legal advice.

Commissioner Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Mur phy, moved to defer Item #2 until the next
Administration Committee meeting and at that time also consider changes from the commissioners.
The motion carried.
ITEM #3

Chainnan Hansen stated that a letter was distributed to each Commissioner from Purchasing Agent
Raymond Robin, stating that the Purchasing Department is compiling and reviewing infonnation

ITEM# 4
Commissioner Hansen asked what the cost would be to include the systems at the County Building that
are not on emergency back up generators to be at full capacity.
Elizabeth Melas, Deputy Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy, stated that the Commissioners
received an inventory of the countywide facilities. Additionally, the Office of Capital Planning and
Policy looked specifically at the cost to provide full generator power to the building and the cost would be
approximately $7 million dollars.
Chai n11an Hansen asked if the Commissioners could receive this infon11ation in writing.
Elizabeth Melas stated that she will provide the Commissioners with the requested infonnation. Further,
Ms. Melas stated that the Office of Capita l Planning and Policy has not done an in-depth study, this is just
a preliminary budgetary estimate. Currently the Cook County Building does have generator power for
emergency lighting, power for emergency telephones and the elevators.
Commissioner Hansen stated that he would like to know were the $7 million dollar figure comes from .
Elizabeth Melas stated that the $7 million dollar figure would provide two additional 2000kw generators
that would provide power for the enti re County Building, which would include design and construction
fees required for installation.
Commissioner Steele asked if the new Stroger Hospital of Cook County and the Cook County Jail have
backup generators.
Elizabeth Melas stated that the new Stroger Hospital of Cook County has all the critical equipment and
emergency generator power. Also, the county j ail has generator power, but she does not know what
specifically is hooked up to the emergency generator.
Chairman Hansen asked if the County has investigated the cost of gas cell type electrical generator units.
John Joiner, Director, Department of Facilities Management, stated that since 1990 there has been some
discussion on co-generating power, but only on the Department of Corrections Campus, where the
County would generate its own electricity. Further, he stated that since the electrical rates are solid at this
time this matter has not gone any further than being discussed. In closing, Mr. Joiner stated that he would
if necessary, go through the past files and provide the Commissioners with updated information.
Chairman Hansen stated that he is concerned about the fact that if power from Commonwealth Edison
was off the County Building will be off completely.
Elizabeth Melas stated that the point of emergency power in the Cook County Building is to provide
adequate lighting to get employees out of the building. Further, she stated that currently the County
Building is not set up to keep operating in case of a power outage. The Office of Capital Planning and
Policy would have to look and see if it is even feasible to add the two generators.
Commissioner Murphy stated that a study should be conducted in regards to emergency power in the
Cook County Building.
Commissioner Han sen asked if the Cook County Building is a command post.

2955

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 21, 2003
(RECESSED AND RECONVENED ON OCTOBER 24, 2003)
Elizabeth Melas stated that there is no command post in the Cook County Building.
Chainnan Hansen stated that it would be helpful to have further examination of partial or total type of
electrical supplies.
Chainnan Hansen asked if the data processing backup was completed.
Chainnan Hansen asked Stanley Molis, Director of the Department for Management of lnfonnation
Systems (MIS), stated that currently there is an unlimited power supply (UPS) attached to the mainframe,
but it does not have a generator attached to it at this time. If the power goes out it is only good for four
hours to power everything down so that nothing will crash.
John Joiner stated that the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system that handles the MIS Department,
gives a four hour window before MIS would lose data. Currently, the Department of Facilities
Management is looking at fitting the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system from MIS and their
system onto the generator that is currently in the Cook County Building.
John Joiner stated that the generator that is currently in the Cook County Administration Building will not
keep the building running, but the generator will allow MIS to maintain data for four hours with the
uninterruptible power supply (UPS). Further, he stated that currently the generator is used for emergency
lighting, three elevators and fire pumps. He is trying to place MIS on the same generator.
Chainnan Hansen asked what capability MIS will have once they are hooked up to the generator.
John Joiner stated that MIS will be able to operate the mainframe.
Chainnan Hansen asked what is the target date for having MIS hooked up to the generator.
John Joiner stated it should be completed within the next two to three months. At this time it is being
studied including in-house engineering.
Chainnan Hansen asked if it has come before the County Board.
John Joiner stated that he is working with in-house electricians, but if the load on the uninterruptible
power supply (UPS) is increased then he would have to look at other alternatives.
Chainnan Hansen asked Mr. Joiner to keep the Administration Committee infonned in regards to the
uninterruptible power supply.

Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved to defer Item #4 until the next
Administration Committee Meeting. The motion carried.
ITEM #5
Chai rman Hansen stated that a copy of the Cook County Ordinance implementing the State ESDA Statute
was sent to each Administration Committee member.
Chainnan Hansen asked if anyone was present from the Sheri fr s Office.

2956

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 21, 2003
(RECESSED AND RECONVENED ON OCTOBER 24, 2003)
Zelda Whittler, Undersheriff, Cook County Sheriffs Office, stated that since 09/ J 1/0 I everyone had to
improve their security measures. The Sheriff has worked diligently towards improving security at all of
the Cook County facilities. She stated that all the court facilities have increased the screening procedures
to insure that every person is adequately screened. The Cook County Building presents a number of
concerns because the building is shared with the City of Chicago. The Sheriff' s Office would have to
work in connection with the City of Chicago; additionally equipment would have to be installed in both
buildings. The number of law enforcement officers in the Cook County Building has increased.
Chaimrnn Hansen asked if there was any way that the level of security can be the same as in the Daley
Center.
Zelda Whittler stated that it would take an initiative from both the County and the City to work together.
Chainnan Hansen asked if there was a reason why the County Building could not be done alone.
Zelda Whittler stated that she would like to defer the question to Chief Don DuLaney.
Chief Donald DuLaney stated that in November 2001, Chief Deputy Sheriff Robert Beavers forwarded
staffing estimates to Cook County. Since then no further analysis has been done. The cost estimates that
we currently have date back to 2001 , but could be updated at the request of the County Board.
Chairman Hansen asked if anything has taken place which might change the estimates based on the
urgency of the subject matter.
Zelda Whittler stated that the cost analysis that was given to the Commissioners in 2001 has changed.
She stated that another analysis will be required to give the Commissioners a clear representation of what
it would cost to provide the needed security for the County Building.
Chairman Hansen asked ifthe Sheriff' s Office could provide the Commissioners with an updated analysis
by the next Cook County Board Meeting.
Zelda Whittler stated that she will provide the Commissioners with an updated analysis.
In reference to the Emergency Services and Disaster Agency Ordinance for the County under Section 5104, Chai nnan Hansen inquired whether the County has any such agreements with any other entity under
the Emergency Services and Disaster Agency Ordinance.
Zelda Whittler stated that at the next Cook County Board Meeting the Sheriff' s Office will be introducing
a mutual aid agreement for the County Board to approve.
Kevin Phillips, Director of Emergency Management, stated that there are several levels of mutual aid that
recently have been proposed and put into operation. One of the mutual aid agreements deals with law
enforcement agencies. The Sheriff's Office has proposed a mutual aid agreement among the collar
counties relative to emergency management or emergency services.
Chainnan Hansen asked how this would assist the County.
Kevin Phillips responded that it would fonnalize what the County had as an unwritten policy among the
collar counties to assist each other in emergencies and disasters. Further he stated that most mutual aid
agreements are voluntary, however, this would formalize the agreement.

2957

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 21 , 2003
(RECESSED AND RECONVENED ON OCTOBER 24, 2003)
Kevin Phillips infom1ed the Commissioners that the Emergency Services and Disaster Agency Ordinance
dates back to the early 80s. The ordinance has always been based upon the State statute for emergency
services.
Chaimian Hansen stated that the State's Attorney' s Office is also working on the Emergency Services and
Disaster Agency Ordinance.
Helen Haynes, State's Attorney' s Office, informed the Commissioners that the Illinois Emergency
Management Agency Act was first prepared in 1975, which was referred to under a slightly different
name, and has been amended many times. Recently there has been legislation proposed to change the
definition of disaster, so that it clearly encompasses public health disasters.
Chairman Hansen stated that the State ' s Attorney' s Office should work together with the Sheriffs Office
so that the Commissioners could have an updated version.
Zelda Whittler stated that the Sheriffs Office will work together with the State' s Attorney' s Office.
Chairman Hansen stated that this item can be brought up again at the next Administration Committee
meeting and review any changes that need to be made at that time.
Commissioner Murphy asked ifthe County has done anything to protect our firefighters.
Zelda Whittler stated that last year the Sherifrs Office had an item on the agenda through Emergency
Management to purchase equipment for first responders. She asked Kevin Phillips to give the
Commissioners more detailed infonnation.
Mr. Phillips stated that $150,000.00 was dedicated to purchase and distribute the Mutual Aid Box Alarm
System (MABAS), a fire service mutual aid group. He stated that a community' s tire department
benefited from the purchase and deployment of the equipment. Protective masks were purchased for law
enforcement. The Illinois Terrorism Task Force has been working with the County to provide to all the
law enforcement agencies with initial levels of preparedness.
Chainnan Hansen asked who is appointed to serve on the ESDA.
Kevin Phillips stated that it is the Emergency Management Agency within the Sheriff s Office. He stated
that there are five budgeted positions. The Sheriff is the coordinator of emergency services in the County
and the President of the Cook County Board is the chaimian.
Chairman Hansen stated that he was pleased that the State's Attorney ' s Office and the Sheriffs Office
will review the document. The Commissioners can be notified as to what course of action should be
taken including that protective masks were purchased. Further he stated that the amendments that were
made in Springfield should be incorporated in the County' s Ordinance.
Chainnan Hansen stated that at the next Administration Committee Meeting a report from the Sheriff and
the State's Attorney will be available.

Commissioner Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved to defer Item #5 until the next
Administration Committee Meeting. The motion carried.
Commissioner Murphy moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Gorman. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

VILLAGE OF MAYWOOD (NO CASH BID REQUEST). Transmitting a Communication,
dated September 5, 2003 from Deborah Sims, County Commissioner, submitting a request
from Ralph Conner, Mayor:
Re: Over the Counter No Cash Bid
The Village of Maywood has targeted various locations within the community for
redevelopment. Among those given priority are vacant lots and other derelict properties
located in residential and commercial areas. The conditions of these lots have caused the
Village to expend its resources to maintain these properties. Many of these same properties
are delinquent in the payment of property taxes depriving the County, the Village, and local
Boards of Education of revenue . These issues have given the Village of Maywood cause to
seek the title to those tax delinquent properties and request that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners submit an Over-the-Counter No Cash Bid on behalfof the Village.

2969

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDfNGS FOR OCTOBER 21, 2003
(RECESSED AND RECONVENED ON OCTOBER 24, 2003)
In 2002 the Village of Maywood Board of Trustees adopted the Adjacent Neighbor Land
Acquisition (ANLAP) and Tax Reacti vation Programs as part of an initiative to redevelop
vacant and underutilized property. Currently, the Village is in the process of adopting a new
Comprehensive Plan with a particular emphasis on development. Site control is a significant
factor to attract investment in targeted redevelopment areas. Tax delinquent properties
acquired through the proposed No Cash Bid will be part of these areas and marketed through
the ANLAP and Tax Reactivation Programs or included in a land banking project for future
projects or other municipal purposes.
In anticipation of the semiannual Scavenger Sale the County has released a preliminary list
of tax delinquent properties. The Village of Maywood submits the following list of tax
delinquent parcels listed by their respective Property lndex Numbers (PTNs) fo r its inclusion
in the No Cash Bid:

The Village of Robbins is undergoing a change. This change is a positive one, with
benchmark accomplishments and never before attempted undertakings. Developments and
projects that were once thought to be impossible are happening before our very eyes. We
have identified this move towards social and economic sustainability as our Robbins
Renaissance.
Along with the many infrastructure oroiects, I 37th Street. Claire Boulevard, and the
Inflow/Infiltration Corrective Action Program (ICAP) to name a few, we have identified a
quintessential and necessary component that once completed, will validate and make viable
every economic development activity within the Village of Robbins. The Village of Robbins
has identified over 1,400 vacant tax delinquent parcels within its boundaries. A majority of
these parcels have been delinquent since 1977. We have worked tirelessly to prepare these
parcels to be entered into the upcoming 2003 tax scavenger sale. Please accept this letter as
our official request for Cook County to make a bid for these identified parcels on behalf of
Robbins at the upcoming scavenger sale.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 21, 2003
(RECESSED AND RECONVENED ON OCTOBER 24, 2003)
For years the Village has suffered because of the unrealized revenue stream from the nonpayment of property taxes. Residential and commercial development has been arrested due
to our inability to offer and leverage land in negotiations with developers. With your
support, the Village will be able to offer the parcels to individual builders, residential and
commercial developers. Needless to say, the Village's only intention for acquiring these
parcels is to return them to the tax roll. For the last two years, the Village has been in the
planning and design phase of establishing relationships with qualified and reputable
residential and commercial developers. With these parcels, the Village can effectively
initiate the next phase of rebuilding our community both socially and economically. Mr.
Stroger, our Village is grateful and appreciative for your many years of encompassing
support of our many endeavors, and we consider you and your board to be an integral part of
our Robbins Renaissance. We look forward to your continued support.

*Referred to the Committee on Finance Tax Delinquency Subcommittee on 1017/03.
Vice Chairman Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved approval of Communication
No. 261806 as amended, pending the provision of title searches and all other pertinent information
by October 21, 2003, by the Department of Planning and Development.
Chainnan Sims provided some extra information on the following Communication Numbers:
Communication No. 261429 contains 40 pins, 19 of which were certified and recommended for approval,
the other 21 of which were withdrawn.
Communication No. 261806 has 954 pins. Chainnan Sims asked Jacqueline Harder to comment on this
communication.
Ms. Harder stated that Communication No. 261806 is not a complete package: It lacks title reports, as
well as pictures of 6 pins. She recommended deferral until the application package is complete.
Randy Kemmer, Assistant State's Attorney, stated that it is at the committee's discretion whether to act on
Communication No. 261806.
Commissioner Moreno asked whether the Department of Planning and Development keeps track of the no
cash bid parcels that are given to municipalities, for example, how long the parcels are off the tax rolls,
what is done with them, to whom they are sold.
Ms. Harder replied that the county board ordinance stipulates that the municipality is supposed to file
reports with the Department of Planning and Development for five years or until development occurs.
Not all municipalities comply.
Commissioner Moreno noted that if the municipality is doing something inappropriate with a given parcel
the Department of Planning and Development needs to know.
Chairman Sims noted that it was her understanding that on a given parcel of land municipalities report to
the Department of Planning and Development for seven years. She stated that she was also under the
impression that a report was forthcoming concerning all the parcels.
Ms. Harder replied that municipalities state in their letter of request to the Board of Commissioners that
they will comply with the reporting requirements and will also file annual reports with the Department of
Planning and Development.

2972

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 21 , 2003
(RECESSED AND RECONVENED ON OCTOBER 24, 2003)
Commissioner Moreno asked whether there is any enforcement language in the letter that the State's
Attorney' s Office could follow up on.
Ms. Harder replied that the ordinance contains requirement language.
Mr. Kemmer stated that the Department of Planning and Development does not have any enforcement
mechanism.
ASA Kemmer suggested that ifthe Department of Planning and Development does not receive reporting,
the Board of Commissioners could stop approving no cash bids for the errant municipality.
Commissioner Moreno requested that Ms. Harder write a letter to the errant municipalities notifying them
that they are on notice that they will receive no more no cash bids until they have complied with the
reporting requirements.
Chairman Sims requested that Ms. Harder start sending the above-mentioned letters in January.
Vice Chairman Goslin asked ASA Kemmer whether there is a reverter clause in the relevant ordinance
that would stipulate that ownership of land reverts to the County if they breach the terms of the ordinance.
ASA Kemmer replied in the negative.
Vice Chainnan Goslin noted that the purpose of the no cash bid is to cultivate the parcels and put them on
the tax roll.
Commissioner Moreno asked whether it was a local ordinance that governed no cash bids, if so, the
ordinance should be amended.
ASA Kemmer confinned that it was a local ordinance that governed no cash bids and reiterated that it is
up to the Board of Commissioners whether to continue dispensing parcels to municipalities which fail to
report.
Chainnan Sims noted that the ordinance stipulates that municipalities are not to land-bank property.
Commissioner Moreno stated that perhaps the deed should have a reversionary clause, should the
municipalities not comply with the reporting requirements or not use the land for its intended purpose.
ASA Kemmer replied that he is not sure the deed could contain such language; perhaps the initial
agreement could.
Commissioner Moreno stated that since the municipality is getting the land free of liens, it is the public
that pays if the municipality doesn't use the land for its intended purposes.
Commissioner Moreno requested that the Chainn an direct ASA Kemmer to write a memorandum on
inserting a reversionary clause in order to avoid land banking and negligent use so that were this to occur
the County could sell the land to someone else who would put the land on the tax rolls.
Chainnan Sims asked which would be a stronger step to take, amending the resolution or amending the
ordinance.

2973

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 21, 2003
(RECESSED AND RECONVENED ON OCTOBER 24, 2003)
ASA Kemmer recommended that the Board of Commissioners stop issuing no cash bids to errant
municipalities. He further stated that it would not be possible to get back the parcels regarding which
municipalities are non-compliant on reporting or usage.
Commissioner Moreno stated that inserting a reversionary clause in the initial agreement would be a good
safeguard for the future.
Vice Chaimrnn Goslin suggested that the Department of Planning and Development make a report to the
Board of Commissioners regarding reporting compliance of municipalities.
Ms. Harder replied that her department has that infonnation in a database.
Vice Chainnan Goslin stated that he would like a report on municipality compliance at the beginning of
every meeting.
Commissioner Peraica noted that deciding when to enforce a reversionary clause because of usage would
be very subjective - sometimes logistical or economic problems can result in a municipality not using a
parcel. Further, in dealing with thousands of parcels enforcing a reversionary code because of usage
would require a lot of work.
Vice Chairman Goslin stated that he intended the reversionary clause to apply only to those municipalities
that were not complying with the reporting requirements. He agreed sometimes the economic climate for
development takes many years to grow.
Chainnan Sims asked Ms. Harder to provide a report every six months to the Commissioners regarding
the reporting compliance of the municipalities.
Vice Chairman Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved the approval of Communication
Nos. 260269, 260270, 260271, 261425, 261426, 261427, 261428, 261429 (as amended), 261430,
261431, 261436, 261437, 261438 and 261806 (as amended), pending the provision of title searches
and all other pertinent information by October 21, 2003. The motion carried.
Commissioner Moreno moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Peraica. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.
