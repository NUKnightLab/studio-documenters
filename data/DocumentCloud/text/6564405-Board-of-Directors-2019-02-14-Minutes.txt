facilities to meet their needs. It?s been very controversial within the port industry. Ports oppose
the funding process and believe CBP stations should be funded by the federal government and are
working, through AAPA, to get this reversed. Mr. Gutheil added that the charges are very common
throughout the industry and the P01t of leveland?s charge is much lower that others. Director

Adopted 3.012019

Ramsey asked what will happen if this issue isn?t addressed. Mr. LaPointe replied there would be
a wall failure and the dock could collapse. Director Roller asked how the dock closure will impact
Operations. Mr. Gutheil replied that no cargo will be lost since vessels can still work on the
opposite side of the dock or other berths. Director Ronayne asked whether the NEORSD is a
potential funding source. Mr. Friedman replied no. The water from port docks drains directly into
the lake, not into system. The Port is paying a stormwater fee for a service that isn?t
used, as opposed to getting help. The Port has made NEORSD aware of the situation but to date
they will not stop charging their fees. Chairman McNair asked about the likelihood of the Port
receiving funding for the project. Mr. Friedman replied the Port is aggressively pursuing outside
funding and the repurposing of existing dollars has begun.
