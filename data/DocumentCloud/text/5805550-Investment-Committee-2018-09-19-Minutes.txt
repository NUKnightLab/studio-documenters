Hubert Draw Jr. Demand Letter

Motion by: Trustee Cowan – Supported by: Trustee Sheehan
WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of the General Retirement System of
the City of Detroit (the “Retirement System”) is vested with the authority and fiduciary
responsibility for the administration, management, and operation of the Retirement
System, and
WHEREAS, the Board has fiduciary duties to the members and beneficiaries of the
Retirement System and shall discharge these duties solely in their interests for the
exclusive purposes of providing benefits and defraying reasonable expenses, and
WHEREAS, on August 16, 2018, attorney Fred Freeman submitted a demand letter
(“Demand Letter”) to the Retirement System on behalf of his client, Hubert W. Draw Jr.,
and
WHEREAS, in the Demand Letter, Mr. Freeman alleges that the Retirement System
made an unauthorized distribution of funds from Mr. Draw Jr.’s annuity savings account
in 2007 while he was incarcerated in Nevada, and
WHEREAS, at its September 5, 2018, meeting, the Board referred the matter to legal
counsel to review and provide a legal opinion on Mr. Freeman’s claims, and
WHEREAS, the Board’s legal counsel provided a legal opinion to the Board at its
September 19, 2018, meeting, and
WHEREAS, after reviewing legal counsel’s opinion, relevant Retirement System
records, and supporting documentation provided by Mr. Freeman, the Board made the
following findings of fact:
1. Hubert Draw Jr. was an employee of the City of Detroit and had accumulated
approximately $145,122.83 in his annuity savings account as of November 13,
2007;
2. By letter dated February 9, 2006, Mr. Draw contacted the Retirement System to
inquire about when he was eligible to make withdrawals from his annuity savings
fund, what potential tax penalties he could face, how often he could make
withdrawals, and other general information about the withdrawal process;
3. On October 17, 2007, Mr. Draw Jr. was sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in
the Nevada Department of Prisons;
4. The Retirement System received a letter signed by Mr. Draw Jr., dated
November 12, 2007, in which he authorized his wife, Monick Draw, to pick up
disbursement from his annuity savings account;

RE: Hubert Draw Jr. Demand Letter- Continued

SEPTEMBER 19, 2018

5. A check, payable to “Draw, Jr. Hubert W”, was issued by the Retirement System
and dated November 19, 2007, in the amount of $80,000;
6. Mr. Draw Jr.’s wife, Monick Draw, signed for and retrieved the check on
November 20, 2007, and specifically wrote in “Monick Draw For Hubert W. Draw
Jr, Letter Attached” next to her signature;
7. Mr. Draw Jr. made another withdrawal from his annuity savings account, with
another letter authorizing his wife to retrieve it, in 2010;
8. Mr. Draw Jr. made a final withdrawal of the remaining funds in his annuity
savings account in 2011 which was divided and partially sent to him via the
Nevada Department of Corrections and partially sent to the Wayne County
Friend of Court pursuant to an Income Withholding Order; THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED, that the Board finds that, when issuing the November 19, 2007, check,
payable to Mr. Draw Jr., and allowing his wife to retrieve the check on November 20,
2007, Retirement System staff acted reasonably and used appropriate care by relying
on the November 12, 2007, letter from Mr. Draw Jr., by requiring his wife, Monick Draw,
to sign for the check, and by making the check payable to Mr. Draw Jr., and further
RESOLVED, that Mr. Draw withdrew the balance of his annuity funds in 2011 at which
time he did not raise any issue with respect to the 2007 distribution. Retirement System
benefits are contractual in nature and subject to a six (6) year statute of limitations.
Accordingly, any claim he would have today for the 2007 distribution would be time
barred by this six (6) year statute of limitations, and further
RESOLVED, that the Board has a fiduciary duty to only pay those benefits to which a
Participant is entitled, no more, no less, and that Mr. Draw Jr. withdrew all the funds
from his annuity savings account and is, thus, not entitled to any additional
disbursements from the Retirement System, and further
RESOLVED, that the Board formally denies Mr. Freeman’s demand for disbursement of
additional funds to Mr. Draw Jr., and further
RESOLVED, that Mr. Draw Jr. may appeal this decision by submitting a formal appeal
request, in writing, not less than 30 days from receipt of this resolution, and further
RESOLVED, that copies of this Resolution be sent to Mr. Freeman, attorney for Mr.
Draw Jr.
