The Rankin family and the surrounding community are making this request in memory of Jada,
because she would frequent the playground at Sawyer Park throughout her childhood. Many
members of the community have signed a petition in support of this request. ada?s mother holds
a Ride4Justice against Gun Violence in the park every year to raise awareness and to also
support families who have lost loved ones due to gun violence.

We respectfully request your authorization to name this playground in memory of Jada Rankin
with a Waiver of Reconsideration

Sincerely,

Sawyer Playground was a part of Jada?s entire life. My mother live one block over from the playground
on Ardmore. I use to scroll Jada to Sawyer Playground when she was a baby. When Jada got older
enough to go to the park without me she went to the park with her friends and family. Jada use to spend
her summer vacation at her Big Mam house. When Jada became a teenager she use to take the children
from the local daycare on outing to the playground, she read to them, and played games with them.

in the summerJada use to give out lemonade also she gave out water to anyone that was playing at the
park. In the winter Jada use to give out hot chocolate. On Wednesday? 5 during the summer Jada gave
out lunches to the neighborhood children using her weekly allowance. 0n the weekend Jada goes up to
the playground and clean up after families had their parties because she never wanted any of the
children that played in the park to get hurt. On Sunday morning before church Jada use to run track and
shoot hoops at the park with her favorite cousin. Jada was always a leader she lead the clean-
up crew to clean the vacant lots in the neighborhood.

She always cared and help the elder people in the neighborhood. she shovel their snow in winter. raked
their leaves in the fall. Jada use to feed the homeless, Jada will go to the corner store and buy food and
feed them when she saw them standing outside the store asking food money. One homeless man was
her favorite his name is "Joe? she made sure Joe had food and clean shirts. Jada was a strong
community advocate her willing to help other was amazing. Jada?s passing devastated that
neighborhood and the community. Jada was murdered in front of her Big Me on Ardmore. To this day
no one can?t believe she's gone. I know Jada was only 15 years old and wasn't known threw the city but
she was loved and smart, giving and had a beautiful heart.

lie-Naming Sawyer Piayground to Jada Rankin Playground will be such an honor and her name and
legacy will live on. It will impact the neighborhood in a positive way Sawyer can become a Playground
where other families can come and get peace and serenity. I host my" Ridefl-Justlce against Gun
Violence" every year at Sawyer Playground to raise awareness and also support families during the
grieving time in their life.

Detroit, MI 48227

November 16, 2018
RE: Renaming of Sawyer Playground
Dear Mrs. Jan Anderson,

My name is Johnny Yousif. I am the president of Esso Wrecking Co. We are a Certi?ed Detroit
Headquartered Business and a Certi?ed Detroit Small Business. We have been at this location
since 2011. We are responsible for cleaning the overgrowth and dead trees on the west side of
the park. Everyone in the neighborhood has thanked us for cleaning up not only the park, but
also our yard when we bought it from the City of Detroit. Our yard is next door to Sawyer
Playground.

The reason for my letter is to show support of renaming Sawyer Playground to Jada Rankin
Playground. Jada's Life was tragically taken in an unfortunate order of events. After asking a
Speeding car to slow down on Ardmore St., the car returned and shot and killed Jada. Jadas
Grandmother used to take her to the park to enjoy the playground during the summers. I have
known Tiawanna, Jada's Mother, for quite some time and earlier this summer she had
mentioned to rue-her idea of renaming the playground. I feel that if it honors an innocent victim
of a senseless crime, and it helps to preserveher memory, then naming the playground in her
honor should be done. As a direct neighbor of the playground and someone who took pride in
cleaning it up, I am asking you to approve the petition of the name change.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at (248) 379-0210 or email me at
essowrecking@gmail.com. Thank you in advance for your time.

Sincerely,

?zz

Johnny Yousif
