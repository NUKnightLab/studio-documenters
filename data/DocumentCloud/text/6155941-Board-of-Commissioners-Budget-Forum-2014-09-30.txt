We encourage patrons to give input and feedback on the Chicago Park District 2015 budget by
speaking at the public forum OR responding to an online survey.
Online Survey
If you prefer to provide your input online, visit www.improvechiparks.com and complete the
surveys titled:
* What one service or program in our parks needs more funding?
* How would you cut back in the event of a funding deficit?
* How would you spend $100 to improve your park?
Results from the surveys will assist the Chicago Park District in its 2015 budget planning process.
The Chicago Park District relies on its patrons for input to provide quality programming and
amenities that cater to each unique Chicago neighborhood. We are asking taxpayers to take
advantage of this valuable opportunity to be a voice in the process and help shape their local
parks. Thanks in advance for your time and input.
