who seek special benefits from the public; have confidence in the integrity and transparency of its
government; and
WHEREAS, full disclosure of political spending has been consistently recognized as important and

WHEREAS, Cook County adopted an Ethics Ordinance that ensures government decisions and policy be
made in the best interests of the People of Cook County, with full disclosure and transparency; Cook
County, Illinois Ordinance No. 93-0-29, as amended; and

accepting employment when such positions may fall within the revolving door definition; Brown v. District
of Columbia Board of Zoning, 423 A.2d 1276, 1282 (D.C. App. 1980); and

reviews complaints concerning possible violations of the Ethics Ordinance and financial disclosure; and
WHEREAS, elected officials are required to submit a campaign disclosure statement on a quarterly basis
to the Illinois State Board of Elections; and

Election Commission and the Illinois State Board of Elections to enforce the ethics rules that exist; and
WHEREAS, Cook County joins Represent US, with other communities in the United States, in seeking
full transparency of campaign finances as necessary for the growth of an educated, engaged, and informed
electorate.

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners support
tough, ethics laws and encourage all higher government bodies to consider strengthening their campaign
finance laws; increase transparency for campaign financing; and bar all elected officials and public
employees from all lobbying activity for one year after leaving employment; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners continues to enforce its
own ethics ordinances, and respectfully encourages state and federal governments to support strong ethics
legislation, and so memorializes these representatives with copies of this resolution for their action.

CALLING ON COOK COUNTY TO ASSESS ITS LACTATION ROOMS AND
LACTATION ROOM POLICIES IN AN EFFORT TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF
NURSING MOTHERS IN ITS FACILITIES
WHEREAS, breastfeeding offers proven health benefits for babies and mothers, but women often find it
difficult to continue breastfeeding once they return to the workplace; and
WHEREAS, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), among employed women
with children under age three (3), approximately 70 percent work full time and one-third of mothers return
to work within three (3) months after giving birth, and two-thirds return within six (6) months; and
WHEREAS, challenges to breastfeeding mothers include lack of break time and inadequate facilities for
pumping and storing human milk; and
WHEREAS, providing accommodations for breastfeeding offers numerous rewards for the employer, in
cost savings for health care, reduced absenteeism, employee morale, and employee retention; and
WHEREAS, Cook County and its facilities owned or rented are unique in that they must accommodate
county employees, workers who are not employed by Cook County but who perform some of their job
duties in county facilities, as well as members of the general public; and
WHEREAS, many of the challenges facing breastfeeding mothers can be reduced with a small investment
of time, money, and flexibility; and
WHEREAS, some Cook County buildings and courthouses owned or rented currently have space reserved
for breastfeeding mothers, but some challenges remain, and it is incumbent upon this body to evaluate
existing resources and see where there is opportunity for improvement.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the county
shall undertake an evaluation of its current lactation rooms and policies for those rooms, with the goal of
having all public buildings owned, operated or rented by Cook County with a designated private room,
other than a restroom, for persons seeking privacy to nurse or express milk, including members of the public
where appropriate; and

 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the private room shall at a minimum include an electrical outlet, a
chair, and a lockable door. Windows, if any, in the private room must have a window treatment appropriate
to ensure privacy; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the management of each building shall make all building staff aware
of the room(s) that have been designated for the use of nursing mothers and what the procedure is should a
member of the public request use of the room(s); and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all public buildings owned, operated or rented by Cook County post
a sign at the building entrance and outside the public restrooms indicating the availability of the designated
room and the procedure for accessing it; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that where a private room cannot be designated without displacing staff
or having to construct a new room within the facility, and where another option that would reasonably meet
the intent of this Resolution cannot be identified, an exception to the requirements of this Resolution will
be made.
Effective Date. This Resolution shall take effect immediately upon adoption.

MANDATORY E-FILING AT THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, the Supreme Court of Illinois ordered that Illinois Circuit Courts create an Electronic Filing
system (“e-filing”) on January 22, 2016; and
WHEREAS, Illinois Circuit Courts were to implement their e-filing system by January 1, 2018; and
WHEREAS, the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County entered into a contract with On-Line
Information Services in June of 2016 to provide e-filing services; and

provide court docketing services that would include matters filed through e-filing in the Circuit Court of
Cook County; and
WHEREAS, to monitor the court docketing services contract, Cook County entered into an agreement with
PriceWaterhouseCooper; and
WHEREAS, Tyler Technologies informed the Clerk, under a different contract with the Illinois Supreme
court, that it would be unable to complete the payment component of the e-filing system by the deadline;
and
WHEREAS, in a November 25, 2017 article in the Chicago Tribune, Circuit Court Clerk Dorothy Brown
stated that her office was prepared for e-filing; and
WHEREAS, on December 13, 2017, Cook County Circuit Court Clerk Dorothy Brown petitioned the
Illinois Supreme Court to extend the deadline for the implementation of e-filing until January 1, 2018 and
to allow permissive e-filing until that time; and
WHEREAS, in her petition to the Illinois Supreme Court, Clerk Brown stated that Tyler Technologies has
been unable to integrate its e-filing software with currently existing proprietary software in place at the
Court and there have been problems with the system’s ability to set dates for case management and with
bulk filing; and
WHEREAS, in response, the Supreme Court gave the Circuit Court an extension of six months until June
30, 2018 to implement the e-filing system and included a number of benchmarks, standards and
requirements to be met during the extension period.

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Circuit Court Clerk of Cook County and
representatives of On-Line Information Services, Tyler Technologies and PriceWaterhouseCooper appear
before the Legislative and Intergovernmental Relations Committee of the Cook County Board of
Commissioner to review the implementation of e-filing in the Circuit Court of Cook County; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County be prepared to explain
the confusion set forth by the office by initialing indicating that the office would meet the January 1, 2018
deadline for e-filing, only to file for an extension approximately three (3) weeks later.

THE HONORABLE TONI PRECKWINKLE, PRESIDENT AND STANLEY MOORE,
COUNTY COMMISSIONER
A RESOLUTION CALLING ON CONGRESS AND THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE
TO ENSURE CENSUS FUNDING, FAIRNESS, AND ACCURACY
WHEREAS, Census results determine the number of seats each state has in the House of Representatives,
are used to draw political districts at federal, state and local levels, and affect the distribution of billions of
dollars of federal funding annually to local communities for infrastructure and vital services like hospitals
and schools; and
WHEREAS, an inaccurate census will result in underrepresentation and fewer dollars for many of our most
vulnerable communities; and
WHEREAS, the perception of cyber-security risks; real cyber-security threats; the digital divide affecting
rural, low income, minority, and older households; a growing climate of fear among immigrants, regardless
of their legal status; and growing anti- government sentiment in some communities are known factors that
can depress response rates considerably; and
WHEREAS, the Constitution requires a count of all persons living in the U.S. on Census Day, regardless
of citizenship or legal status; and
WHEREAS, new Census Bureau research documenting the growing reluctance of immigrants to
participate in surveys and census tests will require expanded research and testing of effective messages and
communications avenues to overcome this significant barrier to an inclusive enumeration; and
WHEREAS, the recent U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) request to add a question about citizenship to
the 2020 Census threatens the Census Bureau’s ability to conduct an inclusive enumeration that accurately
reflects the diverse fabric of America; and
WHEREAS, the American people must have confidence that the Bureau’s leaders will uphold its core
principles of protecting confidentiality, sharing expertise, and conducting its work openly and fairly,
without regard to partisan interests, and be guided by a commitment to scientific objectivity and excellence
and research-based innovation; and
WHEREAS, in order to ensure a full, fair and accurate 2020 Census, there must be adequate funding;
qualified Census Bureau leadership; and no untested questions.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners
that Congress and the Secretary of Commerce ought to ensure provide adequate funding in the final FY
2018 omnibus appropriations bill, continue the tradition of strong, nonpartisan, experienced leadership in
the Census Bureau, and reject the DOJ’s request to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census; and

 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution be delivered by the Cook County
Clerk to each member of the Illinois Congressional Delegation.
Approved and adopted this 7th of February 2018.
