 GENERAL BACKGROUND
As part of the Capital Improvement Program, Contract No. 0640 was executed between the
Chicago Housing Authority (“CHA”) and Hasbrouck Peterson Zimoch Sirirattumrong (“HPZS”)
for Prime Design Consultant (“PDC”) services at Dearborn Homes (IL2-09).
The Capital Construction Department (“CCD”) is seeking approval of Modification No. 03 to
Contract No. 0640 for work to be performed by HPZS at Dearborn Homes. This modification is
to increase the amount of Contract No. 0640 by $323,559.00 to cover civil engineering for site
communication and changes to the site, including firelane, and trash /stuffer compactor design
services fees, and by an amount not-to-exceed $40,000.00 for additional reimbursable expenses.
The reimbursable amount includes costs primarily for, though not limited to, printing and the use
of messenger services.
HPZS submitted a proposal for additional compensation and reimbursable expenses due to the
CHA’s request to increase their design services for engineering for site communication
distribution, civil engineering for changes to the site – firelane, and design work for the
trash/stuffer compactor replacement and trash lift installation. The CCD staff, after careful
analysis of HPZS’s additional costs and extensive negotiations, believes that an increase to
Contract No. 0640 of $363,559.00 is justified. This amount includes $323,559.00 for additional
services and an increase not-to-exceed $40,000.00 for reimbursable expenses.
Based on the foregoing, it is recommended that the Board of Commissioners authorize the Chief
Executive Officer or his designee to approve Modification No. 03 of Contract No. 0640 with
Hasbrouck Peterson Zimoch Sirirattumrong for the provision of additional prime design
consultant services at Dearborn Homes in the amount of $323,559.00, and to increase its funding
for reimbursable expenses by an amount not-to-exceed $40,000.00, totaling $363,559.00. The
new total contract value of Contract No. 0640 is $3,581,319.00.
