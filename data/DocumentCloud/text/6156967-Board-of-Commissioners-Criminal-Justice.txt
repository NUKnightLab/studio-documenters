COMMUNICATE AND COORDINATE WITH THE COOK COUNTY SHERIFF’S POLICE TO ADDRESS

 WHEREAS, despite the fact that the nation’s attention has turned to police practices because of high profile
killings, concerns about policing extend beyond the use of force and into the everyday interactions of police
with community members; and,
WHEREAS, in black and Latino communities, these everyday interactions are often a “Stop and Frisk”; and,
WHEREAS, under the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), officers are allowed to
stop you if the officer has reasonable suspicion that you have been, are, or are about to be engaged in criminal
activity. Once you are stopped, if an officer has reasonable suspicion that you are dangerous and have a weapon,
the officer can frisk you, including ordering you to put your hands on a wall or car, and running his or her hands
over your body; and,
WHEREAS, a report on “Stop and Frisk” police practices by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of
Illinois, published this past Spring, contains troubling signs that the Chicago Police Department has a current
practice of unlawfully using stop and frisk; and,
WHEREAS, “Stop and Frisk” is disproportionately concentrated in the black community. Last month’s ACLU
Report found that black Chicagoans were subjected to 72% of all stops, though they constitute just 32% of the
city’s population; and,
WHEREAS, the ACLU of Illinois, comparing stops to population, found that Chicagoans were stopped more
than four times as often as New Yorkers at the height of New York City’s stop and frisk practice; and,
WHEREAS, the abuse of stop and frisk is a violation of individual rights, but it also poisons police and
community relations and directly impacts the bottom line for Cook County taxpayers by leading to arrests that
would not have otherwise occurred, thereby burdening Cook County Courts and the Cook County Jail; and,
WHEREAS, the Cook County Sheriff operates pursuant to four specific policies that govern the procedures of
the Cook County Sheriff’s Police related to “stop and frisk,” namely the following: Section 500 of the Cook
County Sheriff’s Police Supplemental Manual dealing with Motor Vehicle Stops; Section 312 of the Cook
County Sheriff’s Police Policy Manual dealing with Searches and Seizures; Section 201 of the Cook County
Sheriff’s Police Policy Manual on Supervisory Rank and Responsibilities; and Section 421 of the Cook County
Sheriff’s Police Policy Manual on Detentions; and,
WHEREAS, all units of county and local government stand to benefit by exchanging information regarding best
practices;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County President and the Board of Commissioners that
the Chicago Police Department be urged to review the above-referenced policies of the Cook County Sheriff’s
Police, and meet with the Chief of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police to discuss the manner in which these
policies are implemented and whether these policies might be directly transferable to the work of the Chicago
Police Department, particularly regarding “Stop and Frisk.”

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AMENDING THE COOK COUNTY CODE OF ORDINANCE RELATING TO THE OFFICIAL SEAL OF
COOK COUNTY TO PROHIBIT FRAUDULENT AND DECEPTIVE USE BY PRIVATE PERSONS AND
ENTITIES
Page 2 of 4

 WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a Home Rule Unit of Government pursuant to the 1970 Illinois Constitution,
Article VII, Section 6; and,
WHEREAS, pursuant to its home rule power, the County of Cook may exercise any power and perform any
function relating to its government and affairs, including the power to regulate for the protection of the public
health, safety, morals and welfare; and,
WHEREAS, the official seal of Cook County (“County Seal”) is an important symbol of the government of
Cook County which is used by Cook County government officials, departments and agencies to convey, and
does convey, the official imprimatur of the Cook County government; and
WHEREAS, when members of the public see the County Seal on any communication or object, they are likely
to believe, and do reasonably believe, that the person or entity displaying the County Seal is a Cook County
government official, department or agency, and that the communication or object has been approved by a Cook
County government official, department or agency; and thus the display of the County Seal communicates
official approval by Cook County government and an association with official Cook County government
business; and
WHEREAS, from time to time, private persons or entities have displayed the County Seal on various
communications and objects with the intent and/or the effect of misleading and confusing members of the public
into believing that the private person or entity is acting as a representative of the Cook County government
and/or acting on official Cook County business; and
WHEREAS, examples of potential fraudulent misuse of the County Seal include, but are not limited to, the use
of the County Seal on letters from non-government entities offering property tax appeal assistance under the
ruse of gathering sensitive personal financial information and the use of the County Seal by private persons to
gain entry to the residences and workplaces of people living and doing business in Cook County under the false
pretense of being Cook County government officials or employees; and
WHEREAS, such fraudulent use of the County Seal puts the most vulnerable members of the public at financial
and physical risk and creates a public safety danger;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Part I General
Ordinances, Chapter 2 - Administration, Article I - In General, Section 2-1 of the Cook County Code is hereby
amended as follows:

which is a scroll bearing the legend “January, 1831” marking the time the County was created by the State
legislature; in the lower left portion of the design there appears an illustration of a ship sailing on Lake
Michigan, symbolic of the County’s geographical location, shipping port and, in a broad sense, all forms of
transportation; in the upper right portion there appears a group of diversified buildings, symbolical of
government, schools, churches, fine arts, dwellings, business and industry; with the entire design being encircled
by a border upon which appears the printed words “Seal of Cook County, Illinois.”

(d) No person, as defined by §1-3 of this Chapter of the Cook County Code of Ordinances, shall use or display
any image or likeness of the seal described in this section for the purpose of conveying, or in a manner that is
reasonably likely to convey, the false impression of endorsement, sponsorship or approval by the government of

provision shall be ordered to cease and desist in such use and shall be subject to a fine as set forth by the Cook
