2019 Winter Blast Weekends
Private Security Plan, Medical Plan and Emergency Evacuation Plan

 

Private Security Plan

The 2019 Winter Blast Weekends will utilize the services of TriCon Security as its
private security and crowd control agency. This private security group will secure all
barricades and propane farms in and around the Winter Blast Weekends festival site.
This private security group will secure all performance stages within the Winter Blast
Weekends festival site, as well as provide roaming uniformed security throughout the
Winter Blast Weekends festival site. The private security group will work directly with
Detroit Police Department and Detroit Fire Department to ensure a safe and secure event.
The private security group will provide a list of commanding supervisors to the Detroit
Police Department and the Detroit Fire Department, along with contact information (cell
phone, pagers, etc.). The private security group will have an on-site command center in
which to work from for the duration of the Winter Blast Weekends festival.

Lost Parent/Child Protocol

Whenever a child is discovered to be lost, the staff person/volunteer/vendor is instructed
to find the closest person with a radio. They MUST contact the Production Of?ce on the
Production Channel. The Production department will direct the appropriate staff person
to come to the location of the lost child. That person will conduct a brief search of the
immediate area for the parent(s). They will obtain the child?s name (if possible), write
down a description of the child and any information on the parents that is available. If
the parents are not immediately located in the area, then the staff person will take the
child to Volunteer Headquarters and inform the Production Staff. The Production staff
will then inform police command.

Private Medical Plan

The 2019 Winter Blast Weekends will utilize Hart Medical as its private medical and
EMS provider for the downtown festival. Hart Medical will have an on?site command
center in which to work from for the duration of the Winter Blast Weekends event. Hart
Medical will work directly with Festival Management, the Detroit Fire Department and
the Detroit Police Department, and will provide a list of commanding supervisors, along
with contact information to the DFD and the DPD supervisors.

Hart Medical Response Plan

Hart Medical will provide the On?Site Emergency Medical Services for the 2019 Winter
Blast Weekends. Hart medical has been contracted by Winter Blast Weekends to
coordinate and deve10p an Emergency Medical Response Plan for the Private Emergency
Medical Services operating during the Winter Blast Weekends.

Hart Medical will be in operation all Winter Blast Weekends. Hart Medical will have an
Ambulance stationed at the Festival. In addition to the ambulances, Hart Medical will
have two (2) EMS personnel available in each sector of the Winter Blast Weekends.

Hart Medical will position its Command Center in the operations area of the Festival and
will invite the City of Detroit to station an EMS of?cer in Hart Medical?s command
center for coordinated deployment. The Command Center will be up and running at the
scheduled times of the Festival. Hart Medical will utilize one operator to staff the
Command Center and communicate with all services involved in the execution of the
Festival. Hart Medical will have direct communication with the Festival Management,
Detroit Police and all Hart Medical Ambulance and Sector Teams. In the event that a
large incident occurs during the 2019 Winter Blast Weekends, it is requeSted that Detroit
EMS Supervisor coordinate with Hart Medical. Hart Medical has reviewed all city and
county MCI and disaster plans and has reviewed them with all employees. Hart Medical
will operate in any capacity that is assigned to them in the incident, by Detroit Fire
Department, EMS Division, if requested. Hart Medical can coordinate these services
with EMS Division or the Fire Department and the Emergency Management Department.

Evacuation Plan

The Winter Blast Weekends staff will provide the above mentioned security and medical
plans for the 2019 event. In the event that an evacuation is necessary for the patrons at
the festival site the Winter Blast Weekends management team will work in conjunction
with the Detroit Police Department?s and the Detroit Fire Department?s protocol for a
proper and safe evacuation of the downtown area and will defer any and all procedures to
that of the supervising DPD and DF staff. The Winter Blast Weekends will assist the
evacuation with announcements from all stages and performance areas using the standard
public announcement systems that will be in each area.
