CONSIDERATIONS
• Identify and prioritize assets beforehand
• Develop incident response traffic control plans
• Use technology to deploy temporary signal timing plans
remotely
• Improve use of social media, navigation apps to provide
travelers with timely alerts/updates
• IC would make decision on traffic control changes

5-9

 DEVELOP/IMPLEMENT THE PROCESS
• Identify a champion to take lead (ODOT TSMO
Coordinators)
• Conduct a follow-up meeting to move response plans
further along
• Local public safety leaders reach out to mayors and
council members for input and buy-in
• Integrate into statewide TSMO efforts
• Continue ODOT program of TIM training
5-9

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact. The TSMO workshop is being
offered free of charge to NOACA and participants.

5-9

 NEXT STEPS
• NOACA staff will add the Business Process to our web
page to serve as a reference for future TSMO planning
throughout the region. Staff will also participate in
further planning studies and Traffic Incident
Management meetings held by ODOT to promote and
support integration of TSMO into businesses practices
of local agencies throughout the region.

5-9

 NOACA will STRENGTHEN regional
cohesion, PRESERVE existing
infrastructure, and BUILD a
sustainable multimodal transportation
system to SUPPORT economic
development and ENHANCE quality
of life in Northeast Ohio.
