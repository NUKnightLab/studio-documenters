RE: A Review of the Michigan lamefduck Bills (Nov. 18, 2018-Dec. 31, 2018)



Due primarily to the impact of Michigan?s state of?ce term limits law, there was a signi?cant
turnover of lawmakers in both the Michigan State House and Senate.1 This year, during the
State Legislature?s lame-duck session,2 the State House and Senate submitted approximately
340 bills for the Governor to consider, of those bills, the Governor vetoed 55 bills.3 It appears
the term limits law has in?uenced the legislature to promote hills which disproportionally
support the concerns of special interest, while railing against causes which would help the less
fortunate of Michigan, such as curtailing the recent voter approved referendum on minimum
wage increases, under Senate Bill 1171, which is detailed in this report.4 We have attached a
complete list of the lame duck legislation and actions for Council?s edi?cation.

 

The Michigan Senate will see more turnover than any legislative chamber in America next year because of a term?
limit law that prevented 25 of 38 members from competing for re-election this month. The amendment to the
Michigan Constitution, approved by 59 percent of voters in 1992, will force a 66 percent turnover in the Senate next
session. That?s by far the highest rate among the 15 states with similar laws, according to an analysis by Ballotpedia.
Why Mich. has largest US. legislative turnover

Ell 
turnover?counlrw?ml 7865602.?

2 When an elected of?cial loses an election (or retires from of?ce), that of?cial is called a lame duck for the
remainder of his or her term. When a legislature assembles between election day and the day that new legislators
assume of?ce, the meeting is called a lame-duck session. In Michigan, term limits also have an impact.

3 Michigan lame-duck bills: Here's what Gov. Snyder has signed, vetoed 
pull ticslm icli i 2311- in bil arted-x-?elned

4 Legislative term limits in Michigan have failed to achieve their proponents? stated goals: Ridding government of
career politicians, increasing diversity among elected of?cials, and making elections more competitive.

Term limits have failed to strengthen ties between legislators and their districts or sever cozy relationships with
lobbyists. They have weakened the legislature in its relationship with the executive
