Honorable City Council

Subject: Re uest to Amend the Official Cum ensatiun Schedule

 

Recommendation is submitted to amend the 2018 2019 Of?cial Compensation Schedule to include the pay range for
the following classification:

 

Class .
Code Title Salary

61-91-31 Graf?ti Removal Attendant $21,432 $3 1.968

 

 

 

 

 

 

The above recommendation is occasioned by a request from Perkins, Project Manager and Analytic Specialist with
the General Services Department (GSD).

The above request and recommendation is a result of a job survey completed to analyze the duties of Building Attendants
working outside of their classi?cation on the Graf?ti Removal Initiative. The initiative is a project to remove graf?ti and
tagging from public and private properties in the City of Detroit. Classi?cation and Compensation staff performed a job
survey of the employee?s which involved, reviewing a job analysis questionnaire completed by the employees ful?lling the
duties, visiting the garage where they receive their assignments, shadowing them in the ?eld, riding along with their
immediate supervisor Michael A. Shearer and meeting with Project Manager, Perkins.

During the visit the following duties and responsibilities were performed currently or at various times according to the
employees:
Survey building to determine what needs to be performed
I Determine where to park vehicle while avoiding traf?c and ensuring all areas can be accessed with lift
0 Determine art from graf?ti
I Mix and ensure proper consistency of Elephant Snot Graf?ti Remover
I Take 5 gallon Elephant Snot Graf?ti Remover and apply with brush to areas with graf?ti
- Power wash buildings, structures, viaducts, traf?c signs and other city owned prOperty to remove graf?ti
after the remover has penetrated the surface (Note: during the winter months the product has to sit longer
due to the cold weather conditions).
it Access high areas using the lift on the lift trucks, maximum height is 47ft
- Trim bushes and remove debris to access hard to reach areas.
Use Shadow Max product to remove shadows not removed with original Graf?ti Remover
- Fill in performing building cleaning duties in the absence of others as overtime

To ensure that the employees were able to effectively perform the aforementioned duties, training was provided to the
employees on to how to use the removal chemical as well as how to operate the Aerial Platform on the truck. Upon
successful completion of training, employees were issued an Aerial Platform Work Permit. In addition, employees are
also required to operate a motor vehicle which requires a valid State of Michigan Driver?s License. The duties are
performed approximately 9 months out of the year. In addition, if weather permits or there is an urgent request
employees can work throughout the year on the graffiti removal initiative on an as needed basis.
