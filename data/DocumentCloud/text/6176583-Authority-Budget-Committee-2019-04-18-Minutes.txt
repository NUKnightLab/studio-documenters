2. Death Penalty Abolition Act
Ms. Brennan, referring to the SFY19 Death Penalty Abolition Act (DPA) memo dated
April 18, 2019, said last year ICJIA issued two notices of funding opportunity, including
one for services to families of victims of homicide or murder and the other for training of
law enforcement personnel. She said staff was recommending designations for law
enforcement training. She said the notice of funding opportunity generated 10 responses
from qualified applicants and that the following agencies received the highest scores in
the merit-based review process. She also noted estimated the costs of each entity’s DPArelated training needs over the next 36 months.

Ms. Brennan explained the programs’ periods of performance would end June 30, 2019.
Mr. Stevens said DPA funds are appropriated to ICJIA from a trust and that
appropriations to ICJIA would be made annually until the fund is depleted. Unlike other
funding sources, there is no money going into the DPA trust fund, he said.
Mr. Stevens, in response to a question from Ms. Wolff, said the effectiveness of the law
enforcement training would be assessed with pre-and post-tests.
Motion: Mr. Olson moved to approve the recommended SFY19 DPA designations. Ms.
Wolff seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
3. Justice Assistance Grants (JAG)
Mr. Stevens discussed FFFY16 and FFY17 JAG Plan Adjustments. He noted the
materials incorrectly indicated FFY16 funds would expire on September 30, 2019; an
extension was granted and the new expiration date is September 30, 2020.
A. Partnerships and Strategies to Reduce Violent Crime
Mr. Stevens introduced continuation grants to support focused deterrence strategies that
closely target offenders at highest risk of reoffending. Mr. Stevens said staff

the operational effectiveness programs at the following agencies for a second 12 months.

C. Crime Strategy Analysis and Evaluation Program
Mr. Stevens said that the Crime Strategy Analysis and Evaluation Program supports a
team of researchers that identify priority criminal justice issues for the state, conduct
research and analysis on these areas, and disseminate information to guide decisionmaking locally and within ICJIA. He said staff recommended designating $424,053 in
FFY17 JAG funds to continue supporting the program for a period of approximately five
months after the program’s current grant expires. The funds would support the program
through roughly February 2020, he said.
Motion: Mr. Kocerka moved to approve the recommended FFY17 designation. Ms.
Kramer seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
4. Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) Plan Adjustments

*Matching funds requirement has been waived for this 18-month continuation.

Mr. Reichgelt said the designations would be the second of two 18-month grants given to
the programs, completing the 36 months of funding allowed under the original notice of
funding opportunity. He noted East Aurora School District (EASD) was granted a
matching funds waiver by the federal Office for Victims of Crime.
Dr, Alderden added ICJIA received a $750,000 grant to augment its InfoNet system that
would allow it to track outcome data and reinforce case-planning for these and other
VOCA programs.
Motion: Mr. Olson moved to approve the recommended FFY18 VOCA designations.
Ms. Wolff seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
B. Lead Entities
Mr. Reichgelt explained ICJIA partners with three lead entity agencies: Illinois Coalition
Against Domestic Violence (ICADV), Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault
(ICASA), and Children’s Advocacy Centers of Illinois (CACI). He said ICJIA awards
each one a substantial grant they then redistribute as sub-grants to member agencies via a
competitive process. He said staff recommended designating FFY17 VOCA funds to the
lead entities as described in the table below:

Mr. Reichgelt said staff recommended designating to each agency another $1.9 million in
FFY16 funds to be distributed among their partner agencies to purchase/upgrade
computers and other office equipment. He said the designations would be an effective use
of remaining unexpended FFY16 funds, which were set to expire on September 30.
Motion: Ms. Kramer moved to approve the recommended FFY16 and FFY17 VOCA
designations. Mr. Kocerka seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
C. Trauma Recovery Center Program
Mr. Reichgelt said the Trauma Recovery Center (TRC) Program was modeled after a
TRC program in San Francisco, Calif. The notice of funding opportunity for this program
required applicants to closely follow the San Francisco TRC model for funding
eligibility, he said, adding that just two of more than 10 applications received sufficiently
complied with the model. He said the recommended continuation grant designations
described in the table would support an additional 12 months of program activity, funding
both programs through 30 of the full 36 months allowed under the original funding
opportunity. He said the designations would support ongoing personnel costs, client
emergency funds, local staff travel, TRC rent, indirect costs, and computer licenses. He
noted the programs have proven to be very successful.
