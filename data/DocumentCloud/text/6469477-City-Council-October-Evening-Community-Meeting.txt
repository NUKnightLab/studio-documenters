Our Letter Dated:

Addendum Applies:
No

This modifies our letter of the above date in which we stated that you
would be treated as an organization that is not a private foundation until the
expiration of your advance ruling period.

Your exempt status under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code as an

organization described in section 501(c)(3) is still in effect.

Based on the

information you submitted, We have determined that you are not a private
foundation within the meaning of section 509(a) of the Code because you are an
organization of the type described in section 509(a)(1) and 

Grantors and contributors may rely on this determination unless the

Internal Revenue Service publishes notice to the contrary.
lose your section 509(a)(1) status,

However, if you

a grantor or contributor may not rely on

this determination if he or she was in part responsible for, or was aware of,
the act or failure to act, or the substantial or material change on the part of
the organization that resulted in your loss of such status, or if he or she
acquired knowledge that the Internal Revenue Service had given notice that you
would no longer be classified as a section 509(a)(1) organization.

If we have indicated in the heading of this letter that an addendum
applies, the addendum enclosed is an integral part of this letter.

Because this letter could help resolve any questions about your private
foundation status, please keep it in your permanent records.

If you have any questions, please contact the person whose name and

telephone number are shown above.

Re: Petition Detroit City Council for Charitable Gaming License
Dear Honorable Council members:

The Friends Of Parkside (FOP) respectfully requests your supp01t for a
gaming charitable license in Detroit to bene?t the children and families
who live in the Villages at Parkside, formerly Parkside Homes, a public
housing complex, on Detroit?s eastside.

We do not have a set date for the charitable event but wanted to be
?quali?ed? by the State of Michigan Charitable Gaming Division in
advance so that in the future we would only need to submit the license
application to the state.

FOP is a 501 (0X3), tax-exempt, community?based organization that was
started in 1991 by Parkside residents to promote solidarity among
Parkside residents; help build self-esteem of youth residents; offer
educational and employment related resources to the community; and
promote the health and well-being of residents.

If you have any questions, please contact me at 313-822?0311 or by
email

con?ict of interest.

if a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible

committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors
whether the transaction or arrangement is in the Organization?s best interest, for
its own benefit, and Whether it is fair and reasonable. ln conformity with the
above determination it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the
transaction or arrangement.

exemption, it must engage primarily in activities which accomplish one 01' more

ARTICLE VII
PER I 

To ensure the Organization operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes and
does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews
shall be conducted. The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following
subjects:

a. Whether compensation arrangements and bene?ts are reasonable, based on
competent survey inforn'lation, and the result of arm?s length bargaining.

b. Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management
organizations conform to the Organization?s written policies, are properly
recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for goods and services,
further charitable purposes and do not result in inurement, impermissible private
benefit or in an excess bene?t transaction.

ARTICLE 
USE QF OUTSIDE 

When conducting the periodic reviews as provided for in Article VII, the Organization
may, but need not, use outside advisors. If outside experts are used, their use shall not
relieve the governing board of its responsibility for ensuring periodic reviews are
conducted.
