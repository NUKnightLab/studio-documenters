RE:

Monthly Update

Board Members,
Success is what we strive for on a daily basis here at METRO. Our Fommunity is important and
SXblic transportation within our community is necessary for all of us to be successful. I am
encouraged by the way our METRO team is working to ensure that we are threads in the fabric of
this community, and we strengthen that fabric by weaving our goals and objectives with those of
the region and the agencies we serve. We have been busy as we accept invitations to come to
the tables of those in our community to discuss their challenges and how METRO can be a part of
the solutions that bring successes to our region. We are no longer forgotten at these tables. We
are an invited and wanted partner by cities, agencies, and other transit systems in our region. It is
a good feeling to be wanted and valued and we will continue to earn those seats at the tables of
our stakeholders and partners. Success is built on relationships and we continue to grow and are
#METROProud to be a part of the successes of our community.
Yours in accessible transportation,

Dawn Distler
Executive Director

Mr. Rector reported that, in Maintenance, 10 buses had been purchased for the SCAT
program, and they each had to be put through a process of preparation, orientation,
and training before they could join our fleet. Operations reported they had a staff
meeting. Unscheduled overtime was down overall, but with some increase compared to
last month. In Paratransit, all things were trending the same as the previous month.
FINANCE & AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Chair: Nicholas Fernandez
Mr. Fernandez reported that the Finance Committee met. The audit is going well with no
issues to report. Grants and Compliance Specialist Matt Mullen gave a short presentation

was approved by the Board.
PLANNING / MARKETING / RAIL COMMITTEE
Chair: Donald Christian
The Planning / Marketing / Rail Committee did not meet, but some updates were given
by Ms. Becker. The rebranding of METRO departments was discussed, and a chart
outlining the name and title changes was noted as being in the Board Packet. Signage
was placed throughout the building to help guide those looking for specific people or
departments. In the Bull Pen, the bulletin boards that were previously cluttered have been
removed in favor of digital displays. Bus Stop Birthday Bashes will begin taking place in
preparation for the 50th Birthday Celebration. Little Debbie has verbally agreed to
sponsor the birthday events in August. Some things to look forward to on the day of the
celebration are: 20+ vendors set up at RKPTC, a DJ, a photo booth, activities for kids,
Touch-A-Bus, and more. A partnership with the Countryside Farmers Market will allow
riders to use their SNAP card at the market, and then show the METRO flyer for free fare
to other markets. The METRO website has been updated with Board photos and bios.
An introduction was made of the new Senior Planner, Emily Baarson, who then gave the
Planning update. No actions were requested.

 THE APD GROUP
Chair: Louise Gissendaner
Mr. Rector reported that the APD Group (Asset Protection and Development) met. He
noted that the hours for the Employee Engagement Center (formerly Human Resources)
have been extended. New hours will be Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday from 6a-5p;
Wednesday 6a-7p; and Friday 7a-5p. The annual Family Picnic was June 12 and began
METRO’s 50 year celebration. The first monthly Labor and Management Discussion
meeting was held, with the goal of bringing up non-labor agreement concerns, and
improving communications.
Three employees left in May; two voluntarily, one involuntarily. July 11th and 17th will
be HR Days, and HR Days in the Bull Pen, respectively. Lost time accidents went from
12 last year to six this year, and an award was received from the BWC for the
accomplishment.
There were nine accidents in May; two were preventable, seven were not preventable.
There were 154,000 miles in between preventable accidents, compared to 138,000 miles
in April. The Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force will be presenting two courses on July
10th for staff and Board members to attend.
GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE
Chair: Gary Spring
Mr. Spring reported that the Governance Committee did meet. The Board bylaws were
reviewed and revised and were submitted to the Board. Some small changes occur in the
first part of the document, while Article 4 contains more significant changes. Deleting
the existing Section 3 would eliminate the reliance on the Board to set salary ranges for
each grade of classified position, and on the Executive Director to determine the salary of
each individual employee within that range. Deleting Section 4 would eliminate the
Board’s governing of appointments and promotions. Adding a new Section 3 would
outline when the Executive Director would be evaluated and how that would work. The
Governance Committee recommends the changes that were presented.
Mr. Spring made a motion to adopt the Board bylaws as presented with revisions. Mr.
Christian seconded the motion. All those present voted ‘yes.’ The revised bylaws
were approved by the Board.
OFFICERS’ REPORT
President:
Mr. DeJournett expressed appreciation for everyone’s involvement in the committees
because much work is getting done that way. He encouraged continued attendance at
those meetings. He indicated that meetings were being set up with the appointing
authorities for himself and Ms. Distler to promote communication on a regular basis.
Executive Director:
Ms. Distler emphasized that our focus right now is partnerships and being part of the
community. She was pleased with the “rebranding” process and the way that everyone
found a way to reflect what they wanted to accomplish every day. The reorganization
8

 and new signage will help direct employees to the department they need, rather than to
just an individual, and they will receive help from a team of people who care.
The partnerships she mentioned included that many of our directors are on boards
throughout the community, and we are staying involved. We meet regularly with the
county and the city, and are always looking for ways we can partner with them.
Ms. Distler indicated she had recently attended the APTA Board Meetings in Toronto, as
well as the Legislative Committee meetings. APTA is at the forefront of new
appropriations bills that Congress is already discussing. It is good to see public
transportation is not a partisan issue, but that it is seen as an investment. She encouraged
the board members to contact their legislators to let them know which transit issues the
Board supports. The APTA Legislative Committee made a recommendation to the board
of what is desired from the appropriations bill; the language and the amounts. If the bill
remains the way it is, the dollars will continue to diminish. Soon, it will not even sustain
what is needed to keep transit going, let alone to allow for growth. A large amount of
funding is needed across the nation for transit to survive. Ms. Distler appreciates the
opportunity to serve on the APTA Board and to represent METRO.
OTHER BUSINESS
None
ADJOURNMENT
There being no other business to come before the Board, Mr. Kremer made a motion to

and the meeting adjourned at 9:42 a.m.
CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE
Pursuant to Section III, Article 3.2 of the Rules & Regulations of the METRO Regional
Transit Authority, METRO has complied with the Notice and Notification to the public
and news media.

 Operations Monthly Update – June 2019
The training hours for the month of June totaled 956. The training consisted of New Hire Training,
Refresher Training, Line-Service training, Specialty Training, and mandatory training per the Preventable
Accident Policy.
On Tuesday, June 4, 2019, De Havilland McCall, Director of Operations, along with several members of
the Leadership Team, met with Valerie Shea, Director of Planning and Strategic Development, for a
presentation regarding Mobility Options. Ms. Shea encouraged the staff to “think outside of the bus” by
brainstorming various ways that METRO can find nontraditional methods to gain new and retain existing
riders. Ms. Shea and her dedicated team will meet with various stakeholders to gauge the transportation
needs of their employees as we continue to Drive METRO Forward.
Operations staff alternated mingling with retired METRO employees at the Annual Employee Picnic held
on Wednesday, June 12, 2019. A good time was had by all who attended. It was really nice to see
former employees who have recently retired, as well as those who have not visited METRO in over 15
years.
A special thank you to Jay Hunter, Director of Employee Engagement, for scheduling and facilitating a
Labor and Management meeting on June 18, 2019. Executive Board Members of T.W.U., (Transport
Workers Union of America) expressed their desire to meet on a regular basis with members of the
Leadership Team. This was a wonderful opportunity to hear the various concerns, comments and
suggestions made by all. The discussions were productive and it was decided that meetings will be
scheduled monthly.
Wednesday, June 19, 2019, the Customer Experience and Service Performance Committee met in the
Vernon Lane Odom Board Room located at 416 Kenmore. Chuck Rector reported the Committee notes
at the June 25, 2019 Board Meeting.
Director of Operations, De Havilland McCall participated in the Greater Akron Chamber
Opportunity and Inclusion Committee. A meeting was held at the Chamber’s Office on June 19,
2019. The committee’s task will be to guide the areas where the Chamber should focus its efforts first,
and identify where the Chamber can assist the business community in becoming more inclusive.
On June 24, 2019, a Representative from The Ohio Civil Rights Commission provided the Leadership
Team and other staff who have Direct Reports with a training regarding Legal Updates in Sex
Discrimination and Harassment. The Representative provided staff members an opportunity to ask
questions and to get clarification regarding various terminology and best practices.
