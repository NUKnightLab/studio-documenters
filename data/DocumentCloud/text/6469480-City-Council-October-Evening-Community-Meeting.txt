MEMORANDUM

TO: Ron Brundidge
Director, Department of Public Works

FROM: Councilman James E. Tate, Jr. T:
DATE: October 8, 2019
RE: Dangerous Sidewalk at 19955 Berg Rd

 

My of?ce has been informed about a dangerous sidewalk in front of the property
located at 19955 Berg Rd. According to the constituent, a tree was removed from
the middle of the sidewalk on August 13, 2019. Restoration was supposed to be
completed within two days of the removal but the sidewalk restoration has not
occurred. The sidewalk poses a signi?cant risk to public safety, exposes the City
to potential liability, and has a negative impact on the quality of life for residents
in the area.

Therefore, I am requesting that DPW inspect the condition of the sidewalk and
report back to my of?ce with your ?ndings as well as a plan and expected date to
address the defect. In addition, please explain why the restoration was not
completed within two days of the tree removal as originally indicated.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact DeAndree
Watson of my of?ce at (313) 224?0278. Thank you in advance for your prompt
attention to this matter.
