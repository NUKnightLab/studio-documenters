GENERAL BACKGROUND
As part of the Capital Improvement Program, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) solicited
bids for general contractors to perform re-roofing and exterior masonry work at Armour Square
Apartments (IL2-044), and Annex (IL2-033) as part of the CHA’s Senior Housing program. The
work will include, but not be limited to, the relocation of existing communications equipment,
cabling and supports, and project submittals and material procurement for both addresses to be
completed by no later than March 31, 2011. All remaining scope must be completed at both
addresses by no later than May 30, 2011.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (IFB) No. 10 – 0580 on July 29, 2010 for re-roofing and
exterior masonry work at 3146 S. Wentworth Ave. at Armour Square Apartments, and 3120 S.
Wentworth Ave. at Armour Square Annex. The IFB was advertised in the Chicago Sun-Times,
the Chicago Defender, El Dia, on the CHA website and on BuySpeed Online.
The Pre-bid meeting and Site Visit were held on August 6, 2010. The CHA issued Addendum
No. 1 on August 18, 2010. It changed the bid submittal date from August 23, 2010 to August 26,
2010, answered Requests for Information, altered the Technical Specifications, updated the
Special Conditions, and distributed a revised set of the BF pages. Addendum No. 2 was issued
on August 23, 2010 to provide information about the Online Contract Compliance System.
The CHA received and opened three (3) bids on August 26, 2010 at 10:00 am.
After reviewing the bid submittal materials, the Department of Procurement and Contracts and
the Capital Construction Department held a pre-award survey meeting with Tyler Lane
Construction, Inc., the apparent low bidder. The firm responded to questions on the thoroughness
of its bid, the amount of the work it planned to self-perform, and its capacity to perform this
work. The challenge presented by doing roofing and masonry work in winter weather conditions
was discussed in depth. The timing of the project, due to the need to relocate communications
equipment on the roof to provide access to the roof, was also addressed thoroughly.
Based on its submitted bid, the Department of Procurement and Contracts has determined that
Tyler Lane Construction, Inc. is the lowest responsive and responsible bidder at $638,000.00.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the CHA’s best interest for the Board of Commissioners to

and supports, and project submittals and material procurement must be completed by no later
than March 31, 2011. All remaining work must be completed by no later than May 30, 2011.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section
3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
