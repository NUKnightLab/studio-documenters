 BACKGROUND
To enhance collaboration and communication across the Chicago Housing Authority (“CHA”),
the CHA has chosen to strategically leverage Microsoft SharePoint (“SharePoint”). The
SharePoint Implementation project is slated to provide a solution to effectively leverage and
manage a variety of collaboration and communication tools (e.g., portals, on-line collaboration
spaces and workflow management).
Some objectives of the project include the following:
•
•
•
•

Develop a comprehensive intranet that defines and extends the agency’s universal
communication strategy and segments communication to internal target audiences
Develop a Resident Services Public Relations and Communications site that will assist in
managing up-to-date communications, providing employees real-time access to
headline/newsworthy information about the Authority
Develop an extranet-based Resident Services External Agencies site that allows internal
and external stakeholders (e.g., vendors) to easily access pertinent information (e.g.,
event calendar, training materials, etc.)
Develop an extranet-based Housing Choice Voucher site that facilitates processes such as
application changes, work order submissions and customer service requests

The CHA sought out the services of a vendor with experience in SharePoint web design &
implementation. The scope of these services includes:
•
•
•
•
•

A complete analysis of the existing SharePoint environment
Business requirements gathering
Prototype design
Intranet portal development
Targeted extranet-based applications
 PROCUREMENT INFORMATION

On March 29, 2010 the CHA advertised Request for Proposal No. 10-00505 Creation of
SharePoint Portal, Intranet Portal, Extranets & Related Tools. The solicitation sought both
business requirements gathering and implementation of a SharePoint Portal and externally facing
sites for the CHA. On April 7, 2010, the CHA held a Pre-Proposal Conference where 12
potential vendors attended in person. The initial due date of the proposals was April 29, 2010.
The Department of Procurement and Contracts (“DPC”) received a high volume of inquiries and
118 written questions from prospective vendors. Due to the volume and nature of questions, two
addendums were issued to amend the proposed contract structure and provide answers to the
questions. The due date of proposals was subsequently extended to May 21, 2010.
To effectively manage the phases of the SharePoint roll-out, the original RFP was amended to
more formally define each phase and checkpoint. Where the original RFP document requested a
fixed price proposal for all of the phases of work included, the amendment required a fixed price
proposal for the introductory phase (Requirements Gathering & Assessment) and each

 subsequent phase will be managed by task orders with agreed upon scope and deliverables. For
each task order, the selected vendor will provide a quote based on the estimated effort and prenegotiated hourly staffing rates. The CHA reserves the right not to dispatch a task order if order
pricing, deliverable(s) and/or the vendor’s proposed approach is inconsistent with the CHA’s
expectations.
A second Pre-Proposal Conference was held on May 11, 2010 to ensure that interested vendors
understood the nature of the changes to the proposed contract structure. The due date was
changed to May 21, 2010. On May 21, the CHA received 11 proposals. The Evaluation Team,
comprised of representatives from Information Technology Services, Resident Services and the
Housing Choice Voucher program reviewed each proposal and provided their individual scoring
results to the DPC.
Procurement set a competitive range of 70, which resulted in 6 of the 11 vendors being selected
to conduct Oral Presentations. To ensure that Oral Presentations provided a detailed
understanding of the key components of the proposed solution and the requirements outlined in
the RFP, the evaluation team devised an intensive Oral Presentation script that each vendor was
required to follow.
After Oral Presentations were completed, all scoring was submitted to the DPC and this resulted
in the selection of Rightpoint Consulting, LLC as the best vendor for this engagement. With an
average score of 111.26, Rightpoint was the highest scoring vendor for each phase of the
evaluation (written RFP response & Oral Presentation). Rightpoint initially submitted a “best
and final” pricing proposal of $112,515. The CHA’s team conducted a series of negotiation
meetings with Rightpoint to ensure a mutual understanding of the project’s scope and specific
elements of proposed pricing. Rightpoint subsequently adjusted their pricing accordingly,
submitting a final pricing offer of $89,435 for the Requirements Gathering and Assessment fixed
price portion of the project and an average hourly rate of $99.38 for successive task orders. This
average rate is comprised of $110 for SharePoint resources and $25 for administrative resources.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to enter into a one year contract
which incorporates a fixed fee component of $89,435 and a variable component accommodating
subsequent task orders not to exceed $660,565, constituting a total contract cost not to exceed
$750,000.
