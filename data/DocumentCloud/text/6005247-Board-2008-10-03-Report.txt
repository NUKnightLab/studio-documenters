REPORT FROM SYSTEM BOARD CHAIRMAN WARREN L. 

Meeting with Price Waterhouse Representatives

Chairman Baits, Director Greenspan, Director Lyne and David R. Small, Interim Chief ExecutiVe Of?cer of the
Cook County Health and Hospitals System, recently met with representatives from Price Waterhouse on the
subject of possibly bringing in a consulting ?rm to assist the Board in their improvement efforts. Chairman Batts
stated that Price Waterhouse is currently working with Grady Memorial and have made considerable progress
there. They have brought in forty to ?fty experienced people to work in every department at Grady Memorial,
and the savings as a result of their efforts may reach up to two hundred million dollars. He indicated that he is
contacting other consulting firms to discuss possibilities, and will report back to the Board on the progress.

Correspondence received from Cook County Commissioner

Chairman Batts stated that he had received a letter from a Cook County Commissioner, in which a request was
put forth for copies of all Board materials. Discussion continued on the subject, and the question relating to the
release ofdra? documents arose. Chairman Batts indicated that the documents upon which the Board acts and are
part of the record should be available; he was unsure whether some documents that are still in draft form should
be circulated until a ?nal opinion or position has been determined.

Director Carvalho noted that not every document that passes the eyes of the Board is a public document. He stated
that caution should be used, because the Board could be setting a precedent that may not be appropriate.

Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State?s Attorney and Chief of the Civil Actions Bureau of the Of?ce of the State?s
Attorney, re5ponded that he would discuss the request with the Commissioner to determine Speci?cally what he or
she is requesting.

System-wide Medical aws

Mr. Small indicated that meetings have been held with the presidents of the medical staffs and representatives

COMMITTEE REPORT
Finance Committee Meeting of 9-26-08*

note: Contracts and Procurement Items were reviewed and considered
by the Finance Committee members present at this meeting.

Director Carvalho stated that the Finance Committee members present at the September 26, 2008 meeting had a
full discussion of the items on the agenda, however they were unable to take action upon those items in the
absence of a quorum.

Director Carvalho informed the Board of the Finance Committee?s review of the following items:

0 Presentation of July 2008 Financials; and
0 Contracts and Procurement Approvals.

Information was provided by Mr. Small on a change in scheduling of the annual reconciliation with the State
from April to occur within the County?s current ?scal year. Typically there is a running balance which remains in
the account and is reviewed by the State toward the end of their ?scal year; if it is determined that the balance is
more than what is deemed necessary, they then adjust for future transfers and adjust the schedule going forward.
The State has been asked to accelerate that process. Mr. Small noted that there is not a request to draw the
account down to zero dollars; what has been requested is a draw down to eight million dollars.

Director Mu?oz asked for information on the balance of the account, both currently and from a historical
perspective.

Mr. Small stated that he could provide the informationz.

Director Carvalho noted that there would be a detailed presentation relating to intergovernmental transfers at an
upcoming Finance Committee meeting.

Further discussion took place on the subjects of intergovernmental transfers, costs, patient revenue accruals and
eligibility referrals. During this discussion, Chairman Batts inquired whether comparative data on a nation-wide
basis was available with regard to costs. He noted that if the volume is increased, the costs would typically be
decreased; this is not the case, as costs are also up.

Mr. Small responded that he would obtain the information3.

Director Carvalho then proceeded to describe the discussion that took place for the item listed on the September
26, 2008 Finance Agenda as ?Consideration and Approval of Preposed Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Cook County
Health and Hospitals System."

Director Carvalho prefaced the discussion by stating that a point has been reached, and although this is by no
means final, it needs to be entered into the County budget system so that the President can prepare his budget. It
then goes to the Commissioners and goes for public hearings. So the recommendation of the members of the
Finance Committee at the September 26th meeting was to authorize or concur with the recommendation for the
administration to enter the numbers at this point in the process as the current, best estimation of what resources
are needed in the 2009 budget. Recognizing that on a going-forward basis, there would be opportunities to adjust
prior to it getting printed and other opportunities to adjustjust as the whole budget is adjusted. He stated that this
was the plan of the Finance Committee and it is submitted to the Board for its consideration.

REPORT OF THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE

COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
OCTOBER 3, 2008

Page 6

Chairman Batts asked whether the Board should have a motion to approve the plan and then discuss it.

Director Carvalho deferred the question to counsel; it is a peculiar situation where the Board is in the middle of
the discussion on a Finance Committee report, which is where the plan was discussed, and the Committee did not
formally take action. He asked if acceptance of the plan by the Board would take place through the Board?s
acceptance of the report.

Mr. Driscoll responded that it would be appropriate to move the report, and this would be part of the report.

Director Carvalho stated that the only other items discussed at the committee meeting were the Contracts and
Procurement items; these would be addressed later in the meeting as they are listed separately for the Board?s
consideration and approval. He indicated that he would at this time make a motion to approve and accept the
report of the Finance Committee and thereupon have a full discussion.

Director Carvalho, seconded by Director Mur?ioz, moved to approve and accept the Report of the Finance
Committee for the meeting of September 26, 2008.

Director Carvalho explained that they started with 2003 ?gures as a baseline; adjustments were then made for
in?ation, cost-of?living adjustments and add-ons of highest priority items. He stated that what is presented is
what he would term a transition budget and a middle-ground budget. During the transition time of one year,
which is what he considers necessary to provide breathing room to ?illy get a handle on what needs to be done to
bring ?nancial health and ef?ciency to the System, the Board will be able to use the time to identify how to get
control over the critical issues, such as the high cost-per?adjusted?bed ?gures.

Director Carvalho stated that the ?exibility of the enabling Ordinance allows for the Board to determine the
savings and needs. At this time, there is no basis to identify by line-item position which should be cut or
transferred. But during the transition year, the message to the administration is to not spend or operate based on
the status quo. Rather, this time will be used to not spend what has been appropriated in some places and transfer
that to spend in other places, as through the course of the year the Strategic Planning Committee will determine
where savings could be made and where the needs are.

Director Carvalho clari?ed his previous statements made referring to a ?billion-dollar budget,? to clear up any
confusion. He stated that while the Board has thought it wise to think in terms of accrual and generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP), the County budget is a cash-basis budget. The Board?s discussion of the budget
has been based upon GAAP, however, the budget that will be submitted will not be a ?billion-dollar budget." The
overall figure for the System budget being discussed for 2009 on a cash-basis is actually$893 million.

Director Ansell referenced the identi?cation of a possible $35 million in savings, due to the potential
implementation of certain programs such as group purchasing and other efficiencies. He likened the possible
savings to a set-aside, for program growth to address areas of de?ciencies in the past. He inquired as to the
likelihood of passage of the budget as presented.

Director Carvalho stated that no other unit of County government put together its budget in public and discussed
in public its strategy for dealing with the negotiations that then ensue. However, the System Board must do so.
This budget is submitted to the President; he then looks at all the different County departments that have been
submitted to him.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE

COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM

With regard to revenue streams, Director Carvalho stated that the System Board has been mindful of what is
thought to be a fair allocation. He continued, stating that it has been mentioned in past meetings of the Finance
Committee that the needs of the health system were an important factor in developing the political will for the
extension of the sales tax and accordingly, the needs of the health system have an important claim on these
resources as long as the System Board can assure that they will be handled effectively and ef?ciently and meet
the needs of the population of the County.

Mr. Small added that the information was presented to the Board in a picture. The Board can see what
comprises the ?ll] expense, even though some of those dollars are not directly appropriated to the System. 1With
regard to the subject of revenue streams, he provided information relating to Fiscal Year 2008 revenue funding,
and stated that the System needs to present a budget for 2009 which then allows for discussion With the
Commissioners on how much local tax dollar support is needed, inclusive of whatever the new tax revenue
streams are. Additionally, he stated that within the next sixty days, a hill operating redesign plan will be
presented that is designed to achieve the savings and circumstances that will allow for the redirection of the
resources.

Director Zopp stated that on' the administrative side, there is a need for more people in areas such as human
resources and corporate compliance, but overall, this budget has over four hundred new positions. In an
environment where the Board is looking at FTE numbers above where they need to be, the Board needs to be
conscious that there is good justi?cation to do that going forward. And the Board needs to understand that some
things will have to be taken out. Otherwise the Board will be subject to signi?cant criticism.

Questions were raised with regard to new positions for speci?c institutions. Chairman Batts inquired and it was
con?rmed that the section listed as the Bureau of Heath Services was the corporate of?ce; he added that this is
where a large number of new positions are listed. Stroger Hospital also has a large number of new positions listed.
He stated that when the Board comes forward with the 2010 budget, it will hopefully contain less, or only contain
no more money than in?ation will force them to ask for.

Director Zopp clarif" ed her earlier comments. She stated that she did not mean to suggest that the Board should
be deleting positions. Because of the challenges associated with a line item budget, if the System needs positions,
then they must ask for them. However, there must be deep oversight going forward because the System ought to
be able to reduce their expenses relating to FTE costs, not increase them.

Director Carvalho added that 1n exchange for a commitment to greater results, there should be a greater ?exibility
in budgeting.

Director Lyne inquired into the request for one hundred new positions under the Bureau of Health Services. She
indicated that with regard to procurement and supply chain positions, this would seem to be an example where
new positions should not be placed when strategy is still an issue. 

Mr. Small indicated that in the background material, under Tab 3, there is a listing for the Bureau of Health
Services? new administrative positions."_ In addition, the pharmacy positions are added and information
technology services positions are housed under this section, under the 890 budget. -

With regard to questions raised by Director Ansell on the Board?s limitations relating to budget and line item 
?exibility, Mr. Driscoll stated that the System's budget is impacted by constraints imposed by the County Board.

REPORT OF THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE

COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
- OCTOBER 3, 2008

Chairman Batts indicated that in meetings with Cook County's Chief Financial Officer and the Director of Budget
and Management Services, it was stated that an opinion has been requested as to whether or not it is legally
required that the System have a line item budget. He stated that the opinion is forthcoming.

Mr. Driscoll provided additional insight into the matter. He stated that state law does not require a line item
budget; it does require some detail. For years, Cook County has adopted a line-item budget, so if the County will
mandate and continue to use the line item budget, then the System Board will have to submit a line item budget as
part of the County budget.

Chairman Batts pointed out that the Ordinance states that after the 2009 Budget is approved, then the System
Board does have some ?exibility to move within the line items, through the usage of intra-fund transfers.

Chairman Batts stated that the Board needed to decide whether to approve this or recommend this to the County
Commissioners, or not. He reminded the Board that there was a motion on the ?oor to approve the
recommendation. He asked whether there was ?rrther discussion at this point.

Director O?Donnell inquired whether, if the Board?s action at this time was to approve the recommendation, the
clock would begin running on the number of days in which the County Board would need to act on the System
Board?s recommendation.

Chairman Batts stated that there are meetings already scheduled. There is a meeting on October 20lh with
President Todd H. Stroger. On October there is a meeting scheduled with County Finance Committee
Chairman and Commissioner John P. Daley to discuss the budget. The Board will be kept apprised on the
progress of the discussions. He stated that he thought the Board should proceed, to get the process going and try
to work with the County to come up with a budget that the System can move forward on. He pointed out that
until a budget is approved, the System Board is somewhat paralyzed in all of the changes that they would like to
get started. He stated that if there were no further questions, he would like to move this to a vote.

On the motion to approve and accept the Report of the Finance Committee for the meeting of September
26, 2008, a voice vote was taken and THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Director Carvalho stated that this proposed amendment had been recommended by the Board to be discussed by
the Finance Committee; he suggested that the Board think about the idea for future consideration. It would work
similarly to the way the rule that was recently amended with regard to appointments considered by the Quality
and Patient Safety Committee. If the proposed amendment was passed, the contract matters approved at the
Finance Committee level would be considered to have Board approval at the time of approval by the Finance
Committee; these items would be incorporated in the minutes of the Finance Committee for the Board?s receipt
and ?ling, thereby decreasing the gap of time between Finance Committee approval and the subsequent approval
of the Board.

In response to questions regarding limitations of approval authority, Mr. Driscoll stated that the amendment had
been drafted by the State?s Attorney?s Of?ce in the broadest terms. -

Director Carvalho noted that speci?c language was not discussed previously; the amendment was drafted as a
starting point for ?Jture discussions on the subject.

Director Lyne, seconded by Director Mu?oz, moved to defer the Proposed Amendment to the Rules of the
Board of Directors of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System to the next meeting of the Board on
October 16, 2003. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

PRESENTATION BY INFORMATION SERVICES
ON THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STATUS

Mr. Small gave a brief overview of the System?s contract currently in place with ACS. This started in January of
2007, and over a three year period they are managing, and to a large extent, helping staff the System's information
services activities.

Charles Bracken, Managing Director of ACS, provided a brief overview from a historical perspective of the
information services activities.

Julie Bonnello, Chief Information Officer for the Cook County, introduced the information technology leadership
team.

'Mr. Bracken and Ms. Bonnello proceeded to provide the presentation on the System?s information technology
status. (See Attachment They responded to questions raised by Directors with regard to needs and speci?c
projects. Some operational challenges and issues raised during the discussion related to training and capital
needs. Additional information on information services activities was provided for speci?c institutions within the
System, including Cermak Health Services, Provident HOSpital and the Ambulatory and Community Health
Network.

Director Ansell requested that the project plan include all of the institutions on one sheets. Additionally, he asked
whether there was a strategic plan for the information technology rollout for the System. He stated that he would
like to have the Quality and Patient Safety review and discuss it in an ongoing way.

Mr. Small indicated that he has the strategic plan for the rollout; he can present it on a'regular basis?.

Director Carvalho inquired into the issue of capital needs. He mentioned that it was stated that some of the capital
needs have already been approved in 2008; he wondered why these needs have not yet been ful?lled if they have
already been approved. He asked which needs referenced in the presentation are not included in the already
approved capital requests.

Mr. Small indicated that a status report on 2008 capital has just been compiled. He stated that he was going to
