RE: GSD: District 6 DFD Concerns

 

Please respond to the following questions regarding the Detroit Fire Department:

During a recent visit to fire houses in District 6 it came to my attention that the ground maintenance
falls to the firefighters on site.
a. Whose responsibility is it to maintain the grounds at each fire house/engine?
b. If it is not GSD's, how do we shift this to GSD's purview?
c. What are the staff and budgetary implications for doing this?

2. What is the status of completing the following capital improvement projects at:
0 Engine 29, 7610 Jefferson: Roof repair
0 Ladder 22, 6830 McGraw: Roof and gutter repair and window replacement

3. Engine 34 (6345 Livernois) has experienced multiple power outages.
a. What can be done to improve the facility to prevent this?
b. What outreach has been done to DTE to address this problem?
0. Lastly, when a generator has been supplied to the fire house it is placed in the alley with a
padlock. Due to the dangerous conditions in the alley, can the generator be placed in the
parking lot?
