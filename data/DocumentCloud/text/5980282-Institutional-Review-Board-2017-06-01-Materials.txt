Approval of Meeting Minutes – August 18, 2016.
Dr. Harrington asked for any comments regarding the meeting minutes of August 18,
2016. Dr. Harrington wanted to clarify a statement on page 3, in the second paragraph,
where it stated, “Dr. Harrington stated that his comments were just suggestions; they are
not really needed.” He stated that the suggestions were best practices for research ethics,
although not required by the federal regulations. The “not really needed” part could be
“not required by the federal regulations.”
Vote: Ms. Laudermilk moved to approve the minutes. Dr. Cooper seconded the motion.
The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.

Megan Alderden). This proposal was approved through the expedited review process in
November 2016.

VIII.

Amendment Application Review:
A. Impact of Legislative Changes on the IDOC Prison Population (Christine Devitt)
Protocol Change: The project methodology is being modified to include criminal history
records of the cohort included in the study, which consists of all persons exiting from the
Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) in state fiscal year 2015. Research staff from
ICJIA will match the IDOC records to the corresponding criminal history records
available in the Illinois Criminal History Record Information (CHRI) System, using last
name, first name, and date of birth. The individuals’ complete state criminal history
records will be pulled from the CHRI System Ad Hoc Database. The IDOC and CHRI
files will be combined, stripped of all identifiers, and disseminated to James Austin at
JFA Institute, the principle investigator responsible for developing the state-specific
sentencing model. This de-identified data file will not be shared with any researcher
outside of JFA Institute, including the co-principle investigator at Rutgers University.
Discussion: Dr. Harrington asked if the addendum changes the de-identified status of the
information. Ms. Devitt replied that ICJIA only provides de-identified data to the
researchers. They do not need the identifiers in their model. Dr. Harrington stated that he
does not see any additional risk so it would qualify similarly as the original protocol.
Vote: Dr. Cooper made a motion to approve. Ms. Laudermilk seconded the motion. The
motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
B. Evaluation of Safe Passage (Jessica Reichert)
Protocol Change: We would like to obtain more demographic information from the Safe
Passage Initiative Client Intake Form. We would like first and last name, date of birth,
race/ethnicity. The Dixon Police Department will electronically send an encrypted file by
secure email the identifying information of clients to the PI (ICJIA Research Manager).
The identifying information received from Dixon will be destroyed once no longer
needed.
We will use name and date of birth to pull their criminal history record information to
compare arrest activity before and after participation in Safe Passage. ICJIA researchers
will link the names to arrest data. Identifiers are needed to link to electronic Criminal
History Record Information (CHRI). After the data is gathered, a unique id code can

 replace their name, so the database is de-identified. All data will be saved on secure,
password-protected computer. The names will be under the researcher’s exclusive control
and will not be shared in any written publication. With a relatively small sample size,
care will be taken to maintain our participants’ confidentiality.
We would like to add interviews with treatment providers who provide services for those
Safe Passage clients with substance use disorders. Questions and consent form are
attached.
Consent Procedure Change: For the analysis of the intake form data, we were approved
for a waiver of consent due to our use of administrative, de-identified data.
Consent Document Change: Adding a consent form.
Discussion: Dr. Harrington asked if the consent forms were for just the 10 treatment
providers. Ms. Reichert stated “correct.” Dr. Long asked if there was another way of
asking Question 41, “Do you think police need more training?” She said the question
might lead someone to think that the researchers think police need more training. Dr.
Cooper stated that Ms. Reichert may want to ask whether someone in the individual
organizations could better speak to treatment provided under the Safe Passage Initiative.
He said an organization’s executive director may know more than individual treatment
providers.
Vote: Dr. Cooper moved to approve. Ms. Laudermilk seconded the motion. The motion
passed by unanimous voice vote.
IX.

Dr. Mock introduced Caitlin Delong as the new IRB manager.

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. PROJECT SUMMARY
1. Please provide a brief summary (3 – 5 sentences), in lay terms, of the purpose of the study
and the procedures subjects will undergo.
Researchers will survey and interview police agency staff about current police-led substance
use disorder diversion initiatives operating in Illinois. The purpose is to learn more about the
characteristics and implementation issues of these initiatives. These initiatives are new, but
growing across the country, and more information is needed to understand how they operate,
ways in which they differ, and the challenges and successes of these initiatives to inform other
police agencies interested in implementing similar initiatives.

 B. PROCEDURES
2. Describe the procedures involving human subjects and list the steps you will take.
Include the following information:
Participants will be told that there are two components: a survey documenting information about
program sustainability and an interview about program design and implementation. Participants
will be offered the opportunity to voluntarily complete both of these components.
Component 1: Online survey (Program Sustainability Assessment Tool)
a.) Time involvement of subjects: Participants will be asked to complete a 10 minute on-line
survey documenting information related to implementation and sustainability.

b.) Location(s) the study will be conducted with subjects, including a description, if applicable:
Participants will be able to complete the survey using any PC or mobile device.

c.) Amount of payment to subject, if any (consent form must note plan for payment if they
withdraw voluntarily): No compensation will be offered.
d.) What subjects will experience or do: After reviewing the informed consent form and
agreeing to participate in the study by clicking agree, participants will be asked 40 questions
that measure factors associated with program implementation and sustainability.
Participants will be informed that they may choose to answer any question and may stop
the survey at any time.
Component 2: Interview
a.) Time involvement of subjects: 30 minutes to 1 hour

b.) Location(s) the study will be conducted with subjects, including a description, if applicable:
In-person or by telephone depending on distance, resources, and respondents’ preference
and schedule.

c.) Amount of payment to subject, if any (consent form must note plan for payment if they
withdraw voluntarily): No compensation will be offered.
d.) What subjects will experience or do: Researchers will review the informed consent form with
potential participants. After signing and scanning and emailing a consent form (if not in
person), subjects will be asked to answer questions about their initiative and opinions
related to their initiative. Participants will be asked if they are willing to be audio-recorded
during the consent procedure. They will be informed about the voluntary nature of this
request and that they may still complete an interview should they choose not to be
recorded. Participants will be informed that they may choose to answer any question and
may stop the interview or audio recording of the interview at any time.

C. EQUITABLE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS

Administrative data

Recruitment

X

Researchers will identity potential agencies through a web search and by consulting national
and state experts in this area, including TASC and PAARI (Police Assisted Addiction and
Recovery Initiative). The agency chiefs or other identified personnel will be contacted for
potential participation. Participants will be told that there are two components associated with
the study: a survey documenting information about program sustainability and an interview
about program design and implementation.
At the end of the interview, those who participate in the interviews will also be asked if they
know of other programs in the state that we could contact.

5. Identify the criteria for inclusion/exclusion of subjects and provide a clear rationale for
them.
Researchers will include all police programs and initiatives of this type that are identified in
Illinois. Only these programs will be examined as the purpose is to learn more about how these
programs have been designed and implemented.

D. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT
6. Briefly describe the potential benefits of the project to subjects and/or to society. Note:
Social science research typically does not provide a direct benefit to the subjects.
There are no direct benefits for participating in this study. This study, however, will document
program design, implementation, and sustainability information that may help participants
further refine their programs. The information may also help guide program development and
implementation decisions in other Illinois jurisdictions interested in these diversionary
programs.

Interviews will be audio recorded, if participants consent, using hand-held recording devices.
The audio-recordings will be saved on secure, password protected servers only accessible to
the research staff and deleted from the recording devices within 48 hours of the interview.
The recordings will be transcribed in computerized word processing files stored securely on
the Authority servers. Only the researchers affiliated with this project will have access to the
transcriptions. No identifying information will be recorded during the transcription process.
The audio-recordings and the transcriptions will be maintained separately. Additionally, the
items (audio-recordings and transcriptions) will be maintained separately from the signed
informed consent forms. The informed consent forms will be maintained in a locked file
cabinet accessible only to the researchers.

b). What will be done with the still photos, video, or audio recordings after the study has been
completed? Will this information be destroyed, kept xx number of years, used in publications,
etc.? How does the investigator(s) define “completion” of the study?
Audio-recordings on the recording devices will be erased within 48 hours of recording. The
recordings will be transcribed in computerized word processing files will be stored securely on
the Authority computers and servers. Audio recordings saved to the Authority servers will be
destroyed after completion of the project. Completion is defined as publication of a final
report. The transcriptions, which will not contain identifying information, will be destroyed
three years after completion of the project. The transcriptions will be coded by researchers to
identify themes, which will be used to provide general descriptions of program design
elements and implementation and sustainability issues.

17. Will names or individual identifiers of subjects be recorded? If YES, answer a through d
below.
Yes

X

No

a.) Where will the names or other individual identifiers be recorded (e.g., on test protocols,
on a separate list with code numbers, etc.)?
Individual identifiers will be recorded on the informed consent forms used for the
interviews. The informed consent forms will be maintained separately from the interview
audio-recordings, interview notes, and transcripts.
Participants will also be asked if they would like their agency and contact information made
available for public dissemination at the end of the report. This information would not be
linked to the survey and interview findings, but rather as a list of agencies that currently
have programs operating in Illinois. Agencies may choose to have their information shared
even if they do not participate in a survey or interview or vice versa.

 b.) Describe project procedures for maintaining the security of these records at every point in
the data collection process.
Signed consent forms will be kept secure in a locked file cabinet accessible only to
research staff. Electronic interview and survey data will be kept on secure, password
protected servers and computers accessible only to research staff.
Online survey data will be collected using Qualtrics. Qualtrics safeguards all customer
data, and uses secure data centers to ensure the highest protection as per HITECH
requirements. HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
Act) complies with HIPAA rules to ensure that data are properly protected and best security
practices followed.

(Authority). You may skip any questions you do not want to answer. If you decide to
participate, you are free to withdraw at any time without affecting those relationships.
Approximately 10 people may be involved in this research.
What is the purpose of this research?
Researchers at the Authority are evaluating the police deflection initiatives in Illinois. The
interview will provide information on the characteristics and implementation of those types of
initiatives.
What procedures are involved?
You will be asked to participate in a research interview.
What are the potential risks and discomforts?
To the best of our knowledge, completing the interview will have no more risk of harm than you
would experience in everyday life.
Are there benefits to taking part in the research?
This study is not designed to benefit you directly. This study is designed to learn more about
police deflection initiatives in Illinois. The study results may be used to guide and inform your
deflection initiative; the public, practitioners, and policy makers; other deflection initiatives; and
other communities interested in starting similar deflection initiatives.
What other options are there?
You have the option to not participate in this study.

 Interview- Police Diversion Initiatives

What about privacy and confidentiality?
With your permission, we would like to audio-record the interview. This is to make sure we
capture everything you tell us in the interview and convey your responses accurately. Please
know the following about recordings:
•
•
•
•
•

Only the researchers working on this project will have access to the audio recording.
The recording will be transcribed. Recordings and transcripts will be kept confidential.
All interview notes and recordings will be electronically stored on password-protected
computers and servers.
Recordings will be destroyed once the final report is complete.
Transcripts will be destroyed three years following publication of the findings or results.

You may still participate in the interview even if you choose not to be recorded. In such a case,
researchers will take notes using pencil and paper.
To date, there are a small number of deflection initiatives in Illinois (we are aware of less than
ten in the state). The interview responses will be aggregated and used to generally describe the
characteristics, barriers and challenges, successes, and issues around capacity and sustainability.
Although no information will be directly attributed to your program, it is possible someone
might attribute the findings to you or your program.
What are the costs for participating in this research?
There are no costs.
Will I be reimbursed for any of my expenses or paid for my participation in this research?
There is no reimbursement.
Can I withdraw or be removed from the study?
If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw your consent and discontinue participation at
any time without penalty. At any time, you can take a break or stop the interview.
Who should I contact if I have questions?

 Program Sustainability Assessment Tool
This tool is to be used to assess current and ongoing program capacity and sustainability. It is to be administered at the
planning, development, and implementation phases. The responses collected will identify strengths and challenges.
Responses will differ at different phases of program development. In the initial phases you may not have responses to
some of the questions. That is to be expected. Results can be used for decision-making and planning with respect to
assessment and sustainability.
In the following questions, you will rate your program across a range of specific factors that affect sustainability. Please
respond to as many items as possible. If you truly feel you are not able to answer an item, you may select “NA.” For each
statement, circle the number that best indicates the extent to which your program has or does the following things.
When completed, review your program's summary Sustainability Report from the Program Sustainability Assessment
Tool. The report results will provide a snapshot of your program’s current sustainability capacity. Discuss any surprises
in the results and differences in opinion about scores. Note that there is no score that can guarantee a program’s
sustainability. Low scores in a domain are deserving of attention and opportunities to review and make planning
decisions. Domain scores serve as guideposts and are a starting point for discussion rather than an end point.

Individual identifiers will be recorded on pre- and post-tests. These identifiers are needed
to match the pre- and post-tests and to link to administrative data on the client.

b.) Describe project procedures for maintaining the security of these records at every point in
the data collection process.
Online survey data will be obtained through Qualtrics. Qualtrics safeguards all customer
data, and uses secure data centers to ensure the highest protection as per HITECH
requirements. HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
Act) updated HIPAA rules to ensure that data are properly protected and best security
practices followed.
At the close of the pre- and post-tests, ICJIA researchers will download a dataset and link
the pre- and posttest data along with the other administrative data collected by research
staff. This dataset will then be stripped of the identifiers and a unique id number will be
used in place of identifiers. Only the final, de-identified dataset will be used to analyze the
data.

Unable to provide

Not applicable

a.) If you are unable to provide the script or consent form, please explain why.
22. Please give a detailed description of the process that will be used to obtain consent and
answer all applicable questions:
a.) Who will obtain consent? Consent forms for administrative data will be administered by
licensed substance use treatment providers that serve Safe Passage clients including
Gateway, Rosecrance, Chestnut Health Systems, Unity Point, and Banyan. Consent for
the pre- and posttest survey data will be made available on-line through the on-line
survey software. Participants will be asked to review the consent materials and click
agree if they wish to participate.

b.) How will consent be obtained?
Online consent for pre- and post-test.
Paper form for administrative data.

c.) How often will consent be obtained (e.g., longitudinal or long-term field studies)?
Once for administrative records at intake to treatment provider services.
Each time a client takes the pre- or post-test.

d.) How will you verify the subject fully understands the consent? The online and hard copy
consent forms are written in a 9th grade or lower reading level. The consent forms will
provide contact information for the principal investigator, the Authority’s attorney/IRB
secretary to request further information about the studies, their rights as a research
participant, and the initiative.

e.) How will your investigators be trained to use the informed consent process?
Treatment provider staff are experienced in obtaining consent regarding the use of
health and treatment records. These records will be maintained in a secure location by
treatment provider staff. Researchers will periodically travel to the sites to obtain the
forms, which will then be placed in a locked file cabinet accessible only to research
staff.
All Authority research staff are certified in the National Institutes of Health Office of
Extramural Research’s web-based training course “Protecting Human Research
Participants.”

23. Will/is the consent form be translated for non-English speaking participants?
Yes

No

X

a.) If NO, please explain why.

 All participants are expected to be English speakers. According to the U.S. Census
Bureau (July 2015), 5% of Lee, 12% of Whiteside, and 6% of Livingston county residents
are Hispanic or Latino, and therefore, likely less to be non-English speaking.

b.) If YES, please provide an explanation of who will/did translate the forms and their
qualifications.
24. Does the consent form you have attached fully comply with the Authority’s instructions for
consent forms that are in compliance with general requirements as outlined in the Code of Federal
Regulations 46.116 and the Authority’s IRB procedures? Please refer to the checklist.

1.) Please provide a brief summary or abstract of your study.
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the Illinois Family Violence Coordinating
Council’s (IFVCC) trainings on model protocols and mini-tool kits for assisting victims of
domestic violence, elder abuse, and abuse of persons with disabilities. The evaluation will
help make suggestions for programmatic enhancements and document progress toward its
goals. The IFVCC was awarded a 3 year grant from the a US Department of Justice Office
on Violence Against Women Grant and the training evaluation is administered and
coordinated by ICJIA staff. Subjects will complete pre- and post –tests. The tests are
voluntary, and anonymous. ICJIA staff and IFVCC’s Evaluation Committee have created
tests for the following protocols:
1. Law Enforcement Domestic Violence Training
2. Law Enforcement Elder Abuse and Persons with Disabilities Training
3. Prosecutor Domestic Violence Training
4. Prosecutor Elder Abuse and Persons with Disabilities Training
5. Court Personnel Promising Practices and Mini-Tool Kit
6. Emergency Medical Services Promising Practices and Mini-Tool Kit
7. Probation Promising Practices and Mini-Tool Kit
8. 911 Telecommunicators Promising Practices and Mini-Tool Kit

2.) Please provide a brief statement of the progress made since the initial approval.
Authority researchers drafted a preliminary report based upon 182 pre-tests and 173 posttests from nine trainings conducted by IFVCC. In addition, 61 pre/post-test were received in
March 2017 from two trainings. We will continue to collect pre/post-test through September
30, 2017.

3.) Please indicate why this renewal is being requested.
We need to continue data collection through September 30, 2017, the end of the federal
fiscal year, to complete a report for the Office for Violence Against Women, IFVCC’s
