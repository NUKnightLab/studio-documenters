PROPOSAL:

Vince Shillcut / Nathan Harvey seeks to add a Rental Hall to an
existing 8,000 square foot Office building denial reversed by BZA
(40-18) in a B4 zone (General Business District). This case is
appealed because the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be
authorized to hear dimensional variance requests for matters that
are beyond the scope of Buildings and Safety Engineering
Department ten percent (10%) administrative adjustments and for
a variance from the required location of off-street parking facilities
or the amount of off-street parking facilities required, or both,
where, after investigation by the Board, it is found that such
modification is necessary to secure an appropriate development
of a specific parcel of land, provided, that any such modification
will not be inconsistent with other requirements and general
purpose of this Zoning Ordinance; per section 61-14-40; 100 (one
hundred) parking spaces are required, 16 (sixteen) are currently
proposed and 61-14-221 – Right of Way Screening; the wrought
iron fence should be between 30 inches but not more than 36
inches in height; the proposed fence is 6 inches, therefore
variances are required by the BZA. (Sections 61-4-91(1) Permitted
Dimensional Variances, Location or Amount of Off-Street-Parking
and 61-4-81 Approval Criteria).AP

PROPOSAL:

Yahya Hammoud seeks to construct a 972 square foot addition to an
existing 5,029 square foot Motor Vehicle Filling Station with an existing
Carry-Out Restaurant DENIED by BSEED (181-17) in a B4 zone (General
Business District). This case is appealed because the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall hear and decide appeals from and review any order,
requirement, decision, or determination that is made by an
administrative official in the administration of this Zoning Ordinance, or
any decision made by the Buildings and Safety Engineering Department
involving Conditional Uses, Regulated Uses, or Controlled Uses, or any
denial of a site plan by the Planning and Development Department;
petitioner proposes to ADD another carry-out restaurant to the existing
Domino’s Pizza; and 36 off-street parking spaces are required, 26
proposed; the site is located in Traditional Main Street Overlay District,
as the new building is not located on the property lot line – O (zero) line
setback; therefore if the denial of the use is overturned, variances will
be required. NOTE: If the denial is overturned an additional fee is
required to HEAR the variances and an additional FEE will be required.
Should the petitioner want both APPEALS heard on the same day the
additional FEE must be paid; and if the denial is upheld the additional
fee will not be refunded. The petitioner may elect to hear the cases
separate therefore the additional fee would not be assessed until the
denial is decided. (Sections Setbacks 61-4-92 Other Variances, 61-3-231
Approve Criteria – Conditional Land Use (If Approved then 61-4-81
