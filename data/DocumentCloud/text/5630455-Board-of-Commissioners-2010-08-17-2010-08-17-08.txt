On July 13, 2010, CHA received notice of an award of $2,000,000 from DFSS to provide
600 CHA youth ages 16 – 24 with job training, skill development and employment
opportunities through Y.E.S. CHA will ratify an amendment to the following contracts to
provide job training and employment opportunities to eligible CHA youth at worksites
throughout Chicago:

Employment & Employer Services (Contract No. 9037 for Transitional Jobs);
TEC Services, Inc. (Contract No. 9038 for Transitional Jobs).

E&ES and TEC will collaborate with CHA’s case management providers to recruit
participants for this summer employment opportunity with a focus on the community
areas not served by the JobStart program. CHA youth participating in Y.E.S. will receive
workforce services including job readiness training, a subsidized job placement through
September 30, 2010 and supportive services (e.g. transportation and child care
assistance). Participants will be placed in a subsidized position for a minimum of four (4)
weeks, work for up to 40 hours per week and earn a wage of $8.25 per hour. Participants
attending school will have the opportunity to work part-time through September 30.
Upon completion of the subsidized placement, participants not enrolled in school will
receive unsubsidized placement assistance and continued retention services through their
FamilyWorks case management provider.
