accomplishments and contributions throughout his 39 years of life; and
WHEREAS, Adrian Willoughby was a devoted husband, son, brother and uncle who affected countless
lives; and
WHEREAS, Adrian Willoughby was deeply committed to economic, racial, and social justice and
dedicated his life to providing affordable housing, shelter for the homeless, and dignified conditions for
those in need; and
WHEREAS, Adrian Willoughby was born March 16, 1979 in Belize City, Belize, the oldest of five
children. He was known for his playful demeanor with his younger siblings and his independence and sense
of style. As a student in Catholic schools in Belize, he insisted to his mother that the brown and yellow
button shirts and slacks didn’t reflect his style. The compromise was to be able to wear yellow Lacoste polo
shirts; and
WHEREAS, Adrian Willoughby moved with his family to Evanston at the age of 16. When his father died
two (2) years later, it was particularly hard on him; but he embraced his new role as man-of-the-house. His
younger sisters remember him as a protector and father-figure; and
WHEREAS, Adrian Willoughby was a pioneer in the online world. In 1997, that meant chat rooms where
he met his wife, Cindi Dingman, a fellow high school student in California. The long-distance relationship
grew and after he graduated from high school, Adrian traveled to California to meet her. They were married
in 2002. They eventually moved to Rogers Park, and then into a Reba’s Place affordable housing unit so
they could save money to purchase their current home in the Fifth Ward; and
WHEREAS, Adrian Willoughby attended Oakton Community College and Colorado Technical
University, initially majoring in political science. He worked for more than a decade at Grainger where he
was in charge of on-boarding, project management, and disaster planning. Adrian was well-loved and
respected at Grainger, so much so that they developed an informal motto of WWAD, “What would Adrian
21

do?” At his farewell party, colleagues bid him good-by wearing T-shirts and holding mugs emblazoned
with the slogan; and
WHEREAS, Adrian Willoughby’s commitment to economic, racial, and social justice led him to seek
volunteer opportunities at Reba Place Development Corp., where he was soon hired as a project manager.
Three years later, he had risen to the role of Executive Director. Adrian embodied Reba’s mission “to
develop safe, decent, and affordable housing, demonstrating how Evanston’s diverse racial and cultural
groups can thrive together.” Adrian’s colleagues describe him as a gentle man with strong convictions and
dreams of building homes in Evanston that people could afford; and
WHEREAS, in addition to his full-time work, Adrian Willoughby was actively engaged civically, serving
as a member of Joining Forces for Affordable Housing - Connections for the Homeless, Interfaith Action
of Evanston, multiple political campaigns, and engaging in various advocacy and consultant work; and
WHEREAS, Adrian Willoughby’s interest in global and local politics was likely sparked by his uncle,
Stuart Leslie, who served as the Belizean Representative to the United Nations, Chief Elections Officer,
and Ambassador of Trade in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and
WHEREAS, Adrian Willoughby was a man of faith. As a parishioner of Vineyard Christian Fellowship of
Evanston, he modeled those values in his life. He believed that God had a purpose for each and every one
of us, and that is was up to us to strive to identify and embrace that purpose; and
WHEREAS, Adrian Willoughby also knew how to have fun. He was a consummate host. No one’s cup
ever ran dry at his home. He was a fervid White Sox fan and loved spending time at his lake house looking
out over the water, just as he had done as a child. He particularly enjoyed the annual Willoughby summer
party, yearly pilgrimages to Myrtle Beach, and camping trips with friends; and
WHEREAS, Adrian Willoughby will be sorely missed by all who knew him. He is survived by his wife,
Cindi-Marie Willoughby; his mother Judith Willoughby; siblings Deven Harmon, Andrew Willoughby,
Desiree Miller and Megan Levy; brothers-in-law Jeff Dingman, Reggie Harman, Patrick Levy, and Eugene
Miller III; nephews Wayne Levy and Reggie Harman; and nieces Maddie Harmon and Azyra Tuggle. He
is preceded in death by his father Wayne Willoughby, grandfather Lindy Leslie, and father-in-law William
Halver Dingman.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on behalf
of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County takes great pleasure in honoring and celebrating Adrian
Willoughby’s 39 years of life and his many contributions bettering the lives of the residents of Evanston
