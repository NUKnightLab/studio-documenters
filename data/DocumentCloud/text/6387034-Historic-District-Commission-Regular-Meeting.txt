PREPARED BY: A. PHILLIPS

SCOPE: ERECT NEW REAR PORCH AND DECK
EXISTING CONDITIONS
The building located at 2475 Edison Street is a 2 ½-story single-family residence constructed in 1919. The structure is
clad in variegated red brick. Records indicate that house once featured stucco and wood detailing but that it was
covered in vinyl (including window replacement) in the late 1990s. The side-gabled roof is covered in gray asphalt
shingles and features two arched-top dormers—each with a single double-hung window—on the front (Edison Street)
façade. A small arched-top portico exists above the main entrance of the asymmetrical front façade. Additionally, a
raised porch with railing exists at the majority of the width of the front façade and is access by four steps set slightly
off-center. The rear yard is fenced and includes a garage at the far southeast corner of the lot which is accessed from
the driveway located directly adjacent (east) of the house. At one time, the rear façade of the house included a twostory porch, however, it has been recently removed.

 PROPOSAL
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s retroactive approval to demolish the existing
rear porch and erect a new two-story wood porch as well as a new rear deck area per the attached drawings
and application.
STAFF OBSERVATIONS & RESEARCH
• The rear yard/project area is not visible from right-of-way
• November 2011, Notice to Proceed issued for application #11-168 (Prong #3) for violation of replacing
historic wood windows with vinyl windows; removing old gutters on exterior and installing new aluminum
gutters and downspouts; installing vinyl siding on all exposed wood and stucco surfaces; installing new trim
on all doors, window, and fascia; installing six (6) new glass block windows in basement.
ISSUES
• The demolition of the existing exterior porch was completed without a Certificate of Appropriateness.
• The erection of a new two-story porch and rear deck was started without a Certificate of Appropriateness.
According to the applicant, the homeowner hired a group of contractors to perform the work prior to
pulling a permit. The contractors completed the demolition of the existing two-story porch and started
erecting the new porch and deck when the homeowner stated that they received a stop work order. Staff
contacted the Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department (BSEED) for verification of
the stop work order and any additional information—BSEED could not confirm.
• Regarding the deck design—there are discrepancies (stair location and height of deck area vs. porch)
between the Home Depot contract documents and the drawings provided by the applicant.
• The proposed finish of the deck and porch are not included in this application.
RECOMMENDATION
Due to the lack of information regarding the condition and detail of the existing porch prior to its demolition, staff is
withholding an opinion regarding its significance to the character of the historic building, its site and setting.
Regarding the proposed replacement two-story porch and rear deck, it is staff’s opinion that the work, as proposed,
does not destroy historic materials that characterize the historic building, its site, and setting. Staff therefore
recommends that the Commission find the work to be appropriate as it meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards
for Rehabilitation
9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
However, staff recommends that the Commission issue this COA with the following conditions:
• Applicant to submit accurate and finalized drawing of what is currently being constructed for staff review and
approval prior to issuance of COA.
• Applicant to submit specifications of proposed finish for both the deck area and two-story porch for staff
review and approval prior to issuance of COA. Finish to be compatible with existing house.
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1) Height. Virtually all of the houses in the district have two (2) full stories plus an attic or a finished third floor within
the roof, which are generally called "two-and-a-half" (2½) story houses, additions to existing buildings shall be related
to the existing structure. New buildings shall meet the following standards:
(i) The eight (8) adjoining houses on the same block face, excluding any houses built since 1930, shall be used to
determine an average height. If eight (8) houses are not available on the same block face, then one (1) or more
houses as close as possible to being directly across the street from the proposed structure may be used. The height
of the two (2) adjoining houses shall be added into the total twice, with a divisor of ten (10) used to determine the
average. The main roof of any new building must have a height of at least eighty percent (80%) of the resulting
average. In no case shall a new building be taller than the tallest roof height included in the calculation. In
determining the height of existing buildings and proposed buildings, the highest point of the main roof shall be

(9)

used, even where towers or other minor elements may be higher.
(ii) The level of the eaves of the proposed new structure has as much or more significance for compatibility as the
roof height. Therefore, an average eave or conice height shall be determined by the same process as that
described above. The proposed new structure shall have a height at the eaves or cornice of not less than ninety
(90) percent of the average determined from existing structures; and in no case shall the eaves or cornice of the
proposed structure be lower than the lowest eave or cornice height used in the computation, nor higher than the
highest eave or cornice.
Proportion of buildings' front facade. Proportion varies in the district, depending on the age, style, and location in a
specific subdivision. Most houses are wider than tall, especially those on large or multiple lots east of the John C.
Lodge Freeway. With height being established by the standards above, proportion will be established by prohibiting
any proposed building or addition from creating a front facade wider than the widest, or narrower than the narrowest,
of those existing on the same block face.
Proportion of openings within the facade. Windows openings are virtually always taller than wide; however, several
windows are sometimes grouped into a combination that is wider than tall. Window openings are always subdivided.
The most common window type is double-hung with sashes that are generally further subdivided by Muntins or
leaded glass. Facades have approximately fifteen (15) percent to thirty-five (35) percent of their area glazed. Sun
porches with a very high proportion of window openings subdivided by mullions and muntins are common.
Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. In buildings derived from classical precedents, voids are usually arranged
in a symmetrical and evenly-spaced manner within the facades. In examples of other styles, particularly those of
English Medieval Inspiration, voids are arranged with more freedom, but usually in a balanced composition.
Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The spacing of the buildings is generally determined by the setback from
side lot lines. There is a variance in the widths of subdivision lots from one block to another. The lots generally range
from forty (40) feet to seventy-five (75) feet in width. The minimum spacing between houses is ten (10) feet and the
maximum spacing between houses is approximately three hundred and twenty-five (325) feet, where several lots are
combined. The typical spacing is ten (10) feet to fifteen (15) feet from side lot lines. In the case of very wide
properties, two (2) conditions exist: The house is located in the center of the site with extensive side yard space,
which only occurs with extremely large houses by district standards; or the house is located at the side of the wide
site, which creates an extensive side yard on one (1) side of the house.
Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. In those examples derived from classical precedents, entrances and
porches, if any, tend to be centered on the front facade. Other examples display more freedom with entrance and
porch placement. Porches and permanently enclosed sun porches are often placed at the side and sometimes at the
rear of the building.
Relationship of materials. The majority of houses are faced with brick, while many are partially or totally stucco.
There are some stone buildings, sometimes combined with stucco; clapboard is rare, and is extremely rare as the sole
material. Roofing includes slate, tile and asphalt shingles. Wood shingle roofs were once common and have generally
been replaced with asphalt. Wood shake does not exist and there is no known evidence that it was ever used in the
district. Stone trim is common. Wood is almost universally used for window frames and other functional trim and is
used in many examples for all trim.
Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that of a low-relief pattern of
mortar joints in brick contrasted with the smooth surface of wood or stone trim. There are a few houses with rough or
rusticated stone surfaces. The use of stucco or concrete, with or without half-timbering, as a contrast to brick surfaces,
is not unusual. Tile, slate, or wood shingle roofs have particular textural values where they exist. Asphalt shingles
generally have little textural interest, even in those types which purport to imitate some other variety.
Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors (such as red, yellow, brown, buff) predominate in wall surfaces. Natural
stone colors also exist. Where stucco or concrete exists, it usually remains in its natural state, or is painted in a shade
of cream. Roofs are in natural colors (tile and slate colors, natural and stained wood colors), and asphalt shingles are
predominantly within this same dark color range. Paint colors often relate to style. The buildings derived from
classical precedents, particularly those of Neo-Georgian Style, generally have woodwork painted white, cream, or in
the range of those colors including "putty"; doors and shutters are frequently dark green or black.

Colors known to have been in use on similar buildings of this style in the eighteenth or early twentieth centuries may
be considered for appropriateness. Buildings of medieval inspiration (notable Neo-Tudor) generally have painted
woodwork and window frames of a dark brown or cream color. Half timbering is almost always stained dark brown.
The original colors of any building, as determined by professional analysis, are always acceptable for a house, and
may provide guidance for similar houses.
(10) Relationship of architectural details. Architectural details generally relate to style. Neo-Georgian buildings display

 classic details, mostly in wood, and sometimes in stone. Porches, shutters, window frames, cornices, and dormer
windows are commonly, although not always, treated. Details on "Mediterranean" style or vernacular buildings
including arched windows, door openings, and porches, are often done in stone, brick, tile, and sometimes in stucco.
Buildings of medieval inspiration tend to have details in the form of carved wood or carved stone ornaments on
window frames, door frames, and eaves. In general, the various styles are rich in architectural details.
(11) Relationship of roof shapes. A variety of roof shapes exist in the district, depending on building style. Shallow
hipped roofs with dormers, roofs with triangular gables, and steep hipped roofs predominate. A few Gambrel roofs
exist. Complex arrangements of the gabled and/or the hipped types, with subsidiary or transverse roofs, are not
unusual. Dormers are common. Flat roofs are present only as subsidiary roofs on residential structures. Garage roofs
generally reflect the style and pitch of the roof on the main house.
(12) Walls of continuity. The major wall of continuity is created by the buildings, with their uniform setbacks within the
blocks. New buildings should contribute to this wall of continuity. Minor walls of continuity are created where rows
of trees have survived in sufficient numbers or new trees are planted in rows, and where hedges along front lot lines
exist in numbers.
(13) Relationship of Significant Landscape Features and Surface treatments. The typical treatment of individual
properties is a flat or graded front lawn area in grass turf, often subdivided by a straight or curving walk leading to the
front entrance. Materials for such walks are concrete, brick, stone, or combinations of those materials. Some front
yards have rectangular raised earthwork terraces upon which the house stands. These unpaved terraces having sloping
embankments or retaining walls which are made of brick, stone, or both, at the change of grade foundation plantings,
often of a deciduous character, characteristic of the period 1900—1930, are present virtually without exception.
Hedges between properties and along front property lines are not uncommon. It is characteristic for corner lots to have
hedges or fencing at side lot lines along the sidewalk. There is a wide range in the type of fencing. Fencing within the
public view was generally designed to compliment the style, design material, and date of the residence. Although the
American Elm was once the dominant tree, it is virtually extinct in the district. Replacement trees should be
characteristic of the area and period. Plantings of new trees should be directed to "tree lawns" and medians. If
American Elm is planted, it should be disease resistant.
Straight side driveways leading from the street to rear garages are the norm, although access to garages is also off the
alley, especially in areas of the district that were developed earlier. On corner lots, garages and driveways often face
the side streets. These driveways are paved in asphalt, concrete, or brick. Side lots are not uncommon for the larger
properties in the district, and a number of these form a part of the original site plan for the residence. Such side lots
are usually landscaped and are often fenced at or near the setback line.
The width of tree lawns varies from block to block. Street pavements are now asphalt. Cut stone curbs exist in areas
of the district where they have not yet been replaced with concrete, primarily east of the John C. Lodge Freeway.
Public sidewalks are concrete. Some tree lawns/berms have been covered with concrete in parts of the district, which
may represent encroachment on city property. The resulting wide sidewalks are not appropriate in the district. The
ample one hundred and twenty-five (125) foot street right-of-ways of West Boston Boulevard and Chicago Boulevard
are ample, and each have two (2) narrow pavements divided by the large graded grassy median strips which are
planted with evergreens and deciduous trees, the other east-west streets, Longfellow Street and Edison Boulevard, are
sixty-six (66) feet wide.
The Detroit Lighting Commission's ornamental poles ("O.P.") with cast iron bases (Pattern #10 and Cast Iron Panel
Pattern #16A) and wooden shafts are placed at regular intervals primarily on the medians on Boston Boulevard and
Chicago Boulevard, and on the tree lawns on other east-west streets. Lighting on the north-south side streets consists
of steel poles, some of which are fluted, with either ornate pendants or simple cranes. There are historic upright poles
along the periphery of Voight Park. Concrete and brick entrance piers exist at Woodward Avenue and Longfellow
Street. Alleys run east-west down the center of the blocks, with the exception of the north-south alleys behind the
Woodward Avenue frontage.
(14) Relationship of open space to structures. Open space in the district occurs in the form of vacant land, a city park,
side lots, and grassy median strips in the boulevards. There are no houses facing Woodward Avenue. Ample open
space is provided at Woodward Avenue and Boston Boulevard, creating a park-like entrance into the district. The
John C. Lodge Freeway is depressed and forms a visual and physical gap in the district. All houses have rear yards as
well as front yards. Where an original or early arrangement of house and grounds included, and still includes,
landscaped lots which form part of the landscaping plan for the residence, such landscaped lots are significant
landscape features.

 (15) Scale of facades and facade elements. There is a variety in scale from block to block and style to style, the largest
and most substantial houses being primarily those on the first two (2) blocks west of Woodward Avenue and on
Boston Boulevard east of the John C. Lodge Freeway West of the John C. Lodge Freeway and on Longfellow Street
and Edison Boulevard, the houses are generally smaller in scale and are situated on smaller lots. The size and
complexity of facade elements and details either accentuate or subdue the scale of the facades. Facade elements have
been determined by what is appropriate for the style. Window sash are usually subdivided by Muntins, which affect
the apparent scale of the windows within the facades.
(16) Directional expression of front elevations. Although many of the larger buildings are wider than tall, the expression
is generally neutral.
(17) Rhythm of building setbacks. Because of the existence of various subdivisions and related subdivision and deed
restrictions, setbacks vary from area to area within the district, although they are generally consistent within each
block or area. The varying designs of the houses, occasionally with slight setbacks in the facades, cause the houses to
relate to the front setback line in different ways. This creates a slight variation in the setback line. Nevertheless, within
each block or area, a wall of continuity is created.
(18) Relationship of lot coverage. Lot coverage ranges from approximately forty (40) percent (40%) to ten (10) percent or
less in the case of homes with large yards. Most homes are in the twenty-five (25) percent to thirty-five (35) percent
range of lot coverage.
(19) Degree of complexity within the facade. The degree of complexity has been determined by what is typical and
appropriate for a given style. The buildings derived from classical precedents usually have simple, rectangular facades
with varying amounts of ornamentation. Other styles, such as those of medieval inspiration, frequently have facades
complicated by gables, bays, slight setbacks, and an occasional tower. In general, the smaller houses in the district are
less complex.
(20) Orientation, vistas, overviews. Most of the houses in the district have front entrances which are oriented toward the
streets running east-west. The houses on LaSalle Boulevard, from Chicago Boulevard to Edison Boulevard, are
orientated toward LaSalle. Garages are frequently oriented either toward an alley and/or the front drive or toward a
side street in the case of corner lots. Almost all garages are detached and are at the rear of the lot.
(21) Symmetrical or asymmetric appearance. Neo-Georgian and other buildings derived from classical precedents are
generally symmetrical, buildings in other styles, including the Neo-Tudor, are generally asymmetric, but balanced,
compositions.
(22) General environmental character. The Boston-Edison District, with its long straight streets, two (2) boulevards,
large-to-moderate sized stately single-family homes, Voight Park and Woodward Avenue's open space, has an urban,
substantial, low density residential character.

Clarification Narrative:
Prior to applying for permit, the owner hired a group of contractors to perform work. During that
time, the rear porch was taken out and the formwork was placed for the new deck. However, the
homeowner was given a stop work order, which is why there are no pictures to include the
demolition of the old deck.
