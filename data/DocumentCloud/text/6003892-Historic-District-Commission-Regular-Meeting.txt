**NOTE: REQUIRED COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH OF STRUCTURAL PRECAST CONCRETE
SHALL BE DETERMINED BY THE PRECAST CONCRETE MANUFACTURER'S ENGINEER.
MINIMUM PERMITTED COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH = 5000 PSI.
b. AIR ENTRAINMENT:
1. CONCRETE LISTED IN TABLE "A" SHALL BE AIR ENTRAINED WITH
THE APPROPRIATE PERCENTAGE AIR CONTENT LISTED IN TABLE "B" AS
APPLICABLE FOR THE INDICATED EXPOSURE CLASS AND NOMINAL
MAXIMUM AGGREGATE SIZE IN THE CONCRETE MIX. THE REQUIRED AIR
CONTENT VALUE MAY BE REDUCED BY 1% FOR ALL CONCRETE WITH
COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH GREATER THAN 5,000 PSI. THE PERMITTED
TOLERANCE ON THE REQUIRED AIR CONTENT IS ±1.5 PERCENT. SEE ACI

ANCHOR LOCATIONS ARE ADJUSTED. CONTRACTOR SHALL NOTIFY STRUCTURAL ENGINEER
TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE ANCHOR LAYOUT WHERE ANCHORS MUST BE RELOCATED TO AVOID
INTERFERENCE WITH REINFORCING STEEL.
i. ADHESIVE ANCHORS SHALL BE INSTALLED WITH A 6” EMBEDMENT DEPTH UNLESS NOTED
OTHERWISE. ANCHORS OTHER THAN ADHESIVE ANCHORS SHALL BE INSTALLED WITH AN
EMBEMENT DEPTH EQUAL TO THE MAXIMUM EMBEDMENT DEPTH NOTED IN THE MANUFACTURER’S
