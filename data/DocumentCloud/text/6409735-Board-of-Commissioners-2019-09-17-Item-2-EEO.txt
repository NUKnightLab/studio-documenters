Item No. 2

APPROVAL OF CONTRACT AMENDMENT TO CONTRACT NO. 11770 WITH PUGH,
JONES AND JOHNSON, P.C. FOR ETHICS OFFICER AND EEO OFFICER SERVICES
Presenter: Cheryl Colston, Chief Legal Officer
Recommendation
The Chief Executive Officer recommends that the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago
Housing Authority approve an amendment to Contract No. 11770 increasing the contract in a
not-to-exceed amount of up to $75,000 with Pugh, Jones and Johnson, P.C. (“Pugh, Jones”) for
services as the CHA Ethics Officer and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Officer. The
contract is within its final extension period which ends December 31, 2019. The additional
increase to Contract No. 11770 shall be subject to the annual appropriated budget for the
Office of the Chief Legal Officer applicable to all aggregated Legal Services Agreements.
The requested action in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable Chicago
Housing Authority Board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement regulations.
Staff have completed all necessary due diligence to support the submission of this initiative.
Funding
CHA Office of Chief Legal Officer
Background
The CHA’s Ethics Policy establishes the position of Ethics Officer to be appointed by the CHA’s
Board of Commissioners. Pursuant to the CHA’s Ethics Policy, the CHA Ethics Officer is
responsible for monitoring and performing services in the administration and enforcement of
the Ethics Policy.
Pursuant to a solicitation in 2016, CHA entered into a professional services agreement
(Contract No. 11770) with Pugh, Jones & Johnson, P.C. on a firm-fixed rate basis, and in an
amount not-to-exceed $90,500 for a one-year base term, effective July 1, 2016 through
June 30, 2017, to perform and provide professional services as the CHA’s Ethics Officer and
EEO Officer, with a one-year extension option reserved to the CHA. The CHA exercised
the one-year option under the same terms and conditions as the initial contract,
extending the term of the contract through June 30, 2018 and increased the contract
1

 in an amount of $90,500 (for a total contract amount of $181,000). Under Resolution
No 2018-CHA-43, the Board authorized a contract extension of Contract No. 11770 for
an additional one-year term, effective through June 30, 2019 under the same terms,
condition and compensation as the prior approvals. A second contract extension was
approved under Resolution No. 2019-CHA-32 adding: 1) an additional six-month term
through December 31, 2019 (during which staff would finalize an evaluation of the
related services and recommend a permanent process for providing such services); and
2) increased funding under the contract in an amount not to exceed $55,000.
While Contract No. 11770 is characterized as a Legal Services Agreement, the retention
of an Ethics/EEO Officer and the legal mandate that any matter referred to the
Ethics/EEO Officer must be investigated, the Chief Legal Officer nor CHA are able to
predict, with any degree of certainty, the volume of work of the Ethics/EEO Officer.
Due to an increase in EEO matters being handled under Contract No. 11770, a contract
amendment is now being requested to add an additional amount not-to- exceed
$75,000 to the Pugh, Jones and Johnson, P.C. professional services agreement. This
amount is expected to be sufficient to pay all pending and anticipated invoices over
the next few months, until such time as an internal permanent hire is in place before
the end of this year.
Conclusion
The vendor’s performance under Contract No. 11770 has been satisfactory during the
term of the agreement, and the CHA now seeks the authorization of the Board of
Commissioners to amend the agreement in an amount not-to-exceed $75,000 and
upon the same prevailing terms and conditions.

Respectfully Submitted:
