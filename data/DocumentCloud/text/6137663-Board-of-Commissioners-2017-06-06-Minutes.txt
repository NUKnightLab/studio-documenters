IN MEMORY OF AVY MEYERS
WHEREAS, Avy Meyers, long-time host of North Town News Magazine, opinionated owner and publisher
for the newspaper Jewish Chicago and well known cable and You Tube interviewer who was perhaps best
known for his judicial interviews died at the age of 66, leaving behind family, friends, colleagues and a
community enriched for having known him; and
WHEREAS, Avy Meyers was a long time journalist at North Town News Magazine, Chicago's only weekly
televised neighborhood news magazine, which later had a powerful presence on the internet as well. Over
the course of the run of the show he conducted more than ten thousand interviews and drew some of the
highest You Tube viewership of any local cable show in the country; and
WHEREAS, as a young journalist Avy Meyers went to work for the Chicago Defender and became their
first white reporter. He covered countless criminal trials and became interested in issues regarding the
judiciary. It was partly this interest that focused his scrutiny on judicial candidates. He was also actively
involved with issues concerning community policing and consequently involved in local oversight of the
Chicago Police Department; and
WHEREAS, most recently, on North Town News Magazine Avy Meyers drew national attention for his
interview with former Cook County State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez regarding her handling at the time, of
the killing of a young black teenager, Laquan McDonald; and

WHEREAS, Avy Meyers will long be remembered for his interviews with local politicians. His
interviewees were members of both parties. Each of his subjects would join him in front of a sheet in his
make-shift studio in the dining room of his West Rogers Park home; and
WHEREAS, Avy Meyers had the unique ability to work without rancor and as a result was genuinely
respected by those on both sides of the political aisle. While a very opinioned man, as a journalist, he was
genuinely interested in listening to the viewpoints of those he disagreed and he often used his show as a
platform to share those opinions. He always treated his subjects with fairness and respect even candidates
he disliked personally. Likewise, he was known for his fairness when it came to selling advertising space
for his publication. He was immensely proud of the fact that his endorsements were not in any way
influenced by the size of an ad purchased by a candidate, or whether a candidate bought an ad at all; he was
particularly harsh on those who thought his endorsement and good opinion could be bought; and
WHEREAS, Avy Meyers’ exceptional work was frequently recognized by his peers; he was singled out
for distinction when he was awarded the Award of Excellence in Community Outreach from the Illinois
State Crime Commission, and three National Awards for Best News Show and Making a Difference in the
Community conferred by the Alliance for Community Media.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on behalf
of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County commemorates the exceptional life of Avy Meyers and herewith
expresses its sincere gratitude for the invaluable and innumerable contributions he has made to the Citizens
of Cook County, Illinois; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be spread upon the official
proceedings of this Honorable Body and that an official copy of the same be tendered to the family of Avy
Meyers.
