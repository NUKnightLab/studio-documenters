A
RESOLUTION
CONSOLIDATING
VARIOUS
GOVERNMENTAL
OPERATIONS BY COMBINING THE OFFICE OF CONTRACT COMPLIANCE
WITH THE OFFICE OF THE PURCHASING AGENT (PROPOSED
RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Elizabeth “Liz”
Doody Gorman, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION CONSOLIDATING VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL
OPERATIONS
BY COMBINING THE OFFICE OF CONTRACT COMPLIANCE
WITH THE OFFICE OF THE PURCHASING AGENT
WHEREAS, in an effort to help resolve the FY 2008 budget crisis, a resolution
consolidating certain government operations was introduced at the February 20,
2008 meeting of the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, during these tough economic times, the need to streamline County
operations still exists as the Board of Commissioners prepares to address the FY
2009 budget; and
WHEREAS, the Purchasing Agent is the chief County official with the charge of
procuring quality goods and services for Cook County agencies at the best
market value, making certain that vendors comply with all of the requirements of
the Procurement and Contracts Code and recommending to the County Board
which vendors should be awarded contracts based on their bids and on meeting
all the required criteria; and
WHEREAS, one of the major criterion in determining which vendors should be
awarded contracts is compliance with the Minority and Women Owned Business
Enterprises division of the Procurement and Contracts Code; and
WHEREAS, compliance with the County’s MBE/WBE ordinance is the only
criterion, in the County’s contract procurement process, which is administered by
a County department other than the Office of the Purchasing Agent; and
WHEREAS, the Purchasing Agent should have the responsibility of making
certain that contracts are fulfilled appropriately and that vendors meet all of the
requirements of the Procurement and Contracts Code; and
WHEREAS, it is redundant to have two departments with such similar
responsibilities; and
WHEREAS, other large governmental bodies, such as the City of Chicago;
Orange County, California; Hennepin County, Minnesota, throughout the United
States, have only one department administering all of these functions; and

to be merged into the Office of the Purchasing Agent.

of the Purchasing Agent; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the employees of the Office of Contract
Compliance shall now report to the Purchasing Agent.
