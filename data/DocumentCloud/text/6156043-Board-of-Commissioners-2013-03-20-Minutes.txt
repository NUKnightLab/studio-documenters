PROPOSED RESOLUTION
ISSUING A MORATORIUM ON FELONY
PROSTITUTION CHARGES IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, Illinois, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri and Texas are the only eight
(8) states in the Country to have a felony sentencing option for prostitution offenses; and
WHEREAS, of these eight (8) states, Illinois has the harshest sentencing option in the Country requiring
only one (1) prior prostitution conviction before a felony charge option is available for subsequent
offenses; and
WHEREAS, as noted by End Demand Illinois, the Department of Corrections reported 127 felony
prostitution admissions for 2012, costing the state $2,011,680.00. Pretrial detention for those facing
felony prostitution charges costs Cook County Department of Corrections between $5.3 to $9.5 million
annually; and
WHEREAS, felony convictions make the transition out of the sex trade to the legitimate economy more
difficult because those with felony convictions can be rejected from jobs, denied work authorization,
denied housing and can even be evicted from their homes for having a felony conviction; and
WHEREAS, rather than continuing to treat prostitution as a crime, we must shift our resources and focus
to the pimps and johns who exploit them.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the State’s Attorney, the President and the members of
the Cook County Board of Commissioners urge the General Assembly to pass legislation that will
permanently remove the felony prostitution charge option from Illinois State Statute; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the State’s Attorney, the President and members of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners issue a moratorium on felony prostitution charges in Cook County.

DECLARING MARCH 21, 2013 AS BROADBAND
ADOPTION DAY IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, in today’s digital world with the increasing utility and reliance upon internet based
applications and information, ready access to an affordable, reliable broadband internet connection in the
home connects families to numerous economic, educational, health and social benefits; and
WHEREAS, a November, 2012 report titled Broadband Adoption in Illinois: Who is online, who is not,
and how to expand home high-speed adoption conducted by the Partnership for a Connected Illinois
found that 32% of residents did not have a broadband internet connection at home, an issue that
disproportionately affected black and Hispanic households, with 44% not having a broadband connection
at home; and
WHEREAS, when asked to elaborate on why they have not adopted broadband in the home 65% of nonadopters indicated cost was a factor but the next two (2) most common factors were lack of relevance and
overall digital literacy, cited by 58% and 44% of non-adopters respectively; and
WHEREAS, a February 28, 2013, Pew Research Center report titled How Teachers Are Using
Technology at Home and in Their Classrooms shows that, while 79% of teachers reported having students
access or download an assignment from an online site, only 18% reported that all or almost all of their
students had access to the digital tools they need at home; and
WHEREAS, significant infrastructure investments have moved our nation forward and shifted the focus
from access to adoption as evidenced by Partnership for a Connected Illinois data dated June 2012
showing that Cook County has 0% unserved and 0% underserved occupied households. Broadband
Illinois defines an area as being "underserved" as areas having the maximum advertised download speeds
of less than 3 Mbps; and
WHEREAS, across the county there are several non-profits that offer digital literacy training that
exposes participants to the many uses of the internet including applying for jobs, seeking medical
information, social networking, furthering education and accessing government services; and
WHEREAS, effective and diligent cooperation by public leaders, civic organizations and private
companies is an essential ingredient in the success of any program aimed at promoting greater broadband
adoption; and
WHEREAS, an example of that essential cooperation is Comcast’s Internet Essentials program, which
addresses the main barriers to broadband adoption by offering families with at least one child who
qualifies for the National School Lunch Program, and meets other program requirements, the ability to
receive low-cost broadband service and participate in digital literacy training.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners and the Board of Commissioners of the Cook County do hereby recognize March 21,
2013 as Broadband Adoption Day in Cook County and encourage residents to adopt or encourage others
to adopt broadband in the home.

COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
SUPPORTING THE STATE’S PRIVATE CORRECTIONAL
FACILITY MORATORIUM ACT
WHEREAS, the private prison industry has grown dramatically in this country over the past few decades
into a multi-billion dollar industry with ongoing efforts to expand; and
WHEREAS, privately contracted detention companies have profited from the wave of criminalization of
less privileged communities, in particular African Americans, Latinos and immigrants; and
WHEREAS, many of the private detention companies have a documented history of putting the welfare
of the detainees in their custody, their workers and the communities where their facilities are located at
risk; and
WHEREAS, in addition to the treatment documented by the media and in various lawsuits of detainees,
it has also been alleged and plead in various lawsuits that these companies have denied detainees adequate
food, medical care and other elements of humane treatment, to the point where individuals have died
while in the custody of these privately contracted detention/prison facilities; and
WHEREAS, these companies have been alleged to use violence to control detainees or have a high rate
of inmate-on-inmate violence; and
WHEREAS, these companies have faced issues with respect to the training of personnel and the
thwarting of union representation, leading to conditions that pose dangers to detainees, employees and the
overall community; a riot at one facility in Mississippi in May 2012 overwhelmed the underprepared staff
and required law enforcement from surrounding communities to become involved; and
WHEREAS, such incidents and other instances of poor management burden taxpayers—refuting the
claims of private prison companies that these facilities save taxpayer dollars; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 20, 2013
WHEREAS, incarceration is an inherently governmental function that requires governments to exercise
their coercive police powers and is therefore inappropriate for privatization; and
WHEREAS, incarceration demands direct public accountability and raises liability issues that cannot be
adequately addressed with privatized facilities; and
WHEREAS, bringing profit motives into incarceration breeds corruption and warps public policy as
those who stand to gain from incarceration seek to influence laws governing detention and even
individual custody decisions; and
WHEREAS, Illinois has already enacted a Private Correctional Facility Moratorium Act that bars the
State from privatizing operations of state prisons; and
WHEREAS, Illinois amended the Private Correctional Facility Moratorium Act in 2011 to cover county
and local jails; and
WHEREAS, despite this statute, one of the largest private detention companies – the Corrections
Corporations of America (CCA) is trying to locate a civil immigration detention facility in Illinois; and
WHEREAS, CCA’s first attempt to locate this facility, in the south Chicago suburb of Crete, was
ultimately rejected by the village board due to financial issues with CCA amid widespread opposition by
residents of the village and surrounding communities, faith leaders, and a broad array of others; and
WHEREAS, despite being rejected in its attempt to build in Crete, CCA is continuing its attempts to
locate a detention facility in Illinois; and
WHEREAS, this Board of Commissioners has long stood for accountability, humane treatment of the
incarcerated, fair treatment of workers, and justice for immigrants and other less privileged communities
in our County and throughout our State.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the members of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners continue to support the Private Correctional Facility Moratorium Act and
oppose any proposed operation of privately contracted detention facilities in the County of Cook or within
the State of Illinois; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be delivered to the President of
the United States; the Secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security; the Director of US
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); and the Governor of the State of Illinois.

COOK COUNTY PARENTAL LEAVE
WHEREAS, women especially are often forced to put their careers and financial future at risk simply
because they want to have children; and
WHEREAS, paid leave for childbearing and childrearing improves children’s health outcomes by
making more time available to parents to provide essential care for children, and more time for parents for
the formation of bonds between parents and children, fostering positive emotional development of
children; and
WHEREAS, it also improves economic conditions of families by increasing the long-term employment
and earning prospects of working parents, especially by eliminating the wage “child penalty” mothers
often pay, thereby increasing job security and ensuring consistent income; and
WHEREAS, paid parental leave benefits employers by reducing staff turnover, which can lower
recruitment and training costs and improve workers’ productivity; and
WHEREAS, when workers feel supported, they have higher levels of job satisfaction that, in turn,
increase their commitment to their organization’s success; and
WHEREAS, some of the most successful private sector companies have instituted paid parental leave for
their employees; and
WHEREAS, Cook County currently does not provide for paid parental leave, forcing employees to use
their accrued sick and vacation leave or take unpaid leave; and
WHEREAS, the County should seek to follow the commendable example set by numerous governmental
entities including the City of Chicago, and implement a policy change to offer all eligible non-union
employees paid parental leave, which will not only benefit our working parents and their children, but
also the County’s overall mission.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby urge the President to amend the County’s parental leave policy to allow for paid parental leave for
non-represented employees.

STATE’S ATTORNEY, Anita Alvarez, submitting communication advising the County of
the Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator regarding Jimmy Doe v.
County of Cook, USDC No. 99-C-3945. This class action litigation was originally brought
in 1999 and has subsequently involved the entry of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
between the parties that was approved by the District Court in December 2002 and the
entry of an Agreed Supplemental Order approved by the Court on May 18, 2006. This
petition was resolved by the entry of an Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional
Administrator (TA) by the District Court on August 14, 2007. The Board of
Commissioners agreed to the entry of the subject order during its meeting of July 31, 2007.
On June 18, 2008, the District Court entered an order amending this portion of the TA
Order permitting the Transitional Administrator to maintain the OTA funds in a separate
account to pay reasonable costs and expenses of the staff of the OTA. The OTA account
was first funded at $800,000.00 on July 22, 2008 and the District Court entered an order
for additional funds of $500,000.00 respectively on December 18, 2008, April 14, 2009,
June 30, 2009, November 17, 2009, April 7, 2010, August 3, 2010, November 23, 2010,
March 29, 2011, June 30, 2011, November 3, 2011, February 28, 2012, July 26, 2012 and
October 15, 2012.
The Transitional Administrator has now presented invoice payment records evidencing
payments and a balance in the account as of January 31, 2013 in the amount of
$106,712.54 which has been reviewed and accepted by the Cook County State’s
Attorney’s Office. The TA has requested the District Court to enter an order providing for
an additional disbursement of $500,000.00 into the OTA account which was approved by
the Court on February 21, 2013.
Upon approval, the Cook County Comptroller will transfer $500,000.00 from the SelfInsurance Fund to an account managed by the Transitional Administrator in accordance
with the terms of the aforementioned court order. From July 22, 2008 to date, inclusive of
this court order, $7,800,000.00 has been transferred from the Self-Insurance fund to the
Office of the Transitional Administrator.

ROGER BALDWIN FOUNDATION OF THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION,
INC. (ACLU), presented by the Office of the State’s Attorney, regarding The American
Civil Liberties Union of Illinois (ACLU) v. Alvarez, Case No. 10-C-5235. On March 5,
2013, Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman in the Northern District of Illinois ordered the
Comptroller to pay the sum of $645,549.00 for all attorney fees, taxable costs, and nontaxable expenses in this case. This lawsuit related to the American Civil Liberties Union
of Illinois’ First Amendment Challenge to the Illinois Eavesdropping Act, 720 ILCS 5/141, et seq.
On May 8, 2012, the United States Court Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the
decision of the district court to dismiss this lawsuit and reinstated the matter against the
State’s Attorney. On May 29, 2012, the State’s Attorney filed a petition for rehearing
which was denied on June 14, 2012. Subsequently, on November 26, 2012, the United
States Supreme Court denied to accept the State’s Attorney’s petition for a writ of
certiorari. Thereafter, on December 20, 2012, the district court granted the American Civil
Liberties Union’s motion for summary judgment and entered a permanent injunction
against the State’s Attorney from enforcement of the Illinois Eavesdropping Act in a
manner consistent with the court’s order. On March 5, 2013, the district court granted the
American Civil Liberties Union’s motion for fees and costs. A check should be made
payable to the Roger Baldwin Foundation of the American Civil Liberties Union, Inc.
(ACLU), in the amount of $645,549.00. Please forward the check to Patrick T. Driscoll,
Jr., Deputy State’s Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, for transmittal.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
EXAMINING THE CROWDING AT THE COOK COUNTY JAIL
AND THE USE OF ELECTRONIC MONITORING
WHEREAS, the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners, in
recommending and approving the annual appropriation bill, has invested in many programs
to protect the general public and reduce the jail population at the Cook County Jail (“Jail”);
and
WHEREAS, one of the programs the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners
has invested in is an aggressive Electronic Monitoring program which provides for a lowercost alternative to housing detainees at the Jail, provides a mechanism to reduce
119

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 20, 2013
overcrowding at the Jail and allows certain detainees to be monitored in a non-correctional
setting; and
WHEREAS, the Jail continues to see an increase in the jail population and the Jail had an
increase in the average daily detainee population in 2012 from the average in 2011; and
WHEREAS, the cost per day of holding one individual in the Jail is significant and there
should be an enhanced emphasis in placing applicable detainees in an Electronic Monitoring
program; and
WHEREAS, placing detainees on Electronic Monitoring in a qualifying residence is a costeffective alternative to incarceration in the Jail; and
WHEREAS, Electronic Monitoring allows qualifying participants to continue to work, go
to school, attend religious services, and maintain family or community ties; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office operates an electronic monitoring program
that can cost-effectively and safely monitor over fifteen hundred participants at any given
time; and
WHEREAS, Illinois statutes expressly permits the use of Electronic Monitoring initiated
by Judges or the Sheriff under certain specific circumstances; and
WHEREAS, since November 2012, the number of individuals using Electronic Monitoring
has declined; and
WHEREAS, the average daily number of participants on the Electronic Monitoring has
decreased by over four hundred since November 2012; and
WHEREAS, failure to use Electronic Monitoring programs to its greatest extent leads to
additional costs for the County, increases the jail population and prevents qualifying
participants from maintaining family and community ties; and
WHEREAS, the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners through the
Justice Advisory Council should work with the new General Assembly, the Chief Judge, the
State’s Attorney, the Public Defender and the Sheriff to review existing Electronic
Monitoring laws and propose amendments to current legislation that will continue to protect
the public but also allow for a broader use of Electronic Monitoring as a viable and safe
alternative to incarceration in the Jail; and
WHEREAS, recommendations to modify and amend the existing Illinois laws to clarify
and expand the use of Electronic Monitoring as a viable and safe alternative to incarceration
should be reviewed by the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, expanded use of Electronic Monitoring will reduce the Jail population, reduce
the daily expenditures of the Jail and will allow the President, Cook County Board of
Commissioners, the County and the Cook County Sheriff to reach substantial compliance
under the Department of Justice Agreed Order.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County
Board of Commissioners encourages the use of electronic monitoring in Cook County as a
120

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 20, 2013
tool to address crowding at the Cook County Jail and to allow qualifying participants to be
monitored in an approved residential setting; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners encourages the Justice Advisory Council and the County public safety
officials to come together to explore how to enhance the use of electronic monitoring and
other effective means of reducing the population of the jail; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a committee comprised of representatives from the
Justice Advisory Council, Chief Judges Office, Sheriff’s Office, State’s Attorney’s Office,
Public Defender’s Office and other appropriate agencies and departments meet to develop
and implement these programs; and

Cook County Board of Commissioners at the first board meeting in May of 2013 and
September of 2013 on its progress, initiatives and activities to account for an enhanced use

and
SHANNON E. ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a contract with Path
Construction Company, Arlington Heights, Illinois, for security post construction upgrades.
Reason:

Competitive bidding procedures were followed in accordance with the Cook County

estimates for the project.
This project will expand and renovate Posts 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and Division IV at the

CONTRACT ADDENDUM
Transmitting a Communication, dated February 4, 2013 from
DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to increase by $68,139.50 and extend from
February 16, 2013 through August 31, 2013, Contract No. 09-84-08 with DDW & Associates/REB
Storage System International, Chicago, Illinois, for rental of shelving located at 1120 East 89th Street,

$560,840.50

DDW & Associates/REB Storage Systems International was selected from two (2) vendor
bids received through the open market bid process. The contract for the rental of shelving was
approved by the County Board on February 4, 2009. The vendor designed, installed and
anchored the shelving to the 89th Street warehouse floor. The temporary storage shelving
system was needed by the Clerk of the Circuit Court to maintain a total of 3,072 pallets of
court documents until space was made available at the new Cicero Record Center.
Due to the fact that the new Cicero Record Center construction completion date is the end of
June 2013, we believe that it is more cost effective and efficient to retain the expertise and
services of the current vendor.
If the current contract were to be rebid, the County would incur additional costs for the
reconstruction of shelving, reloading of pallets, and incur possible increases in labor costs
needed for staff to search for the location of pallets/documents during the reconstruction.
Additionally, the Clerk of the Circuit Court would experience delays in the retrieval and
delivery of court documents during the reconstruction of the shelving. The expiration date of
the current contract is February 15, 2013.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $68,139.50. Contract extension: February 16, 2013 through August 31, 2013.
(529-660 Account).
Sufficient funds are available in the Clerk of the Circuit Court Document Storage Fund.

DEPARTMENT OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT
CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication, dated February 28, 2013 from
JAMES D'AMICO, Director, Department of Facilities Management
and
SHANNON E. ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a contract with HOH
Water Technologies, Inc., Palatine, Illinois, to furnish water treatment chemicals for various locations.
Reason:

Competitive bidding procedures were followed in accordance with the Cook County
Procurement Code. On February 8, 2013 bids were solicited for Contract No. 12-53-436 to
supply water treatment chemicals for the Cook County Department of Facilities
Management. One (1) bid was received. The water treatment chemicals will be used to
prevent corrosion from forming in the boiler systems at various Cook County Facilities. The
savings on this contract is $9,585.84.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $184,708.56 (FY 2013: $41,046.35; FY 2014: $61,569.48; FY 2015:
$61,569.48; and FY 2016: $20.523.25). Contract period: March 20, 2013 through March 19, 2016.
Thirty six (36) months with two (2) one-year renewal options. (200-333 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Years 2014, 2015 and 2016 funds.

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 11, 2013 from
138

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 20, 2013

JAMES D'AMICO, Director, Department of Facilities Management
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $50,000.00 from Account
200-450, Maintenance and Repair of Plant Equipment to Account 200-444, Maintenance and Repair of
Automotive Equipment for the repairs on Facility Managements fleet of vehicles.
Reason:

This transfer is needed to replenish the account for vehicle repair and maintenance to allow
Facilities to make necessary repairs on its fleet. Without this influx of funds Facilities
Management will not be able to make the necessary repairs to insure our fleet is road worthy.

From Account 200-450

Total

$50,000.00

To Account 200-444

Total

$50,000.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent that Account 444 would need an influx on March 11, 2013. The balance on
March 11, 2013 $8,689.00 and on February 19, 2013 the account balance was $6,000.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 450 had a significant balance with no major projects slotted at this time, therefore this
account was chosen. The only other account that could be used is 333. This account was not
considered because of the amount of purchasing that is done from this account and the history of
this account becoming under funded as the year progresses.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 450.
Facilities would have to put off the repair of its vehicle fleet which would cause our vehicles to be
in a state of disrepair.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

The Budget Department has reviewed and has no objection to this transfer.

A regional Request for Proposal (RFP) was jointly developed by Cook, DuPage, Kane,
Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will Counties for the selection of a company to perform aerial
imagery for data acquisition and sharing at county borders. After the completion of the RFP
process, the regional Geographic Information System (GIS) workgroup has recommended
Merrick & Company based on its ability to meet all technical specifications of the RFP.
Since Cook County has the largest, most complex territory in the region composing of dense
urban areas, airports and shore line environments, it is acting as the lead government project
manager for this initiative. Cook County beneficiaries of this project will be Cook County
municipalities which provide vital operations involving first responders, emergency planners,
remediation experts for homeland security, highway for transportation, emergency
management and disaster preparedness. This time sensitive project is performed in the spring
under “leaf-off” conditions.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $3,344,446.00 (FY 2013: $1,099,929.00; FY 2014: $1,099,743.00; and FY
2015: $1,144,774.00). Contract period: April 1, 2013 through September 30, 2015. (545-260 Account).
Sufficient funds are available in the Geographic Information Systems Fund.

Review; Taxing Agency Extranet (TEA) Enhancements, critical to the distribution function,

Reason:

On November 30, 2012, an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the JOC Construction Contractors was
advertised. An IFB process was followed in accordance with the Cook County Procurement
Code. Twenty-nine (29) bids were received on January 9, 2013.
JOC is a quantity based procurement process that allows facility owners to complete a
multitude of repair/maintenance and construction projects with a single, competitively bid
contract. The JOC process generally involves first selecting a vendor pool of potential
contractors through a competitive procurement process, and then identifying projects for such
selected contractors.
The contracts are a two (2) year base term with two (2) one-year renewal options from the
date of contract execution.
The County is currently “piggybacking” on the City’s existing JOC Contract. The proposed
contractors will replace the piggybacked contract with the City.

Explanation of Fiscal Impact: The County will award a series of JOC contracts for a not to exceed dollar
amount. The number of projects and dollar value of each are unknown at this time. The potential fiscal
impact of $24 million covers the two (2) year contract period.

DEPARTMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATION OPERATIONS
CONTRACTS
Transmitting a Communication, dated February 26, 2013 from
LYDIA MURRAY, Chief Information Officer
and
SHANNON E. ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute Contract No. 13-8812439 with Globetrotters Engineering Corporation, Inc. (GEC), Chicago, Illinois, for Phase III of the
Broadband Network, which will consist of adding additional fiber optic cable between the Daley Center
165

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 20, 2013
and the County Building and 69 West Washington; Hawthorne Warehouse and Provident Hospital of
Cook County to the Network; and fiber locating services that are required by the City of Chicago due to
the County’s underground fiber optic cable. This is a comparable government procurement under Section
34-140 of the Procurement Code, as the State of Illinois awarded CMS Contract No. 1473740 to GEC,
through a Request for Proposal (RFP), for services. The prices that GEC commits to the County are at
least as favorable as those GEC committed to the State.
Reason:

The County recently completed construction of Phase I of the Broadband Network that
consisted of installing fiber from the Daley Center to City Hall and the Thompson Center.
Utilizing existing fiber from the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) at the Thompson Center to
the Polk Street Station, the County extended the Network to Stroger Hospital of Cook County.
Phase II Engineering is currently in process, which will extend the Network from Stroger
Hospital of Cook County to the 26th and California Courthouse and County Jail Complex,
including Cermak Health Services of Cook County.
Based on the high quality of professional engineering services provided by GEC during
Phases I and II, their in-depth experience and knowledge of the County’s requirements and
the need to complete this project in the most timely manner possible, the Bureau of
Technology respectfully requests a new contract to proceed with Fiber Optic Network Phase
III Engineering of the project.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $325,465.24. Contract period: March 21, 2013 through December 31, 2013.
(715/009-570 Account).
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.

LYDIA MURRAY, Chief Information Officer
and
SHANNON E. ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a contract with
Solutionary, Inc., Omaha, Nebraska, for information security consulting services.
Reason:

The Bureau of Technology (BOT) requests that the County procure information security
consulting services from Solutionary, Inc. including security assessments, credit card
compliance auditing and vulnerability testing. This is a comparable government procurement
under Section 34-140 of the Procurement Code, as the County of Allegheny, Pennsylvania (its
County Seat being Pittsburgh) awarded Contract No. 124164 to Solutionary, Inc. through a
Request for Proposal (RFP), #6438, issued July 2010, for information security services. The
166

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 20, 2013
scope of services matches the services required by Cook County and the prices that
Solutionary, Inc. commits to the County are favorable as those Solutionary, Inc. committed to
the County of Allegheny. Most importantly, Solutionary, Inc.'s services - which immediately
augment the efforts and priorities that BOT devotes to information security - will assist in
mitigating risk of a data security breach.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $368,400.00. Contract period: March 20, 2013 through March 19, 2016. (490441 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Years 2014, 2015 and 2016 funds.

Tax Liens for Fiscal Years 2013 through 2015 with two (2) one-year renewal options.
Reason:

Based on the vendor’s extensive experience and knowledge of the Treasurer’s on-line auction
processes, Illinois tax sale statutes, and coupled with a reasonable price proposal, it is deemed
that Realauction.com is the best value for the County.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $680,000.00 (FY 2013: $230,000.00; FY 2014: $230,000.00; and FY 2015:
$220,000.00). (Optional 2016: $231,000.00; and 2017: $231,000.00). Contract period: April 1, 2013
