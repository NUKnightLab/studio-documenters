WHITNEY M. YOUNG, JR. BRANCH

he Whitney M. Young,
Jr., branch of the Chicago
Public Library has long
been a Dainiliunity
anchor, hosting numerous classm
and community events within the
Chatham neighborhood. Designed
originally by Jay Carow in 1973,
the small structure with distinctive
modernist features required an
update. As apart of the ongoing
efforts by the City of Chicago to
modernize libraries across the city,
Architect ure was brought on to
rehab the existing structure and create
a new, integrated addition
Theproject was led by two South
Side natives: Danielle Tillman, AIA,

from Architecture (the project's
Design Architect) and Chris Lee, 
of Johnson 81 Lee, (the project?s
Architect of Record). Both architects
deeply understood the community?s
affections for its branch. "The library
has been a longstanding community
anchor in the hatharn neighborhood
Historically it's been a place for

all types of activities children's
activities, book signings and readings
and concerts. People who had heard
about the renovation of the building
would talk about when they lived in
the neighborhood or even outside

of the neighborhood, that it was the
strongest library on the South Side,?
Tillman commented.

visited the site in the
mornings, and it always amazed me
that there were people waiting to
get in," added Lee.

Tillman noted two distinctive
library features that she knew would
contribute to its unique sense of
place: the original coffered ceilings
and an underused courtyard. ml'he
cofferecl ceiling we found to be quite
interesting and a little bit of a design
challenge as we were looking to
renovate the space. And then, the
courtyard, it was not utilized, it
was a green, outdoor space that one
typically doesn?t ?nd in a building."

The architects met with

representatives from Chicago

Public Libraries and several local
librarians, who expressed that
they desired more community and
collaborative spaces. ?They had
so many resources but didn?t feel
they had the space to make use of
everything," Tillman said

"They were bursting at the seams,"
exclaimed Lee.

Preserving much of the existing
structure, the design team chose
to create a sleek, glass addition
that, as Tillman notes, ?felt like
a light to and highlighted the
architecture that remained: the
existing brick, and coffered ceiling."
The courtyard now greets visitors as

they enter the library.

The ?nal building creates spaces
for all of technology?focused
programming, including a separate
area for teen programs that, while
separated for a sound barrier,
still relains a visual runner Him in
the main library space. The
existing structure provides an
open yet cozy ?oorplan for general
reading and reference, as well as
(hihln?n's at ivil ies.

Today the building is, as Lee
notes, proverbial beacon for
knowledge. The glass addition glows
at night and during the day, it
invites people to look in."

Overall the program?s goal was
to, as Tillman put it. ?really show
the building as a neighborhmd
anchor. The Chatham neighborhood
has historically been a very proud
neighborhood and the residents
wanted to highlight that with one
of the strong community centers
in the area?s functions." In this
way the new Whitney M. Young,

Jr, branch serves as a means to
advocate for the community as the
community has come to advocate for
its library, something that Tillman
sees as invaluable to the architecture

profession, as wdl. ?Architects should
go out and use these spaC$," Tillman
stated. ?We think that something has

been left behind just becausepeople
don't think about using libraries, but
when they?re active spaces when

people are using them i you share
that libraries are beautiful places, and
this helps us advocate for them." CA
