RE: Kashif Bhatti v. City of Detroit
Case No: 18-007312-NI
File No: L18-00435 (SVD)

On April 8, 2019, a case evaluation panel evaluated the above-captioned lawsuit and awarded Six
Thousand Dollars and NO/Cents in favor of the plaintiff. The parties have until May
6, 2019, to either accept or reject the case evaluation. Failure to ?le a written acceptance or
rejection within this period constitutes a rejection.

Based upon our review of the facts and particulars of this lawsuit, which are set forth in a
con?dential memorandum that is being separately hand-delivered to each member of Your
Honorable Body, it is our considered opinion that acceptance of the case evaluation award is in
the best interest of the City of Detroit.

We, therefore, request authorization to settle this matter in the amount of Six Thousand Dollars
and NOlCents and that Your Honorable Body direct the Finance Director to issue a
draft in that amount payable to Kashif Bhatti and his attorney, Law Of?ces of oumana Kayrouz,
to be delivered upon receipt of properly executed Releases and Stipulation and Order of Dismissal
entered in Lawsuit No. 18-007312-NI, approved by the Law Department.

HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: D'Marco Cra? and Michaele Jackson v. City of Detroit; Civil Action Case No.
17-cv-12752 for RC. Richard Billingslea

Representation by the Law Department of the City employee listed below is
hereby not recommended. We agree with the recommendation of the Head of the
Department that the officer was not acting within the scope of his employment at the
time the acts complained of were committed. We do not recommend that the City
indemnifies the Defendant and, therefore, recommend a vote on the attached
resolution for former P.O. Richard Billingslea Badge No. 971.

 

Please note that a copy of the original Law Department letter dated November
14, 2018 is attached (excluding the privileged and confidential attachments which
were previously circulated via email).

At the January 22, 2019 Formal Session, City Council denied representation
of PO. Billingslea (Line Item 66). Subsequently, City Council held a closed
session regarding representation on March 19, 2019. This closed session
(commonly referred to as a Loudermill hearing is a due process requirement pursuant
to the U.S. Supreme Court?s holding in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill,
470 US 532 (1985). Arbitration awards issued by the Voluntary Labor Arbitration
Tribunal also recognize the past practice of City Council holding hearings for police
officers who have been denied representation (see Grievance Nos. 79-237, 82-055, 90-
047, and 

P.O. Billingslea was entitled to receive and the City of Detroit was required to
hold this hearing. Now that the closed session on representation has occurred and
additional and/0r new information was presented to Council in this matter it is timely
and appropriate for the attached resolution to be presented to your Honorable Body
for..a vote.

 

Please advise the Law Department Liaison, Ericka Savage Whitley, if you are
in need of any of the privileged and confidential documents that were previously
distributed in this matter.

Re: Request for ?Local Governing Body Resolution for Charitable Gaming Ucenses? 

For Mittens for Detroit, Inc. State of Michigan Organization ID: 139800

Per my conversation of 3/7/19 with Ms. Jackson in your office, I am submitting a new request for a ?Local
Governing Body Resolution for Charitable Gaming Licenses? for Mittens for Detroit, Inc. We had submitted
a reQuest on 3/26/18 for our event last year, which was assigned the number ?249 - Mittens for Detroit,
request resolution from your Honorable Body a charitable gaming license.? This previous request is
attached, and it apparently got lost in the system. Ms. Jackson suggested that I send it along with updated

information for this year's event.

Mittens for Detroit is a 501(c)(3) nonpro?t that collects, purchases, and distributes new mittens and gloves
to children and adults in need in Detroit, Hamtramck, Highland Park, and other nearby communities. Since
its inception in 2010, over one-quarter million new pairs have been collected and distributed, with
distribution through a network of about 100 agencies, schools, health facilities and other organizations
that work with those in need. Our work has a great impact in the health and well-being in the

neighborhoods.

Our of?ce has been downtown since 2013, first in 1001 Woodward and in the First National Building since
2015.

Mittens for Detroit was founded as a community initiative in 2010. In 2011, it became a fiscally sponsored
nonprofit. In 2016, we incorporated, receiving our 501(c)(3) in late November 2016. On January 1, 2017,
we assumed full responsibility for our organization, ending the relationship with the ?scal sponsor on
12/31/16. Therefore, 201? was our first year to be filing a 990, which is attached. Our 2013 990 is not yet

completed.

All other materials which were requested for this resolution are attached. Our event Giggles 8i Gloves
is on May 19, 2019, which is the event for which we are requesting this license, and a flyer is attached.
A copy of our Raf?e License Application, which has been sent to the State, is also attached.

Thank you so much for your consideration of this request. Please advise me when it is completed or if you
need more information.
