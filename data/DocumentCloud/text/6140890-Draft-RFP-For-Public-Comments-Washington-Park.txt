 Letter from the Cook County Land Bank Authority
In 2013, the Cook County Land Bank Authority
(CCLBA) was formed to promote the redevelopment
of vacant land and properties and support efforts
to stabilize neighborhoods. We work with local
government and community stakeholders, and we
commit our resources to bring these properties back
to productive use.
In Woodlawn, we see a community that is
simultaneously recovering from the foreclosure
crisis while also experiencing a boom: Multiple new,
large-scale investments are occurring and Woodlawn
is quickly becoming one of the “hottest” neighborhoods in the city.
In the midst of this change, CCLBA’s goal is to
bring resources that act as a stabilizing force for
the community as well as attract new investment
to the neighborhood.
Last year, we acquired the Washington Park National
Bank Building. Located at the gateway of Woodlawn,
the future of the bank building is the heart of 63rd
and Cottage Grove, and we wanted the community
to be involved in its revitalization. That’s why we
partnered with the Metropolitan Planning Council
(MPC) to conduct the Corridor Development Initiative
(CDI), a participatory planning process for community
stakeholders.

Over 180 stakeholders participated in three meetings,
allowing them to work with community development
professionals to transform their ideas into 20 possible
development scenarios.
This publication documents the community’s efforts,
needs and goals, both for the public record and to
provide to potential developers of the building.
Thank you to all who participated in the CDI process.
We hope you will continue to provide input as
we release a Request for Proposal (RFP). We are
confident that the input from community members
at the beginning of this process will result in a project
that is responsive to local needs and foster continued
vitality on this important commercial corner.
Sincerely,

Rob Rose
Executive Director
Cook County Land Bank Authority

The CDI model goes a step beyond public hearings
by equipping participants with knowledge and tools
to create scenarios for development that are rooted
in market realities. The core principles that arise from
these workshops are used to guide development that
is responsive to community needs and priorities.

WOODLAWN CORRIDOR DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE  1

 Executive Summary
Transit-oriented development (TOD) supports thriving neighborhoods by improving access
to jobs and amenities across the city and suburbs, decreasing cost of living and reducing
traffic congestion and air pollution. That’s why the Metropolitan Planning Council (MPC) has
been a long-time advocate. MPC has an extensive track record of working with government,
community and business leaders across metropolitan Chicago to:
1.  Revise local policies to encourage greater density and affordable housing options near transit;
2.  Research and recommend new financing tools to encourage TOD; and
3.  Engage communities in shaping their local vision for TOD through our Corridor Development Initiative (CDI)
and other forms of technical assistance.
In 2017, Cook County Land Bank Authority (CCLBA)
Executive Director Robert Rose invited MPC to lead an
inclusive, site-based planning process for community
members to help shape the future of the Washington
Park National Bank Building, located at 6300 S.
Cottage Grove and adjacent to the 63rd and Cottage
Grove el stop.

Restaurant and historic assets such as the Grand
Ballroom, the area has experienced new life in recent
years with the redevelopment of Grove Parc Plaza
through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development’s (HUD) Choice Neighborhoods Initiative
and budding investment sparked by the promise of a
nearby presidential center.

The property was cited as one of Chicago’s most
endangered buildings in 2016 and lay vacant in a
state of disrepair with unpaid taxes for more than 20
years. The first large-scale commercial site acquired by
the Land Bank, the property will be returned to the
market through a competitive request for proposal
(RFP) process informed by community priorities for
redevelopment.

At the north and southeast corners of the intersection,
Preservation of Affordable Housing (POAH) is leading
a revitalization effort that includes construction
of Woodlawn Station, a mixed-use building with
15,000 sq. ft. of ground-level commercial space and
55 residential units expected to be completed in the
summer of 2018. POAH also acquired a 22,000 sq. ft.
commercial property across the street, which is slated
for future redevelopment. Central to the intersection
is the Chicago Transit Authority’s (CTA) 63rd & Cottage
Grove Green Line station, which is the terminus of the
eastern branch of the Green Line. CTA will begin a $3
million project to upgrade the station in 2018.

The intersection of 63rd and Cottage Grove has
long been an important gateway to the Woodlawn
community. In its heyday, 63rd Street was a thriving
corridor on the South Side offering a range of retail
and entertainment options. Best known for Daley’s

2  WOODLAWN CORRIDOR DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE

The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT)
has also prioritized the intersection for their Walk
to Transit Program, a federally-funded initiative to
improve pedestrian safety and comfort for people
walking within a ¼ mile of a transit station.
Woodlawn has a proud history of community organizing
and active groups of engaged residents. Community
members have taken proactive approaches to
planning with the development of a LISC Quality of
Life Plan in 2005, an Urban Planning Study in 2015 by
1Woodlawn in collaboration with Gensler, and, most
recently, a Community Vision and Master Plan in 2017
by 1Woodlawn in collaboration with SOM.
In January 2018, MPC brought the Corridor Development
Initiative to Woodlawn to align conversations on
investments near 63rd & Cottage Grove and lead
community members in a process to create viable
development proposals. In collaboration with
volunteer experts in development and design, MPC
helped stakeholders understand the benefits available

 under the City of Chicago’s TOD ordinance, potential
government incentives and historic preservation
financing sources, and how building design can
promote positive health outcomes. Through three
public meetings, an online survey, text polling and
a workshop at the Woodlawn Summit, hundreds of
participants shared their ideas, concerns and opinions
about what is needed in the community. Neighbors,
business owners and institutional partners participated
in small group discussions, building block exercises
and keypad polling to craft specific recommendations
that considered market realities, economic impacts
and how the design could improve the health of
residents and upgrade existing transit assets.
This report documents the results of our engagement
process. It is important to note that our goal was not
to reach consensus on any one vision, but to identify
areas of broad agreement about the future of the site.

How this report will be used
Robert Rose and the board of the Cook County
Land Bank Authority committed to use the results
of the CDI to help determine the most appropriate
and realistic uses for the building. The CCLBA has
identified priorities that are consistent with principles
that emerged from the CDI process. These include
the return of vacant, abandoned or foreclosed
property to productive status to support neighborhood revitalization and development that promotes
job creation. Additionally, the CCLBA will impose
covenants, conditions and restrictions to ensure the
use, rehabilitation and redevelopment of the property
is consistent with the public purposes of the Land
Bank.

The CCLBA is charged with the disposition of the
property and intends to issue an RFP to select a
development team who will purchase and redevelop
the property. The CCLBA commits to holding a
public meeting after the RFP is released to offer the
Woodlawn community another point for transparency
and feedback. Proposals will be weighted based
on their ability to respond to the community’s
recommendations and other core requirements of the
RFP. The final proposal will be approved by the CCLBA
board.
MPC will distribute this report widely and continue
conversations with the Cook County Land Bank
Authority and the local advisory committee to
advocate for a redevelopment plan that best reflects
the community’s needs and priorities. The CDI
experience and outcomes serve as a model for how
proactive planning can produce development that
meets the needs and desires of local residents and
businesses, connects people to jobs, amenities and
experiences in different communities and increases
transit ridership.

 The Corridor Development Initiative
The Corridor Development Initiative (CDI) is a participatory planning process that engages communities in proactively planning for real-world development scenarios.
Through three public meetings, participants gain a deeper understanding of issues such as density, transit-oriented development, affordable housing and the true cost
of development, and create a set of priorities to guide community leaders as they plan for future development in their neighborhoods. Developers can use this CDI
report to understand local opportunities and values. The Metropolitan Planning Council (MPC) partners with communities across the Chicago region to use the CDI to
encourage quality, equitable development near transit.
Through an exercise using wooden blocks and aerial maps of the selected sites, participants have the opportunity to “build” what they would like to see and test
whether their projects are financially feasible. Participants then work together to consider development options and explore how their ideas might perform on the
ground. The CDI is not a master planning process but can be integrated with such processes.

Existing conditions and goals

Block exercise

Development recommendations

The first meeting provides an overview of current
land use policies and demographic and commercial changes in the community. Participants discuss
development opportunities and challenges and set
concrete goals.

Next, community members explore design and
financing options for their ideas through a hands-on
block exercise. Participants create hypothetical developments using various wooden blocks that represent
different building uses. As community members build
their proposals, they are sketched by design advisors,
while a real estate advisor calculates development
costs, revenues and any financing gaps.

The final meeting features a panel of real estate
experts and developers who respond to the outcomes
of the block exercise in light of current market
trends. These recommendations are then compiled
into a report that community leaders can present to
potential developers to provide them with a community-led, feasibility-tested vision.

 Recommendations
The following summarizes the primary conclusions of the Woodlawn CDI workshops and online survey. This report outlines a vision for the property that
is feasible and balances the many ideas expressed by participants.

General recommendations

1.

The site should be developed as a commercial
property with a mix of retail, restaurants,
professional services and nonprofit space.
The majority (more than 58 percent) of people
surveyed agreed that the focus of the redevelopment
should be commercial. Participants also noted the
need for “responsible retail” such as financial services,
family-friendly entertainment or cultural venues where
people can gather and interact. These views were
reinforced in the second workshop where 100 percent
of the development proposals included retail and a
majority (60 percent or higher) included nonprofit
and commercial spaces. Only a small percentage of
proposals included housing.

2.

Polling revealed the preferred height for the
building should be consistent with the existing
structure and not exceed five stories.
The average development proposal was 4-5 stories
tall and over 60 percent of those polled agreed the
building should be between four and five stories.

3.

Keypad Polling Results

Parking should be considered for only a
portion of retail units.
38 percent felt there are enough parking options
in the area and no need for parking at the site. 40
percent favored dedicated parking for a portion of
retail space. In the development proposals, an average
of 23 new parking spaces were created to serve the
development. During the third workshop, experts
discussed how pedestrian-friendly sites are attractive
to retailers, as well as options to broker a shared
underutilized parking lot located to the south.

4.

Development should, to the extent possible,
improve community health and safety.
In the first and second workshops, participants
discussed the impact of design on health and
safety and received guidance on how incorporating
elements like green space, lighting and the location
of entrances can improve sightlines, pedestrian access
and health outcomes. Participants cited safety at
the intersection of 63rd & Cottage Grove and better
lighting under and around the train station as needed
improvements. Additionally, 63 percent of participants
polled in the first workshop agreed that the area lacks
access to healthy food options. Development proposals reflected a desire for more restaurants and flexible
open space such as atriums, green roofs and a plaza.

 Woodlawn
Community demographics
The historic bank building located at 6300 S. Cottage
Grove Avenue is located in Chicago’s Woodlawn
neighborhood. 63rd Street was historically a vibrant
commercial corridor, home to some of Chicago’s
greatest jazz clubs, but has experienced high vacancy
and job loss over the past several decades in part due
to disinvestment and declining population. Over the
last 60 years, Woodlawn has lost over 50 percent of
its population, falling to 24,150 in 2010. 85 percent
of Woodlawn residents are black or African American.
In 2015, over 51 percent of Woodlawn households
earned less than $25,000 per year. The median
purchase price of a home in Woodlawn in 2010 was
$162,392; the homeownership rate during the same
year was 19 percent. Several hundred units of tax
credit affordable housing have been developed in the
neighborhood recently, but the share of renter households that are housing cost-burdened—meaning
they spend more than 30 percent of their incomes
on housing—was 62 percent in 2016. The share of
cost-burdened homeowners in Woodlawn was 49
percent in 2010. A steady uptick in home values in
the neighborhood as a result of future investments
have raised displacement concerns among residents
and community stakeholders.

 Site
The Washington Park National Bank Building was
constructed in 1924, adjacent to the Cottage Grove
Green Line station which was built in 1893. The
current el station opened after renovation in 1994
and serves about 1,174 daily users. Ridership at the
station has fallen by about 17 percent over the past
15 years. The public space around the station will
receive lighting and pedestrian upgrades over the
next several years thanks to Chicago Department of
Transportation’s Walk to Transit capital investment
program.
The four corners of the Cottage Grove and 63rd
Street intersection are home to Daley’s Restaurant,
several retail businesses, the Bessie Coleman Public
Library and rental housing. Preservation of Affordable
Housing (POAH) will complete construction of
Woodlawn Station, a 55-unit mixed-income, mixeduse development with first-floor retail, financed
through the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, on the
northwest corner of the intersection, later this year.
POAH has also purchased the property on the southeast corner of the intersection and plans to redevelop it.
Beyond the immediate intersection, however, the 63rd
Street and Cottage Grove Avenue corridors suffer from a
high density of vacant lots and shuttered storefronts.
The Cook County Land Bank Authority (CCLBA) owns
the bank building site, which includes the vacant
building and an adjacent strip of grassy land. The
goal of the Woodlawn CDI was to determine how the
community could best respond to current and future
needs while planning for transit-oriented development.

 Community participation
Outreach strategy
MPC worked closely with the Cook County Land Bank
Authority to develop a community outreach strategy.
Initial meetings were held with key city government
partners, including the Chicago Department of
Planning and Development, Department of Transportation and Chicago Transit Authority. The Chicago
Department of Public Health (CDPH) also collaborated
to provide community level health impact assessment
data. This information provided insight on how the
community of Woodlawn compares to the rest of
the city on key public health indicators such as air
quality, access to healthy foods and mental and
social wellbeing. CDPH designed questions to gauge
priorities of community members in these areas and
shared resources to help participants understand how
building design can have a positive impact on health
and safety. Meetings were also held with institutional

stakeholders including POAH, 1Woodlawn and the
University of Chicago to coordinate information
on past planning efforts and new and future
development that would impact the 63rd & Cottage
Grove intersection.
To ensure the outreach strategy resulted in significant
attendance and community participation, MPC
assembled an advisory committee of local stakeholders. This group met twice prior to the CDI workshops
to provide feedback on meeting content, advise
on local outreach opportunities and best practices,
promote meetings, and offer knowledge on past
planning efforts and Woodlawn’s sociopolitical
landscape. MPC also consulted these advisors for
feedback on the draft version of this report. The
commitment consisted of representatives from many

local organizations—an indicator of a highly engaged
community:
•  1Woodlawn Quadrant Leaders
•  Blacks in Green
•  Chicago Public Library
•  Cook County Land Bank
•  Chicago Park District
•  Harris Park Advisory Council
•  West Woodlawn Coalition
•  Woodlawn Chamber of Commerce
•  Woodlawn Neighbors Association
•  Woodlawn Summit

Outreach methods
With the help of this advisory committee, MPC conducted robust outreach, including the methods detailed below. The primary objective was to invite area residents and
stakeholders to participate in the three public meetings held in January and February 2018.
Emails
MPC sent promotional emails to key organizations
and individuals, and shared these emails with the
advisory committee for wider distribution through
their networks.
Online announcements
MPC used social media, including Twitter and
Facebook, to promote the meetings.

10  WOODLAWN CORRIDOR DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE

News Placements
MPC invited journalists to attend and promote the
meetings. These outlets followed up with several
articles throughout the CDI process.

On-the-ground outreach
MPC staff distributed flyers and posters to multi-unit
residential developments, businesses on major arterials, key residential streets, churches and restaurants.
MPC staff also visited the Bessie Coleman Public
Library and the Harris Park Fieldhouse to invite staff
to attend and promote the meetings to patrons. MPC
made efforts to connect with additional community
organizations and shared flyers at area elementary
schools.

 Mobile text polling
MPC used Textizen mobile polling, a tool that
provides an interactive platform for users to share
their thoughts. To gather this input, MPC included a
prompt for text polling on the flyers and postcards
distributed widely throughout the community.

people responded to a multiple choice list and chose
whether or not to opt in to receive text updates about
the CDI.
Eventbrite allowed participants to sign up for individual workshops, receive email reminders and respond
to polling questions. Registrations through Eventbrite
were more popular than participation in text polls.
More than 40 participants signed up for workshops
using Eventbrite.

The el tracks above 63rd Street darken storefonts. The community identified lighting as a priority.

Meeting participation

Survey participation

The three CDI meetings took place on January 30,
February 6 and 20, 2018 from 6 to 8 p.m. at the
Harris Park District, which is centrally located in the
community. Each meeting averaged 100 attendees.

To gather input on the process from the Woodlawn community, MPC designed an online survey
that was shared with all meeting attendees, project
stakeholders and the advisory committee. The
survey was distributed to others who had not had
the opportunity to attend the meetings. During the
Woodlawn Summit in March, an annual meeting
by and for residents, a workshop explained the CDI
process and shared development scenarios and
recommendations. The Summit had over 400 people
in attendance and close to 40 came to the workshop
on the CDI. Flyers were distributed at the summit
with information on how to access the online survey.
Between February 21 and March 10, 2018 only 20
individuals completed the survey. Feedback from the
survey is also incorporated into the recommendations.

A majority of attendees were Woodlawn homeowners, despite the fact that the community area’s
population is over 70 percent renters. Between the
first and third meetings, MPC conducted additional
outreach to attract more renters. See the tables on
the following page for more data on the breakdown
of meeting participants.
All meetings had a broad range of participants. When
we broke out the final survey and polling results to
show responses from only those who live or work in
Woodlawn, the priorities for the site remained the
same.
During each of the three meetings, MPC used
electronic keypad polling to collect additional information about attendees, including demographics and
development preferences, which informed the conclusions of this report.

Full survey results can be found in the online appendix
at metroplanning.org/woodlawn.

Participants placed dots to indicate where they live, work and play in
Woodlawn. Results are cumulative from all three CDI meetings.

 Meeting 1: Community goals
The following were identified as needs, challenges and opportunities the community believes are critical to
development in Woodlawn, not just at this site.

Participants identified a strong preference for creating
office space within the development that would be
accessible and affordable to local small businesses and
entrepreneurs.

Community Gathering and Cultural Space
There is a need for community-focused, safe spaces
in the neighborhood. Any future development should
encourage social interaction, provide programming,
and ideally celebrate Woodlawn’s rich history and
culture. Some of the uses identified included a
community café, public library, movie theater, cultural
arts center, YWCA and child care center.

Safety and Security

Business Attraction
Many participants expressed a desire to maintain the
building’s historic appearance, and to see the building
reflect a mix of uses and activities. Suggestions
focused on healthy and responsible retail. Participants
expressed clear values around creating interactions

and relationships with community-based businesses
and preserving existing businesses. Participants also
expressed a desire to connect the development with
jobs and training for local residents.

Participants identified a need to bring more energy,
amenities and activity back to this corridor to draw
more people to this intersection, improve people’s
perception of safety and to help disrupt negative
activities currently taking place. Improved street
lighting, particularly underneath the CTA el tracks
that run along 63rd Street was suggested, along with
activating the sidewalk to help attract foot traffic and
discourage loitering. Finally, participants expressed
a need for better management of vehicle traffic at
the intersection and improvements to allow for safer
pedestrian crossings.

WOODLAWN CORRIDOR DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE  13

 Participants agreed that poor lighting deterred
residents from using the El. They also expressed a
desire to better leverage the centrality of the station,
as well as its proximity to buses, as part of the
development of the bank building site and as a way
to capture business from commuters and visitors
who will be drawn to the neighborhood due to the
incoming Obama Presidential Center.

Housing and Health
Although some expressed a need for additional
affordable housing options, the majority of
participants agreed that this particular site should be
prioritized for other community needs including retail,
restaurants, office and community spaces. Some
participants offered alternatives, such as using the
wide availability of vacant lots in the neighborhood,
and particularly those located along residential
corridors, for additional housing development.
Table conversations included the discussion of health
values and how a development project could support
and promote well-being. Handouts illustrated options
that included creation of green space and places for
gathering and outdoor activity.

Transportation and accessibility
At the first meeting, representatives from CTA provided a brief summary of their plans to upgrade the
Cottage Grove Green Line station, which is scheduled
for completion at the end of 2018. As part of this
upgrade, CTA will replace all existing lighting, repaint,
and make repairs on the stairs, elevators and other
elements to ensure they are in a state of good repair.
14  WOODLAWN CORRIDOR DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE

CDOT will also fund pedestrian safety improvements at the 63rd and Cottage Grove intersections.
Beginning in Fall 2018, priorities will include sidewalk improvements, enhanced ADA accessibility and
signage and traffic signal improvements.

 Meetings 2 and 3: Scenario development
In the second workshop, meeting attendees gathered
around tables in facilitated groups to generate
concepts for development at the Washington Park
National Bank Building site. Each table created two
scenarios: rehab and new construction. At the time
of the CDI, an assessment of the building’s condition
was underway but had not yet been finalized by the
structural engineer. Therefore, it was imperative that
the community propose visions for both adaptive
reuse and new construction.
Using large maps and scaled wooden blocks that
represented different building uses (such as retail,
office, community or residential spaces), each
group discussed how they would like to see the site
redeveloped. Volunteer facilitators and architects
provided technical assistance and helped shape the
discussion but did not force outcomes in one direction
or another. Once each table agreed to a development
plan, they “built” it, took a picture and recorded their
plan’s characteristics.

Analysis and development panel
The meeting’s facilitators—MPC staff and volunteers
with professional expertise in development and
finance—analyzed each proposed development plan
and offered insight into design and financial feasibility.
Volunteers mocked up the plans and translated them
into development budgets to estimate construction
costs, investment return, available subsidies and other
financial details specific to the site. Health experts also
reviewed each scenario to identify the potential for
positive health outcomes.
For each scenario, MPC provided an estimate of
the proposal’s characteristics with the costs and
subsidies needed to fill the funding gap. Among the
20 scenarios developed, a range of uses and design
concepts were proposed. For each, volunteers offered
feedback on how each concept could potentially
reduce any gaps in funding. MPC identified four
proposals to analyze in-depth because they were most

representative of the ideas developed by the groups
(see the appendix for the remaining scenarios).
MPC presented these four representative proposals
to the community at the third meeting, and a panel
of developers offered immediate feedback about
each proposal. Workshop participants were asked
to comment on the proposals, including what
adjustments they would be willing to make for the
projects to be more financially feasible. Together
with the responses from earlier workshops and the
online survey, MPC used this feedback to develop the
recommendations for site development.
Characteristics of all 20 proposals and the four
selected proposals are presented on the following
pages.

Though attendees were given the opportunity to
explore any and all ideas, they were encouraged to
create visions that met market realities. These development realities—including real-world constraints of
the site, and the benefits and limitations of various
public subsidies, affordable housing resources and
other significant capital sources—are noted in the
online appendix: metroplanning.org/woodlawn

 If the bank building were rehabbed...
In early 2018, the Metropolitan Planning Council and the Cook County Land Bank Authority co-led a series of community meetings in order to plan a new life for
Chicago’s Washington Park National Bank Building at 6300 S. Cottage Grove Ave. in Woodlawn. Residents and local stakeholders weighed in. This is a summary of
the development proposals created in those meetings, specifically participants’ wishes for rehabbing the bank building.

 Scenario 1: Rehab

Potential health impacts
•  Shared community spaces build social cohesion
and trust, improve self-rated health and reduce
the risk of heart disease and stroke.
•  Adding green space or gardens to the open
rooftop could reduce anxiety and depression for
residents and provide increased access to fruits
and vegetables.

The project would provide new retail and commercial opportunities and rental housing
within the existing building. It would feature an open rooftop to accommodate community
space. The residential component of this project would provide 18 market-rate apartments
and includes no on-site parking. The development scenario projects to have a low financial
return and a $2.5 million gap in financing.

Project financials
Total Development Cost: $10.7 million    Financing gap: $2.5 million

•  Affordable housing can boost a family’s income,
making healthy foods and other healthy activities
more accessible.

 Scenario 2: New Construction

Potential health impacts
•  Services provided by the YWCA and public library can
support increased physical activity, social cohesion,
child/youth wellbeing and skills development.
•  Exposure to sunlight and the sound of moving water
can reduce anxiety and depression and promote mental
wellbeing.
This project would provide a mixture of retail, commercial and community space. Its key
features include the Bessie Coleman Branch of the Chicago Public Library, which would move
from its current space into this development, along with the YWCA. The existing public library
building (adjacent to this site) would be redeveloped into a parking garage with 40 parking
spaces.
The project would include features such as an atrium with a fountain, a lounge, restaurant and
bank, and would provide co-working and business incubator spaces. The development scenario
projects to have very low financial returns and a $2.4 million gap in financing.

•  A restaurant that serves healthy food options can
reduce the risk of hypertension, obesity and diabetes.
