Agreement period: 4/6/1987 until revoked
Fiscal Impact: None
Accounts: N/A

Summary: Amends Section 13 of the previously executed agreement between the Chicago Zoological
Society (Zoo) and the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (District) for the maintenance and
operation of a zoological park on lands of the Forest Preserve District, commonly known as the
Brookfield
Zoo, to allow for changes in certain admission and parking rates.
Reason:
This increase will support the Zoo’s submitted 2018 Budget proposal. On 4/6/1987 an agreement between
the District and the Zoo was presented and approved by this Honorable Board of Commissioners for the
continued maintenance and operations of the Brookfield Zoo (Agreement). From time to time the
Agreement has been amended by mutual consent of the District and the Zoo (Parties). The Parties now
wish to amend the Agreement to approve an increase in admission and parking fees at the Brookfield Zoo
as indicated below.
Section 13 of the Agreement is hereby amended as follows:
"Said Zoological Park shall be open without general admission charge to organized groups of children in
attendance at schools in the State of Illinois. The Society may limit the number of any such groups in
any given day and may establish other rules and regulations that reasonably ensure public safety,
accessibility, and convenience, including but not limited to standards of conduct and supervision. Said
Zoological Park shall be free to the public without payment of any general admission fee or gratuity for a
period equivalent to 52 days each year. The Society may otherwise charge an admission fee to said Park
not exceeding $19.85 $21.95 for each visitor from twelve to sixty-five years of age; and not exceeding
$14.50 $15.95 for each visitor ages three to eleven and for each visitor sixty-five years of age or older
showing proof of birth date. The Society may charge a parking fee not exceeding $12 $14 per car and
$15 $20 per bus. The Society may charge fees not exceeding these limits on a per vehicle basis and may
otherwise adjust seasonally and daily to provide for optimal utilization of said Zoological Park. The
proceeds of such admission fees and parking fees shall be devoted exclusively to the operation and
maintenance of said Zoological Park and the collections therein. Charges may be made at any time
pursuant to special services and for admission to special facilities within said Zoological Park for the
education, entertainment or convenience of visitors."
