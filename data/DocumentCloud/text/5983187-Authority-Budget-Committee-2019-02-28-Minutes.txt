2. Bullying Prevention (BP)
ICJIA Program Supervisor Reshma Desai, referring to the memo regarding SFY19 BP
funds, said the proposed programming would address bullying prevention within
established school-based trauma-informed networks. Staff let a Notice of Funding
Opportunity (NOFO) to the recipients so that they could complete an action plan. She
said that staff recommended making the following SFY19 BP designations:
DESIGNEE
Southern Illinois University
Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital
TOTAL

RECOMMENDED
DESIGNATION
$198,466
$193,809
$392,275

Mr. Buckman said that Southern Illinois University’s program intended to target
elementary, middle, or high schools and allow the school districts to select which
individual schools would participate, thus the program would serve students from
kindergarten through 12th grade. Ms. Raviv said Lurie Children’s Hospital planned to use
a similar approach for its programming.
Motion: Ms. Kramer moved to approve the recommended SFY19 BP designations. Lt.
Col. Byrd seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.

3. Death Penalty Abolition Act (DPA)
ICJIA Criminal Justice Specialist Maureen Brennan, referring to the meeting materials
regarding SFY19 DPA Fund, said after the State of Illinois abolished the death penalty,
the legislature transferred remaining in the Capital Litigation Trust monies to the Death
Penalty Abolition (DPA) Fund, a special fund in the state treasury to be expended by the
Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority. These funds shall be used for services for
families of victims of homicide or murder and for training of law enforcement personnel,
she said. She said the meeting materials contained a typographical error; $2 million, not
$2.5 million, in DPA SFY19funds were made available through a notice of funding
opportunity for services to families of homicide victims. She said that staff recommended
making the following designations using those funds:
DESIGNEE
BUILD, Inc.
Chicago Survivors, Inc.
TOTAL

RECOMMENDED
DESIGNATION
$92,142
$151,981
$244,123

Motion: Chief Perez moved to approve the recommended SFY19 DPA designations. Lt.
Col. Byrd seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
4. Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Councils (IFVCC)
ICJIA Program Supervisor Mary Ratliff, referring to the memo regarding SFY19 IFVCC
funds, said that the IFVCC comprises 13 local family violence coordinating councils
throughout Illinois. She said staff recommended decreasing the existing Cra Wa La
Volunteers in Probation, Inc., designation by $10,000, as the program was experiencing
hiring difficulties prohibiting the fund expenditure. She said the $10,000 would be used
to support the annual IFVCC spring training.
Motion: Ms. Kramer moved to approve the recommended SFY19 IFVCC designation
reduction. Mr. Olson seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
5. Justice Assistance Grants (JAG)
Designation Reductions
ICJIA Federal & State Grants Unit Acting Associate Director Greg Stevens, referring to
meeting materials on Federal Fiscal Years 2013 through 2017 JAG Plan Adjustments,
described $710,849 in funds recently returned to ICJIA from programs in the amounts
listed below:

$4,096,245 in FFY13, FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16 JAG funds to support police-led
substance use diversion/deflection programs, multijurisdictional large-scale narcotic
trafficking enforcement, and multijurisdictional narcotic prosecution programs. He said
ICJIA had received its FFY17 JAG award and that staff recommended designating funds
to support the programs for 18 months, except where noted in the materials. The
designations would fulfill ICJIA’s three-year commitment to fund these programs, he
said.

Public Comment
Barbara Shaw, representing Chicago Survivors, said DPA legislation states that the
purpose of the DPA funds shall be used for services for families of victims of homicide
or murder and for training of law enforcement personnel and noted DPA funds are the
only state funds earmarked for this victim group. She said the NOFOs that were issued
for the remaining $6.5 million in DPA funds disproportionately favored law enforcement
training in terms of fund allocations. She requested that ICJIA reconsider more equitable
funding distribution between services for families of victims of homicide or murder and
for training of law enforcement personnel. She also requested that ICJIA reconsider
depleting the DPA funds over the next three years. She said the funds are critical to
service providers and it would be advantageous to extend the funds for a longer period.
Executive Director John Maki said the biggest concern ICJIA has with DPA funds is that
they exist at all. The DPA fund has been swept in the past, he said, and if the DPA funds
are not actively used, the pot becomes attractive to lawmakers looking for idle funds for
other programs. This puts pressure on ICJIA staff to move the funds, he said. He noted
that with the recent VOCA federal awards, ICJIA has been supporting more victim
services programs than ever before. In addition, he said, there has been a lot of
demonstrated need for law enforcement training. He said staff has made every effort to
maintain the integrity of the statutory intent of the DPA Act. He noted that the last time
ICJIA designated DPA funds, it was via a sole-source agreement with Chicago Survivors.
He said staff recommended offering DPA funding opportunities to more potential
recipients via a competitive process.
