 The Executive Director reported on the status of the search for an Investment Consultant. She
stated that the Fund had received proposals from four candidates, including a proposal from
the incumbent. The Investment Staff was currently conducting due diligence of the
candidates and expected that the process would be completed in a few weeks. After the
Investment Staff’s due diligence has been completed, the finalists will be presented to the
Board.
4. Legal Matters
a. Findings of Fact
Margaret Fahrenbach, Legal Advisor, stated that the Fund staff had identified three matters in
which members had been denied requests for duty disability benefits because their
applications had not been filed while they were still disabled. Each of the members had each
requested administrative hearings. The Fund had asked that the members provide evidence
to show that they had a reasonable cause for delay in filing their respective applications
before proceeding with the administrative hearings. If they failed to do so, the Fund would
request that the Board entered final administrative decisions. None of the members provided
evidence which would support a reasonable cause for delay in filing their applications for
benefits. The Fund prepared proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decisions
for Sharon Mindock, John Scanlon and Paula Williams for the Board’s consideration.
Sharon Mindock-Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decision
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee McFadden that the Board
reaffirm its earlier decision that Sharon Mindock is not eligible for the duty disability
benefits that she requested and that the Board adopt the presented Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law and Decision as a final administrative decision.

5. Consideration of August 20, 2015 Health Benefits Committee Recommendations
Brenda Deming, Director of Health Benefits, stated that the Health Benefits Committee reviewed
three clinical options relating to Presecription Drug Benefits and approved three changes to
Specialty Medication Management that would result in savings. The Committee recommended that
a Split Fill Oncology Program be adopted which would allow oncology drugs to be filled in small
quantities to avoid waste in the event the patient required a different prescription drug. In addition, it
was recommended that the Board adopt the CVS Health Advance Control Specialty Formulary
which follows a restrictive formulary for prescription drugs that are characterized as specialty
medications. Finally, the Committee recommended that the coverage of all treatment of hemophilia
be transferred to the medical plan, including the coverage of all prescribed drug therapy. The
changes were projected to save between $1.2 and $1.4 million annually.
It was moved by Trustee Goode and seconded by Trustee Fitzgerald that the Board approve the
recommendations made by the Health Benefits Committee at their meeting on August 20, 2015, to
adopt the Split Fill Oncology Program, the CVS Health Advance Control Specialty Formulary and
the transfer of all coverage for treatment of hemophilia to the medical plan, as presented.
