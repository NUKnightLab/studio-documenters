Emerging Manager – Portfolio Review;
Ms. Hackett and Mr. Vinzons provided an update on the Fund’s 2013 year-to-date emerging
manager utilization, performance and MWBE broker-dealer usage. Through September
2013, the total Fund’s emerging manager exposure represented approximately 17% of the

County Employees’ and Officers’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Cook County
Forest Preserve District Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Cook County

 total assets, or $1.4 billion. From a performance standpoint, all of the Fund’s emerging
manager domestic equity direct mandates are generating positive returns, with a range of
high-teens to high 20s percentage returns. Channing’s SMID and Small Cap Value products
continue to lead the group. Fixed income managers continue to beat their benchmarks, if
only by a small margin, as the impact of Fed tapering talks earlier in the year begin to
dissipate. Finally, the Fund’s MWBE broker-dealer utilization is at or above targets in all
asset classes.
Ms. Hackett also briefly discussed rebalancing initiatives that have yet to be implemented
and the potential impact that could have on the Fund’s emerging manager utilization goals.
Based on this discussion, the EMIC recommended affirming the Funds’ current emerging
manager and broker dealer target range goals.
Motion to Affirm the Funds’ Emerging Manager and Broker-Dealer Target Utilization
Goals. It was moved by Trustee Herrera and seconded by Trustee Goode to recommend to
the Investment Committee to affirm the Fund’s target range goals for utilization of emerging
investment managers and minority broker dealers as proposed by Fund Investment Staff. –

Motion to Bring Channing SMID Value Portfolio to the Investment Committee. It was
