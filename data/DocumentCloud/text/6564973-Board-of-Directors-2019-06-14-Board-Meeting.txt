BOARD OF DIRECTORS MINUTES

Board of Directors Meeting
March 8, 2019
NOACA Offices

President Valarie McCall convened the Board meeting at 9:00 a.m.
Meeting Minutes
A motion was made by Mayor John Hunter and seconded by Mayor Michael Dylan Brennan
to approve the Board minutes of January 11, 2019. The motion passed by voice vote.
Committee Updates
The Board received summaries of the standing committee meetings.
Comments on the Legislative Meet & Greet
Commissioner Matt Lundy mentioned that NOACA hosted a Legislative Meet & Greet for Ohio
State Representatives and Senators prior to the Board meeting. Commissioner Lundy talked
about the transportation budget bill that was approved recently by the Ohio House. He said
he hopes the state legislators see the gas tax increase through the lens of infrastructure
investment and public transit through the lens of jobs. He said the NOACA region stands
ready to work with the state legislators.
Comments from State Representatives and Senators
State Senator Sandra Williams, Ohio State Senate District 21, said she and her colleagues
are trying to get 18 cents or more or at least maintain the 10.7 cents for the gas tax increase.
State Representative Stephanie Howse, Ohio House District 11, talked about efforts made to
get the NOACA region its fair share of transportation funding.
State Representative Bride Rose Sweeney, Ohio House District 14, thanked Board members
who testified in Columbus in support of transportation funding for the region. She mentioned
that the House approved $100 million for public transportation.
State Representative Terrence Upchurch, Ohio House District 10, said he looked forward to
working with Ohioans and collaborating with NOACA and its Board.
State Representative Kent Smith, Ohio House District 8, stated that Ohioans are served by
61 transit systems that provide a total of 115 million rides per year. He noted that Ohio ranks
7th in population, 14th in ridership, and 38th in state support. He said the state legislature is
looking to put people to work and get people to work. He talked about public transportation,
shared governance model, and amendments introduced by the State Senate and House.

3075b

1-1

 State Representative Steve Hambley, Ohio House District 69, talked about legislators working
together to reach a compromise; the importance of funding being spent wisely and distributed
efficiently and effectively; taking care of local communities; encouraging economic
development; creating shared partnerships at the state and local level; incrementally
increasing the gas tax; maintaining the existing infrastructure; and the importance of public
transit. He encouraged the NOACA Board to contact the State Senate about the
transportation bill.
State Representative Darrell Kick, Ohio House District 70 said he was not in support of the
gas tax increase because of the content in the legislation, but was working through it. He said
he looked forward to the Senate’s proposal and working with the urban and rural areas.
President McCall talked about the NOACA Board working together to meet the needs of the
region; NOACA working to improve the transportation infrastructure for the Amish Community
in Geauga County; NOACA sharing information with others; and the bipartisanship of the
Northeast Ohio delegation.
Ms. Gallucci talked about the bipartisanship of the NOACA Board and the $9.6 million BUILD
grant NOACA secured for infrastructure improvements in Geauga County.
Ms. Gallucci thanked legislators for their work and for taking the time to respond to NOACA’s
concerns and issues. She also recognized State Senator Kenny Yuko and State Senator
John Eklund who attended the Legislative Meet & Greet, but had to leave prior to the Board
meeting.
Public Comments
Mr. Newell Howard, resident of South Russell Village in Geauga County, stated that NOACA
held a public meeting at the Chardon Public Library on July 19, 2018, to solicit input on the
Long-Range Transportation Plan. He noted that Geauga County has not received any verbal
or written details on the plan or how the plan will affect the residents. Mr. Howard expressed
concern that the proposed gas tax increase will negatively impact Geauga County. He
mentioned that questions were forwarded to State Representative Sarah LaTourette and
Senator Eklund, who have not yet responded back with answers.
Ms. Gallucci stated that a public hearing was held in Geauga County in July for the
Coordinated Public Transit-Human Services Transportation Plan, which will be completed
within a couple of months and presented to the Board for approval in June.
Mr. Howard stated that the Coordinated Plan was supposed to be presented at this meeting.
Ms. Gallucci stated that NOACA had some issues with the Lorain County portion of the plan
and is in the process of making some modifications to it.
President McCall asked Mr. Howard to follow up with NOACA staff and Board members from
Geauga County who can provide him with more information. Ms. Gallucci informed
Mr. Howard that Ms. Gayle Godek, NOACA staff, will follow up with him after the Board
meeting. Ms. Gallucci stated that counties receive gas tax funds which are distributed to the
cities, townships and villages. Mr. Howard said South Russell Village does not receive any
money from the gas tax.

Resolution 2019-010: Signal Timing Optimization Program (STOP) Contract
Modification
Ms. Gallucci provided background on STOP and Albeck Gerken’s work.
Mr. John Albeck presented an update on the STOP contract. He noted that Part I of the
contract included an evaluation of West 150th Street / Warren Road and SOM Center Road
corridors. Mr. Albeck reviewed the traffic signal system retiming process and performance
evaluation of both corridors. He stated that the project benefits include emissions savings of
6,600 metric tons; fuel savings of 742,300; delayed savings of 729,500 hours; and a benefit
cost ratio of 26:1. Mr. Albeck also reviewed Part I project status, project assignments, pilot
project assignments and the elements for good timing. He noted that Part II of the STOP
contract will focus on the Chester Avenue corridor.
Ms. Gallucci thanked Mr. Albeck for his firm’s work and the communities for working with
NOACA. President McCall asked staff to keep Cleveland City Council updated on the Chester
Avenue corridor.
Mayor Annette Blackwell asked if the City of Maple Heights should contact NOACA or an
engineering firm to address the traffic jams and anticipated growth with the opportunity zones
on Warrensville Center Road. Ms. Gallucci said information should be forwarded to her.
Ms. Gallucci explained how the corridors are selected for STOP and noted that staff will take
a look at the list to see if the Warrensville Center Road corridor can be moved up on the list.
Ms. Susanna Merlone stated that a total of $1 million was budgeted in the FY 2018 and FY
2019 Overall Work Programs (OWPs) for the STOP contract. She noted that Part I came in
under budget so the resolution would take $30,000 in savings from Part I and move it to Part
II which includes a total of 66 traffic signals. Ms. Merlone stated that with Board adoption,
NOACA staff will work with the communities and the consultant team to implement Part II of
the STOP contract.
A motion was made by Mr. Dever and seconded by Ms. Tanisha Briley to approve Resolution
2019-010. The motion passed by voice vote.
President McCall asked staff to keep Cleveland elected officials, Planning Department, and
Traffic Engineering Department updated on the work being done on Chester Avenue.
Ms. Gallucci stated that once the work begins, Cleveland elected officials and various
departments will be invited to provide comments and participate in discussions.
Resolution 2019-011: Contingency Plan: Revolving Line of Credit
Ms. Billie Geyer reviewed NOACA’s funding sources and noted that the agency relies on
monthly reimbursements ($400,000) from grantors to pay its bills. She stated that the NOACA
Executive Director needs authorization to open or close a revolving line of credit that would
not exceed $1 million. Ms. Geyer reviewed the policy and procedures and noted that the
3075b

1-5

 weekly drawdown amount would be $100,000 per week. Ms. Geyer noted that the
documentation cost is estimated to be $200-$300, plus interest on any outstanding balance.
She said the financial impact of not having a contingency plan is that NOACA’s cash flow may
be inadequate to pay employees and/or vendors and contractors during an extended
government shutdown. She stated that with Board adoption, NOACA staff will work toward
procuring a revolving line of credit subject to the NOACA Revolving Line of Credit Policy.
Mr. Higgins asked why the drawdown amount was being limited to $100,000 a week.
Ms. Gallucci stated that NOACA’s reserve is about $100,000 a week.
Ms. Briley asked staff to comment on the connection between the Operating Reserve Policy
amount and the Revolving Line of Credit Policy. Ms. Gallucci said the Reserve Policy states
that NOACA must have about 2 ½ months in the reserve to cover operating expenses.
Ms. Geyer mentioned that the 2 ½ months Reserve Policy is representative of funds to cover
payroll for 3 months and other operating expenses for 2 months. Ms. Gallucci stated that
NOACA uses its reserve to pay its bills, which is replenished when the agency is reimbursed;
she noted that the Reserve Policy would not apply to a government shutdown.
Mr. James Cordes asked if the reserve is NOACA’s cash flow. Ms. Gallucci said yes and
noted that it is also the working capital. Ms. Gallucci provided background on NOACA’s
Reserve Policy. Ms. Geyer mentioned that the reserve has been low which is why NOACA
increased its dues. Ms. Gallucci talked about the lag time for NOACA to be reimbursed its
funds.
A motion was made by Mr. Cordes and seconded by Mr. Dever to approve Resolution 2019011.
Mr. Bruce Landeg asked if NOACA has an essential personnel policy. Ms. Gallucci said no,
but noted that one could be created. Mr. Landeg asked if the proposed policy would cover all
NOACA employees. Ms. Gallucci said yes.
Ms. Kyle Dreyfuss-Wells asked if the grantors will allow NOACA to use a line of credit to repay
the grants. Ms. Gallucci said the grants would be used to repay the line of credit.
Ms. Dreyfuss-Wells asked if NOACA is allowed to use grant money in that way. Ms. Gallucci
said yes because the grant money reimburses NOACA. Ms. Dreyfuss-Wells asked if the
grantors would reimburse the bank. Ms. Gallucci said the grantors would reimburse NOACA
and then NOACA would pay the bank.
The Board voted, Mr. Landeg voted no, and the motion passed by voice vote.
Resolution 2019-012: NOACA Credit Card Policy
Ms. Geyer stated that the proposed policy would formalize the existing procedures and include
state requirements. She mentioned that NOACA has one account, two cards, and a credit
limit of $20,000. Ms. Geyer reviewed NOACA’s credit card process and procedures and noted
there was no financial impact to implementing the policy.
Mayor Pam Bobst asked if NOACA has a policy for personal credit card use. Ms. Geyer said
not specifically for that purpose, but noted that NOACA minimizes personal credit card use.
(Note: NOACA does have a policy regarding personal credit card use as part of a broader
travel policy) Mayor Bobst asked if language on limited personal credit card use was included

3075b

1-6

 in the proposed policy. Ms. Geyer said no. Mayor Bobst mentioned that state auditors
discourage the use of personal credit cards.
President McCall asked staff to take a look at NOACA’s personal credit card use, which is
probably included in the travel policy. She asked staff to provide the Board with an update on
NOACA’s travel policy. She asked if NOACA has a preapproval process for employees to
follow when purchasing something on short notice.
Ms. Gallucci stated that employees must get a purchase requisition approved prior to buying
anything. Ms. Gallucci stated that exceptions occur, such as if an employee uses their
personal credit card to pay for a taxi as part of a business trip or purchase something for a
public hearing. She said state auditors have not required NOACA to have a policy for personal
credit card use, but one could be created.
A motion was made by Councilman Matt Zone and seconded by Mayor Hunter to approve
Resolution 2019-012. The motion passed by voice vote.
Resolution 2019-013: NOACA Position on Increased Fees for Transportation
Infrastructure
Ms. Gallucci stated that NOACA has maintained its position on increased user fees in a very
broad sense and supports increased funding for public transit. She said it was up to the
legislators to determine the amount.
Ms. Beverly Burtzlaff stated that Governor Mike DeWine proposed a gas tax increase of 18
cents per gallon for the motor fuel user fee indexed to inflation for future years that would
generate an additional $1.2 billion annually. The increase would be included in the SFY 20202021 Transportation Budget. Ms. Burtzlaff reviewed NOACA’s caveats to increasing revenue
through a user fee, including aligning the user fee to demonstrated need, distributing revenue
in an equitable manner, increasing funding for public transportation, and funding maintenance
prior to new capacity. She discussed the estimated fee distributions and the current formula
versus VMT-based distribution.
Ms. Gallucci reviewed the current formula, VMT-based distribution, and the local component
which consists of county, city, and township components. She mentioned that the NOACA
region puts in $225 million, but only gets back $75 million, but if a VMT-based distribution was
used, the region would get back $101 million. Under a VMT- based distribution, all counties
except Geauga would do well. She said NOACA would work to ensure that Geauga County
would remain whole.
Ms. Burtzlaff stated that House Bill 62 includes a 10.7 cent increase for the motor vehicle user
fee; a distribution formula that provides 55% for state and 45% for local; no indexing for
inflation; and federal flex funding in the amount of $100 million annually for transit.
Ms. Burtzlaff mentioned that the bill has to be approved by the Senate. She noted that
following Board approval, Resolution 2019-013 will be communicated to the state legislature,
administration, and other external stakeholders.
A motion was made by Commissioner Lundy and seconded by Mr. Foley to approve
Resolution 2019-013.
Mr. Friedrick asked how VMT is calculated. Ms. Gallucci stated that VMT is a precise estimate
based on traffic counts and other data. She noted that NOACA gets its VMT data from ODOT.
3075b

1-7

 Mr. Friedrick asked if there has been any discussion about changing VMT to vehicle miles
reported based on annual registrations. Ms. Gallucci said no, but noted there was a
discussion about creating a fee for electric vehicles. She said pilots around the country are
looking at VMT through GPS which would provide funding for the roads being used. She said
Northeast Ohio may participate in a pilot, as well.
Engineer Cattell asked if staff’s VMT analysis referred to local roads only. Ms. Gallucci said
interstates were not included in the analysis. Engineer Cattell asked if the state routes have
been included in the 55% (state/ODOT portion) of the distribution formula. Ms. Gallucci said
state routes are only part of the 55% in unincorporated areas, but that state routes in the
incorporated areas are the local jurisdiction’s responsibility, thus part of the 45% (local
government portion).
Engineer Cattell stated that the counties’ portion was split 1/88th because the registration fees
in Southern Ohio rural counties bring in virtually no money. He noted that the urban zones
bring in more money from registrations than rural areas, but when it comes to the gas tax, the
rural areas get more money than they should and urban areas get less money. He said both
funding sources should be looked at as a package. Engineer Cattell said he would be happier
with a decrease in the gas tax if the legislature adds an inflation index.
Ms. Gallucci stated that one model to consider is the federal gas tax where 95% of the tax
generated in a state gets returned to that state. Thus, relative to the state motor vehicle user
fee, perhaps 90-95% of the funding generated by a county, comes back to that county, and
the remaining funding could be redistributed to other counties of the state. She noted that
staff is looking at other formulas.
Councilman Miller suggested that NOACA recommend $100 million for federal flex funding for
public transportation and focus on increasing the general revenue funds for public
transportation. He said NOACA’s resolution was weak.
A motion was made by Councilman Miller and seconded by Mr. Foley to amend Resolution
2019-013 to include the following language in Section 1: “NOACA supports the increase in
the gasoline tax provided that the following issues are included concurrently...”
Mr. Ben Capelle asked if the amendment could include the $120 million mentioned in the
ODOT Transit Needs Study. Ms. Gallucci said yes, provided staff can be provided the
documentation of that amount in the study.
Ms. Stacy Bauer read the following language to be included in Section 1 of the resolution:
“NOACA supports opportunities to increase revenue to a sufficient level to achieve a
state of good repair of Ohio transportation system through user fees or other alternate
methods provided however that the following issues are included concurrently…”
Mr. Capelle mentioned that the Ohio Public Transit Association (OPTA) stated that public
transportation should get $120 million in flex funds.
Dr. Caver located the language in the Transit Needs Study that states $120 million.
Mayor Brennan asked if conditions would be placed on the recommendations. Ms. Gallucci
said the amendment would change the recommendations to requirements.
3075b

1-8

 Ms. Briley suggested including the amount of $120 million in the third recommendation.
Councilman Miller withdrew his original amendment, made a motion for a new amendment to
include the original amendment and add the dollar amount of $120 million to the third
recommendation.
President McCall requested that the amendment be tabled so staff can make changes to the
resolution and present it under old business.
A motion was made by Mr. Friedrick and seconded by Mayor Blackwell to table the
amendment. The motion passed by voice vote.
Ms. Briley suggested changing the word “with” to the word “and” in the first sentence.
A motion was made by Mr. Friedrick and seconded by Mr. Higgins to table Resolution 2019013. The motion passed by voice vote.
Mayor Robert Stefanik suggested keeping the resolution vanilla.
Mr. Myron Pakush stated that he would be abstaining from voting on Resolution 2019-013
and amendments to it since ODOT supports Governor DeWine’s proposal. He noted that if
ODOT receives less than 18 cents, a lot of projects will not get done. He asked Board
members to keep pushing the legislature for the 18 cents and get the business community
behind the bill.
President McCall talked about the region needing more than 18 cents. She asked staff to
present some recommendations when this agenda item is brought back under old business.
Mayor Bobst asked if language on indexing will be included in Section 1. Ms. Gallucci said
staff will change the word “with” to the word “and” in the first sentence; add language on
indexing to Recommendation 2; and add language on $120 million to Recommendation 3.
President McCall asked Mr. Pakush if he would be willing to defer the Opportunity Corridor
presentation to another time. Mr. Pakush said yes.
Mayor David Roche asked for clarification on the user fee of 40% in Recommendation 1 of
Section 1. Ms. Gallucci said staff will clarify by adding “prior to debt service” in the language.
Resolution 2019-014: Project Planning Reviews (PPRs)/Intergovernmental Review and
Consultation (IGRC); 3rd Quarter State Fiscal Year 2019
Mr. Ed May reviewed the following projects included in the 3rd quarter PPRs:

President McCall asked if the new equipment will allow for upgrades. Mr. Capelle said
Laketran was upgrading to 4G because 3G will be phased out.

•

LAKETRAN FY 20 Replacement Light Transit Vehicles (LTVs) - This project involves
purchasing 8, 14 LTVs per year to replace vehicles in the fleet that have reached or

funds will be used.

A motion was made by Mr. Capelle and seconded by Mr. Collier to approve Resolution 2019014.
Councilman Miller asked why there were no GCRTA projects included in the PPRs this
quarter. Mr. May said no GCRTA projects were submitted this quarter. Ms. Gallucci said
GCRTA projects are already in the Plan and TIP.
The Board voted and the motion passed by voice vote.

Resolution 2019-013: NOACA Position on Increased Fees for Transportation
Infrastructure
A motion was made by Mayor Alai and seconded by Mr. Heidecker to bring Resolution 2019013 back on the table. The motion passed by voice vote.
Ms. Gallucci reviewed the following recommended changes to Section 1:
•

First sentence: Change the word “with” to the word “and” in the sentence.

•

Recommendation 1 will read: “Align the amount of the user fee appropriately to
the demonstrated need, with a greater proportion to at least 40%, prior to the
amount taken off the top for debt service, of all revenues going to counties,
cities, and townships.”

•

Recommendation 2 will read: “Index the motor fuel user fee for future inflation.”

•

Recommendation 4 will read: “Increase funding for public transportation to at
least the $120 million goal as contained in the 2015 ODOT Transit Needs
Study…”

Mayor Hunter suggested that NOACA try to get the actual funding needed instead of
concurring with the 10.7 cents. Ms. Gallucci referred Mayor Hunter to Recommendation 1.
Mayor Brennan said Recommendation 1 should clearly state the needs. Ms. Gallucci said
she will work with her colleagues at OARC to get that information. President McCall asked
Ms. Gallucci to include a number in the resolution before sending it out.
A motion was made by Mayor Summers and seconded by Mr. Dever to approve the revised
language in Resolution 2019-013.
Councilman Miller commented that he was not optimistic that much would happen if NOACA’s
recommendations are not included in the overall package. He said he supported the revised
resolution.
Mayor Blackwell asked if there was a reason for pushing the resolution through so quickly at
this meeting. President McCall said yes and noted that the transportation bill was approved
by the House and will soon move to the Senate. President McCall said it was important for
NOACA’s voice to be on record.
Mayor Roche suggested including two sections in the resolution: Section 1 would be the
Governor’s proposal and Section 2 would be the original Section 1.
Commissioner Lundy suggested that Section 1 reads as “NOACA supports the Governor’s
proposal of 18 cents as a minimum or greater…” Ms. Gallucci said the issue is with the
distribution not the amount.
The Board discussed having staff make additional changes to the language in the resolution.

3075b

1 - 13

 Mayor Alai suggested including the following language in the first sentence of Section 1:
“NOACA supports the Governor’s proposal to increase revenue to a sufficient level…”
President McCall asked the Board if it was comfortable with staff making the appropriate
changes to Section 1. The Board had no objection to changes being made to the resolution.
A motion was made by Mayor Roche and seconded by Commissioner Lundy to approve the
amendment to have staff modify the language in Section 1 of the resolution. The Board voted
to approve the amendment, Mr. Pakush abstained, and the motion passed by voice vote.
The Board voted to approve Resolution 2019-013, Mr. Pakush abstained, and the motion

funds have been appropriated by the Ohio General Assembly to ODOT for the purposes of this
Agreement, and to the certification of funds by the Ohio Office of Budget and Management, as
required by §126.07 Ohio Revised Code. If ODOT determines that sufficient funds have not been
appropriated for the purposes of this contract, or if the Ohio Office of Budget and Management fails
to certify the availability of funds, this Agreement or any renewal thereof will terminate on the date
that the funding expires without any further obligation by either party.
SECTION X: TERMINATION

This Agreement may be terminated by any party to this Agreement upon written notice to all other
parties. Any such written notice of termination shall include the terminating party’s reasons for
electing to terminate this Agreement, and the terminating party shall send such written notice of
termination by certified U.S. Mail, return receipt requested, not less than ninety (90) days prior to

AGENCY with notice of the failure to perform or the violation and shall provide a thirty (30) day
period to cure any and all defaults under this contract. During the thirty (30) day cure period, the

subcontracts relating to such terminated activities, take all necessary or appropriate steps to limit
disbursements and minimize costs, and furnish a report describing the status of all work under this
contract, including without limitation, results accomplished, conclusions resulting therefrom, and
such other matters as ODOT may require.

submission of a proper invoice, for the work performed prior to receipt of notice of termination, less
any funds previously paid by or on behalf of ODOT. ODOT shall not be liable for any further claims,

 ODOT shall initially pay all costs of the work performed which are incurred by ODOT and may, owing
to the multi-funding sources, directly invoice the AGENCY for the cost of services provided by ODOT
for expenses within the approved WORK PROGRAM, in accordance with the terms and conditions
specified in this Agreement.

In no instance shall reimbursement payments for the cost of the work to be performed exceed the
maximum cost shown in the approved WORK PROGRAM and budget without prior written approval
of ODOT. Any expenditure in excess of the budget, without prior written approval from ODOT, will
be the exclusive responsibility of the AGENCY.
No expenditure shall be included in the cost of the work performed and no part of any funds
reimbursed to the AGENCY shall be used by the AGENCY for expenditures or charges that are
(1) contrary to the provisions of this Agreement, (2) not directly related to the work performed,
(3) incurred without the consent of ODOT, or (4) after written notice of the suspension or termination
of any or all of the AGENCY’s obligations under this Agreement.
In the event that funding generally made available to ODOT by the U.S. DOT is limited either in scope
or magnitude, ODOT reserves the right to mutually negotiate with the AGENCY a revision to this
Agreement as an alternative to termination.

The AGENCY shall have an independent financial statement audit performed on an annual basis in

As often as deemed necessary by ODOT, or U.S. DOT, the AGENCY shall provide ODOT, or U.S. DOT, or
both, or any of their duly authorized representatives, upon reasonable notice, proper facilities for the
review, inspection, and programmatic audits of the work performed under this Agreement and any
records in support of the work performed. This will include provision for office space for ODOT’s
representative. The AGENCY shall include in all its subcontracts under this Agreement a provision
that ODOT, U.S. DOT, or any of their duly authorized representatives, will have full access to and the
right to examine any pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of any contractor or consultant
involving transactions related to this Agreement for three years from the final payment under this
Agreement.
SECTION XIV: PERSONNEL

The AGENCY agrees to establish a Transportation Section and agrees that all services required in the
approved WORK PROGRAM will be performed by the AGENCY or by its contractors or consultants.
The AGENCY represents that it has, or will secure, all personnel required to perform the services
under this Agreement. The AGENCY shall submit a listing of such personnel, salary ranges, and
person-hours allocated to each work element in the approved WORK PROGRAM and budget to ODOT.
None of the AGENCY’s personnel, nor any of its contractors or consultants may be current employees
of ODOT.

 SECTION XV: REPORTS, INFORMATION, AND RIGHTS IN DATA

The AGENCY’s progress in completing the WORK PROGRAM will be monitored through annual
AGENCY progress reports. Each progress report shall include a narrative description and financial
expenditure summary for each work element in the approved WORK PROGRAM and budget. ODOT
and the U.S. DOT will review the progress reports to assure the AGENCY is making satisfactory
progress toward meeting the WORK PROGRAM commitments to justify reimbursement payments.
If the progress reports demonstrate the AGENCY is not satisfactorily advancing a WORK PROGRAM
product or activity, ODOT will notify the AGENCY in writing and work with the AGENCY to identify
corrective actions. The AGENCY will have one month from the date of ODOT’s written notification to
begin good faith efforts to correct the deficiency. Whenever ODOT and the AGENCY are unable to
agree on corrective actions, and the situation is such, in the opinion of ODOT, that it indicates there
has been gross malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance by the AGENCY, ODOT may withhold funds
until the AGENCY takes corrective actions deemed acceptable to ODOT.

Publication of reports is limited to those shown in the approved WORK PROGRAM unless otherwise
authorized by ODOT or the U.S. DOT and only after satisfactory resolution of all comments made by
these agencies. Acknowledgment of the cooperative effort of appropriate parties shall be made in
each report; for example, “Prepared in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Transportation’s
Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Administration, the Ohio Department of
Transportation, and local communities.” A disclaimer statement, where appropriate and requested
by ODOT, shall also be included; for example, “The contents of this report reflect the views of the
AGENCY/author, which is responsible for the facts and accuracy of the data presented herein. The
contents do not necessarily reflect the official view and policies of ODOT and/or the U.S. DOT. This
report does not constitute a standard, specification, or regulation.”
The foregoing limitations are not applicable to dissemination of data necessary to perform a service
function of the AGENCY. Such dissemination of data shall be made in accordance with the AGENCY’s
established policy contained in the approved WORK PROGRAM.

The AGENCY shall retain the copyright for all documents, data, materials, information, processes,
studies, reports, surveys, proposals, plans, codes, scientific information, technological information,
regulations, maps, equipment, charts, schedules, photographs, exhibits, software, software source
code, documentation, and other materials and property that are prepared, developed, or created
under or in connection with this Agreement. The AGENCY agrees to grant to ODOT and the U.S. DOT,
a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, disclose, distribute, or
otherwise use, and to authorize others to use, for State or Federal Government purposes: (a) the
copyright in any work developed under this Agreement; and (b) any rights of copyright to which the
AGENCY purchases ownership for this Agreement.
The patent rights provisions of 35 U.S.C Section 1 et seq., and CFR Title 37 regarding rights to
inventions are made a part hereof and incorporated by this reference as if fully rewritten herein.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Board of Directors

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

June 7, 2019

RE:

Resolution 2019-024: NOACA Geauga County Amish Safety BUILD Project

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve Resolution 2019-024, which approves $1,500,000 of NOACA
Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP) funding for the NOACA Geauga County Amish Safety BUILD
project.
The Executive Committee recommended this action to best meet the grant deadlines associated with the
federal Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) program.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Geauga County Amish Safety project was developed as a result of a strategic safety plan completed in
2015 in partnership between Geauga County, ODOT District 12 and NOACA. The study identified projects
needed on Geauga County roadways to improve safety for motorists, Amish buggies, and pedestrians. In
2017, the identified projects were adopted into the NOACA AIM Forward 2040 Long-range Transportation
Plan.
In April 2018, NOACA partnered with the Geauga County Engineer to submit an application for a Geauga
County Amish Safety project for federal BUILD program funding consideration. The project includes
widening roadway shoulders for the construction of buggy lanes and pedestrian facilities; warning and
detection signal systems; and signage safety improvements. To enable the project to best compete for
funding under the program’s guidelines and criteria, staff included a commitment of $1,500,000 of
Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP) funding to match a request of $9,651,000 of BUILD program
funding in the overall project financing plan.
In December 2018, NOACA was notified by US DOT that the project was selected for BUILD program
funding for the full $9,651,000 request amount. Since that time, staff has worked with the Geauga County
Engineer, ODOT and FHWA to determine an acceptable approach for project administration in accordance
with the agencies’ oversight and monitoring requirements. As part of the BUILD program requirements,
funds awarded to the project must be obligated for construction phase activities no later than September 30,
2020 or the grant funding expires. The project benefits NOACA identified Environmental Justice
populations in Geauga County. Consistent with the Board approved Environmental Justice policy, the
$1,500,000 of NOACA funding match to the project was committed for allowable preliminary engineering
and detailed design activities. These activities must begin as soon as possible to allow for the necessary
time for completion prior to the stated deadline.

5 - 23

 As such, staff planned to include a funding recommendation for the project in conjunction with the
development of SFY 2021-2024 NOACA TIP funding recommendations, originally planned for Planning and
Programming Committee review in April 2019 and Board approval in June 2019. That item is being delayed
by one quarter, resulting from the delay of the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) due
to the uncertainty of future federal funding, with an anticipated action by the Board in September 2019. As
a result, a commitment of funding for Geauga County Amish Safety BUILD project request would be
delayed, causing significant impact to the project development and design schedule.
Therefore, to allow for the necessary time needed to complete project development and design activities
prior to the stated BUILD program deadline, the Executive Committee was requested to add this project
funding recommendation to the Board agenda for action in June 2019.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The request would commit $1,500,000 of NOACA TAP funding to the NOACA Geauga County Amish Safety
project. NOACA STBG funding would be utilized in SFY 2019 and SFY 2020 to finance the request, which
would be made whole through the TAP program in SFY 2021 for new 2021-2024 TIP projects. Therefore,
there is no impact to existing TIP projects.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, the NOACA TIP will be amended to incorporate the recommended project funding and
project development and design activities will be advanced.

RE:

Resolution 2019-025: NOACA Board Support for Increased Funding
for Public Transportation in Ohio

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to consider a resolution to be presented to members of the
Ohio General Assembly and the Governor of Ohio, requesting that they uphold their previous
commitment to fund transit at $70 million annually in the SFY 2020-2021 state Operating Budget
(House Bill166), which is currently pending before the Ohio Senate.
The External Affairs Committee recommended this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
At the March 8, 2019, Board of Directors meeting, the Board adopted a resolution supporting an
increase to the gas tax with the recommendation to the Ohio General Assembly to also increase
funding for public transportation to at least the $120 million goal contained in the 2015 ODOT
Transit Needs Study, representative of the benefit that transit provides to the entire transportation
system. The subsequently enacted SFY 2020-2021 Transportation Budget committed to funding
public transportation at $70 million annually, but deferred the actual funding action instead to the
upcoming state Operating Budget, due to be finalized by June 30.
This resolution requests that members of the Ohio General Assembly and the Governor of Ohio
ensure that the previous commitment to fund public transportation at $70 million annually is
approved in the Operating Budget, and continue to explore additional resources for public transit
in order to fulfill the recommendations of the 2015 ODOT Transit Needs Study.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
NOACA staff will send the Board resolution to the Governor of Ohio and members of the Ohio

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The operating budget for SFY 2020 is expected to be a little more than $6.7 million, plus an estimated
$1.46 million in encumbrances from prior fiscal years ($8.2 million total). The combined SFY 2020 OWP
Budget and carryforward is around two percent higher than the SFY 2019 Budget and carryforward.
However, a comparison of the SFY 20 budget to the SFY 19 budget actually represents a small (less
than 1%) decrease. Furthermore, estimated carryforward revenues ($1.46 million) plus SFY 20
revenues ($6.94 million) are $8.40 million, which is more than sufficient to meet the expenditures.
Unspent revenues (currently estimated at $201,976) will go to replenish local reserves.
Revenues
Factoring in $1.46 million of prior year funds carried forward and $6.94 million in funding for SFY 2020,
total available revenues are projected to be around $8.40 million. SFY 2020 revenue sources are similar
to prior years and primarily come from FHWA, FTA, ODOT, USEPA, Ohio EPA and NOACA dues. In
addition, the Ohio Turnpike Commission, Cleveland Foundation and ODOT committed funds toward the
Hyperloop project in SFY 2019. A portion of these SFY 2019 funds are expected to be carried forward for
continued work related to the Hyperloop Feasibility Study. By optimizing use of existing resources and
the successful pursuit of additional funds for special projects, the SFY 2020 budget will allow NOACA to
complete ongoing work and address new priorities at a similar level of funding as prior years.
Expenditures
Total SFY 2020 expenditures for staffing and operations are an estimated $8.20 million. Of this, $1.18
million is for expenditures encumbered in prior years that will be paid in SFY 2020. The remaining
$320,000 in carryforward funds will be used for staffing and related expenditures. The SFY budget is
projected to be $6.7 million.
The key SFY 2020 budget assumptions include:
•
•
•

47 full-time equivalent positions authorized in the organizational chart (unchanged from SFY
2019), not all of which are funded.
A 5% increase in health care costs
A 3% overall salary increase for the annual staff performance evaluation process, which is also
consistent with SFY 2019. Note that individual staff increases will be based on merit.

A Budget Summary appears on the next page. The full draft OWP can be found at
https://www.noaca.org/Home/ShowDocument?id=23702.

5 - 34

 Budget Summary
Staffing and operations expenses for recent years and the upcoming year are summarized below.

A comparison of the draft SFY 2020 budget plus encumbrances to the SFY 2019 budget plus
encumbrances shows that projected costs for
•
•

Employee-related expenses will increase by $470,000, or 10%, as NOACA plans to fill previouslyunfunded vacant positions
Contractual Services will decrease by approximately $385,700. The decrease is largely attributed to
the Hyperloop Feasibility Study project, which was a part of the SFY 2019 OWP and is nearly
complete.
5 - 35

 •

•

Other Operating (supplies, postage, business travel, agency memberships, meeting costs, and
outside printing) will increase by almost $64,000 due, in part, to NOACA hosting the Ohio Conference
on Freight.
Utilities and Building Maintenance, which includes Occupancy and Equipment and Capital Outlay, will
increase by nearly $14,000.

The full draft OWP can be found at: https://www.noaca.org/Home/ShowDocument?id=23702.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, the final 2020 OWP and Budget will be sent to ODOT and federal agencies fro
approval.

TO:

NOACA Board of Directors

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

June 7, 2019

RE:

Resolution No. 2019-027: Procurement – Regional Strategic Transit Plan

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board is asked to approve this item, which will award a contract to AECOM Technical Services, Inc. for
NOACA’s Regional Strategic Transit Plan not to exceed the amount of $148,916.
The Finance and Audit Committee recommends this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
Transit is an important aspect of the transportation network, and mobility choices are vital to the health and
vibrancy of a region. Public transit options reduce congestion, personal transportation costs, and carbon
output. Public transit is not just a form of alternative transportation, but provides options for lower-income
households, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Public transit provides access to healthcare,
entertainment, and educational facilities, among other daily activities and destinations.
The region’s population density is declining, and the population is expanding outward into townships and
previously rural areas. NOACA and the region’s transit systems will need to plan accordingly to meet the
needs of the region’s population and to prioritize limited transportation funding. The region must balance
transit needs with demands, determining where to expand or reduce service, and where to strengthen core
services.
In light of these factors, NOACA is looking to develop a Regional Strategic Transit plan. The overall goals of
this plan is to (1) recommend how to prioritize transit investments within the NOACA region (analyze current
funding mechanisms, current and long term funding needs, provide a baseline economic value analysis), (2)
identify gaps and needs in transit service regionally based upon the Fixed Route service networks of each
of the transit agencies in the NOACA region and (3) identify strategies on how to better connect the region
through transit and use of other NOACA products like the Transit Oriented Development and Transit Asset
Management plans. This will be done through a collaborative effort of NOACA and regional transit agencies
and stakeholders.
On March 8th, 2019 NOACA issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a Regional Strategic Transit Plan.
The proposals were due on April 17th, 2019. NOACA received two proposals. Vendors were scored on four
criteria: project approach, experience, qualifications and cost. After evaluating the proposals, the NOACA
review team selected the vendor with the highest scores which was AECOM Technical Services Inc.

5 - 43

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
The proposed contract will be executed for 18 months commencing on or around July 2019 and ending on or
around December 2020; at a cost not to exceed $148,916. This project is funded by the Office of Statewide
Planning and Research grant from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT).
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
If approved, NOACA will enter into contract with AECOM Technical Services Inc. for a term July 1st, 2019December 1st, 2020.

RE:

Resolution No. 2019-028: Contract Amendment – Great Lakes Hyperloop
Feasibility Study

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider placement of this item on the June 2019 Board of Directors’ agenda.
Specifically, this action would amend the Transportation Economics & Management Systems, Inc. (TEMS)
contract for The Great Lakes Hyperloop Feasibility Study in the amount of $35,393.
The Finance and Audit Committee recommended this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Board of Directors, through Resolution 2018-019, authorized a budget of $600,000, and awarded a
contract to Transportation Economics & Management Systems, Inc. (TEMS) for the development of The
Great Lakes Hyperloop Feasibility Study not to exceed amount of only $550,092. As the study has
progressed, events have occurred that suggest some minor contract amendment should be done.
The original study corridor from Cleveland to Chicago was extended to Youngstown as requested by the
Ohio Department of Transportation, a partner in this project. This study extension is being completed within
the existing budget and on the same schedule as the original corridor. In March 2019, the Pennsylvania
Turnpike Commission awarded a two million dollar contract for a Hyperloop feasibility study from Pittsburgh
to Philadelphia. This leaves a small gap between Youngstown and Pittsburgh of approximately 65 miles.
The extension of the corridor from Youngstown to Pittsburgh will enhance the economic feasibility and
connect Cleveland to the East Coast through Pennsylvania’s Hyperloop Feasibility Study. The Cleveland to
Pittsburgh corridor was always identified as a phase two route, so this small extension would complete the
network.
This study of the extension to Pittsburgh will cost $55,150. A portion of this amount ($20,000) will be funded
through a contract savings resulting from a shift of some communications and public outreach tasks from
TEMS to NOACA and HTT, as the new Director of External Engagement and Public Affairs will lead those
tasks with support from HTT’s Public Affairs team. Therefore, only $35,393 is needed, taking the contract
amount from $550,092 to $585,485, as well as extending the completion of the study to the end of October.
The time extension is needed to complete the additional work.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This project was budgeted for expenditure in FY 2019 for $600,000 and is funded through revenues totaling
$650,000 earmarked for the Hyperloop initiative from various partners of NOACA (Cleveland Foundation –
5 - 47

 $200k, ODOT - $250,000, Ohio Turnpike - $100,000), as well as NOACA ($100K). This action would increase
the consultant contract from $550,092 to $585,485, which is still below the Board approved budgeted amount
of $600,000.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA will amend the contract with Transportation Economics & Management
Systems, Inc. (TEMS).

RE:

Resolution 2019-029: Project Funding Requests – LOR Avon Citywide Bicycle and
Multi-use Path TLCI Study

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve Resolution 2019-029, which approves additional funding for the
City of Avon Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) study project of $15,000 to expand the
study area into the adjacent community of Sheffield Village.
The Finance and Audit Committee recommended this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Avon Citywide Bicycle and Multi-Use Path Master Plan TLCI study project is programmed in SFY 2019
of the current 2018-2021 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) with a NOACA commitment of $30,000
of TLCI program funds. The current project scope and funding commitment was developed to establish a
bicycle and pedestrian plan for the Avon incorporated area.
In the most recent TLCI funding cycle, Sheffield Village submitted an application to study a potential bicycle
route connection in an area adjacent to the Avon incorporated area. Sheffield Village requested $15,000 for
the project, however, the project was not recommended for funding at that time as an independent project.
Subsequent meetings with Avon and Sheffield Village, and Lorain County Metro Parks officials were
conducted to better understand the larger context of the communities’ needs, it was collectively determined
that extending the existing Avon TLCI study area into the proposed Sheffield Village study area is needed to
best plan and evaluate connection of the communities to the larger regional bicycle and pedestrian network
in Lorain County.
Therefore, the communities are requesting an increased NOACA TLCI program funding commitment of
$15,000, as originally requested by Sheffield Village, to expand the study project across communities to
provide maximum project benefit. A local match of $5,000 (20%) has been committed from the Lorain County
Metro Parks for a total cost of $20,000. If approved, the existing Avon TLCI consultant contract would be
modified in scope and cost and the communities would partner in performance of the study.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The request would increase the NOACA funding commitment to the City of Avon TLCI study project by
$15,000 from $30,000 to $45,000. The increase would be funded utilizing savings from TLCI projects
5 - 51

 coming in under estimate. Therefore, there is no impact to other projects funded through the TLCI program
or the TIP.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, the TIP will be amended to incorporate the additional scope and funding for the
project.

Resolution 2019-030: Project Funding Requests – CUY North Royalton State Road
Sidewalks Phase I TLCI Implementation

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve Resolution 2019-030, which approves a transfer of funding from
Phase II of the City of North Royalton State Road Sidewalks to Phase I North Royalton State Road
Sidewalks Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Implementation project.
The Finance and Audit Committee recommended this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The City of North Royalton State Road Sidewalks Phase I TLCI Implementation project (ODOT PID 106748)
will connect the Town Center District (TCD) to Memorial Park, providing access for the residential
subdivisions and homes with immediate access to the TCD. The project also benefits students and staff
travelling to school facilities that are adjacent to the park. The NOACA Board of Directors awarded
$108,900 of TLCI Implementation funds to this project (Resolution 2017-026) in June 2017, with a local
commitment of $41,500, totaling $150,400 committed to this phase of the project.
The City of North Royalton State Road Sidewalks Phase II (Memorial Park to Akins) TLCI Implementation
project continues the sidewalk south along State Road to Akins Road, lessening the gap in sidewalk
facilities to the Cleveland Metroparks Valley Parkway trail to about 1,700 feet. The NOACA Board of
Directors awarded $100,000 of TLCI Implementation funds to this project (Resolution 2019-019) in March
2019.
Three bids were received for Phase I of this project, the lowest of which was $252,784, nearly 60%
($102,384) over the original $150,400 application estimate. An additional 10% for ODOT construction
admin/engineering costs brings the total Phase I project cost to $278,023. To mitigate delay or cancellation
of Phase I, the City has requested to transfer the $100,000 in NOACA committed TLCI funds from Phase II
of the project to Phase I; totaling the NOACA commitment to Phase I to $208,900, and adjusting the
NOACA TLCI commitment to Phase II to $0. The City of North Royalton would contribute the remainder
(approximately $69,000) to complete Phase I of the project. The City requests the funds for Phase II to be
considered for the next TLCI application round.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The request would increase the NOACA funding commitment to the City of North Royalton State Road
Sidewalks Phase I (Town Center District to Memorial Park-PID 106748) by $100,000 from $108,900 to
5 - 55

 $208,900, and decrease the NOACA funding commitment to the City of North Royalton State Road Sidewalks
Phase II (Memorial Park to Akins Rd.) by $100,000 to $0.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the TIP will be amended to incorporate the funding changes for these projects.

RE:

Resolution 2019-033 – Fiscal Year 2020 Annual Priority List

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve the priority list of projects to be funded in State Fiscal Year (SFY)
2020 with NOACA administered funds.
The Transportation Subcommittee and Planning and Programming Committee recommend this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The SFY 2020 Annual Priority List (APL) (attached) contains projects to be funded in state fiscal year 2020
with NOACA administered Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG), Congestion Mitigation and Air
Quality (CMAQ) and Transportation Alternative Program (TAP) funds. The SFY 2020 APL reflects existing
and recommended projects on the Plan and TIP. NOACA staff, ODOT Districts, and the project sponsors all
concur that these projects are ready and able to use the identified funding amounts during the next fiscal
year.
All of the projects in the SFY 2020 APL have been processed through NOACA’s project planning review
(PPR) and have been amended to NOACA’s Long Range Transportation Plan and the Transportation
Improvement Program (TIP).
The APL represents projects prioritized for funding in SFY 2020 of the current TIP. The list includes debt
service payments for previously approved State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) loans.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total cost of the projects is approximately $390 million with approximately $50.5 million of NOACA funds
committed. The projects are consistent with current financial forecasts, plans and budget constraints.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA will manage the SFY 2020 program to ensure the expenditure of all
available funding during the fiscal year, including the advancement of additional projects as approved by the
Board should funding become available.

RE:

Resolution No. 2019-034: Functional Classification Amendment
Recommendations

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve Resolution 2019-034, which approves the functional
classification amendment recommendations.
•
•

State Route 94, in Cuyahoga County, from Minor Arterial to Collector
County Route 4, in Geauga County, from Collector to Local

The Planning and Programming Committee and Transportation Subcommittee support this
action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Ohio Department of Transportation has requested the following functional classification
amendments:
•

Downgrade the short segment of SR 94 between the Medina County Line (log.0.00) and
CR 63 - Edgerton Rd (log 1.46) from Minor Arterial (FC 04) to a Collector (FC 05) to
match the classification in Medina County.

•

Downgrade CR 4 in Geauga County from a Collector (FC 05) to Local (FC 07) between
the Portage County Line and CR 606.

Functional classification is the grouping of roads, streets, and highways in a hierarchy based on
the type of highway service they provide. Streets and highways are part of an interconnected
network, and each one plays a role in moving traffic throughout the system. Generally, streets
and highways provide either traffic mobility or land access and can be ranked in terms of the
proportion of service they perform.
In June 2014 the NOACA Board of Directors approved Resolution Number 2014-025, which
created a NOACA functional classification policy for the review of proposed functional
5 - 81

 classification revisions. The policy requires all proposed functional classification revisions to be
evaluated thoroughly prior to making a recommendation to the Ohio Department of
Transportation. Evaluation is based on guidelines suggested by the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) and the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) with some
criteria refined to reflect local conditions. Criteria evaluated include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Lane widths
Shoulder widths
Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT)
Access
Speed limit
Parallel spacing of routes
Area type
Percentage of mileage by functional classification (by region, by county)
Functional classification density analysis

Based on the NOACA Functional Classification Amendment Policy, staff recommends
downgrading CR 4 in Geauga County from a Collector (FC 05) to Local (FC 07) between the
Portage County Line and CR 606, and recommends the downgrade of SR 94 between the
Medina County Line (log.0.00) and CR 63 - Edgerton Rd (log 1.46) from Minor Arterial (FC 04)
to a Collector (FC 05).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact, but approval of the functional classification recommendations could add
additional mileage to the federal-aid network.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, these recommendations will be forwarded to ODOT and FHWA for
further review and implementation.

WHEREAS, after applying the evaluation criteria of lane widths, shoulder widths,
average annual daily traffic (AADT), access, speed limit, parallel spacing of routes, area type,
percentage of mileage by functional classification (by region, by county) and functional
classification density analysis to the two proposed amendments, SR 94 between the Medina
County Line and CR 63 - Edgerton Rd., and CR 4 between the Portage County Line and CR
606, both roadway segments are recommended for functional classification revision, which will
result in a decrease of 2.77 miles to the federal-aid system.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Directors of the Northeast Ohio

RE:

Resolution 2019-035: Geauga County Facility Planning Area (FPA) Prescription
Modification Request in Chardon Township

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve the facility planning area (FPA) modification request by Geauga
County. Specifically, the item will change the Prescriptions for Wastewater Treatment (Prescriptions) of 124
Chardon Township parcels covering 141 acres in the Geauga County FPA to allow for sanitary sewer
service.
The Planning and Programming Committee and Water Quality Subcommittee recommend this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Berkshire Heights Estates Subdivision in south Chardon Township was developed in the 1950s and
1960s and has a significant number of failing on-site home sewage treatment systems (HSTSs). In 2013,
the Chardon Township Trustees submitted a public health nuisance complaint for the subdivision to Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) after trustees found a drainage line near the subdivision that
appeared to convey untreated sewage. Ohio EPA found the numerous failing HSTSs resulted in unsanitary
conditions and a public health nuisance. In 2015, the Ohio EPA issued a Director’s Final Findings and
Orders (DFFO) to the Geauga County Board of Commissioners. The DFFO required the County to produce
a sewage plan for the subdivision and install a sanitary sewage system within five (5) years. Geauga
County plans to start construction of sanitary sewer lines and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in 2019.
The subdivision’s current Prescription in NOACA’s Clean Water 2000 Plan (208 Plan) is “no sewer service”
(Attachment A). This Prescription does not allow for sanitary sewer extensions or connections. Ohio EPA
cannot issue any permits that conflict with NOACA’s 208 Plan. Therefore, Geauga County requests the
Prescriptions be changed to “may be sewered” for the parcels that that will be connected to sanitary sewers
and the parcels where the WWTP will be constructed (Attachment B). The change will allow Ohio EPA to
issue the needed permits to Geauga County to proceed with the Ohio EPA required sanitary sewer project.
Chardon Township and Geauga County are the only affected jurisdictions. Both the Chardon Township
Board of Trustees and Geauga County Board of Commissioners support the proposed Prescriptions
changes (attached) which fulfills the notification requirements in Policy 4-6 of the 208 Plan.

5 - 85

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA’s approval of the Prescription modification will not result in any financial impact to NOACA.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA staff will submit the Prescription modification to Ohio EPA.

 Staff Comments:
In 2015, the Geauga County Board of Commissioners were issued Ohio EPA Director’s
Final Finding and Orders (DFFOs) to construct a sanitary sewer system within five (5)
years for the Berkshire Heights Estates Subdivision in Chardon Township. The
subdivision was found to be a public health nuisance from numerous failing home
sewage treatment systems (HSTSs). Geauga County plans to start construction of the
sanitary sewers and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in 2019.
The current Geauga County Prescription for the entire subdivision is “no sewer service,”
which does not allow for sanitary sewer extensions or connections (Attachment A). The
Prescription for the subdivision and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) site needs to
be changed to “may be sewered” in order for Ohio EPA to issue to Geauga County the
needed Permit-to-Install (PTI) and National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit for the sewerage system (Attachment B).
The requested prescription modification is supported by both affected jurisdictions: the
Chardon Township Board of Trustees and Geauga County Board of Commissioners.
Staff Disposition:
The staff recommends approval of the modification to Geauga County’s Prescriptions in
Chardon Township. Sanitary sewers are required under the Ohio EPA’s 2015 DFFOs.
The request is supported by both Chardon Township and Geauga County.

NORTHEAST OHIO AREAWIDE COORDINATING AGENCY
MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Board of Directors

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

June 7, 2019

RE:

Resolution No. 2019-036: Coordinated Public Transit-Human Services Transportation
Plan for Northeast Ohio

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to adopt Mobilize: Accessibility for Independence, NOACA’s Coordinated
Public Transit-Human Services Transportation Plan for Northeast Ohio.
The Planning and Programming Committee supports this recommendation.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The current Coordinated Public Transit-Human Services Transportation Plan for Northeast Ohio
(“Coordinated Plan”) was adopted by the NOACA Board of Directors in January 2015 and extended through
December 2018. The Coordinated Plan covers Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain and Medina Counties,
and will be updated for the years 2019-2022.
The federal circular for the Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities (Section 5310)
funding program requires that all projects funded must be “included in a locally developed, coordinated
public transit-human services transportation plan,” and “developed and approved through a process that
included participation by seniors, individuals with disabilities, representatives of public, private, and nonprofit
transportation and human services providers and other members of the public.”
NOACA began the plan update with outreach activities that included public meetings, a client/rider survey,
and a provider/stakeholder survey. Using this feedback, and input from NOACA Transit, Community
Advisory, Rural Advisory, and Bike and Pedestrian Councils, goals and strategies were developed for the
Coordinated Plan.
The Coordinated Plan acts as an evaluation tool to prioritize project funding for the Section 5310 program.
Section 5310 scoring criteria and prioritization for funding is guided by current and future regional needs
identified in the coordinated planning process. NOACA will also utilize Mobilize: Accessibility for
Independence as an action plan and will integrate adopted goals and strategies into the organization’s work
plan.

5 - 97

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
As the designated recipient, NOACA is eligible to access federal 5310 program funds apportioned to the
Cleveland UZA and distribute them according to the federal guidelines. Up to 10% of these program funds
can be used by NOACA to cover its administrative costs for the development of plans by staff.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, Mobilize: Accessibility for Independence will be adopted as the Coordinated Public
Transit-Human Services Transportation Plan for Northeast Ohio for the years 2019-2022.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Board of Directors

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

June 7, 2019

RE:

Resolution No. 2019-037:Transportation Conformity Analysis for 2015 Ozone National
Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) Nonattainment Designation

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve the regional air quality determination. Specifically this item will
approve the regional air quality conformity determination for the Cleveland-Akron air quality nonattainment
area for the 2015 ozone NAAQS.
The Air Quality Subcommittee and Planning and Programming Committee have recommended this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires that Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) complete a transportation
conformity analysis to demonstrate that its transportation plans, programs, and significant projects will not
interfere with an area’s ability to come into or maintain its attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality
Standards (NAAQS). As part of this process, NOACA must demonstrate that emissions associated with its
TIP and LRTP fall within the motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs) outlined in all relevant State
Implementation Plans (SIPs), which the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) develops and
submits to the U.S. EPA.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) designated Northeast Ohio (Cuyahoga,
Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, and Summit Counties) as a nonattainment area for the ozone
NAAQS effective August 3, 2018. Under the CAA, NOACA must complete a transportation conformity
determination within 12 months of this designation. Accordingly, NOACA initiated an interagency consultation
process to complete this analysis in February 2019. Because portions or the entirety of the NOACA region
are in maintenance or nonattainment for the 2008 ozone NAAQS, the 2006 fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
NAAQS, and the 2012 PM2.5 NAAQS, NOACA must show that the emissions from its TIP and LRTP will
remain within the MVEBs outlined in these SIPs.
Additionally, under federal regulations, NOACA must coordinate its conformity determination with all MPOs
that fall within its metropolitan area. Accordingly, NOACA staff have worked closely with the Akron
Metropolitan Area Transportation Study (AMATS) and the Erie Regional Planning Commission (ERPC), along
with other relevant agencies. Both AMATS and ERPC have approved concurring resolutions adopting the
results of the conformity determination.
Results of the conformity analysis are shown below, which identifies both the established budget, as well as
the projected emission amounts. To “pass” conformity analysis, the projected amounts must be lower than
5 - 101

 the budgeted amounts. Because only Cuyahoga and Lorain Counties are included in the nonattainment area
for the 2012 PM2.5 NAAQS, they are the only counties that must demonstrate conformity with the MVEB for
that standard.
