5-2B-9 and Appendix A of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as Follows:

5-2A-1: - New Licenses.

Upon receipt of a properly completed license application and a non-refundable one thousand ?ve
Mdred dollars 500.00) application fee the Forest Preserve District of Cook County
(FPD) will begin initial administrative processing nfthe application for consideration by
appropriate FPD staff. FPD Staff shall then review the application and attached plans to
determine the applicable License Review Fee and feasibility of granting the requested license to
the applicant. Applications will be reviewed based on, among other things, the potential damage
construction or operation of the proposed facilities could have on FPD property, location of the
proposed facilities, type of facilities proposed, and number of trees to be impacted. Based on this
review the FPD may reject the request outright or may request revisions to the proposed plans
that would make the proposal acceptable to the FPD. Under no circumstances will licenses be
issued for areas that are dedicated Illinois Nature Preserves, high quality natural areas identi?ed

 

 

 

by the FPD or areas covered

by conservation easements.

Sec. Acceptable Application and Plans.
Page 5 of 11

If the submitted (or revised) application and plans are found to be acceptable by the FPD staff,
the FPD will draw up a license that, if approved by the Board of Forest Preserve District
Commissioners, would grant the licensee authority to locate, operate, and maintain the facilities
for which the application and plans were submitted. Said license will include, among other
things, the term for which the license will be issued, the fee that the FPD will charge for
issuance of the license, any moneys that will be paid for tree mitigation associated with the
license, and any charges for "out of pocket" expenses incurred by the FPD to determine whether
the license is acceptable. Said license will be forwarded to the applicant for their review and
approval before being submitted to the Board of Forest Preserve District Commissioners (Board)
for ?nal approval. If the applicant decides to withdraw its application after review of the
proposed license or if the Board does not approve the proposed license, the ?out of pocket?
expenses will still be due and the FPD will bill the applicant for said expenses. If said fees are
unpaid, the FPD will accept no further license applications from that applicant. Said applicant
can regain its application privileges by paying one hundred (100) percent of the fees owed along
with a penalty fee of ?fty (50) percent of the original amount owed. If the license is approved by
the Board then all fees will be paid to the FPD at or before the time the ?nalized license is
delivered to the Licensee.

Sec. 5-2A-4. License Fee.

In addition to those special fees as may be recommended by District staff, the fee for licenses
issued under this Article will be determined by multiplying the acres used by the cost per acre.
Acres used will be calculated by multiplying the linear footage shown on the license application
(or revised application) by the width required for future maintenance of the facilities. The
minimum width will be ?fteen (15) feet for all licenses regardless of the facilities installed or
location of said facilities. Requests for widths above ?fteen (15) feet must include an
explanation justifying the need for additional width. The minimum license fee will be ?ve (5)
percent of the cost per acre for the current year. Additionally, a Youth Education, Land
Acquisition and Restoration (YELAR) Program Fee of ?ve seven and one half percent
of the cost per acre, and a License Review FE, shall be assessed against all licenses issued. Cost
per acre, minimum license fee, License Review Fee and YELAR program fee ?gures can be
found in Appendix A at the end of this Article. All fees due will be paid as a lump-sum up-front
one?time payment, unless otherwise approved by the Board.

See. 5-2A-6. Renewal of Existing Licenses.

Any license previously issued by the FPD that expires while this Article is in force will be
renewed at a rate ?fty (50) percent lower than that speci?ed for issuance of a new license, unless
otherwise approved by the Board based upon District staff recommendations for a license

exceeding twenty-?ve (25) acres and/or when in staff opinion the license can generate additional
revenue for the District. The minimum renewal license fee will be ?ve (5) percent of the_cost per
acre for the current year. Additionally, a Youth Education, Land Acquisition and Restoration
(YELAR) Program Fee of ?ve seven and one half percent of the cost per acre and a
License Review Fee shall be assessed against all licenses issued. Cost per acre, minimum license

of ?ve hundred dollars ($500.00) to the FPD at least six (6) months prior to the expiration date
of said license to con?rm its interest in continued operation and maintenance of the facilities for
which the license was originally issued. If the applicable license renewal application fee and
prior notice of the Licensee's intent to renew is not received by the FPD at least six (6) months
prior to the expiration of the existing 

   

Willi? license will be considered expiIed and Liccns_ee may be requiied to Icinpve tl_1ei_1
facilities from FPD property per the terms of the license If the Licensee wishes to renew a
license for?which it?has expired, the FPD will wallow
the renewal, but the fee for the renewal will be based on the formula used to determine the fee
for issuance of a new license. All fees due for license renewals will be paid as a lump-sum
upfront one-time payment, unless otherwise approved by the Board.

 

 

Sec. 5-2A-9. Youth Education, Land Acquisition and Restoration Program Fee (Y ELAR).
