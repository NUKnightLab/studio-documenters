Residential Lights
Stephen Knittel

Proposal: Sagamore Hills Township Zoning Commission is proposing an amendment of
Section 3 Residential District 3.11 Lighting to establish clarity about the use and direction of
lighting on residential property.
Proposed Text Amendments: Text that is struck through is text proposed for deletion, new
proposed text is underlined.
Section 3 Residential District
3.11 Elevated lights Lighting
Lighting shall not create a nuisance and shall in no way impair the safe movement of
traffic on any street or highway. No light shall shine directly on adjacent property.
No strings of open light bulbs shall be permitted. No lighting structure shall
exceed fifteen (15) feet in height unless it is attached to a building, but shall not
exceed the height of the building. Exposed light bulbs except for those used in
holiday decoration shall be prohibited.
The pole or standards for elevated lights shall be no higher than ten (10) feet from
finished grade to top of light standards and shall be set back at least twenty (20)
feet from the public right-of-way, subject to rear and side line regulations, and
shaded so as not to interfere with the visions of persons on the highway or
neighboring premises.
Summary of the changes proposed:
3.11 - Adding text to establish that residential lights:
• Shall not be used to illuminate adjacent property.
• Shall not create a nuisance.
• Shall in no way impair the safe movement of traffic on any street or highway.
• Shall have no lighting structure exceed fifteen (15) feet in height unless it is attached to a
building, but shall not exceed the height of the building.
• Shall not be exposed light bulbs except for those used in holiday decoration.
3-11 Removing text elevated to have regulations apply to all residential lights.

 Staff Research:
Bath Township Ohio: Sec. 803 EXTERIOR LIGHTING
Sec. 803-A Purpose
The purpose of this exterior lighting section is to regulate outdoor lighting in order to reduce or
prevent light pollution and to minimize lighting impacts on surrounding properties. This means to
the extent reasonably possible the reduction or prevention of glare and light trespass, the
conservation of energy, and promotion of safety and security.
Sec. 803-B Applicability
1. All outdoor lighting fixtures shall be subject to review as part of this article unless
specifically exempted.
2. Lighting Plan Required
(1) A photometric plan showing the following shall be submitted as part of a zoning
certificate or business use certificate application, or for a conditional use
application:
(A) The proposed intensity levels of the lighting throughout the site
indicating foot-candle measurements;
i)
The lighting levels for the proposed site and an area extending
a minimum of 30 feet onto adjacent properties;
ii)
The locations of each of the proposed lighting fixtures (wall
mounted and pole);
iii)
The minimum, maximum, and average intensity/illumination for
the site;
iv)
Details of all proposed outdoor lighting fixtures indicating
manufacturer, model and style of the fixture. A graphic
representation of the fixture is required. The fixture lamp type
(i.e. low pressure sodium, metal halide, etc.) shall be indicated
on the proposed plans;
v)
The proposed height of the lighting fixtures;
vi)
The hours of use of the lighting fixtures; and
vii)
Any additional submittal requirements as may be determined
by the Zoning Inspector.
(B) A lighting plan shall not be required for single-family or two-family
dwellings.
3. Exemptions
(A) All exterior lighting fixtures producing light directly by the combustion of
fossil fuels, such as kerosene lanterns or gas lamps are exempt from
the requirements of this section.
(B) Holiday lighting shall be exempt from the requirements of this section.
(C) All temporary emergency lighting needed by the police, fire department,
other emergency service vehicles, and public service vehicles, as well
as all vehicular luminaries, shall be exempt from the requirements of
this section including flashing or blinking lights.
(D) Street lights shall be exempt from the provisions of this section.
4. Prohibited Lights

 (A) Search lights, beacons, laser source lights, or any similar high-intensity
or flashing lights are prohibited, except in emergencies by police and/or
fire department personnel.
(B) No open lights, such as strings of light bulbs, shall be permitted. This
prohibition shall not include holiday lighting.
Sec. 803-C General Provisions Applicable to All Districts and Development
(1) Exterior lighting shall be installed in a manner to deflect from adjacent residential
developments.
(2) All exterior lighting for residential and nonresidential uses shall be located,
screened, or shielded so adjacent lots located in residential districts or recorded
subdivisions are not directly illuminated. Shielding may also be required for high
intensity light fixtures to prevent glare to adjacent uses, public right-of-ways, and
drives. Perimeter lighting, when adjoining residential districts or recorded
subdivisions, shall be by shielded fixtures to prevent light trespass onto adjacent
properties.
(3) No exterior lighting shall be of such an intensity or color distortion as to cause
glare or to impair the vision of drivers, pedestrians or adjacent properties. Shields
and/or filters are required for light fixtures with high intensity and glare potential.
Sec. 803-D Lighting for Residential Uses
(1) Lighting for single-family dwellings shall be exempt from most provisions of this
article with the exception of the following:
(A) The prohibited lights established in Sec. 803-B(4) shall apply to lighting
for residential uses.
(B) Residential lighting for single-family dwellings shall be subject to the
general provisions of Sec. 803-C: General Provisions Applicable to All
Districts and Development.
(C) For light fixtures that are not attached to the house or to an accessory
building, there shall be a maximum height of 12 feet from the finished
grade adjacent to the base of the light fixture to the top most point of the
fixture. The light bulb shall not produce more than 1,600 lumens.
(2) Lighting in the R-4 district or lighting for nonresidential uses in the R-1, R-2, or R3 districts shall be subject to the requirements of this article unless expressly
exempted.

(A) In all districts, the maximum height of any non-cutoff light fixture shall be
12 feet.
(B) All cut-off exterior lighting shall be designed, located, and mounted at
heights pursuant to Table 803-1.
TABLE 803-1: MAXIMUM CUT-OFF LIGHT FIXTURE HEIGHT ZONING DISTRICT MAXIMUM
HEIGHT OF LIGHT FIXTURE

(C) In no case shall the height of light fixtures exceed the maximum
permitted building height within the applicable zoning district.
(D) Lighting located under canopies shall be flush mounted or recessed
within the canopy.
(E) Height shall be measured from the finished grade adjacent to the base
of the light fixture to the top most point of the fixture.
(3) Illumination
(A) Exterior lighting shall be designed and located to have the following
maximum illumination levels. The levels shall be measured at the
finished grade at the lot line as demonstrated by a lighting plan:
i. The maximum illumination at a lot line that abuts a lot zoned or
used for residential purposes (except R-4 zoned lots) shall be 0.0
foot-candles.

 ii. The maximum illumination at a lot line that abuts R-4 zoned lot
shall be 0.3 foot-candles.
iii. The maximum illumination at a lot line that abuts a business
zoned lot shall be 1.0 foot-candles.
iv. The maximum illumination at a lot line for properties used for
outdoor sports and recreation shall be reviewed for compliance
with regard to the intent of these guidelines to minimize the
impact of light trespass and glare on all surrounding properties
and public rights-of-way.
v. The illumination across any property shall be designed so as to
not create excessively dark spots that may create safety issues.
(B) All applicants are strongly encouraged to submit lighting plans with
components that reduce light pollution including, but not limited to,
automatic shut-off of fixtures, auto-dimming to adjust lighting based on
ambient lighting, and the use of as little lighting as necessary without
creating safety issues.
(4) Modifications
Should any exterior light fixture or the type of light source therein be changed
after the permit has been issued, a change request must be submitted to the
Zoning Inspector for approval, together with adequate information to assure
compliance with this section, which must be received prior to substitution.
Comments:
• Keep consistency in referencing “strings of open light bulbs” or “exposed bulbs”.
• The intent to limit light pollution for adjacent properties may be served by including
lumens and footcandles standards for types of lights. Traditionally wattage was used to
measure the intensity of a light bulb, but wattage actually measures the amount of
electrical power a light bulb consumes and as more efficient light bulbs are developed
wattage per bulb no longer translates to amount of illumination.
• Definitions may be needed to be added if language about lumens and footcandles are
added.
o A lumen is the unit that defines the intensity of light.
o Footcandles are a unit of illuminance equal to 1 lumen per square foot of surface.
• A current popular trend is having string lights above patios/porches typically these light
strings are showcased with “Edison bulb” type light bulbs which emit smaller lumens
than the standard incandescent bulb of the same wattage. Standard incandescent bulb
is 800 lumens (a 60 watt bulb) up to 1600 lumens (a 100 watt bulb).
• Bath Township has language in their Zoning Resolution (relevant section included
above) about lumens and footcandles and the maximum illumination at a lot line.
Recommendation: Staff recommends to the Summit County Planning Commission that the
proposed text amendments be APPROVED.
