Section 4.
A.

The Chief of Human Resources shall issue rules to implement the provisions of this Ordinance.
Pri or to the effective date of such rules, the Chief of Human Resources shall give public notice in
one or more newspapers of general circulation, and in no case shall such publication be less than
I 0 days before the effective date of the proposed rule or amendment to the rule. Such public
notice shall include infonnation concerning where the rules can be reviewed and where
comments may be directed. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the Chief of Human
Resources from giving other appropriate public notice. The rules shall provide for:
( I)

The preparation, maintenance and revision of a position classification plan for all
positions, except those exempted in Section 3 of this Ordinance based upon similarity of
duties perfonned and responsibility assigned, so that the same qualifications may
reasonably be required for and the same schedule of pay may be applied equitably to all
positions in the same class;

(2)

The annual submission of a pay plan to the President;

(3)

The recruitment of persons in the Career Service on the basis of their qualifications.
Whenever it is appropriate, in the judgment of the Chief of Human Resources, a fair and
open lottery procedure may be applied to develop the order of candidates to be considered
for selection. Other selection procedures including, but not limited to interviews,
performance tests, or medical examinations may be applied.

(4)

The establishment of lists of eligibles for appointment and promotion in Career Service,
upon which lists shall be placed the names of successful candidates in order of their relative
excellence in the respective examinations, where such examinations are administered. For
all positions requiring open, competitive written examinations, qualified eligible veterans
shall be entitled to receive five points added to any final adjusted passing score provided
that the veteran has served in the United States Anned Forces on active duty for a pe1iod of
not less than six months of continuous service, was not di shonorably discharged, and
provides documentation confinning status as an eligible veteran . Five additional points
shall be added to a passing score for veterans holding proof of service connected disability
from the United States Veterans Administration or recipients of a purple heart decoration.
Those seeking veterans' preference under this section must submit documentation
confinning their eligibility to the Bureau of Human Resources within five working days of
the examination. The Chief of Human Resources may substitute categorical rankings such
as excellent, well qualified and qualified for numerical rating and establish eligible lists
accordingly. Such rules may provide for lists by area or location, by department or other
agency, for removal of those not available for or refusing employment, for minimum and
maximum duration of such lists, for the addition of names of successful candidates to list
and for such other provisions as may be necessary to provide rapid and satisfactory service
to the operating agencies. The rules may authorize removal of eligibles from lists if those
eligibles fail to furnish evidence of availability upon forms sent to them by the Chief of
Human Resources;

6

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR AUGUST 9, 2000
(5)

the list is by categorical ranking instead of numerical ratings;

(6)

Promotions which shall give appropriate consideration to the applicant' s qualifications,
record of performance and ability;

(7)

Probationary periods after original appointment not to exceed one year. An employee
who completes a probationary period shall have the status of a Career Service employee;

(8)

Probationary periods after promotional appointment not to exceed one year. The rules
may also provide for the restoring of an employee's Career Service status to the class
from which a promotion was made when an employee does not successfully complete a
promotional probationary period or when an employee requests a return to the next lower
rank with the approval of the department head;

(9)

Emergency employment for not more than 60 days with the consent of the Chief of
Human Resources and for provisional employment when there is no appropriate eligible

(12)

Implementation and administration of the grievance procedure provided by this
Ordinance;

(13)

The establishment of disciplinary measures such as suspension, demotion in rank or grade,
or discharge. Where employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and that
agreement establishes disciplinary or grievances procedures, those procedures control. For
all other Career Service employees, such disciplinary measures shall provide for a
statement of the charges on which discipline is based, together with an explanation of the
evidence supporting the charges and an opportunity for the employee to respond to the
charges in writing before action is taken, appeals after such disciplinary action, and a
hearing on the charges upon request of the employee in case of discharge, demotion or
suspension exceeding 10 work days, consistent with the requirement of due process of law.
The charges and explanation of evidence need not be in any particular form, but must be
sufficient to apprise the employee of the matters on which discipline may be based. The
employee's response must be reviewed by the department head or designee responsible for
making the decision, provided that such designee may be the person who initiated the
charges against the employee. No Career Service employee may be discharged, demoted or
suspended for more than 10 work days unless the statement of charges and any matter in
support are first reviewed by the Chief of Human Resources, before the employee is
notified of such action;

(14)

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR AUGUST 9, 2000
Chairman Daley asked a representative of the Bureau of Health Services to address the issue of overtime.
Alvin Holley, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Health Services, stated the reason for the increase in
overtime is because of nursing and radiology vacancies.
Chainnan Daley asked how the shifts operate?
Mr. Holley responded that it is very difficult to schedule nurses to work the third shift, which causes the
Bureau to recruit nurses for this shift.
Chainnan Daley asked what is the maximum amount of time an individual nurse can work?
Mr. Holley responded that the maximum for nurses is a double shift.
Commissioner Lechowicz stated that other hospitals, including the private sector, are faced with a
shortage of registered nurses. It is not unusual that registered nurses work two shifts.
At the July 11 , 2000 Board Meeting, Commissioner Hansen requested that the Bureau of Health Services
provide revenue and expense figures by ambulatory clinic. He asked the status of the request.
Mr. Holley responded that the request is in progress.
Commissioner Silvestri echoed Commissioner Lechowicz's statement and asked if the County has had a
problem recruiting nurses to fill vacancies within budgetary limitations.
Mr. Holley responded in the affirmative and noted there is difficulty obtaining nurses from the registry.
He stated that registries do not always have the personnel to send to the hospital.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if the County offers wages comparable to private industry?
Mr. Holley responded that the wages are comparable to private industry, but because of the economy,
nurses are going into other professions.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if the County is advertising the benefits that come with employment at
County hospitals, as opposed to working in private facilities?
Mr. Holley responded in the affirmative, but noted that recruitment is difficult.
Commissioner Silvestri referred to the Ambulance and Patient Transportation Service account, 2 I 3. He
asked if this transfer will last throughout the fiscal year or if it is in anticipation of future transfers?
Mr. Holley answered that the funds will last until the end of the year.
Commissioner Silvestri asked why there is a deficit in the Ambulance and Patient Transportation Service
account?
Mr. Holley stated the utilization of the number of patients increased more than what was projected in the
beginning of the fiscal year.
Commissioner Silvestri asked what was the total ambulance service budget?

115

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR AUGUST 9, 2000
Mr. Holley responded that he would get back to the Finance Committee with the amount.
Commissioner Moran asked if Cook County Hospital has 12-hour shifts for registered nurses?
Mr. Holley answered that currently Cook County Hospital does have 12-hour shifts.
Commissioner Moreno inquired if the workload in nursing justifies the cost of overtime?
Mr. Holley responded that it is incumbent upon all senior administrators to pre-approve all the overtime
and make sure the overtime is needed.
Commissioner Moreno asked if there will be continued overtime increases after completion of the new
Cook County Hospital?
Mr. Holley projected a reduction in the number of staff needed with the new Cook County Hospital.
Commissioner Maldonado asked what outreach strategies are utilized by the Bureau of Health Services in
recruiting nurses?
Mr. Holley replied that ads are placed in newspapers, and recruitment acti vities are conducted at
universities and job fai rs.
Commissioner Maldonado asked if the recruitment efforts extend out of state?
Mr. Holley answered in the affinnative, but not on a monthly basis. He stated that when there are job
fairs or conferences held out of state, Cook County attends and advertises the benefits of working for the
County.
Commissioner Maldonado expressed his concern that the traditional strategies utilized in the past are not
effective and urged annual visits to other states where there is a surplus of nurses for recruitment in Cook
County.
Commissioner Maldonado asked if Cennak Hospital employees are required to pursue their education in
the same field in which they are employed when utilizing "employee tui tion refund"?
Mr. Holley stated there are provisions in the collective bargaining agreements wherein the County must
provide tuition reimbursement, particularly for nurses.
Chairman Daley asked if there is a requirement regarding the number of years nurses who benefit from
tuition assistance must serve the Bureau of Health Services?
Mr. Holley answered there is no stipulation in the collective bargaining agreement that nurses have to
remain with the Bureau of Health Services for a certain amount of time.

Commissioner Lechowicz referenced the Public Defender's Office account 190, Transportation and other
Travel Expenses for Employees. He asked if the transfer request is due to the travel agency's error? He
also asked for the name of the travel agency and the cost of the accounting error?

Chairman Daley stated that the transfer requests in accounts 214 (Armored Car Service), 242 (Surveys,
Operations and Reports), and 246 (Imaging of Records), are necessitated by delays in processing vendor
bills, and by lapsed purchases from 1999 being carried over to 2000. He asked a representative from the
Recorder's Office to explain.
Geni Johnson acknowledged that payments were taken from the 2000 budget, not the 1999.
Chairman Daley indicated that a more detailed explanation of these bookkeeping errors and accounting
deficiencies would be required by the Finance Committee.
Chairman Daley asked if there was an increase in travel? He further inquired what meetings were held,
the location of the meetings, who attended and why.
Ms. Johnson responded that the increases were due to seminars attended by the Recorder, Chief Recorder,
Deputy Recorder and two attorneys.
Chairman Daley asked Ms. Johnson to provide the information in writing. (See Submitted #2)
Commissioner Lechowicz asked Ms. Johnson to provide to the Committee, in writing, a detailed
explanation of the transfer request regarding the salaries and wages of temporary employees in the 527130 Account. He asked to include what the status is of the deregistration and if temporary employees will
be included in next year's budget as full time positions. Commissioner Lechowicz also asked if regarding
computer equipment, monies will be taken out of FY 1999 or FY 2000 527-579 Account to cover the
negative balance.

119

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR AUGUST 9, 2000
James Lee, representative of the Sherifrs Office, responded the number of meals are calculated by the
number of inmates. There are 10,000 inmates eating three meals daily, for a total of up to 30,000 meals
per day. The Sheriffs Department is budgeting for a lower number this year. The Department will cut
back in the beginning of the year on a number of items, with this being one of them.
Commissioner Lechowicz inquired who takes the head count on the daily food outlay? He also asked if
an audit is conducted.
Mr. Lee stated the Sherifrs personnel conduct a daily head count for meals. He also stated that the
figures are audited.
Commissioner Maldonado referred to Account 211-445, Operation of Automotive Equipment, and
inquired if the $650,000 transfer is justified by the recent gasoline price increases?
Jack Kelly, Chief Financial Officer, Sheriffs Office, indicated for 1999 the average gasoline cost was
$1.25 per gallon. For the first 6 months of this year, the average was $1.69, and for the month of June the
average was $2.00.
Commissioner Maldonado asked Mr. Kelly to project how much of an increase he anticipates for the
remainder of the year?
Mr. Kelly speculated perhaps a ten to fifteen cent decrease per gallon.
Commissioner Maldonado referred to line item 211-186, Training Programs for Staff Personnel. He
asked if the training for officers is included in the Administrative and Supportive Services department or
is it in the 230 (Court Services) or 239 (Department of Corrections) departments?
Mr. Kelly responded that the funds are taken from the Administrative and Support Services department,
21 1- 186 for training of all officers.

COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL, by Lacy L. Thomas, Chief Operating Officer. Transmitting a
Communication, dated July 7, 2000:
Re: Cook County Hospital Corporate Bylaws
l submit for approval by the Board of Commissioners revised Corporate Bylaws for Cook
County Hospital.
Although the Corporate Bylaws have from time to time been reviewed, they were last revised
in 1987. The proposed revision updates the Corporate Bylaws to reflect changes in state
regulations and standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care
Organizations. In addition, the Cook County Board revises the Corporate Bylaws to reflect the
adoption of the Bureau of Health Services Ordinance. The Joint Commission on Accreditation
of Hospitals will next survey Cook County Hospital later this year in November.

*Referred to the Health and Hospital Committee on 7/11/00.
Commissioner Hansen moved approval of the Cook County Hospital Corporate Bylaws. Seconded
by Commissioner Daley, the motion carried.
Commissioner Hansen moved approval of the four amendments.
Daley, the motion carried.

Seconded by Commissioner

Commissioner Hansen asked Assistant State's Attorney Elizabeth Reidy to give brief comments
regarding the amendments.
Ms. Reidy explained that the amendments are marked and the underline in the text indicates that it is a
recommended addition, and a strike-through it means a recommended deletion.
Amendment to Article 1, Offices, Purpose and Powers, Section 1. Office, of the June 2000 draft: Cook
County Hospital, a public hospital established pursuant to the laws of the State of Illinois, is operated and
administered by the Cook County Board of Commissioners (hereinafter "Board"), through its Bureau of
Health Services, to serve as a general public hospital providing care to patients regardless of their ability
to pay, including the medically indigent.
Amendment to Article III, Committees of the Board, Section 2. Special Committees or Subcommittees,
of the June 2000 draft: Special Committees or Subcommittees shall be appointed ey the PresieeAt ef the
Beare er by the Chairmafl ef a staAeiAg eemmittee ef the Beare as may be previeee iA pursuant to Board
Rules.

224

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR AUGUST 9, 2000
Amendment to Article VII, Quality of Professional Services, Section 3, Joint Conference Committee, of
the June 2000 draft: The duties of the Joint Conference Committee shall include, but not be limited to:
... considering and approving recommending approval by the Board of plans for the Hospital's response to
and protection and care of patients and others at the time of internal and external disasters; ...
The final amendment is to the June 2000 Draft Cook County Hospital Corporate Bylaws: Proposed
Amendment to the June 2000 Draft Cook County Hospital Bylaws changing the title from "Cook County
Hospital Corporate Bylaws" to "Cook County Bureau of Health Servi ces Corporate Bylaws" and adding
Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County, Provident Hospital of Cook County and the Cook County
Ambulatory and Community Health Network as well as the appropriate amendments necessary to
effectuate this change.
Commissioner Daley asked if Cermak Hospital is included in the amendments?
Elizabeth Reidy stated that Cennak Hospital is considered a department of Cook County Hospital and is
included.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked if all outlying county health facilities are included in the National Joint
Accreditation of Cook County Hospital?
Elizabeth Reidy responded that the JCAH separately surveys each of the county's three hospitals because
they are separately licensed. Ms. Reidy said that JCAH requires Bylaws be in place that set forth the
governance, operating structure and corporate structure. She continued by saying if these Bylaws are
amended, as proposed, each of the hospitals would have Corporate Bylaws that could be turned over to
the JCAH. Ms. Reidy further stated that this was the reason why the Bureau asked to include Ambulatory
Care in the Bylaws.
Commissioner Sims asked if these Bylaws encompass all the County's hospitals?
Elizabeth Reidy responded affinnatively. She said there would be one set of Corporate Bylaws for the
entire Bureau of Health that would include four of the affiliates, the three hospitals and ambulatory care.
Ms. Reidy further stated that if the fourth amendment is approved, the State' s Attorney's Office would
draft the changes that were required and the only thing that might change would be for the "purposes" of
the hospital, where now there is only the purpose of Cook County Hospital so a separate paragraph would
be added describing Oak Forest, Provident and Ambulatory Care. The officers would remain the same in
the hospital s but the ambulatory might be a little different so it would be separated out and a copy would
be given to the commissioners before the August 9, 2000 Board Meeting with all the changes that would
be required along with the technical changes that are required for amendment four.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved to approve Communication No.
237252, as amended. The motion carried.
Commissioner Hansen voted Present on Section V "sexual orientation".

Absent:

Commissioner Butler and Schumann (2)

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Veterans of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Thursday, July 27, 2000 at the hour of 2:30 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118
North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
237251

SOLDIER FIELD RESOLUTION (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed
Resolution sponsored by William R. Moran, County Commissioner and Co-sponsored by
Gregg Goslin, Carl R. Hansen and Calvin R. Sutker, County Commissioners:
The following is a synopsis.

WHEREAS, plans for creating Soldier Field began in 1919 as a memorial to the soldiers of
the First World War; and
WHEREAS, Soldier Field was opened in 1924 as the Municipal Grant Park Stadium, with
45,000 seats; and
WHEREAS, Soldier Field was dedicated on November 27, 1926 after an Army Navy
football game, ending in a 2 1-21 tie; and
WHEREAS, the Chicago Park District is considering renaming Soldier Field in order to
receive money from a corporate sponsor in order to pay for renovations; and
WHEREAS, Soldier Field is a grand structure with a great history, and is a great landmark
for the City of Chicago and Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the grand structure of Soldier Field is a unique memorial to the Soldiers who
have served the United States of America.

237

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDTNGS FOR AUGUST 9, 2000

NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
urges the Chicago Park District to continue to honor the soldiers of the United States of
America by keeping the name Soldier Field as a tribute to the Soldiers of our county as
originally planned in 1919; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be sent to the
Chicago Park District and the City of Chicago.
Commissioner Carr asked if Cook County owns Soldier Field?
Chairman Moran responded that the County does not own Soldier Field.
Commissioner Daley stated that the County would set a precedent not only for the City of Chicago, but
any municipality by approving this resolution. He further stated that the County should review the
resolution and work with the Chicago Park District and the City of Chicago on the issue. Also, he stated
that the Mayor and Park District representatives have indicated that the facility will continue to be named
Soldier Field.
Commissioner Daley stated that he is concerned that if the City and Park District are still in negotiations,
nothing is on the table for discussion. He stated for anything to be renamed within a Park District, an
individual must come to the park and present it to the board, which at this point has not occurred. The
Commissioner stated that he is concerned that no representatives were invited to the Veterans Committee
meeting. Finall y, he said he believes the County Board is in support of retaining the name, Soldier Field.
Vice Chainnan Hansen stated that he is completely in support of the resolution. He stated that the direct
responsibility for the field lies in the hands of the Chicago Park District and it would be well for the County
Board to hear from representatives of the Park District before the County proceeds. Further, he stated that
the name should remain Soldier Field. The Commissioner said he believes the legal course of action should
be followed namely, through the governmental entity that has direct responsibility for the property.
Commissioner Quigley stated that the corporate naming is nothing new and these would be benefactors.
He said he supports the resolution.
Chairman Moran referred to a June 15, 2000 article in the Daily Southtown that discusses the Chicago
Park District plan to seek corporate sponsors for parks and programs. The article stated that some
Chicago leaders say that renaming Soldier Field could help pay for its renovation and the number of
people who object to a new stadium name are such a small minority and would have no affect. He further
stated that the people who objected to changing the name of Soldier Field, both Fox News and MSNBC,
conducted polls to see whether the name should be changed. The Fox News poll was ninety-four percent
against the change and the MSNBC poll was ninety-three percent against changing the name. Also, the
Chainnan stated that the Chicago Park District has stated that a name change is not planned.

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Vice Chairman Hansen, moved to defer communication No.
237251. The motion carried.
Vice Chairman Hansen moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Carr. The
motion carried.
