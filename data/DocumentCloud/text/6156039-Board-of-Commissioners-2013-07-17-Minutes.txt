 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 17, 2013
WHEREAS, recent statistics have named Human Trafficking the second largest most profitable criminal
enterprise among members of organized crime and violent street gangs; and
WHEREAS, modern technology allows traffickers to operate virtually undetected by the use of social
media where many victims are forced to pose for humiliating and degrading pictures that are then posted
on the internet and available to be viewed by individuals seeking to engage in sexual acts in exchange for
money further contributing to the sexual exploitation; and
WHEREAS, one of the most valuable resources available to traffickers to continue to remain undetected
while maintaining constant communication with victims of Human Trafficking, their associates, and
potential customers is the use of cellular phones; and
WHEREAS, no contract prepaid cell phones are referred to on the street as burners or drop phones and
are impossible to track because phone carriers do not require a contact, photo identification or a minimum
age; and
WHEREAS, in instances where law enforcement’s only lead in rescuing a kidnapped victim is being able
to determine who a cell phone number is registered too, can be the difference between life and death.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 17, 2013
the Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator regarding Jimmy Doe v. County
of Cook, USDC No. 99-C-3945. This class action litigation was originally brought in 1999
and has subsequently involved the entry of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between
the parties that was approved by the District Court in December 2002 and the entry of an
Agreed Supplemental Order approved by the Court on May 18, 2006. This petition was
resolved by the entry of an Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator (TA) by
the District Court on August 14, 2007. The Board of Commissioners agreed to the entry of
the subject order during its meeting of July 31, 2007.
On June 18, 2008, the District Court entered an order permitting the Transitional
Administrator to maintain the OTA funds in a separate account to pay reasonable costs and
expenses of the staff of the OTA. The OTA account was first funded at $800,000.00 on
July 22, 2008 and the District Court entered an order for additional funds of $500,000.00
respectively on December 18, 2008, April 14, 2009, June 30, 2009, November 17, 2009,

November 3, 2011, February 28, 2012, July 26, 2012, October 15, 2012 and February 21,
2013.
The Transitional Administrator has now presented invoice payment records evidencing
payments and a balance in the account as of June 10, 2013 in the amount of $166,222.06
which has been reviewed and accepted by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office. The
TA has requested the District Court to enter an order providing for an additional
disbursement of $500,000.00 into the OTA account which was approved by the Court on
June 17, 2013.
Upon approval, the Cook County Comptroller will transfer $500,000.00 from the SelfInsurance Fund to an account managed by the Transitional Administrator in accordance
with the terms of the aforementioned court order. From July 22, 2008 to date, inclusive of
this court order, $8,300,000.00 will have been transferred from the Self-Insurance fund to

circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or

154

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 17, 2013
Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for

application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than
the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If
the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b eligibility application, the
applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the
County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding
Sspecial circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM)
Program:
In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of

other structures have been vacant and unused for at least 12 continuous months.
The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and

shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance
with the required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal
Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its

circumstances has been requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program:
In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of

location for a minimum of ten years prior to the date of application for
the SER Program;

155

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 17, 2013

B.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of
hardship supporting a determination that participation in the SER
Program is necessary for the industrial enterprise to continue operations
at its current location and maintain its staff, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable
causing the property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and
unused; and

C.

The applicant is not receiving another Cook County property tax
incentive for the same property.

The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of
the special circumstances, and a determination that the applicant’s participation

included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class
6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the
approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the

to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling
Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and present such
municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its
determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is
deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to
that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special
circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or
Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for
purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b
application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than
the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If
the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the applicant
shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the
case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special
circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program or SER Program under a Class 6b
application must be received by the Assessor’s Office on or before November 30,
2018 to receive consideration.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by
recipients of Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the
use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 6b site. In
such reports, recipients shall be required to certify whether the industrial
enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application continues
its operations at that location. In addition, recipients of Class 6b incentives
granted pursuant to the SER Program shall be required to report to the Assessor
within 30 days if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time
of the SER application ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports

156

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 17, 2013
will be forwarded by the Assessor’s Office to the Secretary of the County Board
for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts.
Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor’s rules
shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.
Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of
the SER application ceases operations at that location, then the Class 6b incentive
granted pursuant to the SER program shall terminate.
d. e.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was
completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the
date of substantial reoccupancy, or in the case of incentives granted pursuant to
the TEERM Program, from the date of the notice of approval. In the case of
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program, this classification shall continue
for a period of 12 years from the date of the notice of approval, or until the
industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application
ceases operations at that location if that occurs sooner.

f.

Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program,
Tthis incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a 160
percent assessment level pursuant to section 74-64(7), if the following
requirements are met:

e. g.

1. A.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor’s Office of intent to request renewal
of the incentive from the municipality or the County Board if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area;

2. B.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board,
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution
expressly stating that the municipality or the County Board, as the case
may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is
necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents
to renewal of the Class 6b; and

3. C.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed
with the Office of the Assessor’s Office before the expiration of the 160
percent assessment level period.

Class 6b incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER
Program are not renewable. For all other Class 6b incentives, tThe number of
renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and
qualify meet the requirements for Class 6b. Any property owner that applies for
Class 6b treatment on or before the adoption date of this Ordinance change will
be eligible for this renewal term at the end of their original incentive period
subject to the above requirements. If, on November 23, 1999, a property is
receiving Class 6b treatment, but the assessment level is higher than 16 percent,
that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16 percent
assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval
of the Resolution and renewal application. However, if, as of November 23,
1999, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is

157

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 17, 2013
granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the
current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted.

(11)

f. h.

A copy of tThe notice of intent to request for renewal which is filed with the
Assessor's Office of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to
the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the County
Board from the eaffected districts.

g. i.

by all Class 6b recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class 6b site. A copy of sSuch reports shall will be verified

housing project, if required by statute to be assessed in the lowest assessment category;
c.
Improved with a building put to commercial and residential use, of six or less units where the

The overall maximum average rent per unit for all single room occupancy units in the building
shall not exceed 90 percent of the current FMR schedule; and

(4)
Class 4. Real estate owned and used by a not-for-profit corporation in furtherance of the purposes
set forth in its charter unless used for residential purposes. If such real estate is used for residential
purposes, it shall be classified in the appropriate residential class.
(5)
Class 5a. All real estate not included in Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, Class 4, Class 5b, Class 6b,
Class C, Class 7a, Class 7b, Class 8, Class 9, Class S or Class L of this section.
(6)
Class 5b. All real estate used for industrial purposes as defined herein and not included in any
other class.
(7)
Class 6b. Real estate used primarily for industrial purposes, consisting of all newly constructed
buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property,
including the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are
substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified
land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square
footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as
the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the
parcel.
a.
An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating

163

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 17, 2013
that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by
Class 6b is necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the municipality or
County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 6b application to the Assessor. A
certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility
application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment
appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the
eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the
County, as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance supporting the incentive has been
requested.
b.
A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested, whichever is
filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor’s Office to the Secretary of the County
Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts.
c.
Class 6b applications for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and other
structures must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of such new
construction or substantial rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 6b incentive. With respect to abandoned
property, the Class 6b application must be made to the Assessor prior to the commencement of the
reoccupation of the vacant and unused property.
d.
In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 6b, unless:
i.
There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or
ii.
There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and
unused for less than 24 continuous months.
The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included
in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or
Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to
that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the
required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that
the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that
effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well as
a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is
deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b
eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an
assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time
of the Class 6b eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding
special circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program:
In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special

164

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 17, 2013
circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of a Class 6b under the
TEERM Program if there has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been
vacant and unused for at least 12 continuous months. The finding of abandonment, along with the
specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting
and consenting to the Class 6b application under the TEERM Program. If the Ordinance or Resolution is
that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be
obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special
circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County
prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of
an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a
County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but
must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class
change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the applicant shall
instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a
Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program:
In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purpose of Class 6b under the
SER Program if:
A.
The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same location for a minimum
of ten years prior to the date of application for the SER Program;
B.
The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of hardship supporting a
determination that participation in the SER Program is necessary for the industrial enterprise to continue
operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and that without such designation the industrial
enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to be in imminent risk of becoming
vacant and unused; and
C.

The applicant is not receiving another Cook County property tax incentive for the same property.

The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special circumstances,
and a determination that the applicant’s participation in the SER Program is necessary for the industrial
enterprise to continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to be in
imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance
supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a
municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is
deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The
applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special
circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County
prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"qualified" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an
Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County
Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of

165

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 17, 2013
Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be
filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to
Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead
file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a
Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program or SER Program under a Class 6b application must be
received by the Assessor’s Office on or before November 30, 2018 to receive consideration.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Class 6b
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports, recipients shall be required to certify whether the industrial
enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application continues its operations at that
location. In addition, recipients of Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program shall be
required to report to the Assessor within 30 days if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at
the time of the SER application ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports will be
forwarded by the Assessor’s Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of
the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within the time established by
the Assessor’s rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.
Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application
ceases operations at that location, then the Class 6b incentive granted pursuant to the SER program shall
terminate.
e.
This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed, or
in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy, or in the case of incentives
granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, from the date of the notice of approval. In the case of
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program, this classification shall continue for a period of 12 years
from the date of the notice of approval, or until the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the
time of the SER application ceases operations at that location if that occurs sooner.
f.
Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program, this incentive
may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a 10 percent assessment level pursuant to
section 74-64(7), if the following requirements are met:
A.
The taxpayer notifies the Assessor’s Office of intent to request renewal of the incentive from the
municipality or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;
B.
The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or the
County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and
beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class 6b; and
C.
A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Assessor’s
Office before the expiration of the 160 percent assessment level period.
g.
Class 6b incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER Program are not
renewable. For all other Class 6b incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the
property continues to apply and meet the requirements for Class 6b.

recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 6b site. A copy of
such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for
distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within
the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to

SHANNON E. ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a contract with Max
McGraw Wildlife Foundation, Dundee, Illinois, for environmental research and monitoring of infectious

The Max McGraw Wildlife Foundation was the sole vendor for Request for Proposal (RFP)
No. 13-50-055 to track wildlife vectors or reservoirs such as skunks, raccoons, and coyotes of
various pathogens that threaten the well-being of people and domestic animals. Continued
surveillance is mandatory as wildlife population proximity to urban areas alters both animal
behavior and disease processes. Radiotelementry, serology monitoring and population
dynamic surveillance are required for vaccination strategies and wildlife management
programs.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1,020,228.00 (FY 2013: $204,045.60; FY 2014: $204,045.60; FY 2015:
$204,045.60; FY 2016: $204,045.60; and FY 2017: $204,045.60). Contract period: December 1, 2012

in animal and man. The University of Illinois Zoological Pathology Program (ZPP) is the
only full-time wildlife/exotic animal pathology program in the state of Illinois. They are
uniquely qualified to provide the full-service diagnostic review of wildlife diseases carried by
vectors within Cook County. Disease surveillance in wildlife in Cook County is a critical
component of Public Health/Safety and effective wildlife management.

CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT
TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 25, 2013 from
DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $30,000.00 from Account
529-240, External Graphics and Reproduction Services to Account 529-225, Postage for postage of
various mailings.
Reason:

Transfer funds are needed to cover postage utilized by departments within the Document
Storage Fund.

From Account 529-240

Total

$30,000.00

To Account 529-225

Total

$30,000.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?

208

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 17, 2013
On May 1, 2013 it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds.
The balance in the account at that time was $0 and the balance 30 days prior to that was $0. The
account was not budgeted for FY 2013 as there were no sufficient funds in the Document Storage
Fund (Department 529). Funds budgeted in the General Fund for postage, were not adequate to
cover mailings that were required by State Statutes. This shortage was due to unanticipated postage
rate increase in FY 2013.
2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 529-240 was identified as the source of transferred funds since the quantity of file jackets
to be printed in FY 2013 had to be reduced with the remaining amount to be funded from FY 2014,
hence the availability of funds for the transfer. As a result, funds allocated for File Jackets in FY
2013 were adjusted to accommodate a lower quantity. Hence, the availability of extra funds in this
account as a source of transfer.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 529-240.
Part of the quantity of the file jackets that were to be printed in FY 2013 will be printed and paid for
from FY 2014 funds.

4.

If the answer to the above question is ―none‖ then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

The Budget Department has reviewed and has no objection to this transfer.
_________________________
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved that the request of the Clerk of the
Circuit Court be approved. The motion carried unanimously.

Transmitting a Communication, dated June 25, 2013 from
DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $45,507.00 from Account
335-240, External Graphics and Reproduction Services to Account 335-225, Postage for postage of
various mailings.
Reason:

The transfer of funds is needed to provide fund for postage of various mailings including
certified and restricted mail. Funds budgeted were not adequate to cover mailings that were
required by State Statutes, due to unanticipated postage rate increase and an increase in
mandatory mailings required by State Statutes in FY 2013.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On May 1, 2013 it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds.
The balance in the account at that time was $139,806.00 and the balance 30 days prior to that was
$244,806.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 240 - External Graphics and Reproduction Services was identified as the source of
transferred funds as the account received reimbursement for the printing costs of Personal Issue
Tickets (Traffic Citation Tickets) from the various Suburban Police Agencies. Hence, the
availability of funds for the transfer.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 335-240.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is ―none‖ then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The funds to be transferred from Account 240 were received as a payment of reimbursement for the
printing costs of Personal Issue Tickets (Traffic Citation Tickets) from the various Suburban Police
Agencies. Hence, the availability of funds for transfer.

Transmitting a Communication, dated June 27, 2013 from
DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $150,000.00 from Account
529-240, External Graphics and Reproduction Services to Account 529-660, Rental of Facilities to
provide for various expenditure mainly 89th Street facility and shelving rentals through the end of the
fiscal year (September 1, 2013 through November 30, 2013).
Reason:

As the move into the new storage facility at Cicero has been delayed until FY 2014 and as
89th street storage facility related obligations were budgeted through the end of August 2013
(previously anticipated date of move), funds are needed in Account 660 Rental of Facilities in
order to meet obligations through the end of the fiscal year.

LOCAL AGENCY AGREEMENT AMENDMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 14, 2013 from
JOHN YONAN, P.E., Superintendent, Department of Transportation and Highways
Local Agency Amendment #2 for Federal Participation
183rd Street,
U.S. Route45 (LaGrange Road) to 80th Avenue
in the Village of Tinley Park in County Board District #17
Section: 05-B6422-03-FP
Centerline Mileage: 2.13 miles
Fiscal Impact: $12,029,089.00 [$4,122,358.00 to be reimbursed from the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) and $5,534,000.00 to be reimbursed from the State of Illinois] from the Motor
Fuel Tax Fund (600-585 Account)
respectfully submits for execution and recommend for execution a Local Agency Amendment #2 for
Federal Participation, M-8003(167), with the State of Illinois, wherein Cook County will be the lead
agency to let, award a contract and supervise construction for improvements along 183rd Street (County
Highway B64) between U.S. Route 45 (LaGrange Road) and 80th Avenue, to be identified as Section:
05-B6422-03-FP. This road will be constructed through the Village of Tinley Park.
Previously, your Honorable Body approved the original Local Agency Agreement for Federal
Participation on November 6, 2007 in the amount of $11,708,000.00 for construction of the 183rd Street
improvements. Subsequently, additional Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) federal funding was
secured and your Honorable Body approved a Local Agency Amendment #1 For Federal Participation on
April 1, 2009 in the amount of $13,315,000.00 to reflect the additional funding but the State of Illinois
did not approve the Amendment #1 due to various issues regarding construction engineering costs.
Further, your Honorable Body approved a new Local Agency Amendment #1 For Federal Participation
on January 16, 2013 which incorporated the final project costs and an amended division of cost table, but
erroneously referenced Illinois Commerce Commission funding.
The previous County approved Amendment #1 (dated January 16, 2013) is superseded by this
Amendment #2 which omits the erroneous reference to Illinois Commerce Commission funding and shifts
$446,847.00 from the State share to the County share of the Amended Division of Cost table contained
within said document. The total project cost of $12,029,089.00 and the FHWA funding of $4,122,358.00
are not affected by this revision.
In summary, the State of Illinois will reimburse Cook County up to a maximum $5,534,000.00(previously
$5,980,847.00) and the FHWA will reimburse Cook County up to a maximum $4,122,350.00 toward the
project construction and construction engineering costs. The County of Cook will be responsible for the
remaining balance of costs and the County share is revised to the amount of $2,372,731.00 (previously
$1,925,884.00) which still reflects a net reduction from the estimated cost of $3,246,494.00 as per the
original Agreement.

County of Cook. The Definition of any terms appearing in this Ordinance which are also used in
aforesaid Act shall be the same as in said Act.

Rabida Children’s Hospital, Chicago, Illinois, to provide violence reduction services in the South Shore
community.

238

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 17, 2013
Reason:

La Rabida Children’s Hospital proposal is to create an intervention that focuses on youth who
are victims of violence. The program is modeled after Drexel University’s Healing Hurt
People Program. Similar to the Drexel Program, La Rabida’s would provide trauma outreach
services and clinical services to youth at the University of Chicago Hospital and Stroger
Hospital of Cook County who have been injured as a result of violence. The goal is to
implement a pilot that if proven effective can be implemented throughout the County. The
program will serve 60 youth. This program focuses on intervention while the youth is still in
the hospital and has the potential to be model for other health care providers to break the
cycle of violence. It also has a long-term sustainability plan if funding does not continue.
The program could serve youth from anywhere in the County, but anticipates that most
participants will be from the South and West sides of Chicago.
The above provider was selected by a three (3) member Evaluation Committee. The
Evaluation Committee in total reviewed 108 proposals. The Evaluation Committee submitted

The program is focused on creating youth leaders and encouraging the youth to take control
of the culture of the school. Involving parents also impacts the families and siblings of the
youth not only transforming school cultures, but also the way families deal with conflict. The
program will be school based and serve the Lawndale neighborhood.

requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a contract with
Struggling Youths Equals Successful Adults, Chicago, Illinois, to provide violence reduction services in
Cook County communities.
Reason:

Struggling Youths Equals Successful Adults proposal is a program that targets foster children
17 and up as they are aging out of the system. The program provides wrap-around services to
young people. Each participant is paired with a ―life coach,‖ who is a former foster child to
help guide the youth through the transition to independent life. Youth also receive the
services of a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, a General Education Diploma (GED)
instructor, and volunteers who mentor three (3) youth each. The proposal was the only
proposal that proposed focusing solely on foster youth and made an excellent case for need
and risk of foster children aging out of the system. The program will serve 50 youth. Using
former foster children to mentor current foster children could be a model for the system in the
future. The program will serve youth from all over the county, but anticipates most
participants will come from Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Bronzeville, Roseland, Austin,
South Shore, Humboldt Park and Lawndale.
