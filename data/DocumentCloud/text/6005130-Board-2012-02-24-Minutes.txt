Board and Committee Reports (continued)
B. Minutes of the Human Resources Committee Meeting, February 17, 2012
It was noted that on February 17th, the Human Resources Committee received information but did not
take action on any items, due to a lack of a quorum.
Gladys Lopez, System Interim Director of Human Resources, provided an overview of the information
that was presented at the meeting; this included information on the following subjects: Human
Resources Staffing; First 30 Days – Issues Identified; Hot Items – Clinical Staff and Displacement; and
2011 Students at Work (SAW) Program Update.
During the review of the information, Director Ansell stated that, at the Quality and Patient Safety
Committee Meeting on February 21st, he requested that a dashboard be prepared with information
relating to nurse staffing levels. He stated that it would also be beneficial to receive a Board dashboard;
this would allow the Directors to periodically review measures, such as those relating to nurse staffing
levels and other Human Resources activities. Maureen O’Donnell, System Interim Chief Human
Resource Officer and Chief of the Cook County Bureau of Human Resources, stated that meetings are
currently being held with Barbara Farrell, System Director of Quality and Patient Safety, to specifically
talk through the performance metrics of Human Resources; one of those metrics specifically addresses
nursing – in terms of hires, postings and length of time. Ms. O’Donnell added that the big question that
needs answers and movement is the question of how much time it takes to actually get a person hired,
from the time of posting to the time the person is on-board.
Director Lyne, seconded by Director Butler, moved the approval of the minutes of
the Human Resources Committee Meeting of February 17, 2012. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, February 17, 2012
It was noted that on February 17th, the Finance Committee received information but did not take action
on any items, due to a lack of a quorum. The contractual requests were discussed by the Committee, and
were placed directly on this Board Agenda, under Item IV(A).
The Board discussed the Contracts and Procurement Items. Dr. Bala Hota, System Chief Medical
Information Officer, and Dr. Terry Mason, System Chief Medical Officer, provided additional
information regarding request numbers 6 and 7 (requests to increase and amend the contracts with
Siemens Medical Solutions and Cerner Corporation). Chairman Batts requested that a one-page
summary be assembled for each request that provides specifics on what the System is trying to
accomplish. Dr. Hota responded that he can provide this information. The following subjects relating to
the two requests were discussed: funding available for Meaningful Use; International Classification of
Diseases, 10th Edition diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-10) conversion and implementation; and
training. Dr. Hota noted that a gap analysis summary was provided on the Cerner Siemens ReEngineering Project; this information is included as an attachment to the February 17, 2012 Finance
Committee Meeting Minutes.

Board and Committee Reports
C. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, February 17, 2012 (continued)
John Cookinham, System Interim Chief Financial Officer, reviewed the Revenue Cycle Report contained
within the minutes. Director Carvalho highlighted information contained on the last page of the Report;
he noted that the information reflects a $40 million Medicaid retroactive rate adjustment, which is $30
million higher than was anticipated. He stated that there is a negative variance in patient fee collection
of $14 million for Medicaid, $2.6 million for Medicare and $3.8 million in the “Other” category.
Director Carvalho asked if the reason for the declining Medicaid receipts was due to any of the following
possible reasons: the System is seeing fewer Medicaid patients; the System is converting Medicaid
patients less efficiently; there is a bottleneck in the System’s process of submitting claims; or there is a
bottleneck in the State’s processing of claims. Director Carvalho stated that each of those possible
reasons could lead to the end result of fewer Medicaid dollars.
Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive Officer, responded that the answer to Director Carvalho’s question is “all
of the above.” He stated that data related to this issue is reviewed on a regular basis. Some of those
issues are clearly on the System’s side; he noted that the System needs to do a better job to resolve those
issues. Some of the issues reside with the System’s vendor, who edits the claims and submits them to
Medicaid; there is a holdup on that end. The claims then reach the Medicaid offices; he noted that there
is a real variation in the way the claims are getting paid, which makes the cash flow situation very
difficult. He referenced a recent meeting held with other Chief Executive Officers of local safety net
hospitals; at that meeting, one of the concerns expressed was the fact that Medicaid is not paying claims
in an expeditious manner. With regard to the issue of the pending Medicaid applications at the State,
Dr. Raju stated that the System continues to have a large number of pending applications. Meetings are
held regularly with the various entities involved; however, there continues to be a backlog with the
processing of the applications. He noted that management has made a strategic decision to prioritize the
applications; mostly inpatient applications and those outpatient applications for high-end ambulatory
services are being sent at this time.
Director Carvalho noted that enrollment in Medicaid is at historically high levels. He inquired whether
the change in payer mix was attributable to the System seeing more uninsured patients or because the
System is seeing fewer Medicaid patients. Dr. Raju stated that the System’s uninsured patients consist
of the following three groups: undocumented immigrants; people who are under-insured; and people
who are employed but who are either not provided insurance by their employer, or they cannot afford to
pay the co-pays under their employer-provided insurance. Dr. Raju indicated that he can provide an
analysis of this information. He noted that, if the number of uninsured patients increases in the System,
they crowd out the patients with Medicaid and other insurance, because those covered patients have an
opportunity to go elsewhere. This crowding phenomena is not unique to the System; it is being seen
across the nation.
Director Carvalho, seconded by Director Lyne, moved the approval of the minutes
of the Finance Committee Meeting of February 17, 2012. THE MOTION
CARRIED.

Board and Committee Reports (continued)
D. Minutes of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting, February 21, 2012
During the presentation of these minutes, Chairman Batts noted that the minutes include an update on the
activities relating to Oak Forest Health Center‘s plans for the Immediate Care Center and specialty care
operations. Dr. Claudia Fegan, Chief Medical Officer of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County,
reviewed this information, which included volume data for outpatient services. Director Ansell stated
that it would be useful to see further information on the matter, including a review of the current status of
activities and a projection of how the System will reach the goals. Additionally, Director Greenspan
requested that this information include data regarding the locations from which referrals are being made.
Director Ansell, seconded by Director Greenspan, moved the approval of the
minutes of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting of February 21, 2012.
THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

V.

Report from Chairman of the Board
Update on Cook County Health Foundation
Chairman Batts stated that a quorum of Foundation Directors is now in place. A proposal was received from
an outside firm who helps organizations like the Foundation raise money; however, the price quoted was not
something the members thought the Foundation could afford, so this subject remains to be addressed. The ad
hoc committee will meet today, after this meeting, to determine the next steps. Chairman Batts indicated that
further action and assistance, internally and externally, is needed to get the Foundation up and running. He
stated that there is a possible opportunity to raise more money. He noted that, in New York City and Los
Angeles County, they each only raise approximately $1 million - $1.5 million per year. In Atlanta, Georgia,
which is much smaller than Cook County, their public hospital has been converted to a 501(c)(3)
organization. The organization initially started with a contribution of $200 million from one family; they are
now running a capital campaign to raise another $320 million, and it appears that they will be successful in
their fundraising efforts.
A. Board Education –2011 Annual Report of the Stroger Burn Center (Attachment #3)
Dr. Stathis Poulakidas, Chairman of the Division of Burn Services at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of
Cook County, presented the 2011 Annual Report of the Stroger Burn Center. The Board reviewed and
discussed the information.
B. Board Education - Orientation to Public Health Accreditation (Attachment #4)
Dr. Martell reviewed information included in a presentation regarding Orientation to Public Health
Accreditation - Preparing the Cook County Department of Public Health for National Accreditation. The
Board discussed the information.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM 
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
February 24, 2012 
 
FY 2012 BUDGET 
Revenue  cycle  performance  is  reviewed  in  detail  at  weekly  meetings  led  by  the  CEO.    Additionally,  
regular meetings are being held to analyze the status of the backlog in Medicaid applications;  present at 
these  meetings  are  representatives  from  CCHHS,  Cook  County,  the  Governor’s  office,  the  Illinois 
Department of Healthcare and Family Services, and the Illinois Department of Human Services.   
In  January  2012,  the  System  realized  $40.9  million  in  retroactive  payment    adjustments  as  a  result  of 
alterations  proposed  by  CCHHS  and  accepted  by  HFS  to  rate  methodology  calculations.    An  additional 
$8.5M in retroactive payments as a result of these adjustments is anticipated to be paid on February 28, 
2012.  This second group of payments relates to past outpatient activity.

 1115 WAIVER 
With  President  Preckwinkle  we  recently  concluded  a  series  of  briefings  with  members  of  the  Illinois 
General  Assembly  regarding  the  1115  Waiver  request,  and  the  necessary  enabling  legislation.    The 
proposed  legislative  language  has  been  drafted.    The  waiver  document  has  been  widely  disseminated 
and we have responded to numerous stakeholder inquiries.  Among others, I or my team have met with 
and briefed the Illinois Primary Healthcare Association, Maryjane Wurth and Illinois Hospital Association 
staff, the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council (MCHC) Policy and Advocacy Council, a large group of 
local FQHC’s and community clinics, several hospital CEO’s, and others; further outreach is planned.  An 
1115  Waiver  Steering  Committee  has  been  established  and  meets  weekly  with  three  working  groups 
reporting.    The  implementation  workgroups  are  Care  Management,  Empanelment/Registry  and 
Administration  and  are  progressing.    We  are  currently  responding  to  a  request  of  HFS  to  provide  that 
department  with  staff  to  lead  on  this  project  ‐  there  is  a  particular  focus  being  given  to  eligibility 
screening/enrollment potential options.  Our initial meeting with CMS, HFS, and CCHHS is scheduled for 
February 24th, at 10:00 a.m. 
OAK FOREST HEALTH CENTER 
The Capital Committee continues to make progress in the planning of the Oak Forest Health Center.  On 
February  10th  committee  members  along  with  clinical  stake  holders  toured  a  radiology  center  which 
offered  assistance  in  mapping  out  patient  flow  and  layout  for  the  ground  floor  of  the  OFHC.    The 
presentation to the Board of Directors for the design of the Oak Forest Health Center has been moved 
up from the April 27th Board Meeting to the March 29th Board Meeting.  The Immediate Care Center will 
move  to  the  New  “E”  Building  on  February  25th.    Also,  the  OFHC  Volume  Statistics  Dashboard  is  now 
posted on the health center’s page on the new CCHHS website and will be updated monthly.   
PUBLIC HEALTH UPDATE 
The  Cook  County  Department  of  Public  Health  in  partnership  with  the  CPPW  (Communities  Putting 
Prevention to Work) team held the final session of the Change Institute on February 14, 2012 in Alsip, 
Illinois to acknowledge the work of the 38 Model Communities grant recipients in implementing policy, 
system and environmental strategies to make “healthy choices” available to improve the health status 
of  residents.    Strategies  ranged  from  plans  to  develop  walking  paths  and  mass‐transit  to  increasing 
healthy  food  options  and  physical  activity  in  schools.    The  participants  highlighted  their  strategies

 through presentations and poster sessions and emphasized a commitment to sustaining these initiatives 
beyond the funding cycle. 
SCHWARTZ ROUNDS 
The  Schwartz  Center  for  Compassionate  Care  was  founded  in  1995  by  Kenneth  Schwartz  who  died  of 
lung cancer. The mission of the Center is to promote healthcare so that patients and their professional 
caregivers relate to one another in a way that  provides hope to the patient, support and nurturing to 
caregivers  and  sustenance  to  the  healing  process.  Schwartz  Center  Rounds®  is  one  of  the  programs 
offered  by  the  Center.  The  Rounds  provide  an  interdisciplinary  and  interdepartmental  forum  where 
caregivers discuss difficult emotional and social issues inherent in patient care. The Rounds discussion 
focuses  on  a  specific  patient  case.  A  panel  of  multidisciplinary  caregivers  describes  their 
experience caring  for the  patient  and  the  impact  it  had  on  them.  This  is  followed  by  a 
facilitated discussion among attendees. These rounds differ from clinical or management rounds in that 
they  address  the  ethical,  psychological,  and  emotional  concerns  that  arise  during  the  patient's  illness, 
not the medical issues. The Rounds serve to nurture the caregivers in a safe and confidential forum. 
 Stroger Hospital's  first  Schwartz  Center  Rounds  was  held  in  September  2011.  Since  then  Schwartz 
Rounds have been held monthly and thus 6 sessions have been held that have been very well attended 
by various disciplines consisting of physicians, RNs, social workers, occupational /physical therapists, lab 
and  clerical  workers.       Benjamin Mba, MD, MRCP (UK), FACP, FHM  is  the  organizer  and  driving  force 
behind this activity and I want to thank him for his efforts and for bringing this great learning tool to our 
system.   
For  your  information  attached  is  an  article  titled  The  Schwartz  Center  Rounds:  Evaluation  of  an 
Interdisciplinary  Approach  to  Enhancing  Patient‐Centered  Communication,  Teamwork,  and  Provider 
Support by Beth A. Lown, MD, and Colleen F. Manning, MA which provides an evaluation of the impact 
of  such  rounds  at  other  institutions.     Also,  the  New  York  Times  article,  Well:  Sharing  the  Stresses  of 
Being a Doctor by Pauline W. Chen, M.D., regarding the subject,  is also attached.

 NEW WEBSITE 
In the beginning of February we launched our new website www.cookcountyhhs.org.  The new website 
is aimed at providing public information for patients, employees, and the public at large.  When you log 
on, you will find basic information about accessing our services, locating our facilities, finding a job or 
how  to  do  business  with  CCHHS  as  well  as  profiles  about  our  elite  medical  staff  and  reports  of  our 
committee  and  board  meetings.    There  is  also  a  news  section  which  highlights  upcoming  events 
including a health observance calendar that highlights what we are doing throughout the system toward 
keeping our patients healthy.  This is just the start of a new look and feel to our on‐line presence and I 
encourage everyone to stay connected to CCHHS. 
I would like to thank Marisa Kollias our Interim Director of Public Relations for undertaking this project 
that was developed at an accelerated pace and completed on time and under budget.
