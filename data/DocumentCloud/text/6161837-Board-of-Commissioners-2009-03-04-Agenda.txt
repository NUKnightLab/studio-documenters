opportunity to be sentenced by their peers and receive a consequence that reflects the ideals of, and
educates the offenders in, restorative justice; and
WHEREAS, peer juries give young volunteers the chance to serve as jurors in a coordinated effort to
hold their peers accountable with balanced consequences that repair harm done to the victim, the
community, and to the offender himself or herself, and their family; and
WHEREAS, peer jury programs exemplify the practices of empowering youth through involvement in
community solutions, problem-solving, decision-making, leadership development, and positive peer
pressure; and

WHEREAS, Federal, State, and local governments, corporations, foundations, service organizations,
educational institutions, juvenile justice agencies, and individual adults support youth court programs
because such programs actively promote and contribute to building successful, productive lives and
futures for our youth; and

management, teamwork, public speaking, and leadership, which are skills that prospective employers
value and which help to transform participants in youth court programs into productive members of their
communities; and

youth. Youth courts also build awareness in youth of the law and the consequences of delinquency, and

and commends the youth court programs in existence in Cook County, including, but not limited to the

RESOLUTION
RECOGNIZING MARCH 24, 2009 AS WORLD TB DAY
WHEREAS, the spread of tuberculosis continues to present a global public health threat, second only to
HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the world’s leading infectious killers; and
WHEREAS, tuberculosis is primarily an illness of the respiratory system that spreads by coughing and
sneezing. Each year, about two million people worldwide die from this curable disease; and
WHEREAS, with appropriate antibiotic treatment, TB can be cured in most people. Left untreated, each
person with active TB disease can infect an average of between 10 and 15 people every year; and
WHEREAS, successful treatment depends on close cooperation between the patient and health care
provider. Patients who stop taking their medication before they are cured remain ill and are at risk for
developing and spreading multi-drug resistant TB, a deadlier form of TB that is much more costly and
difficult to treat; and
WHEREAS, in suburban Cook County, treatment and control services are provided by the Cook County
Department of Public Health’s (CCDPH) TB Prevention and Control Unit; and
WHEREAS, an effective TB prevention and control program includes screening, early case
identification, contact tracing, and treatment. These are the services provided by the CCDPH that are so
essential to the prevention of costly TB outbreaks.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Todd H. Stroger, President of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners, do hereby recognize the efforts of the Cook County Department of Public
Health to provide the services needed to control this disease and furthermore recognize March 24, 2009,
as World TB Day.

ITEM #26

APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated February 10, 2009 from
ANTONIO HYLTON, Chief Information Officer, Bureau of Technology
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Merrick & Company,
Aurora, Colorado, for aerial imagery for the Counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry
and Will. The seven county projects for aerial imagery includes ground control, aerial imagery (including
aerotriangulation), orthorectified imagery, DEM, geodatabase design, metadata, and project management.
This time-sensitive project is performed in the spring under "leaf-off" conditions.
Reason:

A regional Request for Proposal (RFP) was jointly developed by the Counties of Cook,
DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will (collectively "the regional GIS work
group") to select a company to perform aerial imagery for data acquisition and sharing at
county borders. The regional GIS work group has recommended Merrick & Company
because of its ability to meet all technical specifications of the RFP. Cook County, the
largest, most complex territory in the region, comprising dense urban areas, airports, and
shoreline environments, acts as the lead government project manager for this initiative. The
entities able to contribute financially to this project are the Counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane,
Kendall and Lake, and the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. Beneficiaries of this
project are the Cook County municipalities that provide vital operations: emergency first

WHEREAS, Cook County has defined "abandoned property" as buildings and other structures that, after
having been vacant and unused for at least 24 months, are purchased for value by a purchaser in whom
the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has defined an exception to this abandon property definition shall be, if the

create an attractive nuisance to criminal elements; the aging and eroding of mechanical equipment within
the abandoned structures; the unkept and unsightly abandoned structures that have created a blighting
effect on surrounding residential neighborhoods, and the ongoing deterioration of the abandoned
structures that have an intrinsic chilling effect on the influx of potential commercial development within
the region.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the
County of Cook, State of Illinois, that the President and Board of Commissioners validate the property
