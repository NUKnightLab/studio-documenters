Debarment Ordinance, Parimal (Perry) Mehta and FutureNet Group, Inc. (FutureNet) has filed an appeal
of the City of Detroit Office of the Inspector General Report of the Administrative Hearing and
Final Determination pertaining to the above-referenced OIG Investigative files with the City Clerk.
Specifically, on June 7th, 2019, the OIG recommended:

It 20 years of debarment of Perry and Jay Mehta, effective September 30, 2016
and ending September 30, 2036; and

15 years of debarment of FutureNet, effective September 30, 2016 and
ending September 30, 2031.

Enclosed please find, for your information and convenience, a copy ofthe Office of the Inspector General
(OIG) binder, which includes a copy of: the OlG?s letter of June 7, 2019 to Steve Fishman, attorney for

transcript for Perry Mehta and FutureNet; and the City of Detroit Law Department?s Legal Guidance and

In accordance with Section of the Debarment Ordinance, please be advised that i am
exercising the Inspector General?s right to appear in person and submit written comments to this
honorable body. Lastly, please be reminded that this honorable body must hold the Appeal Hearing
within 45 days of receipt of the appeal from Perry Mehta and FutureNet. See, Section 18-11-11(e) of the

Mr. Goldberg, was provided with the Final Decision of Debarment on November 5, 2018 for failure to

Questions Regarding Request for Indemni?cation for Of?cer Michael Russell in the case of
Howard vs City of Detroit et al Civil Action case 18-13678

1- Please provide more details as to actions of Of?cer Michael Russell (Lieutenant), relative to the
subsequent Narcotic raid, which is the subject of the case?

2- The suit describes three separate events in the attachments, one was the Robbery /Homicide which
occurred on or about December 30, 2013. It was at that time, Of?cer Russell was in contact with
one of the suit plaintiffs. During the investigation of the Robbery /Homicide the Narcotics unit
responded to the same scene and collected and con?scated several marijuana plants and related
products. As a direct result of the on-going investigation of the Robbery/ Homicide another agency
became involved by engaging one of the suspects in alleged Robbery /Homicide where a gun battle
ensued, and the suspect was shot and killed by the of?cers involved. This act negated the need to
further investigate the case because the second suspect was never identi?ed and the other case of
Robbery /Homicide was closed under special circumstances. Approximately eight months later
(August 22, 2014) there was a subsequent narcotic raid conducted at the same location where other
property was seized, it appears as though the listed defendants were identi?ed as defendants in this
suit, yet there is no documentation of the incident in August 2014. Given these circumstances it is
requested that all supporting documents be made available for review to determine Indemni?cation
status before this body.

3- It is further requested as to the ?nal outcomes of both contacts, relative to the return of property or
not that the plaintiffs are suggesting were illegally obtained. Of?cer Russell?s involvement

speci?cally to the con?scations in either incident.

4- Were there any Department charges or investigation into these matters?

Sincerely,

Roy McCalister, Jr.

RE: Questions regarding Settlement of Lawsuit of Lonzell Latimer; verses the City of Detroit

Case No.: 3:18-cv-11654; File No.: L18-00326

1- Please provide more details as to the rational for the initial stop (Probable Cause)?

2- The suit was forwarded but there are a lot of unanswered questions regarding the validity and or the
lack of information. Therefore if there are any other supporting documents which would shed a
better light on this case I would appreciate reviewing them. If not, this case is frustrating and I
would like to have a better understanding as to why litigation is usually not pursued and a quick
settlement is the only option.

3? The simple fact that a witness was produced how far reaching was the investigation?

4- Were there any Department charges or investigation into this matter?
