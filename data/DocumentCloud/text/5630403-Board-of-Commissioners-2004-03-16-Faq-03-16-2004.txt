Narrative Attachment
Questions 2-10 and 14-15
Several individuals expressed concerns about the future of the Charles Hayes Center.
Response
The CHA is committed to continuing to operate the Charles Hayes Center and the programs provided there. The Hayes Center will
retain its name, as well.
The CHA does intend to change the way services are delivered at the Hayes Center. Rather than staffing the Hayes Center with
employees funded by CHA and through grants available to FIC, Inc., the CHA will hire qualified outside firms to administer programs
provided through the Hayes Center, including Information Technology training and supportive services.
