 MEETING MINUTES
PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
April 7, 2016

was held at 121 N. LaSalle St., in Room 201-A.
Present:

Ernest Wong, Chair

Staff: Eleanor Gorski, Deputy of Planning, Design, and Historic Preservation Division

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1. 11127-11149 S. Langley
9th Ward
Pullman District
Proposed exterior and interior rehabilitation of two existing 3-1/2 story 6-flat
residential buildings and a new 3-1/2 story masonry building for 38 live/work units
and 17 parking spaces along rear alley
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
Exterior Rehabilitation of 6-Flat Buildings:
1. For the historic 6-flat building to the north of the site, the existing paint shall
be removed using the gentlest means possible. The MSDS sheet for any
chemical products shall be submitted for review and approval by Historic

Preservation staff prior to work occurring;
2. Enlarged details of the new front porches, doors, and windows,
proposed to match the design of the original missing features shall be
included in the permit plans;
3. The new code required open metal exit stairs located on the rear
facades of the 6-flat buildings and designed to be as minimal as
possible to meet code requirements are approved as proposed and shall
be painted black;
4. The height of the walls screening the trash containers along the rear
alley should be as low as possible, only what is required to screen the

 trash containers beyond, and the brick should match the historic
common brick. Elevations of the masonry wall shall be included in
the permit plans;
5. Any new brick, stone, and mortar shall match the historic masonry in
color, profile, texture, and finish. The new mansard roofing may be
synthetic slate or slate-like asphalt shingles as proposed. Exterior
material samples shall be reviewed for approval by Historic
Preservation staff prior to order and installation;
New Construction:
6. Given that this building is a stand-alone structure on a site at the
eastern edge of the landmark district and that there are other 3-1/2
story historic buildings of similar heights across the street and in the
district, staff recommends that the proposed 40-ft height for the main
roofline of the building is approved;
7. The elevator penthouse, which is setback from the front façade and
encloses the code required overrun and a machine roof, would only be
minimally visible from Langley. The metal cladding of the penthouse
shall be a grey color in a non-reflective finish;
8. Enlarged details of the new front porches, doors, and windows shall be
included in the permit plans; and,
9. The proposed orange-colored face brick with black-colored accent
bricks, orange-colored precast concrete coping and porch
treads/landing, dark green-colored dormer cladding and
gutters/downspouts, and dark bronze window frames are approved
with the condition that the face brick for the front and side facades will
be standard modular-sized bricks.
2. 1937 N. Humboldt
1st Ward
Logan Square Boulevards District
Proposed new 3-1/2 story 7-unit masonry residential building with 7 parking spaces
in detached garage off the rear alley
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The two rooftop stair enclosures should be clad in a neutral, dark grey
color in a non-reflective finish. Any rooftop feature and/or
planting/landscaping on the rooftop should be set back and low in
height so as not to be visible from the public rights-of-way;
2. Window details, front door cut sheets, and enlarged details of the
building base and parapet, and porch/stair/railing conditions should be
included in the permit plans; and,
3. The dark red-colored face brick, proposed to be modular-sized for the
front and side return facades and be utility-sized for the remainder of
the side elevations beyond the chimney, is approved in concept with
samples to be provided for Historic Preservation staff review and
approval prior to order and installation. The mortar should have a
narrow profile and match the color of the face brick.

 3. 216 N. May
Fulton-Randolph Market District
Proposed new 4-story office building addition to the historic building
Action:

27th Ward

Approved unanimously with the following condition:
1. The 4-story addition is approved as shown on plans dated 2/11/16.
The ground face concrete block proposed at the first floor south
elevation shall be integral colored, color to be submitted. Samples of
proposed cladding materials shall be reviewed and approved by
Historic Preservation staff with the permit application.

4. 1306 N. Dearborn Parkway
2nd Ward
Three Arts Club
Proposed interior alteration at first floor to relocate the “Pantry” coffee station
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following condition:
1. The interior modification to relocate the “Pantry” coffee station is

be obtained for the proposed modification.
