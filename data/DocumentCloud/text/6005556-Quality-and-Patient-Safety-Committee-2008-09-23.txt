has taken place at the Cermak Health Facility since the last meeting. He indicated that they have
submitted their budget, which includes 93 full-time equivalent employees for the Fiscal
Year 2009 Budget and 29 additional for Fiscal Years 2010 and 20] l. Mr. Fagus informed
the Committee that they concluded the initial round of negotiations for the new Residential
Treatment Unit (RTU) and the Receiving Classi?cation and Diagnostic Center (RCDC) Building
which is a major component in bringing these two areas up to standard. The new building will
have 900 new beds and will re-establish an intermediate care area that is appropriate for the care
that those patients at that level need. Also, once the building opens, all of the mental health
patients will be moved into that building. Mr. Fagus stated that his hepe is that by the end of
2009 to have all of the records electronically all across the compound and also at the Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center (JTDC) as well. Further, Mr. Fagus stated that he will speak with
regards to the CQI model in closed session.

Dr. Avery Hart, Interim Chief Medical Of?cer of Cermak Health Services, stated that the
mentality needs to be shifted in terms what quality improvement work is and who does it and it
should be done by all. Further, Dr. Hart indicated that he will speak with regards to two specific
issues in Executive Sessions.

Chairman Ansell asked what the goal date for accreditation is.

PAGE 3

Dr. Hart indicated that he met with the accreditation individuals and they indicated that they
would like to see a self-study which will tell them if Cermak Health Facility Services is ready or
not. Dr. Hart stated that the self?study will not happen until Fiscal Year 2009 because some of
the major liabilities cannot be ?xed without more individuals. In conclusion, Dr. Hart stated that
he anticipates submitting the self-study in the Spring and hope?ully six months after submission
of the self-study Cermak Health Facility Services will be ready for a visit.

Chairman Ansell requested a presentation on the IT Strategy with regard to clinical functions
across the System.

Dr. Hart stated that at Cennak Health Facility Services there is one individual on-site who is self-
taught. Dr. Hart stated that Julie Bonello is requesting four positions for Cermak on?site.

Director Munoz inquired if there was training for the Cemer System.

Dr. Hart responded no. Further, Dr. Hart indicated that they have requested that trainers to come
out and train the schedulers and physicians who will be doing their own scheduling as it is done at
the CORE Center.

Chairman Ansell stated that each entity should submit their annual performance improvement
plan for approval by the Committee of the Board which is a Joint Commission requirement even
if you are not certi?ed by the Joint Commission. Further, Chairman Ansell stated that a schedule
needs to be worked on.

Chairman Ansell indicated that the Justice Department is interested in what the System Board is
doing and they are taking a collaborative approach towards resolving the issues.

Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State?s Attorney and Chief of the Civil Actions Bureau of the
Office of the State?s Attorney, stated that he has met with the Justice Department and they will be
submitting a proposal. Mr. Driscoll indicated that there is a team that will be coming in to do an
analysis of Cerrnalt Health Services.

If

Lula Roberson, Interim Director of Quality Services at Provident Hospital. gave a summary of the
quarterly quality report from Provident Hospital; this report covers the ?rst and second calendar
quarters of 2008.

Chairman Ansell requested that the different institutions who are presenting data should present
in the same way; there is a need to standardize.

David R. Small, Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System, to address the issue at Provident Hospital speci?cally.

Dr. Aaron Hamb, Chief Medical Of?cer at Provident Hospital, stated that they have had changes
in leadership in the department this year.

Mr. Small inquired as to when the changes occurred.

Dr. Hamb stated that leadership changes occurred earlier this year; not only the Director of the
Department but also the Assistant Administrator over that department has changed.

Mary Driscoll, Illinois Department of Public Health, indicated that it would be useful to see back
data.

Ms. Roberson stated that she was not sure how to present the data.
Chairman Ansell indicated that the Committee will come up with a standard.

Chairman Ansell stated that he sees a lot of green which is unusual because most hospitals have
trouble around pain management. Chairman Ansell suggested that nursing should take a look at
the problem to see if it is real or not.

Martina Harrison, RN, MSN, Chief Nursing Of?cer, Provident Hospital, indicated that Provident
Hospital has taken an individualized approach to looking at pain because it has been a problem
and Provident Hospital has experienced issues with respect to pain. The nurse managers are
auditing all of the records almost daily. When new admissions come in they run a special report
called ?Vista Report? and look at those types of diagnosis that would lead them off to pain.

Ms. Roberson indicated that in core measures they meet the target except for pneumonia and that
is due to the cue six hours and one eight hours turn-around time for pneumonia.

Chairman Ansell indicated that it is a problem everywhere. He also stated that they are thinking
of changing the standard to six hours instead of four hours.

Chairman Ansell stated that in March ?recovery audits? will be coming to Illinois; they are
companies that will come in and audit the one and two day stays. Further, Chairman Ansell
stated that they should be receiving a Report? that tell you about where you are
benchmarking statewide.

In regards to the ?never events" Chairman Ansell stated that Medicare will not pay for series of
conditions that develop in the hospital. Again it is a device to improve quality but it is actually to
save money.

Dr. Hamb indicated that Provident Hospital had another regulatory visit which was by Illinois
Emergency Management Agency (IEMA), the group who certi?ed the mammography program as
well as the radiation safety program.

Director Butler, seconded by Director Mu?oz, moved to Receive and File the quarterly
quality report from Provident Hospital. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Receive report from the Medical Staff Executive Committees from
Provident, Oak Stroger Hospitals

Dr. Hamb reported for Provident Hospital. He indicated that the hospital is diligently prepared
for the joint accreditation visit; the medical staff is working with medical records to decrease the
number of incomplete records; teams are daily working to insure they are concurrent and
complete with medical records; departments are redoing materials pertinent to their areas to
optimize staff responses during tracers.

Dr. Homer Abiad, President of the Medical Sta? at Oak Forest Hospital, reported for Oak Forest
Hospital. He indicated that the major problems are the voids in the clinical services that Oak
Forest HoSpital provides; they still do not have any physicians in Gastroenterology or
Gynecology, and have only two Intensive Care physicians. At this time they have budgeted for
Gastroenterology and two Intensive Care physicians. Requests have been submitted two months
ago and they are still waiting for the go-ahead from Human Resource to post these positions.

Chairman Ansel] inquired of Mr. Small as to why it is taking so long.

Mr. Small stated that he does not know what the current status is. it is reported to the Human
Resource Committee in terms of the outstanding request to hires and they will be looking at that
on Friday at the Human Resource Committee meeting.

Judith Frigo, MD, Chief Medical Of?cer, Oak Forest Hospital, indicated that they have prepared
requests to hire for the open positions and Sylvia Edwards, Chief Operating Of?cer of Oak Forest
Hospital, has signed off. Dr. Frigo stated that it is unclear to her because they have to be told
from the downtown Human Resources Department and they have not received clearance.

Mr. Small stated that the Human Resources Committee has just approved the revisions to the
hiring process; it has been approved and ?nalized with the sign off of Cook County Human
Resource Department. -

Chairman Ansell inquired whether they have candidates for these positions.

Dr. Frigo stated that they have at least one candidate for the general internal medicine position;
however, they don?t have candidates for gastroenterology.

Chairman Ansell asked Ms. Edwards to follow up on these positions to make sure that the
positions are cpened up. He inquired whether these positions are done in an integrated way or are
they done in an independent way.

Dr. Frigo stated that all of heads at Stroger Hospital all are aware where that there are vacancies
at Oak Forest Hospital.

John M. Raba, M.D., Interim Chief Medical Officer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System, asked if there are any resources from another institution that could help out at Oak Forest
Hospital on a part time-basis while the process of searching ensues.

Dr. Frigo indicated that she has made telephone inquiries and hasn?t been able to come up with
anyone. .

REPORT OF THE QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY COMMITTEE OF THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
SEPTEMBER 23, 2008

PAGE 6

Chairman Ansell stated that it would be a great opportunity for Dr. Raba to become involved in
getting these positions ?lled.

Ms. Edwards stated that she has been in discussions with Dr. Hamb and Mr Thomas of Provident
Hospital In terms of their ability to identify a practitioner to come to Oak Forest Hospital based
on their volumes.

Director Mu?oz asked if it has always taken this long to get positions posted and get individuals
hired.

Dr. Hamb stated that the posting is a new requirement as a result of the Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) coming into effect.

Dr. Hart inquired whether the new policy is in distribution.
Chairman Ansell responded that it is being passed this Friday.

Dr. Janice Benson, President of the Medical Staff at Stroger Hospital, presented the report for
Stroger Hospital.

Chairman Ansell reminded the attendees that medical staff quality is number one and that the
Joint Commission has a series of new requirements regarding periodic performance review.

Director Munoz suggested that some resources within the hospital system should be identi?ed
and coordinated to try to help with the formatting of all the information.

Director Munoz, seconded by Director Butler, moved to Receive and File the report from
the Medical Staff Executive Committees from Provident, Oak Forest and Stroger Hospital.
THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

 

Receive report on Family Case Management program transition

Linda Rae Murray, MD, MPH, Chief Medical Officer of the Cook County Department of Public
Health, reported for Dr. Stephen Martin, Chief Operating Of?cer of the Cook County Department
of Public Health.

Chairman Ansell asked how we will know when a transfer happens.

Dr. Murray stated that once the State completes the transfer you will be able to see it
electronically.

Director Munoz stated that what would be helpful to the Committee and the Board would be a
delineation of the levels of severity that are handled by the different case services that the Cook
County Department of Public Health delivers to the community. He further requested that it be
put into a memo addressed to the System Board so that it is clearly identified and that it include
some totals of how many individuals are in those programs so that we can counter some of the
criticism.

REPORT OF THE QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY COMMITTEE OF THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
SEPTEMBER 23, 2008

PAGE 7

Dr. Murray stated that she will make sure that the System Board receives the memo from the
State dated July 13, 2003, with totals. In that memo there is a list of a whole series of case
management programs that speci?cally talks about programs that the Department of Public
Health has not given up; they are separate from this program. In conclusion, Dr. Murray stated
that she will update the numbers.

Chairman Ansell stated that his concern is about making sure that the South Suburban area is
taken care of.

Dr. Murray stated that Aunt Martha?s is a big provider for the South suburbs and is willing to take
more.
