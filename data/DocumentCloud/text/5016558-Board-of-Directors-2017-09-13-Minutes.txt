Project Introduction
220 West Congress Detroit, LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) and owner of the

The developer intends to renovate the five-story building on the property to modernize the 36,500
total square feet of office and retail space. Constructed in the early 1900’s, the building has been
occupied by various professional offices and restaurants since the 1950’s and is currently 96%
vacant.
The final use will serve as mixed use space. The first-floor retail space will be completely
renovated with the intention of retaining the current Subway tenant, the building’s sole current
tenant. The second through fifth floors will be extensively renovated and will be marketed as
incubator-style office spaces. The Developer has received interest from potential tenants in tech
and creative industries and hopes to secure tenants who will help to activate the Congress Street
Corridor and the west side of Detroit’s Central Business District (CBD).
The Developer will restore and rehabilitate the building’s exterior, including a redesigned façade
and repurposed roof with a rooftop terrace. The building’s interior will be rehabilitated to include
energy efficient building materials and mechanics. Additionally, the Developer is working with the
City to invest in improvements to the adjoining, publicly owned alley to the west of the building
with the intention of activating the alley a public gathering and art space.

 It is estimated that 40 temporary construction jobs will be created and 1 additional permanent jobs
by developer as well as 75 expected jobs to be created by prospective tenants. Total investment

Project Introduction
751 Griswold Detroit, LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the Plan which entails the
renovation of a four-story office building, constructed in 1924 under architect Albert Kahn and
sculptor Corrado Parducci. The renovation includes retail space on the first floor and office space
on the 2nd through 4th floors. The first-floor retail space will make use of both the basement and
mezzanine space. The redesign of the building incorporates essential considerations specific to
modern office spaces and “state of the art” telecommunications technology systems. The
rehabilitation of the Property includes the repair or replacement of all of the deteriorated and/or
damaged plaster, masonry, brick and stone. Particular attention is being given to the preservation
of the historic nature of the Property by ensuring that the damaged decorative details will be
replaced with material consistent with the current profile, finish, and color.
It is estimated that 79 temporary construction jobs will be created and 2 permanent jobs are
expected to be created. Total investment is expected to be approximately $6,883,375.00. The
Developer is requesting $836,869.00 in TIF reimbursement for eligible activities under the
proposed Plan.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of a single (1) parcel located at 751 Griswold Street
in Detroit’s Central Business District, bounded by West Lafayette Boulevard to the north, Griswold
Street to the east, the property line to the south and the property line to the west.
Basis of Eligibility
The property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because (a) the
property was previously utilized for a commercial purpose; (b) it is located within the City of Detroit,

 a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and (c) the Property is determined to be a
historic resource and functionally obsolete.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered “eligible
activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they included include demolition and asbestos
abatement, infrastructure improvements, site preparation, and development and preparation of
brownfield plan and/or work plan. The eligible activities and budgeted costs are intended as part
of the development of the Property and will be financed solely by the Developer. The Authority is
not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and will incur no debt.
Eligible activities commenced in October 2014 and completed in April 2017. The project is
requesting retroactive reimbursement on eligible activities due to an increase in budget and
timelines on the project as a result of numerus unforeseen circumstances. This included
identification of plaster behind the previous wall coverings (i.e. drywall, paneling), which was
determined to be asbestos containing. The asbestos containing materials were extensive and
required abatement throughout the entire building. Re-construction and stabilization of the
sidewalks surrounding the property, was required by the City of Detroit. During the start of
construction, the City determined the existing public sidewalks to be structurally unsound, which
required a full tear out and re-build of the infrastructure. In addition to the demolition and new
concrete that was required, this included re-engineering and construction of all the supports under
the sidewalk in the basement of the building, which extends under the public sidewalk space.
Relocation and replacement to existing utility lines were required as a result of the construction
on the sidewalk as well.
