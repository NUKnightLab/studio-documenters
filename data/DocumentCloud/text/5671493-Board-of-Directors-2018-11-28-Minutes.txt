B. Board Members' Remarks
Director Daddow gave remarks regarding yesterday's (November 27, 2018)
Asset Management/CIP Meeting, which was exceedingly well attended by the
communities.
Secretary Munfakh made inquiries regarding the location of the GLWA
Charges Roll Out meeting tomorrow (November 29, 2018) morning (10:30
a.m.), to which Suzanne Coffey, Chief Planning Officer, responded the
meeting is being held at the Troy Community Center.
Vice Chairman Baker inquired about the status of the WRAP and when the
ideas (Wayne Metro) are expected to come back to the Board of Directors, to
which Mr. Wolfson responded, by the end of the year (December 12, 2018
Board of Directors Workshop Meeting); however, Mr. Wolfson will have to
confirm that date.
Director Brown gave comments regarding the CEO's contract; his
disagreement with not disclosing the subject matter of closed sessions; the
arbitration process and his intention to recuse himself from closed session, as
well as his intention to make a Motion following today's Closed Session, so
that the public is aware that there may be action taken by the Board
following the Closed Session. However, Director Brown made a Motion, for
the record, that GLWA withdraw its arbitration demand and require the
administration to follow the process and protocol dictated by the lease
documents and the MOU regarding the GLWA's administration's alleged
disputes with DWSD. The Motion failed for lack of a Support.
Note: Director Brown will recuse himself from Closed Session and return to
the meeting under New Business (Cont'd) following today's Closed Session.
