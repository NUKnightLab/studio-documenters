A PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO ITEM 15-6257, A PROPOSED ORDINANCE
AMENDMENT TO THE PROPERTY TAX CLASSIFICATION SYTEM FOR ASSESSMENT
NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
74 - Taxation, Article II. Real Property Taxation, Division 2- Classification System for Assessment
Section 74-63(7) be amended as follows:
Sec. 74-63. - Assessment classes.
Real estate is divided into the following assessment classes:

***

(7) Class 6b. Real estate used primarily for industrial purposes, consisting of all newly constructed
buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property,
including the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are
substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified
land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal
square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such
proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the
improvements on the parcel.
a. An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or Resolution
expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that
the incentive provided by Class 6b is necessary for development to occur on that specific real
estate and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to
the Class 6b application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need
not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be
filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class
change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the
applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County, as the case
may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested.
b. A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested, whichever
is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the
County Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts.
c. Class 6b applications for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and other
structures must be made to the Assessor within one (1) year prior to the commencement of such
new construction or substantial rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 6b incentive. With respect to

 abandoned property, the Class 6b application must be made to the Assessor prior to the
commencement of the reoccupation of the vacant and unused property.
d. In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 6b,
unless:
1. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant and
unused prior to such purchase; or
2. There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and
unused for less than 24 continuous months.
The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included
in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. If the Ordinance
or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to
that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the
required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding
that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to
that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as
well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property
is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b
eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an
assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the
time of the Class 6b eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding
special circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the instance where real
estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the
County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of a Class 6b under the TEERM Program if there has been
no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least 12
continuous months. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class
6b application under the TEERM Program. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the
approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The
applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special
circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County
prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of
an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a
County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor,
but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the
class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the

 applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be,
confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program: In the instance where real estate does not meet the
definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case
may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed
"qualified" for purpose of Class 6b under the SER Program if:
1. The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same location for a
minimum of ten years prior to the date of application for the SER Program; and
2. The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of hardship supporting a
determination that participation in the SER Program is necessary for the industrial enterprise to
continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to be
in imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused; and.
3.The applicant is not receiving another Cook County property tax incentive for the same
property.
The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special circumstances, and a
determination that the applicant's participation in the SER Program is necessary for the industrial
enterprise to continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to be in
imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance
supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a
municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is
deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained.
The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special
circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County
prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"qualified" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of
an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a
County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for
purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor,
but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the
class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the
applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be,
confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program or SER Program under a Class 6b application must be received
by the Assessor's Office on or before November 30, 2018 to receive consideration.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Class 6b incentives
granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed
at the Class 6b site. In such reports, recipients shall be required to certify whether the industrial
enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application continues its operations at that
location. In addition, recipients of Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program shall be
required to report to the Assessor within 30 days if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at
the time of the SER application ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports will be

 forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of
the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within the time established by
the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.
Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application
ceases operations at that location, then the Class 6b incentive granted pursuant to the SER program shall
terminate.
