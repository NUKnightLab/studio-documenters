CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF SAINT CONSTANCE PARISH

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

October 5, 2016

WHEREAS, with the final approvals and blessings from the Bishop, Father Alexander Knitter was
appointed as the first pastor and was tasked with establishing the new parish and its community. Once the
Parish’s location was chosen at Lawrence and Central Avenues, renovations began while parishioners heard
their first Masses in the home of Valentine Wachowski at Lawrence and Long Avenues; and
WHEREAS, the Jefferson Park Community continued to develop at rapid rates and it was evident then that
St. Constance Parish would soon need larger facilities. A new site was obtained at Ainslie and Strong Streets
and on November 1, 1916 ground was broken for what would be the new church and a new school; and
WHEREAS, less than a year later, Archbishop George Mundelein presided over the dedication and Father
Knitter held the church’s first Mass in what is now the current home of St. Constance Parish at 5843 West
Strong Street, Chicago, Illinois. Within its first 30 years, the St. Constance Community grew to include
over 1,000 families; and
WHEREAS, during the community’s continuous growth, Parish societies were organized such as the
Original Polonia Club, Rosary Sodality, Holy Name Society, Handmaids of the Lord, Church Ushers and
the Saint Constance Choir. By the end of 1917, Sisters Mary Waltrudis, Mary Giovanna and Mary Martha
of the School Sisters of Notre Dame welcomed the first class of 72 students to the Saint Constance School;
and
WHEREAS, by 1937, the school had grown to include a full four-year high school known as Cardinal
Stritch High School. Following the passing of Father Knitter, Fr. Sylvester Wronka was appointed the
fourth pastor of St. Constance and under his leadership, a new convent was built in 1956 followed by a new
elementary school in 1959. Following in his footsteps, St. Constance’s fifth pastor, Fr. Handzel added to
the Parish’s legacy with the groundbreaking of what would later be the Handzel Social Center in 1967; and
WHEREAS, following the election of an administration, Finance Committee and re-developed Auxiliary
Ministries, the year 1973 brought the completion of a small meeting hall, science lab and school library. A
short time later, the Parish Athletic Association was founded; and
WHEREAS, St. Constance Parish who began with such humble beginnings in a small frame church and
90 families, has now grown to include a modern church, school, social center and over 1,600 families.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby
celebrate the Centennial Jubilee of the 100th Anniversary of Saint Constance Parish and all the efforts by
its Polish Catholic community and their supporters throughout their journey; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this text be spread upon the official proceedings of this Honorable
Body, and an official copy of same be presented to the St. Constance Parish leaders to commemorate this
milestone event.

BREAST CANCER AWARNESS MONTH
WHEREAS, the month of October is recognized as Breast Cancer Awareness Month; and
WHEREAS, in the United States about 1 in 8 women (about 12%) will develop invasive breast cancer over
the course of her lifetime; and
WHEREAS, in 2016, an estimated 246,660 new cases of invasive breast cancer were expected to be
diagnosed in women in the U.S., along with 61,000 new cases of non-invasive (in situ ) breast cancer; and
WHEREAS, about 2,600 new cases of invasive breast cancer were expected to be diagnosed in men in
2016. A man’s lifetime risk of breast cancer is about 1 in 1,000; and
WHEREAS, Breast cancer incidence rates in the U.S. began decreasing in the year 2000, after increasing
for the previous two (2) decades. They dropped by 7% from 2002 to 2003 alone; and
WHEREAS, one theory is that this decrease was partially due to the reduced use of hormone replacement
therapy (HRT) by woman after the results of a large study called the Women’s Health Initiative were
published in 2002. These results suggested a connection between HRT and increased breast cancer risk;
and
WHEREAS, about 40,450 women in the United States were expected to die in 2016 from breast cancer,
though death rates have been decreasing since 1989, with larger decreases in women under the age of 50.
These decreases are thought to be result of treatment advances, earlier detection through screening, and
increased awareness; and
WHEREAS, for women in the United States, breast cancer death rates are higher than those for any other
cancer, besides lung cancer; and

and Native-American women have a lower risk of developing and dying from breast cancer; and
WHEREAS, in 2016, there are more the 2.8 million women with a history of breast cancer in the United
States. This includes women currently being treated and women who have finished treatment.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Members of the Board of

Concurrences:
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook

Summary: The Circuit Court of Cook County will use this grant award from the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services to expand and enhance the Rehabilitation Alternative Probation (RAP) Drug
Court Program for men and the Women’s Rehabilitation Alternative Probation (WRAP) Drug Court
Program for women. The court’s goal is to increase the number and percentage of participants who
achieve stable recovery and graduate successfully from the programs. To achieve this goal, the court
proposes to expand and expedite client access to community-based residential substance abuse
treatments, incorporate new offender service elements, such as cognitive behavioral therapies and
medication treatments, and expand trauma support services.
The Circuit Court of Cook County established the RAP Drug Court Program for men in 1998 and the
WRAP program in 2001 to divert individuals with substance use disorders into treatment. The
RAP/WRAP Drug Court Program is currently one of the largest drug courts in Illinois, with
approximately 150 - 200 participants supervised each year.
Grant funds will be used to partially fund the salary and fringe benefits of a program research associate,
as well as to provide funds for community treatment services, supplies, training and travel and indirect
costs. Project funds will be available for an additional two years if satisfactory progress is demonstrated.

PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Department: Office of the State’s Attorney - Dept. 250
Request: requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer $91,000.00 from and to the
accounts listed below.
Reason: This transfer of funds, which represents less than one-tenth of one percent of our 2016 budget,
should be sufficient to fulfill our obligations for the remainder of the fiscal year for three accounts with
projected shortages. These accounts are: 250-217 Transportation for Specific Activities, where we have
seen higher than anticipated costs for bringing in witnesses from out of state and extraditing prisoners
from other jurisdictions; 250-232 Boarding and Lodging of Witnesses, primarily due to the cost of
relocating and protecting witnesses who are threatened; and 250-264, where expenditures for hiring
experts to testify in court have been slightly higher than projected
From Account(s): 250-190-Transportation and Other Travel Services, $25,000.00; 250-240-Printing
and Publishing, $10,000.00; 250-241-Internal Graphics and Reproduction Services, $15,000.00;
250-445-Operation of Auto Equipment, $40,000.00; 250-461-Maintenance of Facilities, $ $1,000.00.
To Account(s): 250-217-Trans Specific Activities, $41,000.00; 250-232-Lodging: Non-Employee,
$42,000.00; 250-264-Expert Witness, $8,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $91,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
53

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

October 5, 2016

was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On 7/1/2016, Account 217 had a balance of approximately $25,000.00; on 6/1/2016 the balance was
approximately $115,000.00.
On 7/1/2016, Account 232 had a balance of approximately $8,000.00; on 6/1/2016 the balance was
approximately $10,000.00.
On 8/1/2016, Account 264 had a balance of approximately $14,000.00; on 7/1/2016 the balance was
approximately $30,000.00.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
These were the accounts, based on current year to date spending and known obligations, which were
projected as most likely to have remaining balances at year end.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Although spending fluctuates from year to year in many accounts, our original budget requests were
based on our best projections at that time.

was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On 9/1 the balance in account 388 was approximately $2,000.00; on 8/1 it was approximately
$25,000.00.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
This is the account which we expect would have a significant balance at year end.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The original appropriation was in anticipation of contracts for software maintenance and support which
we now know will not take effect until FY 2017.

Summary: Currently, the Department of Animal and Rabies Control (“DARC”) relies upon an aging
mainframe solution and isolated manual processes to manage documents and content related to its
departmental mandates. The proposed system aims to replace legacy operations with a robust Enterprise
Content Management (“ECM”) platform that is scalable and will grow with DARC’s business needs. The
ECM is also accompanied by a Responsive Design Web Portal that will render across mobile and desktop
devices and transform cumbersome manual processes into automated online services for customers.
The ECM will achieve additional efficiencies by adopting BOT’s Hyland OnBase software standard,
which will provide a centralized solution for managing DARC’s internal operations.
This is a Comparable Government Procurement pursuant to Section 34-140 of the Cook County
Procurement Code. Hyland Software, Inc. was previously awarded a contract through a Request for
Proposals (RFP) process by the state of Ohio. Cook County wishes to leverage.

THE HONORABLE BRIDGET GAINER, JESÚS G. GARCÍA, LUIS ARROYO JR.,
RICHARD R. BOYKIN, JOHN P. DALEY, JOHN A. FRITCHEY, DEBORAH SIMS,
ROBERT B. STEELE AND LARRY SUFFREDIN, COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
ESTABLISHING EARNED SICK LEAVE FOR EMPLOYEES IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of government pursuant to the 1970 Illinois
Constitution, Article VII, Section 6 (a); and
WHEREAS, pursuant to their home rule powers, the Cook County Commissioners may exercise any power
and perform any function relating to their governments and affairs, including the power to regulate for the
protection of the public health, safety, morals and welfare; and
WHEREAS, employees in every industry occasionally require time away from the workplace to tend to
their own health or the health of family members; and
WHEREAS, in Cook County approximately 40 percent, or 840,000, private sector workers receive no paid
sick leave; and
WHEREAS, earned sick leave has a positive effect on the health of not only employees and their family
members, but also the health of fellow workers and public at large and the most comprehensive national
135

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

October 5, 2016

survey of United States restaurant workers found that two-thirds of restaurant wait staff and cooks have
come to work sick; and
WHEREAS, earned sick leave reduces healthcare expenditures by promoting access to primary and
preventative care and reduces reliance on emergency care; and
WHEREAS, nationally providing all workers with earned sick leave would result in $1.1 billion in annual
savings in hospital emergency department costs; and
WHEREAS, nearly one (1) in four (4) American women report domestic violence by an intimate partner,
nearly one (1) in five (5) women have been raped, and nearly one (1) in six (6) women have been stalked.
Many workers, men and women, need time off to care for themselves after these incidents, or to find
solutions, such as protective orders or new housing, to avoid or prevent further domestic or sexual violence.
Without paid time off, employees are in grave danger of losing their jobs, which can be devastating when
victims need economic security to ensure their own safety and that of their children; and
WHEREAS, at least 28 local jurisdictions have enacted Earned Sick Leave including Chicago, New York
City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Jersey City and Seattle; and
WHEREAS, a cost model developed by the Civic Consulting Alliance found that a paid sick leave
framework similar to the one reflected in this Ordinance would result in only a small, 0.7 to 1.5 increase in
labor costs for most employers.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter
42 Human Relations, Article 1 In General, Sections 42-1 through 42-6 of the Cook County Code is hereby
enacted as follows:
Sec. 42-1. Short title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the Cook County Earned Sick Leave Ordinance
(“Ordinance”).

of any state, domestic partner, parent, spouse or domestic partner's parent, sibling, grandparent, grandchild,
or any other individual related by blood or whose close association with the Covered Employee is the
equivalent of a family relationship. A child includes not only a biological relationship, but also a
relationship resulting from an adoption, step-relationship, and/or foster care relationship, or a child to whom
the Covered Employee stands in loco parentis. A parent includes a biological, foster, stepparent or adoptive
parent or legal guardian of a Covered Employee, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the Employee
was a minor child.
Health Care Provider means any person licensed to provide medical or emergency services,
including, but not limited to doctors, nurses, and emergency room personnel.
Sec. 42-3. Earned sick leave.
(a)General Provisions
(1)

Any Covered Employee who works at least 80 hours for an Employer within any
120-day period shall be eligible for Earned Sick Leave as provided under this
Section.

(2)

Unless an applicable collective bargaining agreement provides otherwise, upon a
Covered Employee’s termination, resignation, retirement or other separating from
employment, his or her Employer is not required to provide financial or other
reimbursement for unused Earned Sick Leave.

(b)Accrual of Earned Sick Leave
(1)

Earned Sick Leave shall begin to accrue either on the 1st calendar day after the
commencement of a Covered Employee’s employment or on the effective date of
this Ordinance, whichever is later.

(2)

For every 40 hours worked after a Covered Employee’s Earned Sick Leave
begins to accrue, he or she shall accrue one hour of Earned Sick Leave. Earned
Sick Leave shall accrue only in hourly increments; there shall be no fractional
accruals.

(3)

A Covered Employee who is exempt from overtime requirements shall be assumed
to work 40 hours in each workweek for purposes of Earned Sick Leave accrual,
unless his or her normal work week is less than 40 hours, in which case Earned
Sick Leave shall accrue based upon that normal work week.

(4)

For each Covered Employee, there shall be a cap of 40 hours Earned Sick Leave
accrued per 12-month period, unless his or her Employer sets a higher limit. The
12-month period for a Covered Employee shall be calculated from the date he or
she began to accrue Earned Sick Leave.

138

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

October 5, 2016

(5)

At the end of a Covered Employee’s 12-month accrual period, he or she shall be
allowed to carry over to the following 12-month period half of his or her unused
accrued Earned Sick Leave, up to a maximum of 20 hours.

(6)

If an Employer is subject to the Family and Medical Leave Act, each of the
Employer's Covered Employees shall be allowed, at the end of his or her 12-month
Earned Sick Leave accrual period, to carry over up to 40 hours of his or her unused
accrued Earned Sick Leave, in addition to the carryover allowed under subsection
42-3(b)(5), to use exclusively for Family and Medical Leave Act eligible purposes.

(7)

If an Employer has a policy that grants Covered Employees paid time off in an
amount and a manner that meets the requirements for Earned Sick Leave under
this Section, the Employer is not required to provide additional paid leave. If such
Employer's policy awards the full complement of paid time off immediately upon
date of eligibility, rather than using an accrual model, the Employer must award
each Covered Employee 40 hours paid time off within one calendar year of his or
her date of eligibility.

(c)Use of Earned Sick Leave
(1)

An Employer shall allow a Covered Employee to begin using Earned Sick Leave
no later than on the 180th calendar day following the commencement of his or her
employment. A Covered Employee is entitled to use no more than 40 hours of
Earned Sick Leave per 12-month period, unless his or her Employer sets a higher
limit. The 12-month period for a Covered Employee shall be calculated from the
date he or she began to accrue Earned Sick Leave. If a Covered Employee carries
over 40 hours of Family and Medical Leave Act leave pursuant to subsection 423(b)(6) and uses that leave, he or she is entitled to use no more than an additional
20 hours of accrued Earned Sick Leave in the same 12 month period, unless the
Employer sets a higher limit. A Covered Employee shall be allowed to determine
how much accrued Earned Sick Leave he or she needs to use, provided that his or
her Employer may set a reasonable minimum increment requirement not to exceed
four hours per day.

(2)

A Covered Employee may use Earned Sick Leave when:
a.

He or she is ill or injured, or for the purpose of receiving medical care,
treatment, diagnosis or preventative medical care;

b.

A member of his or her family is ill or injured, or to care for a family
member receiving medical care, treatment, diagnosis or preventative
medical care;

c.

He or she, or a member of his or her family, is the victim of domestic
violence, as defined in Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act
of 1986, or is the victim of sexual violence or stalking as defined in Article
139

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

October 5, 2016

11, and Sections 12-7.3. 12-7.4. and 12-7.5 of the Illinois Criminal Code
of 2012; or
d.

His or her place of business is closed by order of a public official due to a
public health emergency, or he or she needs to care for a child whose
school or place of care has been closed by order of a public official due to
a public health emergency. For the purposes of this section, “public health
emergency” is an event that is defined as such by a Federal, State or Local
government, including a school district.

(3)

An Employer shall not require, as a condition of a Covered Employee taking
Earned Sick Leave that he or she search for or find a replacement worker to cover
the hours during which he or she is on Earned Sick Leave.

(4)

If a Covered Employee’s need for Earned Sick Leave is reasonably foreseeable, an
Employer may require up to seven days' notice before leave is taken. If the need
for Earned Sick Leave is not reasonably foreseeable, an Employer may require a
Covered Employee to give notice as soon as is practicable on the day the Covered
Employee intends to take Earned Sick Leave by notifying the Employer via phone,
e-mail, or text message. The Employer may set notification policy if the Employer
has notified Covered Employee in writing of such policy and that policy shall not
be unreasonably burdensome. For purposes of this subsection, needs that are
"reasonably foreseeable" include, but are not limited to prescheduled appointments
with health care providers for the Covered Employee or for a family member, and
court dates in domestic violence cases. Any notice requirement imposed by an
Employer pursuant to this subsection shall be waived in the event a Covered
Employee is unable to give notice because he or she is unconscious, or otherwise
medically incapacitated. If the leave is one that is covered under the Family and
Medical Leave Act, notice shall be in accordance with the Family and Medical
Leave Act.

(5)

Where a Covered Employee is absent for more than three consecutive work days,
his or her Employer may require certification that the use of Earned Sick Leave
was authorized under subsection 42-3(c)(2). For time used pursuant to subsections
(c)(2)(a) or (b), documentation signed by a licensed health care provider shall
satisfy this requirement. An Employer shall not require that such documentation
specify the nature of the Covered Employee's or the Covered Employee's family
member's injury, illness, or condition, except as required by law. For Earned Sick
Leave used pursuant to subsection (c)(2)(c) a police report, court document, a
signed statement from an attorney, a member of the clergy, or a victim services
advocate, or any other evidence that supports the Covered Employee's claim,
including a written statement from him or her, or any other person who has
knowledge of the circumstances, shall satisfy this requirement. The Covered
Employee may choose which document to submit, and no more than one document
shall be required if the Earned Sick Leave is related to the same incident of
violence or the same perpetrator. The Employer shall not delay the commencement
of Earned Sick Leave taken for one of the purposes in subsection 42-3(c)(2) nor
140

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

October 5, 2016

delay payment of wages, on the basis that the Employer has not yet received the
required certification.
(6)

Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prohibit an Employer from taking
disciplinary action, up to and including termination, against a Covered Employee
who uses Earned Sick Leave for purposes other than those described in this
Section.

(7)

This Section provides minimum Earned Sick Leave requirements; it shall not be
construed to affect the applicability of any other law, regulation, requirement,
policy, or standard that provides for greater Earned Sick Leave benefits.

Sec. 42-5. Application to collective bargaining agreements.
Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to interfere with, impede, or in any way diminish the
right of Covered Employees to bargain collectively with their Employers through representatives of their
own choosing in order to establish wages or other conditions of work in excess of the applicable minimum
standards of the provisions of this Ordinance. The requirements of this Ordinance may be waived in a bona
fide collective bargaining agreement, but only if the waiver is set forth explicitly in such agreement in clear
and unambiguous terms. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to affect the validity or change the
terms of bona fide collective bargaining agreements in force on the effective date of this Ordinance. After
that date, requirements of this Ordinance may be waived in a bona fide collective bargaining agreement,
but only if the waiver is set forth explicitly in such agreement in clear and unambiguous terms. In no event
shall this Ordinance apply to any Covered Employee working in the Construction Industry who is covered
by a bona fide collective bargaining agreement.
Sec. 42-6. Notice and posting.
(a)Every Employer shall post in a conspicuous place at each facility where any Covered Employee
works that is located within the geographic boundaries of Cook County a notice advising the Covered
Employee of his or her rights to Earned Sick Time under this Ordinance. The Agency shall prepare and
make available a form notice that satisfies the requirements of this Ordinance. Employers that do not
maintain a business facility within the geographic boundaries of the County are exempt from this
subsection.
(b)Every Employer shall provide to a Covered Employee at the commencement of employment
written notice advising the Covered Employee of his or her rights to Earned Sick Time under this Ordinance.
The Agency shall prepare and make available a form notice that satisfies the requirements of this Ordinance.
Sec. 42-7. Retaliation prohibited.
It shall be unlawful for any Employer to discriminate in any manner or take any adverse action
against any Covered Employee in retaliation for exercising, or attempting in good faith to exercise, any
right under this Ordinance, including, but not limited to, disclosing, reporting, or testifying about any
violation of this Ordinance or regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section, prohibited
adverse actions include, but are not limited to, unjustified termination, unjustified denial of promotion,
unjustified negative evaluations, punitive schedule changes, punitive decreases in the desirability of work
141

assignments, and other acts of harassment shown to be linked to such exercise of rights. An Employer shall
not use its absence-control policy to count Earned Sick Leave as an absence that triggers discipline,
discharge, demotion, suspension, or any other adverse activity.
Sec. 42-8. Enforcement and penalties.
(a)The Agency shall administer and enforce this Ordinance in accordance with Chapter 42, Article
II, Section 42-34 of the Cook County Human Rights Ordinance, except as allowed for in subsection (b) of
this Section.
(b)If any Employer violates any of the Earned Sick Leave provisions in this Ordinance, the affected
Covered Employee may recover in a civil action damages equal to three times the full amount of any unpaid
Sick Leave denied or lost by reason of the violation, and the interest on that amount calculated at the
prevailing rate, together with costs and such reasonable attorney’s fees as the court allows. Such action may
be brought without first filing an administrative complaint. The statute of limitations for a civil action
brought pursuant to this Ordinance shall be for a period of three years from the date of the last event
constituting the alleged violation for which the action is brought.
Sec. 42-9. Effect of invalidity; severability.
If any section, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase or other portion of this local law is,
for any reason, declared unconstitutional or invalid, in whole or in part, by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed severable, and such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not
affect the validity of the remaining portions of this local law, which remaining portions shall continue in
full force and effect.
Sec. 42-10. After passage and publication, this Ordinance shall take effect on July 1, 2017.
Effective Date: This Ordinance shall take effect on July 1, 2017

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AN AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY AMUSEMENT TAX
WHEREAS, it is the intent of the County Board to recognize and encourage both the artists who add to
our cultural identity as well as the venues that allow them to display their talents to crowds from around the
County and around the world by exempting them from the City and County’s amusement tax for live
performances; and
WHEREAS, it is not the role of government to restrictively decide and define what is and is not ‘music’;
and
WHEREAS, to single out one or any type of music genre performed at these types of venues as not
applicable to the small venue exemption clause is not in the spirit or purpose of the exemption clause nor
the expansive definition of music;
WHEREAS, as the recording industry and music genres have evolved, the National Academy of Recording
Arts and Sciences has recognized although sometimes more slowly than society at large, that new music
genres evolve and form, such as Rock, Rap, Reggae, Metal, Roots, Electronica, New Age etc.; and
WHEREAS, DJ’s have been considered an art form for many years now and in fact the National Academy
of Recording Arts and Sciences’ Grammy Awards created the Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year,
Non-Classical at the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998 to recognize an individual(s) who takes previously
recorded material and adds or alters it in such a way as to create a new and unique performance; and
WHEREAS, the first Grammy Award for such category was presented to Chicago’s very own Frankie
Knuckles whose key role in developing and popularizing House music into an internationally recognized
musical genre during the 1980s led to him being referred to as the "The Godfather of House Music."; and
WHEREAS, in 1998, the Cook County Board created an exemption to the Amusement Tax for small
venues with a maximum capacity of not more than 750 persons, and in 1999 the County Board further
amended said ordinance by defining live performances by examples giving several genre examples and art
forms including live musical performances, but does not restrict it to only those examples by including the
encompassing term “music”; and
WHEREAS, the current language contained in the County Code has created unintended and unnecessary
confusion as to what constitutes ‘music’ and has created undue burdens on venue operators who are being
required to comply with inconsistent definitions, restrictions and exemptions by the County and the City of
Chicago; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
74 Taxation, Article X, Amusement Tax, Sections 74-391 and 74-392 of the Cook County Code of
Ordinances are hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 74-391. - Definitions.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

musical presentations ("artistic societies or organizations"), if the artistic society or
organization:
1.

Receives substantial support from voluntary contributions;

2.

Is a not-for-profit institution where no part of the net earnings inure to the
benefit of any private shareholder or person; and

3.

Either (i) bears all risk of financial loss from its presentation of the amusement,
where the amusement takes place at a venue that is owned or operated by a notfor-profit institution, no part of whose net earnings inure to the benefit of any
private shareholder or person, and where the amusement is limited to an
engagement of not more than four calendar days over the course of a calendar
year, or (ii) is substantially and materially involved in the production and
performance of the amusement. Where an amusement is sponsored or
conducted by two or more artistic societies or organizations, the requirements

(c)None of the exemptions contained in subsection (b)(3) of this section shall be granted

amusement event or 15 calendar days prior to the date that admission tickets to the amusement are first
made available for sale, whichever is earlier. The application shall be on a form prescribed by the Director

more than 750 persons.
a. For purposes of subsection (d)(1), the Department will assume that the activities of
the DJ qualify as a live cultural performance where both of the following conditions
exist:
1. The pre-recorded material used by the DJ was recorded by the DJ. This may be
original work composed by the DJ or the work of other artists that the DJ has mixed
or otherwise modified.

147

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

October 5, 2016

2. The DJ is paid substantially above the rate that would be paid solely for the service
of playing the pre-recorded material of other artists. The Department will assume
that the payment of $2,000 or more for a single performance qualifies the event for
this provision.
b. Where the activities of a DJ do not qualify for the provision set forth in Subsection
(d)(1)a. 1. and 2. of this section, they may nevertheless qualify as a live cultural
performance if at least four of the five following factors apply:
1. The DJ is featured in advertisements for the venue.
2. The DJ is visible to patrons of the venue, who spend a substantial amount of time
observing the DJ’s performance.
3. The DJ is featured more prominently than other amusements or activities available
at the venue.
4. The patrons are charged substantially above the amount that would be paid for
entry into the venue in the absence of the DJ. For purposes of this provision, the
term “substantially above” means at least one and a half times the amount that
would be charged without the DJ.
5. The DJ is represented by a manager and/or agent.
(2) Initiation fees and membership dues paid to a health club, racquetball club, tennis club
or a similar club or organization, when such club or organization is organized and
operated on a membership basis and for the recreational purposes of its members and
its members' guests, shall be exempt from the tax imposed in subsection (a) of this
section. This exemption shall not be construed to apply to any fees paid or based upon
a per-event or a per-admission basis.
(3) Fees or other charges paid by a patron for the privilege of witnessing, viewing or
participating in an amusement, solely within the confines of such patron's home, shall
be exempt from the imposition of the tax imposed in subsection (a) of this section. For
purposes of this exemption, the term "home" means the permanent dwelling residence
of the patron. For patrons who live in condominium buildings, apartment buildings or
other multiple-unit structures, the individual dwelling unit the patron occupies shall be
considered the patron's home.
(e)For the purpose of determining the amount of the amusement tax due under this article,
admission fees or other charges shall be computed exclusive of:
(1) Any Federal, State or municipal taxes imposed upon the amusement patron.
(2) Any amounts subject to other Cook County taxes (with the exception of County
Retailers' Occupation Tax), provided such County taxes are separately listed on the
148

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

ticket of admission and the corresponding Cook County tax has been paid on that
separately stated amount.
(3) Any separately stated optional charges for nonamusement services or for sales of
tangible personal property.
(f)It is unlawful for any person to produce, present or conduct any amusement without
collection of the tax, except as provided in this article.
(1) The rate of the tax imposed in subsection (a) of this section shall be one percent of the
admission fees or other charges to witness in person live theatrical, live musical or other
live cultural performances that take place in any auditorium, theater or other space in
the County whose maximum capacity, including all balconies and other sections, is
more than 750 persons and less than 5,000 persons.
(2) The rate of the tax imposed in subsection (a) of this section shall be 1.5 percent of the
admission fees or other charges to witness in person live theatrical, live musical or other
live cultural performances that take place in any auditorium, theater or other space in
the County whose maximum capacity, including all balconies and other sections, is
5,000 persons or more.
(g)It shall be presumed that all amusements are subject to tax under this article until the
contrary is established by books, records or other documentary evidence.
(h)It is unlawful for any person to produce, present, conduct, or resell tickets to, any
amusement without collection of the tax, except as provided in this article.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.
