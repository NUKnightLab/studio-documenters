How's everybody doing?

All

5

right.

6

wanted to talk about Rialmo, you know, and how

7

I just really don't think Rialmo is for the

8

community.

9

So, you know, today I just

I do not think that this man who

10

actually was able to kill two people in one

11

incident should be a civilian police officer.

12

It's clear to me that his

13

military training has taught him that the first

14

response is to kill.

15

him how to kill multiple people in a single

16

incident.

17

And it has also taught

Now, me and my boy here argued

18

over whether or not I was right or the cops are

19

right when they say that Rialmo should be, you

20

know -- not exonerated, but at least --

21

BOARD MEMBER O'MALLEY:

22

MS. NOEL:

Justified.

worth two lives, nobody.

to shoot knowing that he could harm another

individual.

Right?

To take full, 100 percent

And Rialmo didn't care about Bettie.
And he saw her.

He
He

And he decided to make the decision

And in his head he thought he was

10

worth two people's lives.

He thought he was

11

worth two people's lives.

He didn't think that

12

he could sacrifice himself for Bettie.

13

I mean if I'm a police officer, and I'm looking

14

at something, and I can see that I may shoot

15

someone else trying to get this one person, I

16

would think to myself, Well, I may have to

17

sacrifice myself, because I'm going to hurt and

18

could possibly harm these other people.

Ms. Roberts, in regards to

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

11

 Police Board Public Meeting - May 17, 2018

1

the Rialmo shooting, did COPA seek out the

2

expert advice of any outside witnesses that

3

deemed it a good shooting?

4

MS. ROBERTS:

I'm still being briefed on

5

that case.

6

answering that question.

7

I'm not sure I'm comfortable

MR. CATANZARA:

The case, as far as COPA is

8

concerned, is already closed.

9

you anymore.

It is not before

It's before them.

I'm asking as

10

far as COPA's investigation, did they seek

11

outside expert witnesses who deemed it a good

12

shoot?

13

MS. ROBERTS:

What I'm telling you is, I'm

14

in the process of still being briefed on that

15

case.

16

so I got a summary of the case, but I have not

17

read all of the details of that particular

18

case, so it's not something that I'm

19

comfortable answering right now.

20
21

That case was closed before I got there,

MR. CATANZARA:

Can you give me an answer

next month?

22

MS. ROBERTS:

23

MR. CATANZARA:

24

Certainly.
Thank you.

12

 Police Board Public Meeting - May 17, 2018

1

As far as the merit promotions are concerned,

2

is there a reason why Steven Maris gets to make

3

merit promotion suggestions when he is not even

4

a sworn officer and has no knowledge of any of

5

people he is nominating for merit promotions?

6

MR. WALLER:

Every exempt member -- and he

7

is thought -- even though he is a civilian,

8

he's an exempt member, so they get that chance

9

to make that type of request.

That's something

10

that can be reviewed probably by the

11

Superintendent.

12

made so far.

13

But that's the choices they

MR. CATANZARA:

Okay.

I expected that.

14

But wouldn't it be logical to determine that

15

anybody of exempt rank that's making a

16

nomination for a merit promotion should have

17

some working knowledge of the officer that they

18

are putting forward?

19

MR. WALLER:

That's why -- you have to have

20

worked for them, or you have to write a letter

21

to say that you have some knowledge of this

22

person.

23

with that packet.

24

There's a prerequisite that goes along

MR. CATANZARA:

Is that open knowledge or

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 Police Board Public Meeting - May 17, 2018

1

is that a Freedom of Information request that

2

we -- do we get to see that stuff?

3

know.

4

MR. WALLER:

I'd love to

That part I don't know.

But I

5

know that there's a letter that you have to put

6

in that packet, and either he worked for you in

7

a certain period of time or that you have some

8

knowledge of that.

dangerous dog was shot in the leg.

7

is much smaller than a human being's head or

chest or back, but when it comes to human

9

beings, it seems that officers fear for their

11

Now, they're trained to shoot.

12

They have on bulletproof vests.

14

because they are scared, and they fear for

2

their safety when it's their job to go into

3

dangerous situations.

4

they just need another kind of employment.

5

And if they're scared,

So we're having these meetings

coming up, the five meetings in the future, I

suggest that you consider that.

these scared officers that fear for their

Blessings.

You know

16

it's amazing, you all sit here with your ass in

17

green and your hundred-thousand-dollar salaries

18

and just ain't got a damn clue about what's

19

happening in these streets.

20

I find it appalling that you

21

graduated another whole crew with not even a

22

handful of darkies among those cadets.

23
24

I'm still waiting on the hundred
dollar turn-in, after you all use the concept
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

16

 Police Board Public Meeting - May 17, 2018

1

to open up a gun turn-in for the first week of

2

June, when folks should be able to turn in guns

3

every day of the year if they choose to.

4

$100 is a small price to pay for

5

these black lives, but I know it's big business

6

that's flowing through these urban streets into

7

my village.

8

10

We could have had about ten more
guns in had you compensated us so we can send
the message out on the street.

11

I want to know who it is I would

12

need to speak to about your discrepancy or your

13

hearing, because what I put on the mic and what

14

shows up on my camera is not what shows up in

15

your minutes.

16

So we have a continuation of two

17

years of deceptive practice that does not show

18

up in those public comments.

19

I'd like to suggest that the

20

public comments are placed in the blue book.

21

I'd like to recommend that we are able to sign

up online.
