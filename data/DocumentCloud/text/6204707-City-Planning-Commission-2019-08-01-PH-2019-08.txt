NOTICE OF PUBLIC DISCUSSION

A public discussion will be held by the City Planning Commission in the Committee of the
Whole Room, 131" ?oor of the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center, 2 Woodward Avenue,
Detroit, Michigan 48226 on

THURSDAY. AUGUST ?12019 AT 5:20 PM

to consider an amendment to Chapter 44 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, Public Lodging, Article
1, De?nitions, and Division 2, Requirements Applicable to Public Lodging Houses, of the 1984
Detroit City Code in order to de?ne and regulate hostels.

This proposed ordinance is the second of two ordinances related to hostels, the ?rst being
the amendment to the Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 61 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, which is the
subject of the August 15? 5:15 PM public hearing. Hostels are newly de?ned in the proposed
Chapter 44 amendment as a type of public lodging house.

Ten of the 14 provisions related uniquely to hostels that are proposed to be deleted in the
Zoning Ordinance are incorporated into this proposed amendment to Chapter 44. Four of the 14
provisions are modi?ed as follows:

0 The maximum length of an individual?s stay is increased from 14 to 17 days; the 21-day
minimum between stays of repeat visitors remains unchanged.

0 The speci?cations for identi?cation signs for hostels are repealed; the generally
applicable sign regulations stated in Chapter 3 of the Detroit City Code will apply.

0 The ?rule of conduct" prohibiting controlled substances and alcohol on the premises is
not preserved.

- The expectation of a hostel?s af?liation with a national or international hostel association
within one year of opening is deleted.

Two provisions related to public lodging houses in general are modi?ed:

0 The prohibition against bunk beds is deleted.
0 Interior paint color speci?cations are deleted.

This amendment to Chapter 44 of the City Code contains the substantive provisions relative to
hostels that are cross-referenced in the Zoning Ordinance text amendment, which is the subject
of the August 15?, 5:15 PM statutory public hearing.
