RESOLUTION REGARDING THE REGULATION OF SIGNS APPROVED AND
ADOPTED JANUARY 20, 1999 (PROPOSED RESOLUTION AMENDMENT).
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Herbert T. Schumann, Jr., County
Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
AMENDING THE RESOLUTION REGARDING THE REGULATION OF SIGNS
APPROVED AND ADOPTED JANUARY 20, 1999
Whereas, the regulation and zoning control of signs in the unincorporated areas
of Cook County were adopted eveF almost twenty-five years ago; and
Whereas, numerous conflicts have developed over the years between the
growth and development of the unincorporated areas and areas under municipal
authority, and the proliferation of signs, particularly large advertising signs; and
Whereas, signs permitted under the 1976 Cook County Zoning Ordinance are
now considered out of place, particularly in areas attempting to preserve scenic and
aesthetic assets; and
Whereas, a comprehensive amendment to Article 12 of the Cook County Zoning
Ordinance has been proposed and introduced for consideration by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners; and
Whereas, the proposed amendments have been referred to the Committee on
Zoning for public hearing and comment, which process ts was expected to take several
months to complete; and
Whereas, these proposed sign regulations have yet to be considered by the
Committee on Zoning and Building; and
Whereas, the proposed sign regulations will substantially amend the size and
location permitted for many signs, and will make certain signs non-conforming subject to
amortization and removal; and
Whereas, the ongoing issuanoe of building permits and/or zoning relief under the
existing zoning ordinanoe undermines the ability of Cook County to effeotively regulate
the proliferation of oonflioting signs throughout the uninoorporatod areas of Cook
County.
Whereas the moratorium on the issuance of permits for advertising signs has
been effective in limiting the proliferation of advertising signs. however. businesses in
unincorporated Cook County are seeking zoning relief for the replacement and
modernization of on premises advertising signs;
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS:
1.
From the date of adoption of this Resolution and until review of the
comprehensive amendment to Article 12 of the Cook County Zoning Ordinance has
been completed, there shall be a moratorium on the issuance of any and all permits for
the construction, expansion or relocation of all signs or for zoning relief as regulated by
Article 12 of the 1976 Cook County Zoning Ordinance.
2.
The Commissioner of Building and Zoning shall, upon sufficient evidence
submitted by an applicant, have the authority to issue a permit for replacement of sign(s)
located on and within the premises of a business or property owner where such sign(s)
existed prior to the moratorium and which have come into disrepair due to damage by
weather conditions, accident, intentional acts of vandalism, eF in instances where the
business at which the existing sign is located has changed, or in instances in which the
property or business owner deems that an existing on premises sign no longer
appropriately projects the quality of the business and where. due to the age and
deterioration of construction materials used, such sign(s) detract from the value of the
business property. The issuance of a permit for the replacement of previously existing
signs shall be only for restricted to applications for those on premises signs not requiring
a variation from , and that meet the requirements of, the 1976 Cook County Zoning
Ordinance.

3.
The Commissioner of Building and Zoning shall take appropriate steps to
inform the Zoning Administrator and the Zoning Board of Appeals of this relief under
the moratorium.
4. If, upon the expiration of six months from the date of adoption of this amended
moratorium, review of the proposed amendments to Article 12 has not been concluded ,
tAe this amended moratorium hereby imposed shall be reviewed and the County Board
shall determine whether a basis exists to extend the moratorium for a further period of
time.

*The next regularly scheduled meeting is presently set for Tuesday, June 19, 2001.
