Communications and Stakeholder Engagement Plan

•5-47
4-9

 ABOUT THE PROCESS
•

We will use the Communication &
Stakeholder Engagement Plan to educate
our stakeholders about the Hyperloop
System.

•

NOACA will fully develop outreach
activities as part of a comprehensive public
involvement process.

•

Seek the assistance of several MPOs,
government and public organizations
located within the project corridor to carry
out these activities.

 PHASE 2: SITE RECONNAISSANCE AND
PRELIMINARY ROUTE ANALYSIS
TRACKMAN™
identified the
capital costs for
each route.

TRACKMAN™ and
LOCOMOTION™ assessed the
speed of Hyperloop technology
along different routes.

 PHASE 2: SITE RECONNAISSANCE AND
PRELIMINARY ROUTE ANALYSIS

Alternative 1 – Connects Cleveland with Chicago on as close to a
straight line as possible. This includes two sections of alignment
underneath the lakes.
5-47

 PHASE 2: SITE RECONNAISSANCE AND
PRELIMINARY ROUTE ANALYSIS

Alternative 2 – Originally utilized the existing highway alignment, but it
proved to be too curvy for Hyperloop. A new alignment was developed
following the Ohio and Indiana Turnpikes, but not confined to the geometry
of the existing highway.
.

 PHASE 2: SITE RECONNAISSANCE AND
PRELIMINARY ROUTE ANALYSIS

Alternative 3 –This proposed route would utilize several sections of very
straight existing rail and highway segments as well as new alignment.
