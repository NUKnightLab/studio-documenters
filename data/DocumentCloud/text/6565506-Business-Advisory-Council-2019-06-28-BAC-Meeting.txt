Business Advisory Council Meeting
March 22, 2019
NOACA Offices
1299 Superior Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44114
Present: Please see the attached attendance record.
Mr. Nate Kelly, Chair of the Business Advisory Council (BAC), convened the meeting at
9:00 a.m.
Meeting Minutes
Ms. Virginia Benjamin asked that her title be corrected (from Mr. to Ms.) on the first page
of the minutes.
A motion was made by Mr. Don Romancak to approve the minutes of the BAC meeting
held on December 7, 2018, with the above-referenced change. The motion was seconded
by Ms. Benjamin. The motion passed by voice vote.
Public Comments
No public comments were made at this meeting.
Executive Director’s Report
Ms. Grace Gallucci welcomed members to the first BAC meeting of this year. She
discussed the importance of the Council’s work.
Ms. Gallucci recognized Mr. Kelly as the Chair of BAC this year. She mentioned that
Mr. Kelly previously served as a NOACA Board alternate.
Ms. Gallucci talked about Ohio’s gas tax and the inequity of the current formulas. She
noted that the current gas tax is not enough to support the transportation needs in
Northeast Ohio.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the current formulas provide ODOT with 60% and local
governments with 40% of the revenue. She noted that the state’s debt service from
existing bonds is taken off the top of the revenue, thereby making ODOT’s share seem
more like 70% and local governments’ share seem more like 30%. She mentioned that
the 30% is divided up between counties, municipalities and townships; of that 30%, 37%
is split equally among 88 counties, 42% is split among municipalities, and 21% is split
among townships. She said the formula for municipalities is based on registrations and
the formula for townships is based on registrations and lane miles.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that NOACA has put forward a resolution that speaks to the needs
of the region and supports Governor Mike DeWine’s gas tax proposal. She stated that

8180s
1-1

 more needs to be done to address the local needs in this region. She said the 70% given
to ODOT is used to address the needs of interstates and state routes in rural areas, but
not the state routes in urban areas. She noted that based on the current gas tax of 28
cents per gallon, the NOACA region gets back $75 million out of $1.8 billion. She said the
state needs two to three times the proposed gas tax increase of 18 cents in order to meet
local needs. She noted that if the current formulas were based on vehicle miles traveled
(VMT), Northeast Ohio would get approximately $101 million. She mentioned that the 18
cent increase would generate $1.2 billion, out of which the City of Cleveland would get $9
million.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that State Senator Sandra Williams introduced an amendment to
include a VMT-based formula in the state transportation bill. Unfortunately, the
amendment did not make it into the bill.
Mr. Bill Koehler asked if the gas tax increase of 18 cents per gallon was included in
Governor DeWine’s proposal.
Ms. Gallucci said yes and noted that the Ohio House proposed a 10.7 cent increase;
changed the local share from 60% / 40% to 55% / 45%; decided not to have debt service
taken off the top; and approved $100 million for public transit. She noted that Governor
DeWine proposed $7 million for public transit and the Ohio Senate proposed a 6 cent gas
tax increase. Ms. Gallucci stated that unless the formulas for the local share are changed,
Northeast Ohio will continue to pay for roads in other regions.
Mr. Romancak asked how much money is being exported from Northeast Ohio to other
areas of the state. Ms. Gallucci said $150 million. She stated that NOACA and the
chambers of commerce need to work together to address the inequity of the current
formulas in order to maintain the roads in this region.
Chair’s Report
Mr. Kelly stated that he wanted to be the Chair of BAC this year because of issues like the
one discussed by Ms. Gallucci. He said he wants to make sure BAC focuses on amplifying
the work of the External Affairs Committee, staff, and elected officials who are advocating
for more funding for this region.
Mr. Kelly discussed his background and noted that he currently leads a real estate firm in
Cleveland called Cushman & Wakefield CRESCO.
Introductions
BAC members introduced themselves.
ACTION ITEMS
No action items were presented at this meeting.
PRESENTATION / DISCUSSION ITEMS
NOACA Position on Proposed Fees for Transportation Infrastructure
Ms. Beverly Burtzlaff provided background on the current gas tax, the proposed gas tax
increase, and reviewed the following provisions included in the resolution passed by the
NOACA Board on March 8:

8180s
1-2

 1. Amount of the user fee increase should be aligned to demonstrated need - at
least 40% back to locals
2. New user fee should be indexed to inflation
3. Distribute revenue in an equitable manner – benefits go back to the users
4. Increase funding for public transportation to at least the $120 million
recommended in ODOT’s 2015 study
5. Fund maintenance of state and local networks prior to new capacity
Ms. Gallucci talked about TRAC using its funds on new capacity projects.
6. Continue to explore resources for transit, how alternate fuel vehicles can pay
their fair share, and additional permissive authority for locals on registration fees
Ms. Burtzlaff mentioned that Ms. Gallucci testified before the House Finance Committee
and Senate Transportation Committee in support of increased funding for infrastructure
on behalf of the Ohio Association of Regional Councils (OARC).
Ms. Burtzlaff reviewed House Bill (HB) 62 and the Senate’s bill. She noted that both bills
will be presented to the Conference Committee. Once a compromise has been reached,
a report will be sent to the House and Senate for a final vote.
Ms. Burtzlaff stated that NOACA will continue to communicate the Board resolution to
state legislature, administration, and other external stakeholders.
Mr. Koehler asked if any other advocacy efforts are being done and if communities are
speaking with one voice on the topic. Ms. Gallucci stated that a coalition called Fix Our
Roads (FOR) Ohio expressed support for Governor DeWine’s proposal, but has not
indicated any support for the distribution of funds. She noted that NOACA is part of FOR
Ohio’s efforts through OARC. She mentioned there is another group called Move On that
is advocating primarily for public transit. She noted that Move On is separate from Move
Ohio. She stated that decisions are made by the regional councils at OARC, and NOACA
is usually the only one that recognizes the inequity of the current distribution. She
mentioned that some of the regional councils were so happy with the proposed funding
increase, they looked passed some of the important issues.
Mr. Koehler asked if the Greater Cleveland Partnership (GCP) is involved in any advocacy
work. Ms. Gallucci stated that GCP expressed support for the gas tax increase for public
transit, but has not taken a position on the inequity of the current formulas.
Mr. Tony Gallo stated that MOVE Lorain County has concentrated on getting funding for
public transit at the state level.
Mr. Gallo asked if ODOT has taken a position on public transit. Ms. Gallucci said ODOT
released a Transit Needs Study that stated public transit needs a minimum of $120 million.
She said NOACA’s position is based on ODOT’s report. She mentioned that former
Governor John Kasich did not take action to increase public transit funding to the level
recommended in the ODOT report.

8180s
1-3

 Ms. Benjamin asked if the chart of the original formula and the VMT-based formula have
been shared with the State Senate President. Ms. Gallucci said the chart was sent to all
State Senators and Representatives and staff followed up with phone calls.
Mr. Kevin Schmotzer said he was glad the House proposed $100 million for public transit.
He asked who in the House pushed for the $100 million.
Ms. Gallucci talked about the limited time NOACA had to respond to the gas tax proposal.
She mentioned that the Northeast Ohio delegation was successful in getting the House to
approve $100 million for public transit. Mr. Schmotzer said he hopes the Senate will
support the increase for public transit, as well.
NOACA SFY 2019 4th Quarter Project Planning Review (PPR)
Mr. Ed May provided background on PPR and presented information on the major
rehabilitation project on US-20 in Madison Township (LAK US-20 – 24.99 PID No. 109270)
that consists of the following improvements: pavement replacement, minor widening
(increased lane width), drainage replacement and a sidewalk. He noted that the total cost
of the project is $16 million; no NOACA funds will be used; and project comments have
been forwarded to the sponsor. He said staff will coordinate with the sponsor on the
proposed project.
Mr. Romancak asked staff to provide information the business community can relate to
when presenting future PPRs to BAC, such as how a project affects job centers and truck
traffic. He also asked that staff explain why a project is important from an economic
development standpoint and what the impact will be to businesses. Ms. Gallucci stated
that future presentations will include information as suggested by Mr. Romancak. She
noted that PPR is intended to capture public comments. She encouraged BAC members
to share information with others in their network if a project or projects have relevance in
their community. She noted that comments can be made on NOACA’s website.
Mr. Gallo asked why the Madison Township project was presented to BAC if no NOACA
funds will be used. Ms. Gallucci stated that NOACA is responsible for regional planning,
which includes approving all transportation projects.
Mr. Koehler suggested that staff put the requests in the context of a broader set of priorities
being looked at by NOACA.
SFY 2021–2024 TIP Development Update – Potential Projects for NOACA Controlled
Funds
Mr. Mike Daugherty provided background on the Transportation Improvement Program
(TIP) and reviewed the elements of the program. He noted that the TIP update was
originally planned for SFY 2020-2023. ODOT delayed the State Transportation
Improvement Program (STIP) / TIP development process by one year because of the
uncertainty of future federal funding, revised the timeframe to SFY 2021-2024, and urged
NOACA to proceed with its adoption of agency funded projects according to the original
schedule.
Mr. Daugherty stated that NOACA staff met with representatives of all five counties and
the City of Cleveland to review the accuracy of the projects. He noted that NOACA’s
Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) program and Transportation Alternatives

8180s
1-4

 Program (TAP) have a total of $80 million available for SFY 2021-2024. He noted that the
CMAQ funded projects have been approved through SFY 2024. He mentioned that
NOACA received 212 project funding requests from 50 communities totaling $301 million,
and the total cost of the projects is $608 million.
Mr. Daugherty reviewed the criteria used to evaluate qualifying projects. He noted that
staff considered regional connectivity factors, consistency with NOACA plans, NOACA
Diversity and Inclusion Policies, and urbanized versus rural areas.
Mr. Daugherty stated that project funding recommendations will be presented to the
Planning and Programming Committee (PPC) on April 12, 2019. If endorsed by PPC, the
recommendations will be presented to the Board for approval on June 14, 2019.
New 208 Plan Draft Development
Ms. Pamela Davis provided background on the 208 Plan and NOACA’s responsibility as
an areawide water quality management agency. She also provided an overview of the
work done by the 208 Plan Working Group and Chapter Focus Groups. She noted that
the 208 Plan update included reviewing and editing chapter text, and developing regional
strategies, agency recommendations, and NOACA policies.
Ms. Davis stated that NOACA staff is planning to do additional outreach for the 208 Plan
and has developed two questionnaires that will be distributed throughout the region using
social media, Facebook, Twitter, direct mail, public meetings, and stakeholders.
Ms. Davis reviewed the two questionnaires: one for the “208 Public” and the other for
designated management agencies (DMAs), local health districts and affected jurisdictions.
She informed members that Ms. Gallucci will forward the “208 Public” questionnaire to
them. Ms. Davis asked members to share the questionnaire with their constituents when
they receive it. She provided an overview of the types of questions on both questionnaires.
Ms. Davis stated that the DMA/health district/jurisdiction questionnaire will be released in
March 2019; the “208 Public” questionnaire will be released in April 2019; and
questionnaire responses and outreach meeting strategy will be presented to the Water
Quality Subcommittee in June 2019.
Ms. Janice Parham asked how many questions are on the questionnaire; how long will a
person have to complete the questionnaire; and how long will people have to respond to
the questionnaire when they receive it.
Ms. Davis said the “208 Public” questionnaire has 20 questions and should take a person
no longer than 15 minutes to complete. She noted that the questionnaire will also be
available at public meetings and can be completed at that time.

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

June 21, 2019

RE:

Planning Reviews (PPRs)/ Intergovernmental Review and Consultation (IGRC); 1st
Quarter State Fiscal Year 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
Attached are PPR summary documents for the proposed projects to be presented to the NOACA
Transportation Subcommittee, Planning and Programming Committee and Executive Committee for review
and recommendation.
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federal-aid
transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and federal
requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff; Board, including committees, subcommittees, and
councils: intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC); and public involvement. The end product of
PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPRs is
included on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained
from the public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed
projects are posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, project sponsors will be notified that their projects have completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with project sponsors to address any planning issues identified during PPR.

Attachments: Project Summaries

Reconstruction of SR-43 in Solon
History/Background: These projects are included in ODOT District 12’s Program.
Title: Reconstruction of SR-43 in Solon
Sponsor: City of Solon
Estimated Total Cost: $8,107,165
Proposed Source of Federal Funds: ODOT
History/Background: The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) Safety program
provides funds to ODOT and local governments for highway safety treatments or corrective
activity designed to alleviate a safety problem or a potentially hazardous situation. The program
is funded at approximately $100 million annually. Priority is given to those projects with
recommended activities/countermeasures that improve safety at roadway locations with a high
frequency, severity, and rate of crashes.
There are two application cycles per year. Applications must be signed off by the respective
ODOT District Safety Review Team. A safety engineering study must typically accompany the
application unless the application is for preliminary engineering funds to complete the study.
Proposed Project: The following project was selected for Highway Safety Improvement
Program (HSIP) funding:
•

CUY SR-43 - 1.98: PID No. 109517 - This project involves reconstruction and widening
of SR-43 (Aurora Road), from 2 lanes to 3 lanes, from the Solar Shopping Center, 0.13
mile east of SR-91 (SOM Center Road) to Liberty Road, in Solon (schematic). The
scope will also include a new water line, storm sewer, a permanent traffic signal at Portz
Parkway, a multipurpose path on the south side of Aurora Road and an on-street bike
lane on the north side with new sidewalks. Right turn lanes will be installed at Clearwater
Court, Portz Parkway and Liberty Road.
The project’s estimated total cost is $8,107,605. The estimated cost of preliminary
engineering preliminary development (PEPD) is $64,974. The estimated cost of
preliminary engineering detailed design (PEDD) is $11,466. The PEPD and PEDD will
be funded by ODOT. The estimated cost of right-of-way (RW) is $450,000. The RW will
be funded with local funds ($450,000). The estimated cost of construction (CO) is
$7,091,165. The CO will be funded with HSIP funds ($1,500,000) and local funds
($5,591,165). The estimated cost of construction engineering (CE) is $490,000. The CE
will be locally funded.

Staff Comment (Summary):
RECOMMENDATION:
o Level 2 of NOACA Freight Network, meaning relatively high truck counts. Design should
consider their turning movements mainly at the shopping center.
o Include high-visibility crosswalks and pedestrian countdown heads with the new signal at
Portz Parkway.
o Include pedestrian crossing for Aurora Road.
Committee Review:
Bicycle Pedestrian Advisory Council (BPAC)
RECOMMENDATIONS:
o Consider providing less width to the vehicular lanes and more width to the bike lane
and/or create a buffer between the bike lane. However, the Safety and Operations
Council cautioned not to reduce the eastbound travel lane as some cyclists may still
choose to use the road rather than the side path.
5-3

 o
o

Consider a shared use path on both sides of the road in lieu of the bike lane (allocate the
5 feet to creating a path,10 feet wide, rather than a path, 5 feet wide and a bike lane, 5
feet wide).
BPAC strongly recommends signing and or centerline striping on the new multi-use path.
Since the existing sidewalk on the south side is being widened to serve as a multi-use
path, BPAC recommends measures that will identify that the facility has changed and
cyclists are permitted on the path.

 Bridge Painting on IR-480 and SR-10 (Lorain Road) in Cleveland
and Fairview Park
History/Background: This project is included in ODOT District 12’s Program.
Title: Bridge Painting on IR-480 and SR-10 (Lorain Road) in Cleveland and Fairview Park
Sponsor: Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) District 12
Estimated Total Cost: $34,500,000
Proposed Source of Federal Funds: ODOT
•

CUY IR 480 - 06.47: PID No. 22131 - This project involves painting the structural steel of

Great Lakes Hyperloop Feasibility Study Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Hyperloop is a new mode of transport that will revolutionize travel by connecting people and goods with
unprecedented speed, safety and efficiency. In February 2018, NOACA and Hyperloop Transportation
Technologies (HTT) formed an official public private partnership (P3) where plans were announced for the
Great Lakes Hyperloop starting with a feasibility study from Cleveland to Chicago. The feasibility study
launched July 1, 2018. The study is divided into four phases:
• Project Objectives and Organization
• Site Reconnaissance and Preliminary Route Analysis
• Technical and Financial Feasibility
• Project Development Cost and Schedule
The study is nearing completion, but the study corridor has recently been extended to Pittsburgh, which has
extended the completion a few months. Since the project is at a point where stakeholder and public
engagement is needed, outreach meetings are scheduled along the corridor.
At the meeting, the Council members will be updated on the status of the study.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total cost of the study is $1.2M with each partner contributing 50%. NOACA’s cost is $600,000, and is
funded through revenues totaling $650,000 earmarked for the Hyperloop initiative from various partners of
NOACA (Cleveland Foundation – $200k, ODOT - $250,000, Ohio Turnpike - $100,000), as well as NOACA
($100K).
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
The Council will continue to be updated on the status of the Great Lakes Hyperloop Feasibility Study.
