23 calls / 28% - transportation
13 calls / 16% - billing and financial queries

Director Lerner reviewed the Meeting Minutes; it was noted that metrics would not be presented this month.
During the discussion of the information on the transition, Director Wiese inquired regarding communications,
benefits and members’ ability to connect with dental providers for specific needs; as an example, if she was trying to
find on the website where an adult patient would go to get their tooth pulled, she cannot find that information easily.
Director Lerner responded that he will follow up on that subject with Mr. Glass.

Resources. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the metrics, Ms. Pryor provided an explanation of the basis for the labor hold, which was
referenced on slide 2 of the metrics. She stated that the System went through a displacement process, where the
administration realigned staff across the organization with specific positions, to make sure that staffing meets the
System’s vision; approximately 250 positions were involved.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Lerner, moved the approval of the Minutes of the Human
Resources Committee Meeting of May 20, 2016. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Board and Committee Reports
G. Finance Committee Meeting, May 20, 2016 (continued)
It was noted that request number 9 remains pending review by Contract Compliance.
During the discussion of the metrics, Director Wiese requested that information be provided that reflects whether
budget variances exist relating to human resources/personnel. Additionally, with regard to the information on
volumes, Director Velasquez requested to see the information presented in a year-over-year fashion. Director Lerner
noted that the Board talks singularly about the Stroger activities and CountyCare when they are, in fact, part of the
same System. What might be helpful is to put some of the metrics side-by-side; this provides a better idea of where
to allocate resources, because if you tweak one, it will have an effect on the other. It was determined that the Chairs
of the Finance and Managed Care Committees would further discuss to determine adjustments to the metrics to reflect
this information.
During the review of the contractual requests, Director Richardson-Lowry requested whether, going forward, for
transparency purposes, a category can be included on the requests, per contract, relating to Minority and WomenOwned Business Enterprise goals and local hire participation. Mr. Jones responded affirmatively.
Director Estrada, seconded by Director Lerner, moved the approval of the Minutes of the Meeting
of the Finance Committee of May 20, 2016. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Any items listed under Sections IV, V and IX

Report from Chairman of the Board
Chairman Hammock stated that the Board has recently lost two (2) good Board Members through resignations - Lew
Collens and Dr. Erica Marsh. The Nominating Committee for this Board has been in meetings and has produced a list of
potential candidates to fill those positions. Additionally, there are three (3) Directors whose terms expire at the end of
June – Directors Richardson-Lowry, Velasquez and Wiese. President Preckwinkle will be also addressing those as she
takes on the whole picture. Given the number of candidates, and the fact that it has been the President’s practice to
interview them all, it may take a month or two to fill the vacancies. He will provide further updates as information becomes
available.

VII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (Attachment #5)
Dr. Shannon provided an update on several subjects; detail is included in Attachment #5.

VIII. Recommendations, Discussion / Information Item
A.

Strategic planning discussion

Topic: Health Equity, presented by Dr. Terry Mason, Chief Operating Officer, Cook County Department of Public
Health (Attachment #6)
Chairman Hammock provided introductory comments. He stated that when this process started in February, the strategic
plan was anticipated to be approved at the June Board Meeting; the goal was to make sure the strategic plan informed
the budget for the coming year. A lot of background has been presented to the Board, getting Directors up to speed with
what has already been going on here, in preparation for making decisions about asset and resource allocations.
Now the Board is coming to the next phase, focusing on the specific goals and objectives that will be set. Approval of
the strategic plan will be moved to the July meeting; that will allow the Board to have a little more time to sift out these
objectives, and will also make sure they will have time to share the draft plan with the County officials, public, staff and
others who are legitimate stakeholders in this process.
Dr. Shannon provided an introduction to the presentation. He also introduced Richard Sewell, Associate Dean of
Community and Public Health Practice at UIC School of Public Health, who will be moderating the strategic planning
discussions.
Dr. Mason reviewed the presentation, which included information on the following subjects:
•
•
•
•
•

Conceptual Framework
Terms
Historical Perspective
Data
Recommendations

Director Velasquez stated that the immigration status of an individual is a health disparity; moving forward, she
suggested that this be included as one of the social determinants of health. Director Junge stated that incarceration and
the effect of incarceration on families should also be included as social determinants of health.
Chairman Hammock inquired further regarding the five (5) year community Health Improvement Plan (WePlan)
referenced on slide 31 of the presentation; he noted the importance of integration of the strategic plan and WePlan, and
asked when WePlan is expected to be presented to the Board for approval. Dr. Mason responded that it will be presented
for approval in the next few months.
Following discussion, the following was determined:
•
•
•

The Directors are expected to receive a draft of the Strategic Plan by June 17th.
The June 24th Board Meeting will be predominantly focused on discussion of the information contained in the
draft Strategic Plan (to be received by June 17th).
A Special Meeting of the Board will be scheduled to be held sometime between the dates of June 24th and July
21st, from 4:00-7:00 P.M. This will provide Directors with additional time to review and digest the information
received on June 17th and provides an opportunity for more robust discussion of the information. A finalized
draft strategic plan is expected to be released to the public following the Special Meeting of the Board. A public
hearing is planned to be held on July 21st; approval of the plan is expected to take place on July 29th.

walked in the door?. They specifically pointed out Dr. Poulakidas? bedside manner, compassion and care and noted the
impact that nurse Jeyalakshmi ?Jeya? Selwyn has had on their ability to cope with the devastating impact of the injuries
sustained by their family members saying don?t know what we would have done without Jeya?s gentle touch. She has
gotten me through this.?

Activities and Announcements

- As part of the strategic planning process, System leadership has hosted three employee town halls and four
community town hall meetings to gather feedback. Additional opportunities for feedback have been created for
staff including an online survey and email address for their suggestions. The community can share feedback by
visiting the ?governance? section of the website. Much appreciation to our community outreach staff who
organized these events.

0 'Patient Experience

0 The central campus parking strategy continues to make more space available for patients and visitors.
To date approximately 200 employees have been relocated to other facilities with more to follow.

0 Construction will begin shortly on improvements designed to improve the experience for our surgical
patients on the 3'd floor of Stroger. When completed, our patients will be able to report directly to the
third floor for all of their pre-op needs rather than starting on the first floor.

0 As reported in our recent Press Ganey numbers, scores for cleanliness are on the rise. While not yet a
trend, we are appreciative of our new environmental services manager and our EVS employees who
have partnered to develop and implement new strategies that appear to be successful.

0 CCH HS has posted an RFP for the Assessment, Development and Oversight of a Patient and Experience
and Service Excellence Program. The intention is to bring in a patient experience consultant to a) assess
current service culture, b) develop and implement a program to improve the patient experience
and service of excellence model and c) measure and monitor the results of said program.

On Monday, May 23, in collaboration with Access Community Health Network, hosted its 
Redetermination event at the Access Kedzie Family Health Center located at 3229 47th Place in Chicago. The
event was attended by 61 CountyCare members seeking assistance with redetermination paperwork and other
enrollment questions. Several CountyCare members in attendance receive their care at Fantus Health
Center while others receive it at the health centers operated by Access, Alivio, Esperanza, and Lawndale
Christian. About half of the attendees were Spanish speakers and/or of Latin descent. Overall. CountyCare staff
submitted 25 redetermination forms to the State for review. There were a few members who could not re?
enroll as they exceeded the financial guidelines and the Access financial counselor helped them with
marketplace enrollment options. There were other members who had been cancelled by the State, but upon
further review we will be helping them to resubmit forms with correct financial information. Our CountyCare
care coordination staff helped a few members with difficult medical questions that they had. Finally, based on
our survey results, 56 of the attendees mentioned that they would definite recommend the CountyCare Health
Plan to friends or relatives.

0 The third issue of the community newsletter (attached) will go out today. The distribution iist has grown
to more than 4,000 individuals and organizations.

Legislative Update

State

Federal

Late Wednesday, May 25th, the House approved an FY17 budget to fund K-12 education, higher education, and
social services programs not currently being paid through court orders or mandates) which passed 63?53?01.
Without new revenue, this budget bill is $7 billion short. This bill now heads to the Senate for a concurrence
vote; the Governor said that he intends to veto this legislation if it makes it to his desk.

Thursday, May 26th the House unanimously approved 53384 which permits hospitals governed by the Illinois
Open Meetings Act, including CCH HS, to go into closed session for matters protected under the federal Patient
Safety and Quality Improvement Act and the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
The bill was unanimously approved by the Senate in April. The bill now goes to the Governor for approval. The
effective date of the legislation is January 1, 2017.

Earlier this month, the Illinois Senate approved H35736, which extends the sunset date for a portion ofthe All
Kids health insurance program that covers 41,000 Illinois children regardless of immigration status. The bill now
moves to the Governor for his signature.

The General Assembly is scheduled to adjourn on May 31, 2016.

On May 6, 2016 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) published the Medicaid managed care rule. Of
concern to is the phase out of directed payments which will occur over a period of ten years with a 10%
cut each year and shrunken rate ranges. CMS has asserted that they found directed or "pass through" payments
that were not generally linked to delivery services or the outcome of these services and that these payments
were not actuarially sound.

The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have begun their work on FY2017 appropriations
legislation. These committees generally leave the more contentious legislation until later in the summer and as
a result neither committee has published or held any hearings on proposed HHS appropriations.

Last week the Senate voted to move forward with a $1.1 billion package of emergency spending to fight the Zika
virus. The legislation would bring the total amount of money available to fight Zika to $1.6 billion, about $300
million below President Obama's February request. The Senate's funding would be on top of $589 million
redirected from the Obama administration's last emergency funding request for the Ebola virus.

The House approved a $622 million package to fund the Zika response through September the end of
FY2016. The House offset the spending by using unspent Ebola money, as well as unused administrative funding
within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) would get
$230 million, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would receive $170 million, the US. Agency
for International Development would receive $119 million and the Biomedical Advanced Research and
Development Authority would get $103 million for the remainder of FY2016. House Appropriators intend to
include additional Zika funds in the FY2017 Labor-HHS-Education bill. The White House issued a Statement of
Administration Policy in opposition to the bill.

Next steps include a conference between the House and Senate to reconcile the differences between the two

Zika bills. The Senate Appropriations Labor-HHS?Education Subcommittee Chairman hopes to have an
agreement before July recess.

0 Last week the House named 35 members to serve on a conference committee with the Senate to reconcile
House and Senate passed-bills on opioid abuse treatment and prevention. The Senate passed one
comprehensive bill while the House approved 18 individual measures.

Speaker Paul Ryan appointed 21 Republican members to the conference committee including illinois delegation
members Adam Kinzinger and Bruce Dold. Minority leader Nancy Pelosi appointed 14 Democrat members to
the conference committee.

The House and Senate measures provide authorization but not appropriations for millions in new or
expanded grant programs. While there is lei?partisan support for this issue, there is dispute about the level of
funding needed.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for at both the State and Federal level.

Catastrophic errors is according 1,0 QUinl STUder Cl health CLICK EERE Linkto Electronic?Learning Management ii 
care expert and founder of the Studer Group. 4

 

There are opportunities to learn from high reliability industries, such as the airline industry. In the airline
industry, there is one crash per 2.5 million flights- a very small error percentage. A recent study by Johns
Hopkins Medicine estimated that medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the U.S., with
perhaps as many as 250,000 Americans dying each year from medical errors. While it remains to be seen
if this study?s ultimate conclusion is valid, if is certainly the case that health care is a complex, error-prone
endeavor. Health systems may underestimate the true prevalence of errors based on self-reporting
alone, and thus may be unaware of significant opportunities to improve the safety of the care they
provide. The Joint Commission recommends that health care organizations adopt the principles of
reliability to provide safe, consistent care.

Principles of High Reliability

. Preoccupation with failure: attentiveness to possibility of an error
Reluctance to simplify: processes are complex, always ?dig deeper'
Sensitivity to operations: awareness of what?s working, or not
Commitment to resilience: ability to handle, learn from adverse events
Deterence to expertise: who really knows the work?

The first principle, preoccupation with failure, means assuming that a mistake can happen any time. This
leads to strategies and processes where the possibility of an error is assumed, and staff double check to
ensure it does not. The ?time?ouf' process is one such example where we check to ensure the correct
patient, the correct procedure and the correct site before a procedure begins. Medication labeling is
another example of double-checking by labeling any container where medication is transferred, and
using visual and verbal handoffs when the medication is administered. These strategies make a big
difference in patient safety always assume an error is possible and follow policies that force us to
'double check'. In forthcoming issues, we will discuss other elements of high reliability.

STRATEGIC
PLANNING

  

 

 



Last week, the employee engagement component of
the strategic planning process kicked into high
gear. This issue of Strategic Planning Update is intended
to provide a high level summary of the information
discussed at the town hail meetings and provide
answers to several of the questions asked that are core
to the strategic planning process.

The employee town hall meeting at Provident was
attended by more than 65 employees and allowed us
to share system?wide priorities as well as the exciting
plans we have for the Provident Community outlined
below:

. We are working closely with the County's
Bureau of Asset Management on the plans to
build a new Regional Outpatient Center (ROC).
This requires acquisition of land, designing the
new building and meeting all the building
codes and regulatory requirements. The goal is
to open a new ROC that provides a full
continuum of outpatient care including
behavioral health and dental services.

. We also had the opportunity to talk about the
new state-of-the-art mammography suites and
the build-out of the new center which is
performing procedures few other hospitals
provide. Community Open Houses are coming
soon.

- A discussion around the future of hospital
services on the south side and specifically the
future of Provident generated a lot of
questions. Yes, the census at Provident is low
and we are now staffing to volumes but the
Emergency Department and the outpatient
clinics the two areas that typically drive
inpatient admissions - continue to see good
volumes. If we can build up outpatient volumes
through increased access to primary and
specialty care then we certainly have an
opportunity to increase our inpatient volumes.
This is a classic example of the
interdependence that exists within the health
system. The success of our outpatient strategy
will define the role of our inpatient services.

More than 50 employees turned out for the Oak Forest
employee town hall where the discussion was also
heavily focused on outpatient services.

0 Several individuals asked about the future of
the immediate Care Center The 

currently operates 24-7. There are
approximately i3,000 visits to the ICC annually.
with 75% of them happening between 7am
and 5pm. We are currently taking a close look
at the and whether it makes sense to
continue to operate a 24?7 center or whether a
mix of traditional services coupled with
things like pediatrics and behavioral health
services make better sense. Stay tuned.

. plans to move out of Oak Forest to
provide modern care in a facility designed for
ambulatory care that has better access for our
patients to ancillary services and public
transportation. Oak Forest is very expensive to
maintain and does not provide the experience
we want for our patients. Eventually we will
move out of Oak Forest into a modern Regional
Outpatient Center.

0 We are investigating a shuttle bus option for
those who get off the bus at i5?1h Cicero and
have to walk to the back corner of the
campus.

A couple general questions were raised that are
applicable to the entire organization:

. What?s happening to all the paper medical
records? moved to an electronic
medical record more than 10 years ago.
Recent efforts to scan all the paper documents
will free up additional space in our facilities for
more patient care.

0 is there a plan to organize all the ambulatory
clinics the some way? Yes. The new clinic
managers will be responsible for the day-to-day
management of their ambulatory site,
including proper staffing. the achievement of
performance metrics such as patient flow.
customer service and more. They will work
closely with medical staff and nursing
leadership allowing clinical staff to focus on
patient care. The addition of these clinic
manager positions will allow to create a
standardized clinic operations model with a
designated and accountable leader.

. in the recent displacements, we were informed
there would be no bumping however several
staff were bumped. Why were the union
contracts not considered? Management?s goal
was to reach Memorandums of Understanding

with all our labor partners to minimize disruption
to both patient care and employee stability by
identifying vacant positions for the impacted
employees. We were unable to reach an
agreement with all of our labor partners and
we regret this did not occur. We appreciate
how everyone rallied on behalf of our patients.
If you have a question or concern about the
process, you should contact your Labor

in Cicero, to discuss strategic
plans and vision for the future, as well

as to get input from the communities
we serve. Our communities?

perspective is invaluable as we move
forward in positioning our health system for continued success. During
the meetings, many of the questions we received were about upcoming
plans for our health care sites and I?d like to share some details with you
here:

  

Provident Hospital: intends to build a new health and
diagnostic center in the Provident community. We envision a regional
outpatient center (ROC) focused on primary care and prevention,
accessible to our patients and integrated with community services. A
new ROC will provide primary and specialty care services, laboratory and
diagnostic services including a full spectrum of radiology services. The
ROC will ultimately also provide dental, behavioral health, orthopedics
and geriatric services: services much?needed in the community. These
plans add on to the updates that have already occurred at Provident with
the construction of a brand new state?of?the-art mammography suite.

Oak Forest Health Center: plans to move out of the current
Oak Forest campus to provide modern care in a facility designed for
ambulatory care that has better access for our patients to ancillary
services and public transportation. Oak Forest is very expensive to
maintain and does not provide the experience we want for our patients.
In the next few years, we plan to move into a new regional outpatient
center, similar to the ROC we plan to build in the Provident community.

Central Campus: As reported in last month?s issue of Community News,
Cook County and are building a new outpatient facility on our
west side campus that will replace the outdated Fantus Health Center.
Starting later this year clinical services will move out of Fantus Health
Center and into Stroger Hospital to prepare for the transition. This
means that there will be some construction in Stroger to accommodate
those services for the time being. Please bear with us! Construction on
the new building starts in 2017 and we are looking forward to caring for
our patients in a modern facility.

Health Centers: has 15 community health centers where we
provide primary care and specialty care. In the coming years, we intend
to rebuild, relocate or renovate each of our health centers. We are
currently working on plans to improve our Cicero, Logan Square and
Vista health centers. We will bpagg?g alrigg the latest details with you
as they become available.

 



All of these plans are intended to help best serve our patients
now, and for generations to come. if you were not able to attend a town
hall meeting but would still like to provide input on plans for the
future, please visit:

1934–1968: FHA Mortgage
Insurance Requirements
Utilize Redlining:
“The FHA also explicitly practiced a
policy of “redlining” when
determining which neighborhoods
to approve mortgages in. “
“… color-coded maps indicating the level
of security for real estate investments…
appraisers divided neighborhoods by
categories including occupation, income
and ethnicity of inhabitants:
C (yellow) were neighborhoods that were
“definitely declining.” Generally sparsely
populated fringe areas that were typically
bordering on all black neighborhoods.
D (red) (hence the term “red-lining”)
were areas in which “things taking place
in 3 (“C”) had already happened.” Black
and low income neighborhoods were
considered to be the worst for lending”.

 In Summary
• Long history of discrimination and racist
practices disproportionately affecting
residents of the near west and southern parts
of Cook County
• This has resulted in areas of concentrated
poverty and low opportunity
• As a result, populations residing in those areas
suffer from disproportionately poor health
care and health outcomes
28

 • Strengthening health equity… means going
beyond the contemporary concentration on
the immediate causes of disease

Page 86 of 96

 Current state
◦ CCHHS is at a critical point in its existence, especially given
changes from the ACA
◦ Is unique as a public health care system, given reliance on
government payors and federal and county funding
◦ Faces competition for patients and plan members
◦ Remains the largest provider in Illinois for the uninsured
Draft

Page 87 of 96

 Assumptions – CCHHS wants to…
◦ Become a provider of choice in a competitive
environment
◦ Build ambulatory services to create healthier communities
◦ Increase affiliations with community-based providers,
including public health agencies and FQHCs to assist in
addressing patient needs as relating to social
determinants of health
Draft

Page 88 of 96

 Assumptions– CCHHS wants to…
◦ Grow CountyCare membership
◦ Increase funding from extramural sources, e.g. grants,
research partnerships, contributions
