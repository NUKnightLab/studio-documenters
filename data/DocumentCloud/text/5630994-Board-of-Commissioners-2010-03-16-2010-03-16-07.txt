RATIFICATION OF ACCEPTANCE OF A RENEWAL GRANT AWARD FROM THE
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND
AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A SUB-GRANT AGREEMENT WITH
HEARTLAND HUMAN CARE SERVICES AND INCREASE THE FY2010
COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners:
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners ratify the acceptance of a HUD grant award
to continue funding for the Public Housing Family Self-Sufficiency Program in the amount of
$56,274.00, and authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to increase the FY 2010
comprehensive budget and enter into a sub-grant agreement with Heartland Human Care
Services for $56,274.00 to continue the implementation of the Family Self-Sufficiency Program.
FUNDING
No funding requirements
EXPLANATION
On February 22, 2010, the CHA received official written notice of an award of $56,274.00 from
HUD’s Public Housing Family Self-Sufficiency Program (FSS) to continue the implementation
of the Family Self-Sufficiency Program, a partnership with Heartland Human Care Services to
target 50 public housing program participants in mixed-income communities. The program has
been recently expanded to include 250 residents in mixed-income and family developments. This
expansion is reflected in an amended Family Self-Sufficiency Plan that was submitted to HUD in
2009. The purpose of the Public Housing FSS program is to promote the development of local
strategies to coordinate the use of accessible services under the FSS program with public and
private resources, enable participating families to increase earned income, reduce or eliminate
the need for welfare assistance, and make progress toward achieving economic independence
and housing self-sufficiency. The Chicago Housing Authority is partnering with Heartland
Human Care Services to provide job training, financial education and incentives to increase
assets earned through wage increases. The anticipated outcome of the program is a transition
from dependency on social services and public housing to self-sufficiency.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to approve the ratification of the
HUD grant in the amount of $56,274, increase the FY 2010 comprehensive budget and enter into
a sub-grantee agreement with Heartland Human Care Services.
