Social Determinants of Health
• The social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age.
• Health care
• Affordable housing
• Healthy food
• Safe, walkable neighborhoods
• Healthy work environments
• Living wage

• Social determinants of health are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources throughout local
communities, nations, and the world.

Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH), Closing the gap in a generation: health equity through action on the social determinants of health. Final report of the
Commission on Social Determinants of Health. 2008, World Health Organization: Geneva.

 Health Equity
“Health equity is the assurance of the conditions for optimal
health for all people.
Achieving health equity requires valuing all individuals and
populations equally, recognizing and rectifying historical
injustices, and providing resources according to need.”

Health Inequities

Modified from Solar, O., & Irwin, A. (2007). A conceptual framework for action on the social determinants of health.

 Structural Racism

A fundamental cause of health inequity, associated with imbalances in
political power throughout society… Structural racism perpetuates
residential segregation, concentrated poverty, disinvestment in
neighborhoods, and targeting neighborhoods for toxic waste— all issues
related to serious health outcomes. (NACCHO 2016)

1934–1968: FHA Mortgage Insurance
Requirements Utilize Redlining:
“The FHA also explicitly practiced a policy of “redlining” when
determining which neighborhoods to approve mortgages in.
“… color-coded maps indicating the level of security for real
estate investments… appraisers divided neighborhoods by
categories including occupation, income and ethnicity of
inhabitants:

C (yellow) were neighborhoods that were “definitely declining.”
Generally sparsely populated fringe areas that were typically
bordering on all black neighborhoods.

D (red) (hence the term “red-lining”) were areas in which
“things taking place in 3 (“C”) had already happened.” Black and
low income neighborhoods were considered to be the worst for
lending”.

 How Can We Advance
Health Equity?
Some successful approaches
• Strengthening health equity… means going beyond
• the contemporary concentration on the immediate causes of disease.
WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health. (2007). Achieving health equity: from root causes to fair outcomes: Commission on
Social Determinants of Health, Interim statement.

 Mobilize Data to Advance Health Equity
• Surveillance of health
equity policies across
140+ school districts
in SCC
• Explore potential
analysis of suburban
school discipline
reports for racial and
other inequities

• Encouraging more screening for STDs
• Especially chlamydia and gonorrhea
• Especially in those 18-24 years of age

• Urging providers to learn about and
use Expedited Partner Therapy

• Making sure cases receive treatment
after being diagnosed with STIs
• Emphasizing prevention

• Condom availability throughout CCH
• Correct and consistent condom use

 In Summary
Long history of discrimination and racist practices affecting residents of the
near west and southern parts of Cook County

The evidence is clear that racism is deeply entrenched and continues to affect
the opportunities available to people of color
This has resulted in areas of concentrated poverty and low opportunity
As a result, populations residing in those areas suffer from
disproportionately poor health outcomes

Must improve health equity and correct Social Determinants of Health
