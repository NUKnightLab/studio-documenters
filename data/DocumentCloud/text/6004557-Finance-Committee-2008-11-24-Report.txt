Summa? 
The Cook County Health and Hospitals Systemjyear to date

?nancial results ?nished the tenth month of the ?scal year behind
the budget by almost 28%. The poorer than planned ?nancial
performance was due to lower Patient Service Revenue, IGT

. RevenUe, and Non?Operating Revenue. The overall revenue
shortfall at the end of the tenth month was $58,588,555 below the
budget for, the same period in time. Expenses were also below
budget. The favorable level-of expenses was not enough to offset
the shortfall in revenue. . 

Operating Revenue

Fees at the end 0f Septembercollecte?d from patient services were 
below budget year to date by 11.4%. The September year to date
shortfall from budget was an improvement from the level at the

end of August where patient fees were 12.5% below the budget. It
is expected that by the end of ?scal year there Will be ?irther.
improvement in collected fees as compared to the budget. Patient
fees are expected to fall short of the budget by approximately 7%
or $21.5 million dollars by the end of the ?scal year. The largest
source of unfavorable patient service revenue is from the shortfall
of Medicaid patient fees.

The Intergovernmental Transfer'Revenue continues to be short of
the budget due to the phase out of one federal program. The
System has been working with the of?cials of the State Medicaid
program to offset the loss 0f IGT revenue. The 2008 loss of IGT is
$15,004,000. Throughthe efforts of the System management and
the consultants they have arranged for the System to receiVe 
approximately $11,697,000 by the end of the ?scal year. IGT
revenue will by the end of the ?scal year still be below'the budget
by approximately $3,307,000." The additional funds received from
the State to offset the loss of the IGT were paid to the Countylin
two different methods. An additional transfer of $3,697,000 was
received ?rst and the $8,000,000 balance 0f the $11,697,000 Was

received as an increase of November patient fees. The increase in
patient fees was paid by adjusting the of revenue that the State
requires the county to return to the State. .

Other Revenue at the end of September' 13 in excess of the budget
by $1,723,106 or 36. If thIS trend continues through the end of
the ?scal year Other Revenue will be 1n excess of the budget by
approximately 2.1 million dollars.

Total Operating Revenue at the end of the ?scal year may be 
belOw budget by approXimately 34.7 million dollars.

Operating Expenses .
Operating Expenses at the end of September Were below budget by

6. 2% or $53, 957, 01 8. This favorable expense performance was
due to positive variances for Supplies, Purchased Services, and
Utilities. Salaries and Employee Bene?ts were over the budget by
relatively small amOunts year to date.

Salaries and Wages ($4,662,118 or 
Salaries and wages continue to exceed the budget at the end of
September. The use of overtime and replacement time for- the

holiday in September contributed to this unfavorable variance.
I Overtime is being monitored by the system management and is
used to ?ll staf?ng needs. There are a large number of staff
positions that remain un?lled and these vacancies create the need
to use overtime.

Stroger Hospital 1s over budget year to date for salaries and wages
and Provident Hospital and Oak Ferest Hospital are below budget.

Benefits- ($834, 519 or 
The level of Bene?t expense is directly related to salary and wage 
expense. Bene?ts for employees are over budget because salaries

and wages are also in excess of budget.

Supplies $20,197, 413 or 16. 4%

Each of the System facilities supply expenses are below the budget
year to date. The System 1S still using the accrual convention to

measure Supply expense based on the actual expenditures at the

end of the period plus 40%.

Purchased Services, Rental, and Other- $36,563,402 or 29.1%
The year to date level expenses for the SyStem for this c-ategory
continues to be signi?cantly below thebudget. The method used

to estimate expense is the same for purchased services-as is used-
for supplies. -

- Utilities- $2,692,841 or 15.3%

The estimated System year to date expense for utilities 1n total 15
below the budget. The most favorable utility expense performance
as compared to the budget 18er Stroger Hospital. Expenses for -
utilities at Stroger-are below the budget by $2,437,500 or 19.2%.
Oak Forest?s utility expense is below the budget by $356,143 or
11. ProVident Hospital?s utility expense is in excess of the
budget by $100, 801 or 

System Expenses per Adjusted Patient Day
A comparison of year to date expenses per adjusted patient day to

the budget 1S as follows.

Stroger $4,035.37 $3,850.66 4.6%
OakForest - $5,148.85 $3,675.88 28.6%-
Provident $5,221.59 1 $3,841.36 26.4%

Non Operating Revenue 
Non operating revenue at the end of September was below budget

by 8% or $34, 347 ,328. The largest shortfall from budget 1s for

sales tax. It is stillexpected that the receipts for sales tax will
increase in October and November. The increased receipts for the
last two months of the ?scal year will be the result of the increase
in the-rate of sales tax thatoccurred on July 1, 2008. The actual 
receipts from the increase will begin to be recorded in the last two
months of the ?scal year. I

The decline in the level of cigarette tax revenue from the level
expected in the budget is notexpected to increase in the remaining
two months of the ?scal year. The decline could be a combination
of factors causing the reduced revenue such as fewer people are
smokers, a decline in the population, and the poor economic 
conditions in Illinois, -

 Cook County Health and Hospitals System

Policy Title: Removing Patient Accounts from Active Accounts
Receivable 

Date: November 21, 2008

Policy:
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System facilities will follow a well de?ned path

to process patient accounts through the collection proCess. Accounts are ?rst established
in the Siemens active accounts receivable ?les. After all collection efforts have been
exhausted accounts are moved to the Siemens Bad Debt System. At the point accounts
are moved to the Siemens Bad Debt System they will be reserved at 100% of their
remaining account balance. Accounts maintained in the Siemens Bad Debt System will
be removed from active accounts receivable and placed in the Siemens Archive ?le on a
basis. The movement of accounts through the system is necessary to reduce ?le
storage costs, improve reporting, and insure the maximum amounts will be collected by
the System. This policy must also be followed to conform with the independent auditor?s
recommendation 1n the 1995 Management Letter to the Bureau of Health. The auditor?s
recommendation was to maintain the Bureau? 5 active accounts receivable ?les to contain
only accounts that are less than three years old. The amount to be removed from
active accounts receivable by the System will be limited to one twelfth of 90% of the
Provision for Bad Debts as reported in the most recent audited ?nancial statements. A
?nal amount, if necessary, of accounts to be removed from active Accounts Receivable
will be presented to the Finance Committee for approval after the completion of each

year?s independent audit.

Procedure:

1. reduction of Bad Debt System files- Each month a number of accounts

that exist in the Siemens Bad Debt System should be removed from the system

and placed in the Archive ?le. Accounts that exist in the Siemens Bad Debt
system are accounts that have already been processed through the normal .
accounts receivable collection efforts that include in some cases a referral to a
collection agency and a subsequent return to the System after an unsuccessful
attempt to collect the balance by the agency. These accounts will be fully
reserved as uncollectible and the removal from the Bad Debt System 15 a ?le
maintenance function. 

2. Medicare Cross Over Bad Debts and other Medicare Bad Debt Accounts -
Medicare requires accounts to be removed from the system if they are to be
claimed as reimbursable bad debts from Medicare. The accounts removed from
the Bad Debt System will be moved to the Siemens Archive File. A list of these
accounts will be maintained by the Patient Accounting Department to include

with the Medicare Cost Report.

3. Insurance account balances greater than three years old. Accounts with
balances that are three years old, have been determined to be uncollectible, and
can not be billed to a patient are to be moved to the Siemens Bad Debt System on
a basis for transfer to the Siemens Archive File.

4. Annual clean up of files in excess of the amounts At the point the
audited ?nancial statements are presented to the Finance Committee if there are
?les without any collection activity that are older than three years an additional
request to perform a ?nal annual clean up'should be presented to the Finance
Committee for approval. The request comes to the Finance Committee with a
report documenting the need for the additional authorization to remove patient
accounts from the active accounts receivable of the System.

Cook County Health and Hospitals System

Policy Title?: Processing Self Pay Accounts, L.O.L. Accounts,
and Bad Debt Accounts. 

Date: November 21, 2008

Policy:
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System will employ all efforts to qualify patients

?rst for coverage under the Medicaid or other programs that may be available to pay for
patient serviCes. If patients do not qualify for Medicaid or other programs that can pay
for their services they will be evaluated to- see if they qualify for discounted services 
under the Cook County L.O.L. program. If the patient is determined to be a self pay
patient or a patient provided a discount under the L.O.L. program the System will attempt
to collect amounts due to the System from the patient. The System Will follow a de?ned
process in the collection of self pay accounts to maintain system file sizes to save data
storage costs, improve the ability to accurately report on the status of accounts receivable,
and msure that collections are maximized.

Procedure: 7
All self pay accounts which include accounts associated with the L.O.L. program are to

be processed through the Siemens system. The process to be followed is to insure thata
reasonable effort is made to collect from all patients that can pay for their services. The
System facilities will process all self pay accounts as follows:

1. Patient balances less than $2.00 All self pay patient balances less than $2.00
will be reduced to zero by the use of an automatic administrative allowance code.
The impact of reducing the accounts receivable balance to zero through the use of
an administrative allowance code will reduce the income in the period and reduce
the accounts receivable balance at the same time. These allowances are not

treated as Bad Debts. The System is reducing these balances to zero because the
estimated cost of collection is greater than the potential cash collections for
amounts less than $2.00.

2. Patient balances less than $10.00 All self pay patient balances less than $10.00
will receive one patient statement. Patients will receive this statement 30 days
after the date of service. At the 60th day after service if the balance of less than
$1.0 00 remains unpaid it will be removed from the active accounts receivable and
recorded 1n the Siemens Bad Debt system. The impact of this transaction will be
to reduce the active accounts receivable and reduce the balance sheet reserve for
bad debts.

3. Patient balances greater than $10.00 All self pay patients withbalances
greater than $10.00 will receive at least three statements. The patient will receive
the ?rst statement at 30 days after the date of service. A second statement will be

sent at 60 days after the date of service if there is a balance due on the account. A
third statement will be sent to the patient at 90 days after the date of service if
there is still a balance due from the patient. At 120 days after the date of service
if thereis still a balance due from the patient and there has not been any payment
activity in the last thirty days the account Will be referred to the collection agency.
The impact of the transaction Will be to remove the account from the active self
pay patient accounts receivable and record it in the active collection agency
accounts receivable.

4. Patient balances greater than $10.00 with payment activity? For self pay
accounts where there has been payment activity in the last 30 days a statement
with the remaining outstanding balance will be sent to the patient after the last
payment made has been recorded in accoums receivable. If additional payment
activity is not posted to the system in 30 days from the last statement the account
maybe referred to the collection agency depending on the size of the remaining
patient pay balance. The impact of this transaction will be to remoVe the account
from the active self pay accounts receivable and record it in the active collection
agency accounts receivable. 

5. Patient balance accounts returned from the collection agency All accounts
returned from the collection agency as uncolleCtible will be recorded in the
Siemens Bad Debt system and removed from the aetive collection agency
accounts receivable. The impact of this transaction will be to remove the account
from active accounts receivable and reduce the balance of the balance sheet
reserve for bad debts.

Special Processing

1. Balances for patient amounts after Medicare payments Patient balances for
remaining amounts due after Medicare payments will follow the self pay process
With several exceptions.

a. Patients eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid Patients accounts with
balances after Medicare has made payment will be billed to Medicaid. If
Medicaid does not pay the account the account will be removed from the active
accounts receivable and placed in the Medicare Bad Debt Accounts Receivable.
The balance will not be referred to the collection agency The System should
receive payment from Medicare for this category of accounts. These accounts are
termed Medicare/Medicaid Cross over Bad Debts. Cross Over Bad Debt accounts
will be reimbursed through the Medicare settlement process.

b. Balances due from patients after Medicare payments Patient pay balances
for patients covered by Medicare who are not eligible for Medicaid are to be
processed through the self pay collection cycle. If small balance accounts can not
be placed with a collection agency and the patient has received three statements
from the System facility through the data mailer series the accounts are to be
removed from the active accounts receivable and placed in the Medicare Bad
Debt Accounts Receivable. These accounts should be reimbursed by Medicare.
All self pay amounts after Medicare pays that can be placed with a collection

agency must be placed with the collection agency and returned to the Bureau as
uncollectible before Medicare will reimburse the account as a Medicare Bad Debt.
At the point the collection agency returns the account as uncollectiblethe account
Will be removed from the active collection agency accounts receivable and placed
in the Medicare Bad Debt Accounts Receivable. Medicare should reimburse the 
System for these accounts through the settlement of the Medicare Cost Report.

The Bureau of Health currently has a contract with Gareda Diversi?ed

Business Service (Contract #08-41-140) to provide nurse registry
services. Cermak requests an increase to this amount to allow for
additional services to be provided by this vendor.

Justi?cation for
this amendment: The Juvenile Temporary Detention Center IS under contract with two

nurse registries to provide services on an as needed basis. Due to the
inability of the other registry serviCe to supply staff, CHS has relied
upon Gareda to satisfy the need for nurses. There has and will not be
any increase in the utilization of registry services as a whole. Rather,
this increase provides for the unanticipated use of one agency versus

the other.

Executive Summary



 

 

As the safety net hospital for the indigent residents of Cook County,

is de endent upon State, Federal, Public and Private sources for
the funding 0 patient care

- Optimizing revenue streams from third party payers through appropriate

financial counseling and eligibility determination is a mission imperative for
publicly funded organizations

MedAssets review of processes revealed significant opportunity
for improvement. Our Independent assessment results are consistent with
those documented by all reviews performed prior to MedAssets arrival.

- Current approaches to this function are disjointed, lack appropriate policy and

procedural structure, technological capability and human capital to perform
effectively.

MedAssets recommends complete restructuring of the financial counseling
function at Adoption of MedAssets recommendations wull result
In:
- Patient centric approach
- Sustainable return on investment

- Rapid implementation

Current State

Currently attempts to enroll uninsured patients in Medicaid utilizing a complicated
combination of internal department efforts and four eligibility vendors

Results from this structure are less than optimal

 

- Internal departmental performance in terms of conversion rates are not available as
there is a complete absence of any data tracking controls or reporting. Our detailed

account analysis revealed significant deficiencies in the timeliness, completeness
and accuracy of work performed.

- Vendor success rates are adversely influenced by referral process design inefficiency

Disability specific vendors? conversion rate is 40% of all referred cases

- x. .- ram 219' 1

Non Disability vendors? conversion rates are between 4% and 22% of all .
referred cases

- The Outpatient population at is grossly underserved within the current
process model as comprehensive screening is conducted on less than 15% of the
patient volume and the conversion results of this limited screening practice are not
tracked

- Outpatients are not referred to vendors

The Proposed Approach

MedAssets proposes addressing the numerous issues adversely impacting eligibility
performance today by:

Ensuring full accountability and optimal results by selecting an eligibility service
company to meet comprehensive set of eligibility needs

Eliminating the loss (opportunities ?falling through the cracks?) associated with
multiple hand-offs involving multiple vendors and 

Addressing the disability opportunity in a comprehensive manner at all locations, not
just Stroger Hospital

Addressing the OB opportunity in an efficient manner

For the first time, addressing the outpatient opportunity at all facilities in a best
practice manner

Taking full advantage of having one party address charity care (LOL) at the same
time as all potential paying programs are addressed to provide an improved level of
service to patients. . .one interview from one party for all programs

Summary

Goal is to optimize revenue streams using a patient centric approach

with an improved return on investment with a rapid implementation

The current process does not allow to accomplish these goals -

The plan is to improve financial performance by centralizing Financial
Counseling and Patient Registration activities

Successful implementation of this plan includes maximizing resources

by strategically managing and co-sourced Revenue Cycle
operations

Patients will now have a ?one-stop shopping? experience for Financial
Counseling and Registration
