Julian C. Madison Buildinq, LLC Casino Loan Program/Resident Fund Loan
Modification

Ms. Hundley advised that the Julian C. Madison Building, is a 62,128 sq. ft.,
office building located at 1420 Washington Boulevard. The historic 7-story building was
January 22, 2019

500 Griswold,Suife 2200 DefrOiT,MiChigCtn 48226 (313) 963-2940

buiit in 1909. Julian C. Madison purchased the building and an adjacent parking lot in
1987, partially with funds from the Downtown Development Authority. The building has
been and is one of the main anchors of viability along Washington Boulevard for almost
30 years. it remains one of the few buildings owned by an African American woman in
Downtown Detroit.

The JCMB is managed by Julian C. Madison Building, LLC with its sole
member being Sharon Madison. She is a 3rd generation businesswoman in a company
started by her grandfather, Robert Madison. She has also served the people of Detroit by
participating on numerous governing boards such as the Downtown Development
Authority, Detroit Economic Growth Corporation and the National Women?s Business
Councii. Her vision for the JCMB involved creating a physical legacy to the pioneering
entrepreneurial spirit of her grandfather and father.

The building has housed various office tenants through the years. The City of Detroit
occupied the majority of the floors in the building from 2000 untii 2013. The tenants were
Detroit Water Sewage and Detroit Transportation Company for the People
Mover In 2010 DWS moved out of the property and in 2013 DTC moved out.
These tenants represented 80% of the rentable space of the building. The moves took
place in the middle of the economic financial downturn and Detroit?s bankruptcy, thus
creating major chailenges and changes for the property. Sharon Madison and herfamily
used their own cash to keep the building viable. Madison overcame these challenges and
in 2013 sought reiief and financing from invest Detroit. The financing from invest Detroit
provided funds to initiate several building performance improvements. The improvements
would reestablish the viability of the building, thus uitimateiy restoring it to its best use and
generating cash flow. Madison also engaged the services of Avison Young Real Estate
Brokers to attract new tenants. Most of the current leases were signed in 2015 and 2016,
significant tenants have been added, resulting in significant lease income.

Although the building has been updated, further revitalization was needed to be that
entrepreneurial hub that attracts a diverse tenant base. Total restoration, revitalization
and full lease capacity is the goal. Major needs for the building include, but are not limited
to, energy efficiencies and tenant and common-area improvements.

in 2017 the Economic Development Corporation and Invest Detroit were
approached to provide financial assistance for the restoration and revitaiization of JCMB.
In January 2017, EDC approved a loan in the amount of $750,000.00. The interest rate
was 6% with a 20?year amortization. The loan matures in 2020. invest Detroit also
approved an additional loan in the amount of $700,000.00 with a maturity date of 2020.
The EDC and invest Detroit share a mortgage lien on the building and share a personal
guaranty from Sharon Madison. The outstanding balance of the EDC loan is $579,250.78.
The total outstanding balance of both Invest Detroit loans is $1,389,189.00. JCMB, LLC
is current in remitting loan payments and required loan documentation.

in November 2018, EDC and invest Detroit were approached by JCMB, LLC with a request
that invoived sharing the lien position with a third party. Sharon Madison has an
outstanding pending federal tax liability. She has also procured a viable cash flow tenant
that requires additional buildout space and is also in need of further financing that will
complete the remaining unfinished building space.

January 22, 2019

A commitment has been secured from Main Street and First independence banks. They
will originate 3 loan to finance the tax liability, the buildout of 9300 sf tenant space for
GSA/Census Bureau and complete the remaining building unfinished space. The banks
are requesting to share our mortgage lien. Conditions of Invest Detroit and EDC sharing
the mortgage lien position with Main Street Bank and First independence Bank wili be
subject to the following: an inter-creditor agreement between the lending group, excess
cash flow recapture above DSC 1.25): spiit 50?/o/50% between JCIVIB, LLC and lending
group, (lending groups portion will be split prorate) and an assignment of Sharon?s
membership interest in JCMB, LLC.

Sharon Madison, in maintaining the building and her family legacy, has experienced
substantial hardship over the past years. At a time when most property owners were
vacating downtown through bankruptcy, foreclosure and short sales, she stood firm and
maintained the property ownership. She has funded operating expenses with minimum
rental revenue, provided buildout to sign new tenants and sought and received financial
assistance to revamp an aging buiiding. Some of those revamps include new plumbing,
heating, air condition systems and energy efficient windows. The property is now a
functional modern building that is attractive to lease. Some current tenants are Level One
Bank, Bamboo Detroit and Duo Security. In 1St quarter 2019 the US Census will be moving
in. The building is currently 90% leased and rental income projections are at for
2019. A recent appraisal valued the building at $10,500,00000. JCMB, LLC will also
work with Invest Detroit, Main Street and other financial institutions to re?nance debt at
maturity.

Staff believes the following factors support the loan transaction: first, the strength and
tenacity of Sharon Madison that enabled her to keep her family?s legacy, second,
increased occupancy of the building, including the GSA/Census tenant for the next two
years, third, positive momentum of new tenants, fourth, current tenants using the building
for additional services, fifth, additional cash flow, sixth, appraised value of the building and
seventh, re?nancing of debt to pay-off the EDC loan.
