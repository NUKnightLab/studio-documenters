OFFICE OF THE COUNTY TREASURER
APPROVAL OF PAYMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 1, 2000 from
MARJA PAPPAS, County Treas urer, Cook County Treasurer's Office
I have been advised by the Purchasing Agent that purchases for printing services (paper, envelopes and
brochures), which are necessary to meet the statutory obligations of this office with regard to the issuance of
the tax bills for first installment 1999 taxes and payable on March 1, 2000, did not follow the procedures
established by the Purchasing Department. Identification of the specific purchases is submitted.
My internal rev iew of the facts and circumstances with regard to this iss ue indicate that members of my
staff, without my knowledge, did not process the necessary information to the Purchasing Department on
a timely basis. This lapse prompted them to act in order to meet the statutory deadlines for the issuance
of the tax bill s. I can assure you this will not happen again.
I have directed my senior staff to closely monitor purchasing requirements and to communicate any
problems to the Purchasing Agent directly, rather than to individual staff members.
I am requesting your approval of payments on the following purchases.

Chairman Daley announced that the ord inance was re-distributed today because two pages we re missing
when it was o riginally distributed. Chairman Daley also identified that the responses from the Purchasing
Agent to Commissioner Hansen's questions relative to the proposed ordinance was re-distributed on
February 7, 2000.

928

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2000
Commissioner Hansen asked Patrick McFadden, County Purchasing Agent, fo r a brief overview of the
proposed ordinance amendment.
Mr. McFadden reviewed the contracts for the last twelve months in order to make a determi nation of the
fiscal impact. It was detennined that often the recycled product is less of an expense than a non-recycled
product. The substantive impact was on recycled paper, carpeting and paper manufactured without using
chlorine. The carpeting amounted to an additional expense of $100,000.00, although the carpeting itself
was substantive at $1.4 million worth of carpeting. The paper reflected an add itional $26,000.00 on top
of a spread of $63,000.00 over and above the non-recycled paper. The additional expense for chlorinefree paper was $23,000.00 on top of the $63,000.00 totaling $86,000.00. The net effect of the ord inance
is $ 126,000.00, mostly in carpet and recycled paper manufactured without c hlorine.
Commissioner Hansen stated this expenditure is certainly warranted, especially with respect to chlorinefree paper. Commissioner Hansen asked to be added as a co-sponsor of this Ordinance. He asked how
does the County handle the recycling of the refuse stream coming out of the County? He suggested a
comprehensive look at this refuse stream.
Commissioner Quigley thanked Chainnan Daley because this item is an extension of an ordinance that
was previously passed and sponsored by Chairman Daley, which has brought the County to a 53% rate of
purchasing recycled paper. He thanked Mr. McFadden for his efforts in helping to craft the ordinance.
Commissioner Quigley indicated that there are representati ves present from the Illinois Recycl ing
Coalition and Illinois Recycling Association who are in full support of the ordinance. He noted that The
National Association of Counties' (N ACo) new initiative is " Counties purchasing recycled content." The
County is purchasing recycled content for cost savings, environmental purposes, and job creati on. This
ordinance, Commissioner Quigley stated, will create incentives for new markets. He furt her stated that
seven land-fills in the area will be closing within the next year, and as a result environmental costs and
financial costs wi ll increase. The Commissioner indicated the fastest growi ng part of a municipality's
budget is waste disposal. He stated there is a 25-50% cost reduction if recycling items are taken out of
the waste stream.
Commissioner Sutker stated this is a positive step forward. He indicated there has been a recycling effort
on a regular basis in the Village of Skokie fo r over a decade and it is cost-efficient, useful and serves the
community well. He continued by stating the landfill problem is continuing and that 20% of landfill
capacity will be closing by the end of year 2000.

Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Hansen moved approval of Item No. 231594.
The motion carried.
Note: For the full text of Item 231594 - An Ordinance Amending Chapter 10: The Contracting and
Purchasing Ordinance of Cook County as it was approved and amended please see the Journal of
Proceedings of February 15, 2000 page 764, 00-0-5.

233735

COOK COUNTY TREASURER, by Michael J. Shine, Chief Deputy Treasurer, transmitting
a Communication, dated January I 0, 2000:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to renew Contract No. 99-41-519 with
LASALLE NATIONAL BANK, Chicago, lllinois, to provide lock box services for the first
and second real estate tax installments of fiscal year 2000.
The office has completed a Request for Proposal (RFP) bid process fo r the lock box services
for fiscal year 2000. The office solicited responses from fifty (50) banking institutions
resulting in twelve ( 12) responses. Of the twelve ( 12) responses eleven (11) vendors declined
via a letter and one ( 1) vendor was responsive to the RFP. In general, banks declining
submission of a proposal noted the three (3) following reasons:
I.
2.
3.

Lack of a branch network to provide payment centers.
Lack of an ability to process the volume of payments or to provide specialized
services.
Lack of an abili ty to implement payment processing requi rements.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $360,000.00. Costs w ill be offset through an interest bearing
account. Contract period: February I, 2000 through January 3 1, 200 I. (060 249 AeeouAt).

* Referred to the Committee on Finance on February 2, 2000
C hairman Daley announced that additional backup material had been distributed for Item 233735 from
the Treasurer's Office.
Commissioner Sutker stated the lock box effort has been a success and that this pilot program should be
continued in the future. He asked Tim Dauber, Finance Manager of the Treasurer's Office, if there have
been studies of other counties, such as Lake County, with respect to federally insured banks being sites
fo r any taxpayers to make real estate tax payments.
Mr. Dauber referred the question to Jim Allen, representative of the Treasurer's Office.

93 1

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDI NGS FOR MARCH 9, 2000
Mr. A lien answered there has been research and there are major problems. He noted that the most
significant problem under the Lake County system is the banks do not have to tender the receipts that they
receive from the taxpayers for up to I 0 days. As a result, the banks receive potentially I 0 days interest on
those property taxes. Conservatively, if the interest rate was 5% the County would potentially be ceding
$10 million in interest earnings.
Commiss ioner Sutker asked if Cook County is bound to a I 0 day period with LaSalle National Bank?
Mr. Allen responded no, Cook County is not bound to a ten day period.
Comm issioner Sutker asked how LaSalle National Bank pays interest?
Mr. Allen answered the interest is required to be credited into an interest bearing account.
Commissioner Sutker stated that LaSalle National Bank is earning interest on the County's interest as
well. Commissioner Sutker asked what other major problems exist.
Mr. Allen stated that there is a problem in the document provisions. Currently, in Lake County the banks
involved do not provide any copy of the front of the taxpayer's check. Lake County has run into
problems where there are duplicate payments. Mr. Allen received information from Lake County
Treasurer, Robert Skidmore, regarding problem s with the banks in Lake County not being equipped to do
imaging. Mr. Allen proceeded to state that Cook County does receive the front image and corresponding
image of the PIN number to which payment was appl ied to, to help detect error or settle any dispute.
Commissioner Sutker stated that this is different than what he has heard and asked for something in
writing from Lake County referencing what Mr. Allen expressed. He asked what are the other problems?
Mr. Allen remarked in Lake County there are 200,000 PIN numbers and approximately 50 participating
banks, while in Cook County there are 1.5 million PIN numbers and 191 banks. He noted there are
col lateralization issues, where community banks are required to have certain leve ls of col lateral in order
to be taking in this money. The banks must show in excess of 100%.
Mr. Allen expressed that the lock box is an important first step in enhancing investment performance and
customer service. He indicated that RFPs were sent to 50 banks and I 2 responses were received and 11
banks declined to participate in this venture.
Commissioner Sutker asked why I I banks declined to participate?
Mr. Allen stated that the responses can be provided to the commissioners. For example, he expressed that
some banks were not ready, did not have the ability to handle such transactions or were transferring
technology and equipment at thi s time.
Commissioner Sutker was disturbed with the County Treasurer's Office brochure listing LaSalle National
Bank locations on the back. He stated there must be a way that the County can provide a service
conveniently to the county 's taxpayers which would include all federally insured banks that are equipped
and wil ling to participate in this program . The Treasurer's goal should be to include more federa lly
insured banks.

932

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2000
Mr. Allen stated that the Treasurer's goal is to include all banks for more convenience and has even been
exploring currency exchanges, in the communities that have no community banks. A long term goal is to
allow taxpayers to pay on the internet. The Treasurer's Office wants to provide as many different options
as possible for the taxpayer.
Commi ssioner Sutker asked what is the interest that the County receives from LaSalle Bank on the
amount of money that is kept in the lockboxes during the period of time they retain the sums?
Mr. Allen commented that LaSalle National Bank was a key component in increasing interest earnings.
Peter Karahalios, Legal Counsel/First Deputy Treasurer, Treasurer' s Office, stated that the way the
accounts are structured is that the money goes from LaSalle Bank into a concentration account. The
concentration account is swept into a Repo Account, earning 200 basis points more than the NOW
account. The rate of return is approximately 5.2 to 5.3%.
Commissioner Sutker stated that LaSal le Bank acquires its profit from that amount above 5.2% which it
can generate using those dollars for investment.
Mr. Karahalios stated LaSalle Bank is making the amount that they are able to charge the County given
the number of PIN numbers that go through the lock box.
Commissioner Sutker stated the County should find a way to use this program as a spring board to a more
generic program to expand services. This program will let the banks compete with each other, w ith
respect to the services they provide to their customers. The Treasurer's brochure sends the wrong
message to the public, banks and taxpayers. The County should not look like it is favoring LaSalle
National Banks.
Comm issioner Lechowicz stated there was a memorandum distributed from Chairman Daley 's Office, to
the Commissioners. The memorandum originated from Treasurer Pappas and Grace Colbert of the
Budget Department as a correction on the Estimated Fiscal Impact for this item.
Commissioner Lechowicz, seconded by Comm issioner Sutker, moved to amend the Estimated Fiscal
Impact with respect to Item 233735, as follows: $360,000.00 $0.00. (Costs of this service is estimated at
$360,000.00 and will be offset through compensating balances through an interest bearing account).
Contract period : February I, 2000 through January 31, 200 I. (060 249 Aee0t1At).
Commissioner Hansen asked how the $500,000.00 and $360,000.00 figures relate on Item 233735?
Mr. Dauber responded that the $500,000.00 was put together for the budget. It was only an estimate;
what is needed is to complete the second installment transactions from the lockboxes to get a more
accurate number, to base the fi gures for year 2000. The way that this wi ll be paid is $360,000.00, but it
wi ll not be charged to an appropriation account. It will be charged to the "A Fund" Account.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the Treasurer's Office cannot obligate $360,000.00 to come from the A
Fund Account without the Board's approval. Ultimately, the County is paying this amount. He asked if it
can be zeroed-out?
Mr. Dauber indicated when the Treasurer's Office was goi ng through the budgetary process, it requested
that $500,000.00 be placed in the Appropriations Account 249. The Treasurer's Office was directed not
to do so and it was in the best interest of the County to leave it the way it was, paid outside of the C Fund
Account. He stated that it is paid out of the A Fund Account. The reason why the item is on the agenda
before the Board is to inform the Commissioners that the Treasurer's Office wi ll be handli ng it this way.
He noted the A Fund Account is not under the authority of the Board.

933

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2000
Commissioner Hansen asked if the State's Attorney' s Office could address the Committee on this issue
regarding Item 233735.
Kathy Howlett, Assistant State' s Attorney , responded that she would like to review this issue and will
respond in writing.
Commi ssioner Hansen voiced his concern, regarding whether the County is allowing a bank to charge
hidden fees.
Commissioner Lechowicz stated that the fi scal impact of thi s program is being shifted out of the taxing
portion of the budget to an interest bearing A Fund Account, and the Treasurer's Office is seeking the
Commissioner' s approval.
Commissioner Hansen stated that I 0% of all property tax revenue goes to Cook County and so I 0% of
the cost goes to the County as well. He stated if there is a $360,000.00 charge to be levied through
receiving less money then this is a cost passed on by the Treasurer' s Office. He asked what is the
statutory basis for this?
Mr. Dauber answered that the Treasurer' s Office does not believe it has sole authority over this issue.
The Treasurer' s Office did an RFP to comply with the Board ' s request. The A Fund Account does not
have an appropriation account fo r this to be charged to, however, there will be a cost incurred of
$360,000.00.
Commissioner Hansen expressed interest in all revenues generated by any and all funds in the Treasurer's
Office to the degree that those revenues are impacted by charges. He asked Tom G laser, Chief Financial
Officer, to address the committee as to where does the $360,000.00 expenditure appear in the County ' s
Budget?
Chairman Daley noted fo r the members, that the letter requesting an amendment to Item 233735 is also
signed by the Director of the Department of Budget & Management Services, Grace Colbert.
Mr. Glaser stated $360,000.00 is a cost estimate based on the volume of transactions processed by
LaSalle National Bank. It is a compensating balance.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the net figure? For example, if $720,000.00 is generated, the cost is
$360,000.00, the net revenue figure is $360,000.00. The request from the Treasurer' s Office cannot
reflect a fisca l impact of zero.

Commissioner Lechowicz, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the Chief Financial
Officer submit a report to the committee, as far as the status of the funds. Included in the report
should be what is involved in the funds and which are approved and not approved by the Board. If
the funds are not approved, there should be an ordinance prepared by the Chief Financial Officer,
requesting that all funds be approved by this Board for any type of expenditures. The motion
carried.
Commissioner Lechowicz commented that this would alleviate Commissioner Hansen 's concern about
the A Fund possibly being spent w ithout Board authorization.
Commissioner Steele indicated there are communities within Cook County where LaSalle Bank has no
presence. Commissioner Steele hopes that other financial institutions are added to accommodate all
citizens in the next fiscal year.

934

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2000
Commissioner Hansen stated that good government finance practices should show gross revenues and
fees should be netted-out afterwards. Fees shown should be shown as they are paid by the Treasurer.
Commissioner Collins asked to look at all agencies that are not taxing bodies to ensure that no
departments have a fund that they can dip into at their discretion. She wants a report showing the source
of the funds to all departments.
Chairman Daley clarified that the request made by Commissioner Lechowicz will include all departments.
Commissioner Hansen stated concern of potentia l taxpayers s uits by charging a fee on collecting receipts.
There needs to be statutory authority. If there is a charge of$360,000 to collect $7 billion, there has to be
adequate authority.
Chairman Daley commented that Assistant State's Attorney Howlett wi ll guide the comm ittee on
Commissioner Hansen's concern.
Com missioner Silvestri asked what is the A Fund Account income over the last year?
Mr. Dauber answered $I 4, I 00,000.00 in interest earnings for Fiscal Year 1999.
Commissioner Si lvestri asked if the additional earnings were based on interest of deposits of tax
payments?
Mr. Dauber answered in the affirmative.
Commissioner Silvestri asked how much of the $14,100,000.00 earnings were spent?
Mr. Dauber answered that nothing was spent in Fiscal Year 1999. It was a budgetary item (060-249)
within the C Fund. The Treasurer's Office was directed to pay for this out of the interest income from the
A Fund Account in the Fiscal Year 2000 Budget. The $ 14. I million is a pass through. The $ 14. I million
went to the taxing bodies and agencies.
Commissioner S ilvestri commented that this item should not be used as an example. The committee has
seen items similar to th is originating from other offices. Often times, a fiscal impact of zero means this is
being paid out of some other source, even though it may not have an impact on the budget.
Commissioner Goslin indicated that a fiscal impact of zero would be misleading. There should be a
process open to all banks and e liminate the perceived favored status of LaSalle Banks. He pointed out
that hi s district borders 3 different counties where other banks work with various systems. He noted that
McHenry County will be opening a cyber account next year and perhaps that should be another avenue to
purs ue.
Commissioner Quigley echoed Commissioners Sutker's and Goslin's comments, to expand the program
to include additional banks. He stated the Treasurer's original request to place this item in the budget was
a better approach.
C hairman Daley asked Grace Colbert, Director of the Department of Budget and Management Services,
to address the Finance Committee.
Commissioner Lechowicz referenced a letter, ori ginating from Treasurer Pappas and Grace Colbert, as a
correction to the Estimated Fiscal Impact and inquired if Ms. Colbert agreed w ith the letter?

935

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2000
Ms. Colbert agreed there is a zero estimated fi scal impact. She commented the historical practice has
been to administer the lock box through a compensating balance arrangement. There has never been a
disbursement or cost related to it.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked how much money is in the different accounts and do they come before
the County Board fo r approval of any type of expenditure?
Ms. Colbert stated that she could not answer the question because s he sees the budget only within the
context of the C Fund.
Commissioner Lechowicz commented that since this practice has been used in the past, does she have any
concerns regarding legal issues?
Ms. Colbert answered that a legal person should res pond to that question, however, this is a historical
practice.
Commissioner Hansen asked ifthe cost for this service had ever been in the budget?
Ms. Colbert responded in the negative to Commissioner Hansen's question, there is no cost as far as the
budget is concerned.
Comm issioner Hansen commented that there is a cost associated with this program, that th is is not a
minimum balance situation. Commi ssioner Hansen asked if the Board has been info rmed of the
mi nimum balance requirements and what it entails? He further asked if Ms. Colbert has been informed of
the composition of the minimum balance.
Ms. Colbert responded that she d id not know what the minimum balance requirements are and what
services are provided. This is outside the purview of the budget.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that this is a systematic problem. He said if the system needs reform, it
should be addressed as a whole.
Chairman Daley expressed caution in deferring Item 233735. He further stated that a precedent may be
set for all departments that present an item which reflects an estimated fiscal im pact of zero. Moreover,
the Budget Director has not onl y concurred with this matter, she also signed off on it.
Mr. Allen stated deferring the item will delay the program and it will become costly in terms of lost
interest earnings . A delay will cause the County to return to pre-lock box days. Commi ssioner Hansen
s uggested that Item 233735 be approved contingent upon receipt of the opini on from the State's
Attorney's Office.

Commissioner Ca rr, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved to defer consideration of Item
233735. Following discussion, Commissioners Carr and Hansen withdrew their motion.
Chairman Da ley formally made the request to the State's Attorney 's Office for a legal opinion with
respect to Item 233735.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Lechowicz, moved to approve Item 233735
contingent upon receipt of an opinion from the State's Attorney's Office. The motion carried.
Commissioner Hansen moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Carr.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2000
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Audit of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Tuesday, January 25, 2000 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building,
118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following item(s) and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
Following the cal l of the meeting, Chairman Daley stated that questions had been submitted to various
departments and e lected officials on the agenda items. The Chairman requested copies of the responses
and questions be submitted to the Secretary to the Board and placed in the record as submitted to the
Comm ittee's report. Chairman Daley then recogni zed Commissioner Hansen.
On a matter of old business, Commissioner Hansen asked if the Chairman had received any
communication from Arthur Andersen or the Treasurer regarding the status of the Treasurer's Office turnover audit report for the year ending November 30, 1998, by Arthur Andersen. Commissioner Hansen
stated he believed the Treasurer had given the Board a target date of Friday, January 21 , 2000 for the
report to be distributed to the Members. Chairman Daley stated he believed the President's Office had
received some type of communication on the issue and called on Tom Glaser to respond on behalf of the
Administration.
Tom Glaser stated that the turn-over audit report was in the process of being completed by Arthur
Andersen. He confirmed that a letter, dated January 13, 2000, from Arthur Andersen to President Stroger
was recei ved and did request assistance in obtaining tax distribution information from the MIS
department. This information is necessary in order to complete the turnover audit report.
Commissioner Hansen asked if there was a response on this matter from the Treas urer's Office regarding
the reason for the delay of the report. The Chair called on Kim Feeney, a representati ve of the
Treasurer's Office, to respond.
Kim Feeney stated the Treasurer' s report had not been forwarded to the Members due to the fact that two
important items needed for the com pletion of the audit have not yet been received. Ms. Feeney cited the
two items as: I) the dummy distribution information from MIS, which allows the Treasurer's Office to
know if there are any items that still need to be distributed or redistri buted to the taxing districts; and 2)
information from the State of Illinois, which Arthur Andersen is working on regard ing monies that could
have been improperly escheated to the State in the past.
Ms. Feeney explained that at the time the Treasurer provided a target date for transmitting the report to
the Board, she had not been informed of any reason for delay and was unaware that Arthur Andersen was
still awaiting the above referenced items and could not com plete the report without the information.
Ms. Feeney stated that she would immediately relay to the Treasurer the Members concerns.
The Chairman then proceeded to the first item on the agenda.
I.

C lerk of the Circuit Court - Child Support Enforcement Division, Financial Report for the year
ended November 30, 1997, by Laura A. Burman, County Auditor.

Deferred at the October 26, 1999 meeting.

1009

 JO URNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2000
Referring to a letter, dated October 29, 1999, from Heather Crossley to Commi ssioner Hansen
recommending investing in an automated billing system to a llow the county to improve the tracking and
collection of the admi nistrative fees added on to child s upport payments, Commissioner Lechowicz asked
if the automated billing system had been implemented or whether there was a better tracking method in
place for the admi nistrative fee collections. The C hair called on George Rada, a representative of the
C lerk of the C ircuit Court's Office, to respond.
George Rada stated the Circuit Court Clerk's Office does not have an automated billing system, but has
implemented the Auditor's recommendations, in terms of developing and maintaining internal written
policies and collection proced ures. He explained that the offi ce sends out three billing notices, wh ich
references the statutory req ui rements to the obligors, in an attempt to collect the child support
administrative fee. Mr. Rada stated when those letters are neglected, the Circuit Court Clerk's Office
consults with and re lies on the State's Attorney' s Office for enforcement of the collections.
In response to Commissioner Lechowicz's question, regarding why the office had not yet implemented an
automated billing system and the reason for the delay in resolving this matter since thirteen million
dollars in uncollected administrative fees date back to January of 1996, George Rada stated the C ircuit
Court Clerk' s Office did contact the State's Attorney ' s Offi ce as recommended by the Auditor to
determine the best action to take and is awaiting a res ponse on what recourse the office has in terms of
collecting the past years delinquent fees as well as what can be done to enforce the payment of future
collections.
Mr. Rada stated the office has consulted with Pat Dri scoll from the State's Attorney's Office and is
awaiting a response on whether to pursue an automated billing system, a private collection agency,
e nforcement through the State's Attorney ' s Office, and/or a change in the statutory authority to allow the
administrative fee to be court ordered. Mr. Rada noted that the office is anxious to resolve the collection
problem and is waiting to review the State' s Attorney ' s recommendations.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked if Mr. Rada could confirm if there was a person from the State' s
Attorney' s Civil Division assigned to enfo rce the administrative fee. Mr. Rada stated that he believed
there was but no enforcement has been pursued.
On that iss ue, the Chair called on a representative from the State' s Attorney to respond to the question of
what is be ing done to pursue the past years delinquent fees collection and future enforcement of the
county's child support administrative fees.
James Michael Bailey, Assistant State 's Attorney in the Civil Actions Bureau, presented himself to the
members as the indi vidual in the State 's Attorney ' s Office asked to review the coll ection and enforcement
of the county ' s child support administrative fees. Mr. Bailey informed the members that there are two
distinct and separate statutes that permit two separate $36 dollar child s upport administrative and
maintenance fees (citing 750 ILCS 5/7 11 and 705 ILCS 5/27.2.) Mr. Bailey said he needed clarification
from the Auditor regarding which statute the audit re port is referencing when it cites House Bill 277. Mr.
Bailey explained the fee authorized under 750 I LCS 5/7 11 is intended for the county ' s use and stated it
specifies that the court shall order the payor making payments directly to the clerk to pay the clerk a fee at
the rate of $3.00 per month for every month in w hich the chi Id support payment is due and the fee is to be
made semi-annually (on the January i s• and July l " payments) and shall be held in a separate fund by the
Circuit Court Clerk and the contents of which sha ll be paid over to the county treasury, on a monthly
basis or at such period as the county Treasurer shall determine, to re imburse the county for the cost of
ma inta ining the child support enforcement program.

10 10

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2000
Mr. Bailey assumed the confusion involved in the collection of fee authorized under 750 ILCS may be
due to the fact that the Circuit Court Clerk has sought to collect and has asked the State's Attorney to
enforce an administrative fee pursuant to 705 ILCS 105/27.2bb(4). He explained that he has discussed
this matter with individuals in the Circuit Court Clerk's Office and has tried to explain that the fee they
wish to collect under this section of the law is unenforceable. Mr. Bailey noted that this statute only
allows for a permissive fee to be collected by the Clerk that must remain separate and apart from the court
orders and therefore makes it very difficult to enforce. He explained that under 705 ILCS 105/27.2,
subsection bb-4, the Circuit Court Clerk, if authorized by the County Board, may collect an annual fee up
to $36 dollars that shall be in addition to and separate from amounts ordered to be paid as maintenance or
child support and shall be deposited into a separate maintenance child support collection fund of which
the Circuit Court Clerk shall be the custodian, ex-officio, and is intended to be used by the Circuit Court
Clerk to further maintenance and child support. It also specifies that the Clerk may recover an additional
cost incurred in the collection of the annual fee.
Commissioner Lechowicz requested a written response from the State's Attorney as to recommendations
to the Audit committee on how to implement the collection and enforcement of the adm inistrative and
maintenance of chi ld support collection fees.
Jn response to Commissioner Hansen's question, regarding the reason for the high volume of money
being held in the Imprest Bank account, George Rada stated that this amount represents checks or monies
that have been disbursed but were returned to the Clerk's office or not cashed by financial institutions.
Commissioner Hansen asked what the aging was on that account's outstandi ng balance. Mr. Rada stated
that some checks go back to 1991.
Commissioner Hansen requested a year-by-year aging schedule of the outstanding check balance in the
Imprest Bank Account and a legal opinion on the county's obligation to escheat this money.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question, regarding if the county has an escheatment problem
related to this acco unt, George Rada stated that the office is looking into the escheatment issue as it
relates to money attached to pending cases and checks returned by the Illinois Department of Financial
Institutions requesting additional information.
Comm issioner Hansen asked the Auditor, if the county was allowed to hold monies for a length of time
over eight years, or is the county required to escheat the monies to the lllinois Department of Financial
Institutions after a certain number of years. Laura Burman stated that generally escheatments are made on
money held for over seven years. However in regards to money the office reported was returned by the
State, there may be a different protocol the State follows relating to pending cases.
In response to Commissioner Hansen 's question on the status of retrieving information on checks
returned to the office due to a lack of information or an invalid address, George Rada stated that the office
is in the process of improving its procedure used to locate case infonnation as well as to update payees
information when the payment notices are returned due to the obligor moving and not supplying the office
with a forwarding address. In such cases, he noted, the information is not on ly important in the collection
of delinquent county fees, but usually involves non-custodial parents who are also delinquent in their
child support payments to the custodial parent. Mr. Rada stated that the Circuit Court Clerk's Office has
hired an outside consultant to provide the necessary matching record equipment to assist the office with
this new match report system.
Commissioner Hansen requested a written response from the Circuit Court Clerk regarding a target date
for completing the match report and updating the clerk's records system.

1011

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDI NGS FOR MARCH 9, 2000
On a separate issue involving child support, Commissioner Hansen stated that he recently had read that
custodial parents receive an inadeq uate share of the total dollars collected on child support payments
ordered.
Commissioner Hansen requested a report on what share of child support dollars ordered in Cook County
goes to the custodial parent. Commissioner Hansen asked that the committee review the level of support
infonnation at its next meeting and examine the relative success or failure of the child support system.

Commissioner Hansen moved to defer Item 1 to the next meeting of the committee. Seconded by
Commissioner Lechowicz, the motion carried and the item was deferred.
Chairman Daley requested that during the period of deferral the Circuit Court Clerk's Office and
State's Attorney's Office get together with the Auditor in order to complete all requests for
information and to prepare a recommendation on the child support fee collection and enforcement
issue for review by the Audit committee and the full Board.
The Chairman then proceeded to the next item on the Agenda.

BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVlCES, by Ruth M. Rothstein, Chief, transmitting a
Communication, dated September 16, 1999:
This letter is to formally request that the Bureau of Health Services Audited Financial
Statements, related Management Letter, and request for Bad Debt write-off for fi scal year
+998 1995 and prior years be forwarded to the Audit Committee of the Board of
Commissioners for discussion.

Referred to the Audit Committee on November 9, 1999.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regardi ng a statement on page I-Appendi x A, and the
status of the recommendation to increase the $250 purchasing limit, Tom Glaser stated that he had briefed
the President on several options and will come back to the Board with a recommendation on the iss ue.
In response to Commi ssioner Hansen's question, on page 3-Appendix A, regarding an explanation of
what a charge master and charge structure is, Alvin Holley stated that the charge master is simply the
table used fo r different fees that refers to over I 0,000 line items in the charge structure. Mr. Holley noted
that these charges typically relate to various radiology and lab fees and stated that in order to increase
these fees and provide a more detailed report of each fee the charge master needs to be updated.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's questi on regarding a tim e frame for completing the
recommendation, Alvin Holley stated that the Bureau has completed its solicitation for bid proposals and
wou ld be submitting a recommendation on a vendor very soon.
In response to Commissioner Hansen·s question, on page 3, regarding where the aging sched ule was for
the $880 million uncollectable account, the Auditor stated that she had passed this request onto Alvin
Holley along with the other questions she had received from the Commissioner only yesterday. Laura
Bumian stated that the Bureau's responses and request for additional information would be provided to
Commissioner Hansen.
Commissioner Hansen requested information in writing from Alvin Holley regarding the aging schedule
for the $880 million uncollectable debt figure, including the amount associated with each year up to fiscal
year 1998.

101 2

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2000
Commissioner Hansen expressed some concern regarding why $880 mi ll ion in uncollectable debt had not
been cleaned up earl ier, as permitted under the Bad Debt Write-Off Policy. Laura Burman stated that th is
was the first annual write-off since the adoption of the policy by this Body. She pointed out that the
communication before the committee today includes a separate schedule item referred to as the
"Summary of Bad Debt Write-Off for fiscal year 1995 and prior." Ms. Burman noted that the schedule
did not include fiscal years 1996, 1997 and 1998, since collections for these years had not yet been
completed. She stated the Bureau of Health Services was requesting approval of the bad debt write-off
schedule for fiscal year 1995 and prior years. She also noted that from this point forward the committee
would be considering bad debt write-off on an annual basis.
In response to Vice Chairman Gosli n's question regarding a more specific defin ition of the term " prior
years" as used in the summary, A lvi n Holley stated that prior years refers to fiscal year 1994.
Vice Chairman Goslin requested a written copy of the Bad Debt Write-Off Policy approved by this Body
from the Auditor.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding if the $880 million uncollectable figure
includes the bad debt for fiscal years 1994 and 1995, Laura Burman stated that it did.
In response to Commissioner Hansen' s question, on page 5, regardi ng an explanation for the contributed
capital depreciation of $ 19 million, Alvin Holley explained there is certain property in assets that the
county purchased with bond issues. He said the Bureau records such property as fi xed assets and records
the offset as contributed capital. Mr. Holley explained that after the Bureau depreciates that asset, the
contributing capital must be reduced to allow it to be fairly stated and not run against the operating fund.
Mr. Holley stated that the operating fund reflected is strictly for presentation.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question to the Chief Financial Officer of the County regarding
when the county instituted this depreciation policy, Tom Glaser stated that the hospital is required to
depreciate assets in order to do the federal report used to receive Medicare/ Medicaid reimbursement. Mr.
Glaser stated the county had not yet instituted a depreciation policy; however, the hospital did institute a
policy on depreciation.
Commissioner Hansen stated this was the first time he had heard of the hospital's depreciation policy and
noted his concern that the County Board had not approved it. Alvin Holley responded that the hospital's
books are recorded on an accrual basis and with the accrual financial statement you must use
depreciation. Mr. Holley stated that the depreciation guidelines used by the county's hospitals come from
the American Hospital Association, which includes suggested depreciable usefu l life that most hospitals
use in the United States.
Commissioner Hansen requested from the Bureau of Health Services a copy of the depreciation policy
used by the hospital.
In response to Commissioner Hansen 's question regarding an explanation for the deficiency figure of
revenue over expenses showing $38 million, Alvin Holley stated that thi s figu re reflects the bottom line
and is derived from subtracting the $333 million non-operating revenue from the $37 1 million loss from
operations.
Commissioner Lechowicz requested a synopsis of past and current bad debt write-offs, along with a
schedule of future bad debt write-offs for fi scal years 1996, 1997 and 1998. Commissioner Hansen
requested that a percentage or estimate for fisca l year 1999 be inc luded in this information.

1013

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2000

Commissioner Lechowicz moved to amend Communication 232091 on its face, by striking "1998"
and inserting "1995 and prior years", and by striking "Fiscal Year 1998" in the Bureau of Health
Service's summary sheet of the Bad Debt Write-Off schedule. Seconded by Commissioner Hansen,
the motion carried.
Commissioner Lechowicz moved to approve the Bad Debt Write-Off schedule, as amended.
Seconded by Commissioner Hansen, the motion carried and the Bad Debt Write-Off schedule for
Fiscal Year 1995 and prior was approved.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County met purs uant to notice on Friday, February 18, 2000, at the hour of I 0:00 A.M., in the Board
Room, Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Chai rman Hansen stated the purpose of the meeting was to review the Year 2000 legislative program for
each agency of Cook County government, to include the Forest Preserve, the Chicago Botanic Garden,
and the Zoological Society. The Chairman then recognized various representatives from the county
elected offices and agencies.
Chairman Hansen proceeded to discussion of the first item on the agenda.
I. HB 4698 - Public Defender Immunity Act
Vice Chairman Lechowicz urged support of the bill because it would ensure a protection in the courts for
employees in the Public Defender's Office. A recent court ruling removes their immunity thereby
opening employees up to being s ued and increasing the county's liability.

Vice Chairman Lechowicz moved to support House Bill 4698. Seconded by Commissioner Sutker,
the motion carried.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2000
2. SB 1303 - Property Taxes: Objections in Court
Steve Morrill informed the members that Senate Bill 1303 was on third reading in the Senate. He stated
the proposal would allow a ll taxing bodies to intervene in any tax objection case and represent
themselves, thereby relieving the State's Attorney of this duty. Vice Chairman Lechowicz stated concern
with removing the current juri sdiction held by the State's Attorney.
Chairman Hansen called on Gerry Reyes to address any concerns the State's Attorney's office might have
regarding the bill.
Gerry Reyes stated the office had some technical questions regarding how objection procedures wou ld be
implemented. He a lso commented the office was rev iewing the impact on tax objection cases if the
State's Attorney was relieved of hi s duties in such cases. Mr. Reyes noted that a similar proposal was
introduced last year but never made it out of the Rules Committee.
Vice Chairman Lechowicz asked if the Cook County State's Attorney's office opposes Senate Bill 1303.
Gerry Reyes stated the office did not take a formal position on the bill but had opposed it in the past.
Commissioner Sutker suggested that the county's lobbyists request an amendment deleting the text
stating, "the State's Attorney shall be relieved of the defense" and inserting the language, "the State's
Attorney may join in the defense."
Commissioner Sutker asked whether his suggested amendatory language had ever been di scussed or
proposed in the past. In response, Gerry Reyes stated that to date no amendatory language has been
proposed.
In response to Commissioner Daley's question regarding the vote in committee on Senate Bill 1303, Steve
Morrill stated he did not believe there were any objections to the measures in committee. Commissioner
Daley asked if the county took a position on the bill. Steve Morrill stated that the county took no
position.
Commissioner Daley asked if when an elected county official opposes a measure does the county do the
same, Steve Morrill stated that pos itions are only taken when this Body and the Board approve a position.
Commissioner Daley commented on the need for the county to take a position on bills during hearings in
substantive committees. Vice Chairman Lechowicz agreed and stated there needs to be a coordinated
effort by the entire county on al l legislation.
Commissioner Sims asked for information in regards to any action taken on the bill.
Sandra Overberg confirmed that no formal opposition was filed on behalf of the Board or the
Administration in committee.

Vice Chairman Lechowicz moved to oppose Senate Bill 1303. Seconded by Commissioner Daley,
the motion carried.
3. SB 1276 - Property Taxes: Attorneys before Board of Review
Steve Morri ll stated that Senate Bill 1276 passed, without objection this week, out of the Senate Revenue
Committee and is on second reading on the Senate floor. Mr. Morrill stated the proposal would provide,
in Cook County only, that non-attorneys are authorized to represent taxpayers before the Cook County
Board of Review.

1022

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2000
C ha irman Hansen called on the representative of the Board of Review, John Potts, to comment on the bill.
Mr. Potts informed the members that the Board of Review opposed the bill in committee, along with the
Illinois State Bar Association's (ISBA) Real Estate Tax Division. He stated testimony was given
addressing the Board's and ISBA's concerns, but the bill passed out of Senate Revenue this week by a
vote of9 yeas, 2 nays. Mr. Potts stated that currently a roll call of the Senate members is being conducted
and the bill is expected to come up for a vote next week.
In response to Chairman Hansen's question regarding if all three Commissioners on the Cook County
Board of Review opposed Senate Bill 1276, John Potts stated that they did.

Hearing no motion from the members of the committee, the Chair ruled that Item 3, Senate Bill
1276, be deferred.
4. SB 1546 - Property Taxes: Assessment Notices

Noting the committee had been informed earlier that Item 4 was presumably dead, but made aware
that bill could be resurrected in amendatory form, the Chair ruled that Item 4, Senate Bill 1546, be
deferred.
5. SB 1645 - Property Taxes: Mortgage Lender Notices
Steve Morrill stated that Senate Bill 1645 passed out of the Senate Revenue Committee th is week and was
on second reading on the Senate floor. He stated that the proposal would provide, in Cook County only, that
when an assessment increase notice is mailed by the Assessor's office to a mortgage lender, within 5 days of
receipt, the mortgage lender shall mail a copy of the notice to each owner or mortgagor of the property.
Eugene Barnes informed the members that Senate Bill 1645 is an initiative of Assessor Houlihan.

Vice Chairman Lechowicz moved to support Senate Bill 1546. Seconded by Commissioner Daley,
the motion carried.
6. HB 2976 - FOIA: Litigation Records
Steve Morrill stated that House Bill 2976 fai led in comm ittee and is technically "dead" for the session.

Vice Chairman Lechowicz moved to oppose House Bill 2976 and similar provisions that may arise
in the future. Seconded by Commissioner Sutker, the motion carried.
7. H B 113 7 - Elections: Local Primaries
Steve Morrill stated that House Bill 113 7 is currently on the Secretary's desk in the Senate on nonconcurrence and will be subject to a conference commi ttee report. Mr. Morrill informed the commi ttee
that the proposed conference committee report's language is intended to amend the Election Code to allow
new voting equipment (purchased by Cook County and the Chicago Board of Elections) to be used as
intended. Mr. Morrill stated that changes to the Code would allow the voter to directly insert the ballot
into the machine rather than handing it to the e lection judge and the machine would automatically tally
voti ng cards.

1023

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2000
Commissioner Daley asked to hear from Gary Rycyzyn, Director of Elections, Cook County Clerk's
Office. Gary Rycyzy n stated that he had not seen the amendment to House Bill 11 37 but noted that if the
proposal contains changes to the Election Code to allow new voting equipment to be used as approved by
the County Board, he would recommend support.
In response to Chairman Hansen's question regard ing whether the county's election process would be
disrupted if this legislation was not adopted, Gary Rycyzyn stated there would be no disruption. He
explained that the election authorities could still use the new equipment, but with the old election
procedure.
In response to Commissioner Daley's question if the new machines would allow for the rejection of ballot
cards not signed by an election judge, Gary Rycyzyn noted that the election authorities were requested not
to use this feature during the test period.
Steve Morrill further stated that the reason this feature is not being used during the test is due to concerns
relating to ballot security.
Commissioner Daley asked if the issue relating to over-counts was still in the proposal, Steve Morrill
responded that it was not.
Commissioner Daley stated that House Bill 11 37 appears to lack two primary features the County Board
was concerned with when it approved the purchase of the new equipment.
Chairman Hansen asked Gary Rycyzyn if the ballot card does not contain an election judge' s initials,
during the test period, would the ballot be rejected. Gary Rycyzyn stated the equipment does not
currently carry this feature.
Commissioner Sutker stated he was very disturbed at thi s since the board was informed that the pilot
program would include the two features mentioned. He noted the pilot program will accomplish nothing
in terms of testing the intended uses of the new equipment.
Chairman Hansen commented that he was disturbed that the Chairman and committee were not being
full y briefed by lobbyists and representati ves from the elected offices on changes being made by this draft
legislation impacting the county.

Commissioner Sutker moved to defer House Bill 1137. Seconded by Vice C hairman Lechowicz, the
motion carried.
8. SB 1890 - Elections: Absentee Voting

After hearing that the bill had failed to advance to the Senate floor by the February 17, 2000
committee deadline, Vice Chairman Lechowicz moved to oppose Senate Bill 1890 or any similar
provisions that may arise in the future. Seconded by Commissioner Sutker, the motion carried.

Vice Chairman Lechowicz moved to support House Bill 3036. Seconded by Commissioner Daley,

1024

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2000
10. HB 3225 - Counties Code: Sheriffs Merit Board
Eugene Barnes stated that House Bill 3225 was amended the day before in committee to remove language
opposed by the Administration calling for merit board members to receive any wage adjustments
approved by the board for its employees. Mr. Barnes stated that upon adoption of the amendment, the
Administration removed its opposition.
Chairman Hansen stated concern in not receiving any oral or written justification from the Sheriffs Office
on the need for two additional merit board members. He noted also that the membership of the current
Board was at odds with the statue copy provided to the committee.
Ed Carik assured the Members that the changes in the statute, in regards to the Board's salaries and
membership, are permissive since the statute states that each requires the consent and approval of the
County Board.
In response to Commissioner Sutker's question on whether the party affiliation of the Board changes
proportionately with the increase in membership, Ed Carik stated that the statute' s current provisions on
party membership would not change.

Commissioner Daley moved to support House Bill 3225, as amended. Seconded by Vice Chairman
Lechowicz, the motion carried.
Chairman Hansen and Commissioner Sutker voted Present on this item.
11 . SB 1522 - Counties Code: Cell Tower Guidelines

Steve Morrill stated that Senate Bill 1522 is a Metro Counties initiative. He stated that the
telecommunication carriers oppose the discretionary provisions being made mandatory. Mr. Morrill
suggested that Sandra Overberg might have some information on this issue.
Sandra Overberg stated that at the last Metro Counties Association meeting, the bill was mentioned as a
priority initiative of Lake County, which the association supported. She stated that the intent of the bill is
to allow local authorities to protect residential communities and property owners. Ms. Overberg stated
that Cook County has taken a neutral position in the past since zoning and building authority is not
restricted under the statute for home rule bodies.
Vice Chairman Lechowicz requested that a copy of Senate Bill 1522 be sent to the Building and Zoning
Department asking for a written response regarding any impact the bill might have on Cook County.

Vice Chairman Lechowicz moved to defer Senate Bill 1522. Seconded by Commissioner Sutker, the
motion carried.
12. HB 4651 - Employee Wage Deductions for Debt Collection
Chairman Hansen recognized Carl McCormick to make any observation on the bill as it relates to Cook
County Forest Preserve District employees.
Carl McCormick stated that the District had no problems with the provisions and is in favor of House Bill
4651.

Re:

Village of Glenview No-Cash Bid Application for PINS: 04-3 5- I 06-034 and 04-32200-044

We represent the Village of G lenview, which is requesting the assistance of Cook County in
making a no cash bid to acquire two separate properties located within the municipal
boundaries of the Village. The properties are identified by PIN 04-35- I 06-034 (Vol. I 34)
and PIN 04-32-200-044 (Vol. I 34). The properties to be acquired have been tax delinquent
for each of two or more years. After acquiring the property bearing PIN 04-35-1 06-034, the
Vil lage intends to return the property to the tax rolls by conveying it to a developer for a
multi-family residential development. With regard to the property bearing PIN 04-32-200044, the Village wi ll continue to utilize this property as a detention bas in as part of the
Village's storm water management program.
Included with this request are:

*

*

*

Certified copies of Resolutions for each PIN fo rmally requesting the bid;
Current title search for each property;
Sidwell maps for each PIN.
Two photographs of each property.

As the attorneys for the Village we will obtain the tax deeds and the Village will bear al l legal
and other costs associated with the acq uisition of these properties.
Troy Deckert, Department of Planning & Development, stated the Village of Glenview is interested in the
first parcel which contains a storm water pond, and a private developer plans to build a multi-family unit
on the second parcel. Approval of the request will allow the Village to clear back taxes and return the
property to the tax rolls.
Commissioner Collins asked if the Village will acquire the property and clear the back taxes for a private
developer?
Mr. Deckert responded that a developer is building a condominium multi-family building. He stated the
taxes will be cleared so that the developer can develop the area.
Commissioner Collins asked if this is standard procedure?
Mr. Deckert responded the No-Cash Bid process will extinguish all cash liens.
Randy Kemmerer, Assistant State' s Attorney, stated the No-Cash Bid is a payment of taxes. The Village
of Glenview wi ll cancel the certificate that will be payment in full and the taxes are extinguished by
satisfying the tax liens. He commented this process has been approved before on behalf of the Village of
Dixmor. Mr. Kemmerer stated that is an over-the-counter sale and the legal effect is to pay the taxes even
though no dollars change hands.
