3. 832 W. Fulton
27th Ward
Proposed Fulton-Randolph Market District
Adoptive reuse of meat-packing buildings into a mixed-use development including

facades of preliminarily identified contributing structures located at 856 W. Fulton
and 310 N. Green, 2-story new construction, and 1-story rooftop addition.
Action:

The Committee unanimously approved the following findings and the
following conditions:

(A) Find that the structures, a 2-story building constructed c. 1960s located at 832
W. Fulton and the 2-story west side addition attached to 310 N. Green, are
non-contributing to the proposed district and their demolition will not be an
adverse effect;
(B) Find that the two structures, a 2-story building constructed in 1887 and a third
floor added in 1903 located at 856 W. Fulton and a 2-story building completed
in 1904 located at 310 N. Green, are contributing to the proposed district.
The project is not subject to the provisions of Section 2-120-825 of the Municipal
Code of Chicago governing review of permits for the demolition of 40% or more
of any building or structure either designated as a “Chicago Landmark” or located
in any district designated as a “Chicago Landmark”.
Partial Demolition:
1. Due to the deteriorated conditions of the masonry walls and interior wood
frame structure, inadequate load provisions, and highly compressive soil
conditions particular to the subject properties, the proposed demolition of the
east (side) and north (rear) common brick secondary facades of 856 W. Fulton
and demolition of the west (side) and south (rear) common brick secondary
facades of 310 N. Green is approved;
2. A report by a licensed structural engineer addressing the partial demolition of
the structures, relative to how the four historic facades to remain in-situ
should be braced and protected during construction, shall be submitted for
Historic Preservation staff review and approval, as part of the permit plans.

 The recommended measures, sequencing, and protections shall be
incorporated in the structural and architectural drawings.
Exterior Rehabilitation:
3. As proposed and shown on the submitted drawings dated 8/19/14, the historic
street-facades of 856 W. Fulton and 310 N. Green shall be repaired in-situ and
rehabilitated in accordance with the Commission’s standards and guidelines,
including the replacement of missing features as indicated by these drawings;
4. Select portions of the historic street facades that require reconstruction due to
deteriorated conditions shall use salvaged bricks as much as possible. Any
replacement brick and new mortar shall match the historic in size, texture,
color, finish, and profiles;

included with the permit plans. The muntins may be simulated-divided-lites

shall be reviewed and approved by Historic Preservation staff when developed
and prior to order and installation;
New Construction:
9. The proposed roof-top trellis on top of the new 2-story corner structure shall
be eliminated as trellises are not characteristic of the historic and architectural
character of the proposed district;
10. The metal and precast concrete panel cladding for the portion located midblock on Green and the corner facing Wayman and Peoria, which encloses
required parking spaces and back-of-house spaces for the development, shall

with the proportions, depth, and range of color palettes of historic facades in
the proposed district; and,
11. Enlarged exterior wall details and material samples shall be submitted as part
of the permit application and subject to staff review and approval.

that the proposed lowering of the existing punched opening window sills are
on the side elevation facing Peoria, the masonry opening alterations are
approved as proposed;
2. Enlarged dimensioned details of the new steel windows and storefronts shall
be included with the permit plans. The muntins may be simulated-dividedlites but shall have a substantial profile with spacer bars and interior profiles
