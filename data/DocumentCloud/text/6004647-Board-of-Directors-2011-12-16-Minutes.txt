Report from Chairman of the Board (continued)
Honoring Jerry Butler for his twenty-five years of public service as a Cook County Commissioner
Chairman Batts stated that Director Butler recently celebrated his 25th anniversary as a County Commissioner; he
read the following into the record to memorialize the event.
Commissioner Butler was first elected to the County Board in 1985; on December 1, 2011, Jerry Butler
celebrated his 25th anniversary as the Commissioner representing the 3rd District of Cook County.
Commissioner Butler was instrumental in the establishment of single member districts, replacing the atlarge elections for County Commissioners.
Commissioner Butler’s true passion has always been health care for all. He was at the forefront in
building the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital in 2002.
As Chairman of the Cook County Board’s Health and Hospitals Committee, he also serves on the Cook
County Health and Hospitals System Board of Directors, for which we are so grateful for his guidance
and counsel.
On the County Board, we have no stronger advocate or ally than Commissioner Jerry Butler. Please join
me in congratulating our fellow Director and our friend.

Update on recruiting Cook County Health Foundation Board Members
Chairman Batts stated that Lester Crown and Dr. Quentin Young have been previously selected and have agreed
to serve on the Board of the Cook County Health Foundation. Efforts are underway to identify other potential
candidates for the Foundation Board; seven members are needed in total, but at least four are needed initially for a
quorum. Chairman Batts indicated the importance of moving forward on this matter, as there is a potential
benefactor who is interested in donating a large sum of money for the clinics.

A. Board Education – Peri-Operative Work Plan (Attachment #2)
(deferred on November 18, 2011)
Tanda Russell, System Interim Chief Nursing Officer and Director of Peri-Operative Services, provided a
presentation on the Peri-Operative Work Plan. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Ansell requested that the following information be provided at a future meeting: the percentage of
utilization of the operating rooms, and metrics on the time from the decision to do surgery to the time surgical
services are received.
With regard to Director Ansell’s request for information on the percentage of the utilization of the operating
rooms, Ms. Russell responded that utilization is monitored daily; although it varies, and is sometimes tied to
length of the cases, the rate of utilization is approximately sixty to sixty-five percent. Director Ansell noted
that it should be at a rate of eighty to eighty-five percent.

Report from Chairman of the Board
A. Board Education – Peri-Operative Work Plan (continued)
Director Carvalho stated that the metrics should include information relating to communications with the
patient; he noted that at a recent County Board budget meeting, a Commissioner presented an example of a
patient who had contacted the Commissioner when their surgery was canceled, because the patient was unsure
as to what would happen next. Ms. Russell indicated that surgery cancellation information is also monitored;
she stated that there are initiatives underway relating to the customer service components. Dr. Ram Raju,
Chief Executive Officer, stated that he reviews information on patient cancellations on a monthly basis; all of
the canceled cases and reasons for cancellation are presented to him and reviewed with staff. Director
O’Donnell stated that examples of patient cancellations and how they impact patient care should be presented.

VI.

Report from Chief Executive Officer (Attachment #3)
Dr. Raju provided an update on the following subjects: FY2012 Budget; Board of Directors Vacancy; Perinatal
Network Designation; and Leadership Changes. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
Additionally, Dr. Raju noted that management and representatives from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) are
currently reviewing a proposed amendment to the PwC contract. In keeping with Dr. Raju’s intention to
formalize the plan to transition away from PwC, and continue to build on the improvements that have been
initiated, he is working with the management team to present a plan to the Board in January regarding the
proposed amendment.
In this regard, Dr. Raju and the management team are reviewing the initiatives that have been undertaken to date,
and reviewing the invoices for out-of-scope charges. During the next week, Dr. Raju stated that intends to discuss
with the representatives of PwC how best to wind-down the scope and the cost of the contract. In the meantime,
he informed the Board that the System continues to incur certain costs for out-of-scope interim resources in the
way of staff augmentation provided by PwC. The out-of-scope charges for prior months were previously
presented to the Board by the former Chief Financial Officer, Michael Ayres, in the form of a request for approval
of payment only. Rather than present a request for payment only today, it was Dr. Raju’s intention to reach an
agreement on the amount of the current charges for this out-of-scope work, and to seek approval for payment only
from the Board in January. This will be in conjunction with what will be presented with regard to the proposed
amendment, as earlier referenced. Dr. Raju added that he has made it clear that there is a reporting structure
under which contracted vendors report to the respective members of System leadership; this allows for clear
accountability at the System management level.

A. Review of Cook County STAR (Set Targets Achieve Results) Report, 3rd Quarter – June 1 through
August 31, 2011 (copy available upon request)
Dr. Raju presented the 3rd Quarter Cook County STAR Report. He noted that, overall, the quality data is
good; some issues remain, including those relating to patient perception of care and wait times.

RAM RAJU, MD, MBA, FACHE, FACS 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM 
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
December 16, 2011 
 
FY2012 BUDGET 
On  November  18,  2011  the  Cook  County  Board  of  Commissioners  approved  and  adopted  the  FY2012 
Budget  with  sixteen  votes.    Included  in  the  CCHHS  Finance  Committee  Minutes  of  December  9th  is  a 
chart  of  approved  budget  amendments  regarding  the  Health  System.    I  am  grateful  to  President 
Preckwinkle for keeping to her commitment to approving the FY2012 budget prior to the beginning of 
the new fiscal year.  This was truly a collaborative effort, working together in the end produced a budget 
for the Health System that, given the financial shortfall facing the County, is realistic and supports the 
long‐term financial health of the County, while still allowing us to continue to implement our Strategic 
Plan: Vision 2015.   
 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS VACANCY 
On  December  1,  2011  the  County  Legislation  and  Intergovernmental  Relations  Committee  considered 
the  appointment  of  Ruth  Rothstein  to  fill  the  vacancy  of  Andrea  Zopp.    The  appointment  was 
unanimously approved by the committee and the County Board on December 1st.  I welcome Director 
Rothstein back to the Health System  and to the CCHHS Board of Directors.  I look forward to working 
with Ruth and to the insight she will bring to the Human Resources Committee and to the Board. 
 
PERINATAL NETWORK DESIGNATION 
I am very pleased to report that Illinois Department of Public Health has re‐designated Stroger Hospital 
as a Level III NICU and as one of ten Perinatal Centers in the state.   IDPH defines Perinatal Center as a 

Page 20 of 29

 referral facility designated under  the  Regionalized  Perinatal Health Care Code (77  Ill. Adm. Code 640), 
intended to care for the high risk patient before, during, or after labor and delivery and characterized by 
sophistication  and  availability  of  personnel,  equipment,  laboratory,  transportation  techniques, 
consultation and other support services.   
The  Health  System  will  receive  the  official  letter  in  the  next  few  weeks.  The  IDPH  team  was  very 
complimentary and noted our many strengths and vast improvement since their last visit in 2008.  This 
was obviously a group effort but much of the credit for how well we did goes to a core group of people: 
David Soglin, M.D. – Stroger Hospital Interim CMO/Chair of Pediatrics 
Lenny Gibeault – Perinatal Network Administrator 
John Gianopolis, M.D. – Co‐Director of the Perinatal Center ‐ MFM 
Suma Pyati, M.D. ‐ Co‐Director of the Perinatal Center – Neonatology 
Omar LaBlanc – Stroger Hospital Administration 
 
LEADERSHIP CHANGES

development.    Her  accomplishments  also  include  establishing  a  forum  for  nursing  leadership  to  work 
together  across  the  affiliates  which  has  resulted  in  consistency  and  standardization  of  policies  and 
procedures, practice standards and protocols, job descriptions, competency measures, educational goals 
and  programs,  leadership  development  and  development  of  nursing  quality  metrics.    Roz  has  been  a 
pleasure to work with and has helped us improve our care within the Health System.  We thank Roz for 
her leadership and wish her well in her new position.

Tanda to her new role. Also effective December 5, 2011 Carol Schneider, Interim Chief Operating Officer
