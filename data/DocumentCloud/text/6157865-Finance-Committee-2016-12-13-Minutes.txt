 AMENDMENTS
16-0388
Sponsored by: TONI PRECKWINKLE, Cook County Board Of Commissioners
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
PUBLIC UTILITIES
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Title 5, Public Utilities,
Chapter 2, Franchises, Sections 5-2A-1, 5-2A-2, 5-2A-4, 5-2A-6, 5-2A-9, 5-2B-1, 5-2B-2, 5-2B-4,
5-2B-9 and Appendix A of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as Follows:
5-2A-1: - New Licenses.
Upon receipt of a properly completed license application and a non-refundable one thousand five
hundred dollars ($1,000.001,500.00) application fee the Forest Preserve District of Cook County
(FPD) will begin initial administrative processing of the application for consideration by
appropriate FPD staff. FPD Staff shall then review the application and attached plans to
determine the applicable License Review Fee and feasibility of granting the requested license to
the applicant. Applications will be reviewed based on, among other things, the potential damage
construction or operation of the proposed facilities could have on FPD property, location of the
proposed facilities, type of facilities proposed, and number of trees to be impacted. Based on this
review the FPD may reject the request outright or may request revisions to the proposed plans
that would make the proposal acceptable to the FPD. Under no circumstances will licenses be
issued for areas that are dedicated Illinois Nature Preserves, high quality natural areas identified
by the FPD and shown on the FPD's GIS system as "license exclusion zones", or areas covered
by conservation easements.
Sec. 5-2A-2. Acceptable Application and Plans.
If the submitted (or revised) application and plans are found to be acceptable by the FPD staff,
the FPD will draw up a license that, if approved by the Board of Forest Preserve District
Commissioners, would grant the licensee authority to locate, operate, and maintain the facilities
for which the application and plans were submitted. Said license will include, among other
things, the term for which the license will be issued, the fee that the FPD will charge for issuance
of the license, any moneys that will be paid for tree mitigation associated with the license, and
any charges for "out of pocket" expenses incurred by the FPD to determine whether the license is
acceptable. Said license will be forwarded to the applicant for their review and approval before
being submitted to the Board of Forest Preserve District Commissioners (Board) for final
approval. If the applicant decides to withdraw its application after review of the proposed license
or if the Board does not approve the proposed license, the "out of pocket" expenses will still be
due and the FPD will bill the applicant for said expenses. If said fees are unpaid, the FPD will
accept no further license applications from that applicant. Said applicant can regain its
application privileges by paying one hundred (100) percent of the fees owed along with a penalty
fee of fifty (50) percent of the original amount owed. If the license is approved by the Board then
all fees will be paid to the FPD at or before the time the finalized license is delivered to the
Licensee.

 Sec. 5-2A-4. License Fee.
In addition to those special fees as may be recommended by District staff, the fee for licenses
issued under this Article will be determined by multiplying the acres used by the cost per acre.
Acres used will be calculated by multiplying the linear footage shown on the license application
(or revised application) by the width required for future maintenance of the facilities. The
minimum width will be fifteen (15) feet for all licenses regardless of the facilities installed or
location of said facilities. Requests for widths above fifteen (15) feet must include an
explanation justifying the need for additional width. The minimum license fee will be five (5)
percent of the cost per acre for the current year. Additionally, a Youth Education, Land
Acquisition and Restoration (YELAR) Program Fee of five seven and one half (57.5%) percent
of the cost per acre, and a License Review Fee, shall be assessed against all licenses issued. Cost
per acre, minimum license fee, License Review Fee and YELAR program fee figures can be
found in Appendix A at the end of this Article. All fees due will be paid as a lump-sum up-front
one-time payment, unless otherwise approved by the Board.
Sec. 5-2A-6. Renewal of Existing Licenses.
Any license previously issued by the FPD that expires while this Article is in force will be
renewed at a rate fifty (50) percent lower than that specified for issuance of a new license, unless
otherwise approved by the Board based upon District staff recommendations for a license
exceeding twenty-five (25) acres and/or when in staff opinion the license can generate additional
revenue for the District. The minimum renewal license fee will be five (5) percent of the cost per
acre for the current year. Additionally, a Youth Education, Land Acquisition and Restoration
(YELAR) Program Fee of five seven and one half (57.5%) percent of the cost per acre and a
License Review Fee shall be assessed against all licenses issued. Cost per acre, minimum license
fee, License Review Fee and YELAR program fee figures can be found in Appendix A at the end
of this Article. The Licensee must submit a non-refundable license renewal application fee of
five hundred dollars ($500.00) to the FPD at least six (6) months prior to the expiration date of
said license to confirm its interest in continued operation and maintenance of the facilities for
which the license was originally issued. If the applicable license renewal application fee and
prior notice of the Licensee's intent to renew is not received by the FPD at least six (6) months
prior to the expiration of the existing license, the FPD will mail the Licensee a "Removal
Notice" at their last known address notifying the licensee to remove their facilities from FPD
property the license will be considered expired and Licensee may be required to remove their
facilities from FPD property per the terms of the license. If the Licensee wishes to renew a
license for which it has already received a "Removal Notice" expired, the FPD will may allow
the renewal, but the fee for the renewal will be based on the formula used to determine the fee
for issuance of a new license. All fees due for license renewals will be paid as a lump-sum
upfront one-time payment, unless otherwise approved by the Board.
Sec. 5-2A-9. Youth Education, Land Acquisition and Restoration Program Fee (YELAR).
A YELAR Program Fee of five seven and one half (57.5%) percent of the cost per acre shall be
assessed for all new and renewal licenses issued. The fee will help support youth education
programs including, but not limited to, the Mighty Acorns, and High School Programs, Land
Acquisition and Restoration activities. Cost per acre and YELAR program fee figures can be

 found in Appendix A at the end of this Article.
Sec. 5-2B-1. New Licenses.
Upon receipt of a properly completed license application and a nonrefundable five hundred
dollar ($500.00) application fee the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (FPD) will begin
initial administrative processing of the application for consideration by appropriate FPD staff.
FPD Staff shall then review the application and attached plans to determine the applicable
License Review Fee and feasibility of granting the requested license to the applicant.
Applications will be reviewed based on, among other things, the potential damage construction
or operation of the proposed facilities could have on FPD property, location of the proposed
facilities, type of facilities proposed, and number of trees to be impacted. Based on this review
the FPD may reject the request outright or may request revisions to the proposed plans that
would make the proposal more acceptable to the FPD. Under no circumstances will licenses be
issued for areas that are dedicated Illinois Nature Preserves, high quality natural areas identified
by the FPD and shown on the FPD's GIS system as "license exclusion zones", or areas covered
by conservation easements.
Sec. 5-2B-2. Acceptable Application and Plans.
If the submitted (or revised) application and plans are found to be acceptable by the FPD staff,
the FPD will draw up a license that, if approved by the Board of Forest Preserve District
Commissioners, would grant the licensee authority to locate, operate, and maintain the facilities
for which the application and plans were submitted. Said license will include, among other
things, the term for which the license will be issued, the fee that the FPD will charge for issuance
of the license, any moneys that will be paid for tree mitigation associated with the license, and
any charges for "out of pocket" expenses incurred by the FPD to determine whether the license is
acceptable. Said license will be forwarded to the applicant for their review and approval before
being submitted to the Board of Forest Preserve District Commissioners (Board) for final
approval. If the applicant decides to withdraw its application after review of the proposed license
or if the Board does not approve the proposed license, the "out of pocket" expenses will still be
due and the FPD will bill the applicant for said expenses. If said fees are unpaid, the FPD will
accept no further license applications from that applicant. Said applicant can regain its
application privileges by paying one hundred (100) percent of the fees owed along with a penalty

all fees will be paid to the FPD at or before the time the finalized license is delivered to the
Licensee.
