and Contracts (DPC) expanded the competitive range to allow two additional Respondents to

concerns raised by the Evaluation Committee due to the limited number of Respondents in the
initial competitive range who had offered proposals on the Scattered Sites – ADA properties. As
a result, the Evaluation Committee was able to consider the presentations of all five Respondents
who made proposals on Scattered Sites – ADA properties. After consideration of the written
proposals and presentations, the Evaluation Committee determined that NIA Architects and Fox

successful respondent pursuant to the June 2002 solicitation issued by Habitat for the
redevelopment of the ABLA Site. HUD has indicated that since a competitive process was
engaged to procure the ABLA Redevelopment Team as identified in the Plan approved by HUD,
and since the engineered barrier approach to remediation involves construction elements to be
performed post-closing, there is justification to enter into this contract. The benefits realized by
