 Presentation by the People Committee. Co-chair Rebeccah Sanders explained that the role of the
People Committee is to connect the citizens of Cook County to nature. Co-chair Cynthia Moreno went
on to discuss the Preserves’ recent successes including opening new campgrounds and launching the
CLIC (Camping Leadership Immersion Course) program. Council Member Rob Castaneda recently
participated in a community partner CLIC training and stated he had an amazing time. He thought the
program was well run and appropriate for everyone from the experienced to the amateur. He
encourages all Council members to visit the campgrounds and is excited to introduce young people to
camping so they can experience nature without having to travel too far from home. Cynthia also
discussed the status of the signage and wayfinding plan and gateways project, and Rebeccah discussed
program partnerships and the importance and challenges of working with partners. Cynthia finished the
presentation by highlighting current top priorities of the People Committee, including:




Nature & Health
ADA Accessibility
Cultural Competency

(Also see Attachment 1A.)
Council members asked the following questions and offered guidance:
 Was the ADA considered and incorporated into the Signage and Wayfinding Plan? ADA issues
were discussed in some specific signage cases as part of the planning process and the Forest
Preserves will be incorporating a general policy into the final plan.
 What are the gateway sites? A gateway is be designed to invite and encourage people to enter a
forest preserve; entrances will be at high visibility locations with access to outdoor recreation
opportunities (such as trails) and will be revitalized through landscaping, signage, and other
interpretive elements. The Forest Preserves has been awarded funds from the Cook County
Department of Public Health through a CDC grant program in order to create a Gateway Master
Plan and site plans for 10 gateway locations.
 Are the funding needs highlighted in the People Committee’s presentation part of the Forest
Preserves budget or are they a Forest Preserve Foundation funding priority? The funding needs
outlined in the presentation are not currently part of any budget, but those needs may be
included in the Forest Preserves’ 2016 budget requests.
 Will or does the Forest Preserves offer people unrestricted open spaces to interact with nature
outside of the confines of a campground? The Forest Preserves are currently in the process of
producing literature on outside activity opportunities for each campground location.
Campgrounds are all different and offer many types of activities and opportunities for people to
experience nature including ropes courses/climbing walls, nature play areas, and nature trails.
Outside of the campgrounds, there are nature centers with nature play areas. The Forest
Preserves are currently working with the Chicago Zoological Society to develop a nature play
plan for each nature center.
 Is there a formal education program? While the Forest Preserves does not have a formal
education program, it does have many informal programs including Mighty Acorns, Citizen
Scientists in Action, It’s Cooler in the Forest, school field trips to nature centers, and classroom
programs in schools. Its educational programs have been professionally developed to be
flexible, to meet the needs of any curriculum, and to align with Illinois Learning Standards. The
Preserves also work with University of Illinois Extension to offer teacher training opportunities.
There are also many informal partnerships that use the Forest Preserves for curriculum based

programs, including Birds in My Backyard. The Preserves need to build on the success of its
current programs, which are dependent on the commitment of individual teachers and schools.
What are the metrics, quantitative and qualitative, that the Forest Preserves are using to
measure success with attracting people to the Preserves? The Forest Preserves is part of the
Cook County STAR performance management program through which the Forest Preserves
report quarterly numbers on six strategic areas which are made publicly available. For education
and outreach, the Preserves measure the number of participants in programs and number of
groups with which Preserves staff interact. Preserves staff welcome any recommendations on
how they can better measure programs. Metrics are available to view online at
http://fpdcc.com/star/
Will the website be translated into different languages? Currently website translation is not a
top priority but we are considering it. A suggestion was made that the Forest Preserves should
think about seeking volunteers to translate website in several languages if funding is an issue.
Are there targeted communities? The People Committee recently put together a map of where
the Forest Preserves and partners have groups with which they have worked. This map is a
starting point for determining what communities the Preserves and its partners are not
currently reaching and where the Preserves and its partners should focus.
Is it possible to leverage resources with partners? It is something the Forest Preserves can
consider, but even its partners need resources. The Preserves are working on relationship
building, but it can be difficult for community organizations to find funding for their current
programs and the Forest Preserves are not always a priority, so this has been a challenge.

The time to discuss key questions identified by the People Committee was limited, and it was suggested
that Council members provide feedback via email.
1. What do you perceive as the barriers to people accessing the Forest Preserves?
2. In what capacity can we count on the Conservation & Policy Council to assist the People
Committee in implementing these three priority areas?
Presentation by the Economics Committee. Co-chairs Richard Gamble and Chris Adas explained that
the goal of the Economics Committee is to insure that the people of Cook County will “value the
economic benefits of protected lands.” They explained that the Committee is focused on the following
priorities:




Documenting the economic value of the Forest Preserves
Encouraging economic business development
Developing a strategic marketing campaign

(Also see Attachment 1A.)
1. Chris and Rich asked for feedback on this key question: “How do we allocate limited resources
for surveys and marketing to be as efficient and effective as possible?” Also, how do we use the
results from surveys and market research in the most efficient and effective manner, ensuring
our decisions are data driven and focusing on our final goal--getting more people to use and
value the Forest Preserves?
Council members asked questions and offered suggestions as follows:

It’s a challenge to compete against for-profit companies for advertising/marketing. Consider
using an economic value report to show communities, municipalities and corporations the value
of the Forest Preserves This will help them see the forest Preserves as an asset and encourage
them to market the Forest Preserves on behalf of the Preserves and themselves.
Consider developing an editorial calendar to help manage the marketing of the Forest Preserves.
Consider the concept of place making/sense of place – how do we make the Forest Preserves
destination sites? Need to determine if we want to promote/market ‘destinations’ or just
general information/awareness.
Utilize the Chicago Botanic Garden and Brookfield Zoo membership database and
communications portals to market the forest preserves. Consider a profile on the Preserves in
the Garden and Zoo magazines.
Discovery Communications had a great approach to promoting the National Parks. Look into it.
Need to consider public policy perspective and to think about the public and economic benefits
and how it’s translated to the forest preserves constituencies.
Work with media outlets like WBEZ to do a profile on the Preserves or perhaps a regular feature.
The value of partnerships is important to keep in mind, because partners all use the Preserves
and there is no competition.
Think about partners for actual dollars—and expand partnership base to include local chambers
of commerce, real estate agents
Consider corporations as ‘partners’ through volunteering, marketing, and actual dollars. Should
develop an asset map highlighting corporations adjacent to Preserves.
Look at digital infrastructure and wayfinding.
Focus on church and faith based institutions when trying to recruit new partners. People like to
give where they are involved already.
General impression problem, corportations may not see the benefits of the Preserves.
Is the Forest Preserves considering a naming rights policy? There are many opportunities for
naming with current assets. Could the Forest Preserves could make money? The Forest
Preserves is already considering naming rights/sponsorship and has worked with REI to sponsor
a trail, for example.
People don’t think about the Preserves in the bigger picture of the regions assets. The Preserves
should come to mind when one thinks of the lakefront and the Chicago parks system.
Consider joining forces with other partner agencies and corporations to develop a general
nature campaign to help promote the forest preserves. By aligning with others, the Preserves
have more opportunities for marketing, PR and research.
Work with Choose Chicago and the “Epic” Campaign, e.g., birds making an epic journey an
stopping in the Forest Preserves.
The Forest Preserves should considering highlighting its role with ADA25 Chicago as a marketing
opportunity.

Review and approval of amended language in section 4.3g of the Plan. A motion was made by Mark
Templeton and seconded by Peter Ellis to approve the amended language proposed to read as follows:
Put in place a financial plan that will produce the annual investment needed to restore 30,000 acres and
expand the forest preserves to 90,000 acres in 25 years, and to meet the other goals outlined in the Next
Century Conservation Plan.

 The language change was approved by majority vote. The Council stressed the importance of
determining a targeted annual measurement so we can hold ourselves accountable and know what we
need to do each year to reach our goals.
Early Action Seed Funding. $40,000 is currently available for funding small scale projects, with the
maximum award capped at $10,000. An RFP has been drafted and will be open to the public. Proposals
must accomplish the goals of the Next Century Conservation Plan and is open to both current and new
partners. Council members suggested the cross-committee initiatives could benefit from this funding.
Communications Strategy. The current www.nextcenturyconservationplan.com website is being
revamped to include information on the NCCP’s implementation process and the work of the
Conservation & Policy Council. Recent and future accomplishments will be featured on the website
through journalistic quality stories and progress on key targets for 2020 will be highlighted and tracked.
Adjournment. A motion was made by Falona Joy and seconded by Laurel Ross and the meeting was
adjourned at 5:00 PM.
