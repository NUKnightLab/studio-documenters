 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
November 4, 2010
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on October 7, at 2:00 p.m. The meeting was held at
33 N. LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

Ben Weese
John Baird
Phyllis Ellin
Edward Torrez
Ernest Wong

Staff:

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Historic Preservation Division, Department
of Zoning and Land Use Planning
Dijana Cuvalo
Beth Johnson
Cynthia Roubik
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

2440 N. Orchard
(Arlington-Deming District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed 3-story new masonry single-family residential building with a
rooftop mechanical penthouse and 1-story detached masonry garage with
alley access; new building is proposed to be built on existing foundations
begun for a project previously abandoned

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The applicant proposes to reuse existing foundations and portions of
walls begun, and later abandoned, as part of a prior project [permit
issued prior to the initiation of the designation process for the district].
An engineer's report indicates that these foundations and walls are in
sound condition and can be reused. Although the resulting 15-foot
front yard setback is several feet less than the predominant front yard
setback of historic buildings on this block of the district, given the
particular circumstances relative to these foundations and the site
conditions (including an adjacent non-historic building also with a 15foot front yard setback), the existing foundations (and acknowledging
the resulting setbacks) may be reused in this limited instance;
2. Due to its visibility from the public way, the rooftop penthouse (37’-6”
x 14’-1”) shall be restudied to be reduced in length and size, with any

 visible portion of the penthouse limited to accommodating only stair
access to the roof, consistent the Commission’s visible penthouse
addition policy as well as the character of historic rooflines typical of
the district. The penthouse should have a sloped roof over the stairs to
further minimize its visibility;
3. The proposed front (east) façade Option ‘A’ is approved with the
following modifications and/or additional information:
a) A continuous horizontal limestone band below the mansard roof
spring point shall be incorporated into the design of the front
façade to break up the massing, in particular regarding the front
masonry return of the north elevation. Additionally, the masonry
wall extending above the roofline in the middle of the building,
similar to how a “firewall” would be built separating rowhouse
units, shall be eliminated in keeping with the architectural
character typical of the district;
b) The proposed front bay design shall be restudied to address
cladding material and detailing so as to be more consistent with the
architectural character of historic bays in the district. The revised
design should incorporate window surrounds, recessed panels, and
trim pieces with profiles and proportions consistent with historic
bays, as well as eliminate the diagonal metal grillework. The
railings shall be eliminated, as there is no rooftop access above the
bay. Provide revised enlarged elevations, section details, and
material/finish samples for Historic Preservation staff review and
approval prior to permit application submittal;
c) The design of the front porch shall be restudied. The limestone
entablature shall be eliminated to reduce the mass of the porch
structure. The two limestone columns should extend to the
underside of the brick parapet, and their shape should be modified
(less exaggerated entasis) to be more consistent with the
proportions of stone columns found within the district.
Additionally, the railings above the front porch roof shall be
eliminated, as there is no deck access at this location. The
proposed metal grilles should also be eliminated. Additional
information about the proposed use of synthetic materials should
be submitted for further Historic Preservation staff review and
approval;
d) The proposed dark-red modular-sized face brick sample is
approved, however, the proposed gray-colored mortar shall be
modified, such as a mortar color that matches the color of the face
brick which would be more consistent with the masonry wall
treatment typical of this district;
e) The proposed cladding of the larger dormer window with a blank
panel of stucco is not consistent with the vocabulary of the
proposed design or the predominant historic materials of similar

 architectural expressions within the district. Consider cladding the
dormer with simulated slate to match the mansard roofing, metal
cladding, or face brick to match smaller dormer window cladding;
and,
f) The proposed simulated divided-lite clad-wood windows shall
have a substantial exterior muntin profile and interior spacer bars.
Proposed window details shall be submitted with the permit
application;
4. Should the project require zoning variances from the Zoning Board of
Appeals, the Commission takes no position regarding any requested
exceptions.
2.

335 W. Menomonee
(Old Town Triangle District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed installation of horizontal wood siding over multiple existing
layers of siding

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. Window Trim. The existing window trim shall be removed, salvaged,
and reinstalled as possible; or, if unsalvageable, and subject to Historic
preservation staff review and approval, replaced to match the existing
trim. Details for the installation of the trim indicating dimensions,
location, etc., shall be provided as part of the permit submission;
2. Other Wall Trim. The end boards shall be removed, salvaged, and
reinstalled; or replaced in kind to match. Trim along the eave shall
match the condition and dimensions of such trim on the front
elevation. Details with dimensions of the trim shall be provided as
part of the permit submission; and,
3. Siding. As proposed, the new cedar siding shall match the profile, lap
and size of the existing wood siding on the front elevation of
the building. The siding shall be painted.

3.

2800 N. Milwaukee
(Milwaukee-Diversey-Kimball District – 35th Ward)
Informational Only/Violation: Partial removal, salvage, and resetting of the limestone
cladding on an existing 6-story masonry building. The removal and resetting of the
limestone was deemed necessary to address the severe deterioration of the existing steel
lintel supports. A permit revision application for the additional scope of work has been
started with the Department of Buildings.
