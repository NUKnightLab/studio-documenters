Alternate Payee: RUTH RAMSEY
David Andrews v. Ruth Ramsey, Case No.:10-769348-DM
Oakland County Circuit for the State of Michigan, (Pontiac, Michigan)

BY TRUSTEE PEGG – SUPPORTED BY TRUSTEE THOMAS
WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees for the Police and Fire Retirement System for the City of
Detroit (“Board”) is in receipt of an Eligible Domestic Relations Order which was entered by the
Oakland County Circuit Court on November 7, 2012 (“EDRO”) which purports to
amend/supplement a Judgment of Divorce entered on August 10, 2010 wherein Alternate Payee
RUTH RAMSEY is awarded certain rights to the retirement benefits of Participant DAVID
ANDREWS, who is an active employee, and
WHEREAS, the Board has been informed that Participant DAVID ANDREWS is an active
employee who is not receiving retirement benefits, and
WHEREAS, Participant’s date of birth is August 14, 1966 and to date Participant has attained
20 years of service credit, and
WHEREAS, the PFRS standard procedure as it relates to EDROs is that a party will submit a
proposed EDRO for review and pre-approval to PFRS’ legal counsel (“PFRS Legal Counsel”).
Once PFRS Legal Counsel pre-approves a proposed EDRO, the party may take same to a court
for entry. Once entered by a Court, the party should submit a copy of the court entered EDRO to
PFRS Legal Counsel. PFRS Legal Counsel will then submit a resolution to the PFRS Board for
its consideration (“PFRS STANDARD EDRO PROCEDURE”), and
WHEREAS, in this matter, PFRS STANDARD EDRO PROCEDURE was not followed, and
WHEREAS, legal counsel for Alternate Payee RUTH RAMSEY submitted a court entered
EDRO to the Board which was incompatible with the practices of the PFRS. Specifically,
counter to law, the EDRO includes the social security numbers of the parties within the body of
order. Further, the EDRO fails to identify if Alternate Payee RUTH RAMSEY is entitled to a
portion of Participant DAVID ANDREWS’ defined benefit plan or defined contribution plan.
In this matter, neither party submitted a proposed EDRO for review and pre-approval before
having same entered by the court, and
WHEREAS, by copy of this Resolution, the Participant, Alternate Payee and Alternate Payee’s
legal counsel will be advised that the EDRO presented to the Board is rejected.
WHEREAS, by copy of this Resolution, the Participant and Alternate Payee will be advised that
corrective action must be taken before the PFRS will act on this matter. Specifically, the parties
should be aware that: (i) the parties should contact the PFRS or PFRS Legal Counsel for a

and provided to PFRS Legal Counsel for review and pre-approval; (iii) once pre-approved by
PFRS Legal Counsel, the first amended EDRO should then be submitted for court approval; and
(iv) then the court entered first amended EDRO should be provided to PFRS Legal Counsel, and
WHEREAS, upon PFRS Legal Counsel’s receipt of a court entered EDRO which is compatible
with PFRS practices, the Board will be provided a resolution regarding the disbursement of
benefits, and
WHEREAS, until such time, no benefits should be disbursed in this matter, and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the EDRO is rejected, and be it further
RESOLVED, that no action will be taken by this Board on this matter until PFRS Legal Counsel
receives a court entered EDRO which is compatible with PFRS practices and provides a
resolution to this Board for action, and be it further
