MINUTES OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGULAR MEETING

DETROIT ECONOMIC GROWTH CORPORATION

500 GRISWOLD, SUITE 2200

8:30 AM.

CALL. TO ORDER

Noting that a quorum was present, Chairperson Forte called the Regular meeting of the Economic
Development Corporation Board of Directors to order at 8:32 am.

GENERAL

Approval of Minutes

Ms. Forte asked if there were any additions, deietions or corrections to the minutes of the May 9,
2019 Special Board meeting. Hearing none, the Board took the following action:

On a motion by Mr. Roling, seconded by Mr. Hodge, Resoiution Code EDC 19-05-02-313
was approved.

Ms. Bruhn stated she would like to make a motion to amend the minutes to be revised to include
a summary of Board members? comments and the public?s comments.

On a motion by Ms. Bruhn, seconded by Mr. Roling, it was unanimously approved for the
minutes to be revised to include a summary of Board members? and the public?s
comments.

PROJECTS

FCA Land Assembly Project: Property Exchange Agreements (l-94 Project Plan,
Sprinqwells Industrial Park Project Plan, East Side Revitatigation Protect)

Ms. Navin stated that as the Board is aware, an item relating to the proposed FCA project was
reviewed at the Special Board meeting on May 9, 2019. Again, in front of this Board, as part of
that project, there is a request that certain land owned or controlled by the EDC be authorized to
be included in a proposed land swap between the Cityand Crown Enterprises. At last week?s
meeting, the item was tabled until the next regularly scheduled Board meeting, so we don?t have
a formal presentation today. At the last meeting, there was a motion to divide the one resolution
into two separate resolutions. The resolution was revised from the last meeting to remove the
Trident Huber LLC transaction, since it was approved. Also, the resolution was revised to make it
explicit that any approval by this Board today would be contingent upon City Council?s approval

May 14, 2019

of the actual property exchange agreement, since this body is not a proposed party to that
exchange agreement. Ms. Navin stated with that, she has no further comments and will leave it
to the Board?s pleasure with how they want to proceed on this matter.

Ms. Clayson made a motion, which was seconded by Mr. Roling, for public comment to happen
after Board questions but before the Board vote. The motion was unanimously approved.

Ms. Forte opened the floor to Board members? questions or comments.

Mr. Jackson stated he would like a clarification. said that they were still going through
the process of making a final determination of whether or not they are going to select this site. If
the conveyances and swaps happen prior to the decision being made, what happens with all the
land it should decide not to be here in Detroit? Mr. Lewand responded that legally there
is a final development agreement. if all of the land swaps are approved by City Council, the
development agreement will be finalized and will be binding. Ms. Bruhn asked if Crown still gets
the properties it the FCA agreement doesn?t go through and the agreement is not implemented.
Mr. Lewand said that is incorrect. None of the land swaps will become effective unless the
development agreement goes through. City Council will have to approve those land swaps as
well.

Ms. Clayson asked if the Board could see the actual development agreement that is proposed
with the actual contractual terms with Crown Enterprises for the land transaction. Mr. Lewand
answered that the document is not in final form yet, and when it is approved, it will be a public
document.

Ms. Bruhn stated that she is trying to clarify role and what would happen if EDC does not
approve the transfer. Does that hold anything up since EDC is only advisory to City Council? The
Board has to take some kind of action, but can the City Council can go ahead do whatever it
wants with the project? Ms. Navin responded that because EDC owns or controls some of these
properties, if the EDC voted against the measure before the Board today and did not include these
properties, the proposed property exchange with Crown, while it still could be approved by City
Council, it would greatly impede the parties? ability to perform under that contract, because that
contract contemplates the inclusion of all of these EDC properties. Ms. Navin stated that if this
Board does not move forward with the inclusion of these properties, then it puts that property
exchange agreement at risk because these properties are key to that property exchange
agreement.

Ms. Bruhn asked Ms. Navin to point out the properties on a map. Ms. Navin referred to the maps
in the Board packet. There are three areas. The first area is the l-94 industrial Park. The second
area is just south of Jefferson near Lycast, there is one parcel owned by the EDC next to Crown?s
Lakeshore Distribution Center. And the third area is in Springwells Industrial Park, there is a
property.

Ms. Clayson asked if any steps had been taken to try to get the Southwest Detroit properties off
of the negotiating table with Crown. Mr. Lewand answered no.

Mr. Roiing commented that it is nice that the Board is making this decision in public and that he
is proud of that fact.

PUBLIC COMMENT

Ms. Forte advised that there were a number of individuals present that have requested to make
public comment and asked that they limited their comments to one minute each. The following
individuals made public comment:

Jessica Trevino (Hubbard Richard Residents Association) They live close to the Ambassador
Bridge area and they strongly oppose the land swap that involves property around their
neighborhood because they have not been a good neighbor to them. it is very unfortunate that
this deai is pitting one neighborhood against another. More than 5,000 new jobs is a good deal
but there has to be another way.

Mark Owens (Executive Director, Samaritan Center) - Samaritan Center is a large, multi-service
center on the east side of the City of Detroit. They house about 70 agencies and support about
50,000 different people per year who come there for various services. We are right across the
street from the expansion, which we strongly, strongly, strongly support. We believe that these
5,000 jobs will benefit many of the Samaritan Center services because many of them come there
for empioyment services and we beiieve that it is critically important that we do everything in this
city to support the east side, the entire city and southeastern Michigan. What does it really mean
if you make $50,000 per year and you have 5,000 people doing that, the positive impact to the
big community is $250 miliion. We support that because we believe it is in the best interest.

Amy Amador (Hubbard Farms Neighborhood Association) I am here representing the
association to express the president?s strong opposition to the swap between the Toledo W.
Grand Blvd. area as well as the properties in the Rivershard [inaudible] area. As you know from
the last meeting, the Toiedo W. Grand three acres was part of the W. Vernor corridor project.
It was slated to be a part of a residential, commercial, and mixed?use part of the City?s planning
study. We are disappointed that the City has chosen not to honor its own study. We would ask
that you not support the swap of that. If this swap does move forward, we would ask that you
restrict that property to be in conformance with what the planning study has proposed for our
neighborhood. This is a residential neighborhood. We are really disappointed that the City has
chosen to take land that is adjacent to residential properties.

Raul Rivera (Mobis Northern Automotive) I represent Mobis in the city of Detroit. We are in
support of this project. i was 16 years old when iwent to prison and they are the only piace that
couid get employment. We worked there 17 years. has given an opportunity for the
southwest residents. We are iooking forward to the new jobs that will come with this. We are all
in support.

May 14, 2019

    

500 Griswotd, Suite 2200
Detroit. Nit 48226

Sam Butler (President, Hubbard Richard Resident Association) - I don?t have fiery activist
ianguage today, just a general disappointment. get jobs, $13 million going directly into
the is a big win. i think it is unfortunate with it coming to having to deal with a bad
actor with such a strong negotiating position. That is unfortunate. Whereas FCA has
development provisions in place--there is investment monitoring, there are methods where we
can [inaudible] if they don?t follow up on their promises-?we are giving land with relative [inaudible]
to a bad actor. Like say, it is unfortunate that this has been forced to move so quickly.

Jose Rivera (FCA Employee) i am currently working for FCA. i am from southwest.
was the first job that gave me the opportunity. i applied at several different places. 
was incarcerated for 10 years and gave me the opportunity to [inaudible]. had a small
college education prior to getting the opportunity. i think it was beneficial to southwest Detroit.
We don?t have jobs. This is beneficial. So, without the opportunity at i wouldn?t be
where i am. It has been two years and have benefits and everything. I am totally grateful, and
support this wholeheartedly.

Mary Carmen Munoz (LA SED) - i am the director of LA SEE). LA SED is a Latino non~profit
service agency in southeastern Michigan that has been serving the community since 1969.
During those years, we have lost many jobs. This is a once in a generation opportunity that is
being given to us by FCA who is willing to make the investment in the city of Detroit. it is
unfortunate that personal feelings regarding one family seem to be [inaudible] economic outiook.
So, LA SED is in support of FCA.

Byron Osbern Local 58) I am support of labor. This project will bring some jobs to our
organization, electrical workers. FCA has an agreement with us to use all labor, ali organized
workers on this project and I am in support of that. I feel like there is always a better way with the
community and with the companies to work things out. Hopefully, in the future, we will ?nd a
better way to do things, but as far as our union, 5,000 members, 10% are laid off, which includes
journeyman and apprentices. i think this job will get a lot of us back to work, as well as minority
contractors, minority businesses, Detroit-based businesses, and give us all a chance to get off
the out of work list and back into our trade, as well as bring in new apprentices into the trade. So,
am in support of labor on this decision.

Rick Preuss Local 58) -- i am with Local 58, but I represent building trades as well.
As Mr. Osbern said, we are experiencing about closer to 18% unemployment rate, so this
construction job will be good for this Local here. investment is huge. Somebody
already said, it?s a once in a lifetime [inaudible] investment. The amount ofjobs that are created
herem?the 5,000?wwill [inaudible] the supply chain. There will not be just 5,000. There is a
company that did an evaluation and it is something like 30 to 1. So, it will trickle down the supply
chain. This is a lot larger than how it wilt affect everybody. actually do iive in one of the affected
areas at Kercheval. We are supportive of this project.

Darnell Gardner i am a member of that community, (more importantly, i am a member of the
community that is most affected by this plant. We did sit down and came away feeling this will be

very positive for our community. I just want to say on a personal level that I, too, [inaudibie]. I
am not a UAW member, I am a salaried worker at Ford Motor Company. i am step a former felon
and want to say what these jobs will mean to the community. My home backs up to this plant.
Up until now, our community has been pretty much forgotten. So, i wouid like to see this deal go
forward, for the jobs, for the community, and most importantly, for the young people in my
neighborhood who are aimlessiy walking around looking for opportunities.

Thomas Hardiman First of all, I want to say that there are three active members here, and I
want to represent that, as members of the Fiat Expansion Neighborhood Advisory
Council of the State that represents the Act, we volunteered to negotiate a strong community
benefit region that will not only benefit our impact area, but the entire city of Detroit. We are
extremely proud of what we did to negotiate a $35.2 million benefit, the largest community benefit
in the city?s history, one of the Iargest jobs creating projects in Detroit?4,950 UAW jobs will be
created from this expansion. On top of the investment in our community, one issue was insuring
that Detroiters would be hired before the general public for the project. We are proud to report
that we were successful. Fiat will give Detroit residents, returning citizens and veterans
opportunities to apply before the general public. Not just when it opens, but over the next 30
years. This is unprecedented. Vote for FCA and the city of Detroit.

Raquel Castaneda?Lopez (City Council) -- I submitted comments to you in writing. I think It is
really sad that every single large development deai [inaudible] this conversation. Labor is pitted
against community and communities are pitted against each other. I support the jobs. My family
has worked over 40 years in the automobile industry, as well as my grandmother and other
members of my family. I think the support needs to come when we are sacrificing public health,
investment in our schools, one community?s weilbeing for another, simply for jobs. I do want to
remind folks the community needs to have prioritization for application. There is no commitment
to a quantifiable number or percentage of hiring Detroiters. So, I would love to be able to support
and I thank for what they have done. These are the changes that we would like to see
in the deal, but I encourage you all on the EDC to advocate for as well, is removal of the properties
in Southwest, a commitment to more than $15,000 per household for home repairs, to really
protect the surrounding communities and people that live right next door, public heaith and from
new pollution, to protect the schoois and the kids and the parents going to the schools, public
health and from new pollution.

Scott Benson (City Council) I am in strong support of this deal and I urge the EDC to make a
yes today. The reason is this deal will result in 5,000 jobs. That will be an increase of 1% of our
General Fund. And when we have to spend $162 million to support our retirees in the year 2024,
we need to grow this economy and this city budget. This helps us do that. We need 15 more of
these to make sure we?ve get $162 million deal. Now, this is a situation where you don?t want the
perfect [inaudible] any of the good. This is a good deal. Do I like the Moroun deal? No, i don?t.
But the third issue is, also we are putting into this deal, we are giving property to the Soave family
as well as the Moroun?s to make sure the city comes out on top with 5,000 newjobs?lifechanging
jobs-~when you have citizens come to you and say how these jobs have turned their lives around.

May 14, 2019

    

500 Griswold, Suite 2200
Detroit, MI 48226

These are middle class jobs, not $50 an hour jobs, middle class jobs. This helps our city. This
makes sure we continue on an upward trajectory in Detroit. Vote yes on this today.

Ms. Forte advised that she did not have any additional cards for public comment and thanked the
public for their comments.

Ms. Forte advised that she would now go back to the Board for further discussion.
PROJECTS

FCA Land Assembly Protect: Property Exchange Agreements (l-94 Project Plan,
Sprinqwells industrial Park Protect Plan, East Side Revitalization Project)

Ms. Clayson said that she just wanted to say one thing about this. The Board?s vote last week
clearly demonstrated that it supports FCA coming in and doing this expansion project. This
particular part of the deal is a substantial problem. We don?t have any formal written appraisal for
this land swap, and she thinks that when you look at the valuations, they are completely out of
Whack when you compare them to the other land swap deals that have happened. She thinks
FCA could make this happen because they already control the very land that they are trying to
acquire, and it was choice not to do it simply based on not getting control of this land. She
thinks that is an incredibly unfair position to put the entire city of Detroit in.

Mr. Roling stated that he thinks first and foremost each of the EDC Board members needs to
remember that they are fiduciaries representing the taxpayers. The questions that he asked
himself are (1) would he put his own money in this deal and would a sophisticated investor put
money in the deal based on what the city has explained are the benefits; and, (2) if somebody
said to him here is $160 million dollars in cash and land, go make the city?s economy better, is
this the first thing that he would do? He can?t say yes with conviction to either of those questions.
It is really hard for him to support this?-itjust feels like nothing more than corporate welfare.

Mr. Hodge stated that he has one brief comment. While he welcomes the opportunity for new
jobs in the city of Detroit, he knows this deal has been structured and a lot of work has been put
into it. The one thing that he would have liked to have seen was a stronger guarantee of jobs
going to Detroiters with the sacrifices that the community is being asked to make here.

Mr. Stallworth clarified that the EDC Board is only responsible for three of the areas here?not the
whole package. Ms. Navin stated that is correct. Mr. Stallworth said that he is concerned as
everybody else about community benefits and the impacts on adjacent communities, but he also
wants to be clear process-wise that ultimately City Council has final approval on this package.
Ms. Navin stated that is correct. They also have responsibility for negotiating community benefits
and ultimately making sure that this project is overall beneficial to the city of Detroit. Ms. Navin
responded that is correct. Mr. Stallworth said the one thing he wasn?t completely clear about is
the competition Detroit is in for this project and asked if there was somebody from FCA that could
address that.

May 14, 2019

  

mi: situates?: {strait Avior-t
sun Griswotd, Suite 22130
Detroit, Mi 48226

 

Mr. Ron Staliworth of FCA responded that there a couple of issues that he wanted to make clear.
With regarding to guarantee of employment of Detroit residents, while at some level that would
make sense, he did a lot of research and had trouble finding any corporation that would guarantee
employment from a particular city. in fact, the City of Detroit doesn?t guarantee that its employees
are residents of the city. So, what FCA will do is give priority to Detroit residents. Mr. Stallworth
explained the appiication process to the Board. Mr. Staliworth said that secondly, in terms of
timing, there is a construction timeline that needs to be met that is really dictated by the weather.
Lots must be prepared before the winter and if this isn?t done it really affects the entire production
schedule. It is intent to start hiring in the fall. With regards to tax incentives, other states
provide more than the state of Michigan and the City of Detroit. Without the land swap taking
place, it makes this project less viable.

Mr. Roling interjected, ?Belvedere, iilinois is a cornfield between Madison and Chicago that
already has a plant. Of course, it is going to be more expensive to build a plant in the
middle of a 300?year?old city. This is just really tantamount to a Shakedown of pitting
two midwestern cities against each other to see who is going to write the biggest check. It is a
race to the bottom."

Mr. Ron Stallworth replied that in terms of a Shakedown, that is not what is going on here.

Mr. Osei asked for someone to comment on the true amount of costs that wilt be driven by the
city and what we expect to get in return, just so everyone is clear.

Ms. Bridges advised that an impact analysis was done based on some underlying assumptions
here on projections that we make in terms of what the city stands to gain on this project over the
next 30 years. In addition, we make some assumptions on costs. The total costs are
approximately $188 million, which takes into account the abatement, the iand costs, the land swap
vaiues. It also takes into consideration some costs that the city has in terms of the Community
Benefits Agreement. The total gross revenues as a result of this project is estimated at $353
miilion over the next 30 years. And when you subtract those costs from the $353 million, you get
a $165 million in net benefits to the city over the next 30 years.

Mr. Osei stated that, just to ciarify without going into too much detail, some of that math does not
add up to him and some of his issue is that it is still not transparent what we are getting. His
calculation was that our total costs would be about $203 million based on conversations
yesterday. Ms. Bridges said that she can submit an updated cost projection, but a part of that,
when you look at the community benefits and what he saw yesterday, some of that was leveraged
money from the State, so we had to back out that leveraged money from the State and cannot
took at that as part of the City?s costs. There was a small portion of almost $5 million that was
already in our project fund that we needed to back out.

Mr. Jackson said that his biggest concern is about transfer of title of the land. He wants to be
sure that if the deal does not happen, the land wili go back to the originai owners. Ms. Navin

May 14, 2019

  

careers Davin-omens autism-rag

500 Griswold, Suite 2266
Detroit, Mt 48226

 

advised that under the development agreement, once it is approved and signed, FCA is obligated
to construct the plant. it it is not constructed in the manner outlined in the agreement, we do have
the right to take that property back.

Ms. Clayson asked what the reverter rights are and does it mean going to court. Ms. Navin
responded that there is an arbitration process and explained the process. Ms. Clayson asked if
there was a reverter for Crown. Ms. Navin stated there is not, however, those swaps will not
occur untii the development agreement and the property exchange agreement are signed and a
diligence period has passed.

Mr. Osei commented that he wanted to say something before a vote is taken. He wants to second
some of the comments made by members of this Board. He is just curious what was done to
back ourselves in a corner that we would entertain these kinds of situations. Obviously, we all
want the jobs, we want the economic impact, we want the growth, but what will we do to get
ourselves off the wali so that we are not forced into these positions in the future.

Ms. Bruhn said that she has mixed feeling about this project because there are a lot of good things
about it. It is not just the jobs. It is also the housing, the money that would go into the housing
renovation, the job training. She doesn?t see it as pitting one community against another. She
sees it as a benefit to the whole city. She is uncomfortable about some of the properties that are
proposed to be transferred to Crowne, particularly the three, and would like, if the Board votes for
approval, that that be conditioned on the removal of these properties. As she understands it, the
Board is kind of backed against the wait. Ms. Bruhn asked if the Board could at least make a
recommendation to City Council that Council remove those properties, even though she
understands that it won?t happen. We are all backed against the well when we find out from FCA
that we are in competition. She asked if Mr. Jackson, as the maker of the motion for approval, if
he would be willing to add these conditions to the proposal.

Mr. Jackson said that he is not willing to amend his motion. He appreciates the concerns of the
Board member, but his motion is approval of the resolution as stated.

Mr. Queries advised that he echoes a lot of what Ms. Bruhn mentioned. What he wants to be
sure the Board is clear on is there is no perfect situation in economic development, and that is
what this Board is, economic development. When we were appointed to be hereto help with the
revitalization of this city, unfortunately there are owners that we have no control of and we have
to make the best decision today with what we have before us. He thinks the Administration has
worked hard to put together the best possible deal. It is not perfect, but there is no such thing as
a perfect deal. This is an economic development board and he has worked for the City and
understands how hard it is to get a company to come to the City. These are jobs and you just
have to do right for the community and strongly urged the others on the Board to consider this
before voting. Mr. Quarles informed that he is going to support Mr. Jackson?s motion for approval.

Ms. Forte commented that she wanted to share for the pubiic before a vote is taken that this Board
has really done its homework. This Board has spent hours reviewing the situation and having

May 14, 2019

their questions answered, both publicly and privately, as best that they can so that they
understand what is at stake here. It is her beiief that they ail understand what is at stake is the
economic deveiopment of this community and the opportunity for individuais in this community.
We have a welt?prepared Board to address this issue.
Ms. Forte calied for a vote and the Board took the following action:

On a motion by Mr. Jackson, seconded by Mr. Queries, Resolution Code EDC 19-05-13?

56 and CODE EDC 1905?69?10 were approved, with Ms. Clayson and Mr. Roiing voting

Ms. Forte thanked the Board for at! the hours and hard work that they put into their decision.

Board of Directors

500 Griswold St., Ste. 2200

Detroit, M148226

Dear Board of Directors,

1 urge you to vote against the FCA Land Assembly Project before you. I ?rmly believe that the lure of
jobs should not lead the City of Detroit to put the interests of one community in jeopardy for the bene?t
of another. I fear that the inclusion of certain properties in Southwest Detroit in the massive land transfer
to Crown Enterprises does just that. Below, I provide the rationale for why i have advocated for each of
the three parcels in SW Detroit to be removed from the transfer.

a. ?Bridge Area? (multiple addresses): These parcels have been the focal point of ongoing conflict
between the Bridge Company?s gradual move Eastward in that neighborhood, speci?cally with
their potential illegal encroachment onto parcels being requested on 20th and St. Anne Street,
which has been met with ardent opposition from the community.

b. West Grand Toledo (3600 Toledo): This land transfer would be In direct con?ict with the
City?s own W. Vernor planning study. The planning department presented this parcel as the target
of a down?zoning to facilitate its future as a mixed-use development. Additionally, we have
received frequent complaints over the years of improper truck traf?c along Toledo from Crown?s
neighboring truck facility. This move would seem to only exacerbate those concerns.

c. Springwells Industrial Park (1420 Springwells): This large property is currently under lease to
the Windsor?Detroit Bridge Authority through 2025 for staging and construction. Outreach from
the city to the WDBA was only initiated yesterday. Given the city?s track record. of working with
the Canadians to move the GHIB forward, this transaction seems counterintuitive. It is likely that
some components of the bridge construction will continue past 2025. If this happens, this could
trigger additional payments from the city to Crown or cause additional delays in construction of
Gordie Howe, which Crown?s owners have sought repeatedly to stop over the last decade.

In addition to the concerns stated above, the City is paying signi?cantly more for Crown?s parcels than
any of the other parcels contemplated in this deal audit is a misuse of public bond money. This
transaction is a massive giveaway of public lands without any community engagement. Again, I urge you
to vote no. Please feel free to contact me with questions at or (313)
224-2450.

Sincerely,

Thank you for this opportunity to provide public comment. I will be focusing on the FCA Project-specifically
the land deals.

As someone working in the Southwest Detroit community for over 30 years and as someone who has
witnessed many real estate deals that have significantly and negatively impacted the community, it is my wish
to speak to=several serious concerns related to the proposed FCA property transactions.

have provided information sheets on the various topics and will only speak to the highlights in my oral
comments.

The proposed purchase price from 82 acres Budd Wheel site, owned by Crown Enterprises/Maroon, is 
(cash) (land exchange) (payment to Crown/Moroun if FCA/Crown/Moroun do not
conclude undefined business deals.) That equals purchase price or $914,634/acre.

The 82 acre Budd Wheel site had a 2018 SEV of $1,678,000 but somehow the City is telling taxpayers it must
pay Crown/Moroun $75,000,000. Has there been verification of the objective criteria and process was used
in the decision to lower the property tax in 2011? There should be a paper trail on that. Has it been
determined if the 82 acre Budd Wheel plant has been charged and paid all drainage rate charges? There
should be apa per trail on that too.

There has been discussion that a premium is being paid on the Budd Wheel property because there is an
active lease between FCA and Crown/Moroun for the use of some of the property as a parking area for new
vehicles. believe there is 9 years ieft on that lease. As it is obvious that lease was necessary as part of
existing plant operations, why are the taxpayers of Detroit being asked to buy out the lease? it would be a
fair question for City Council to ask FCA without the filter of the Administration telling you what FCA has to
say.

I am sure everyone on City Council understands a large international, multi?billion dollar corporation like FCA
moves slowly and has many levels of approvai for any decision as large and complex as the expansion of two
automotive plants in the City of Detroit. 50 when exactly did discussions begin on the possibility of doing the
expansion. it seems obvious the Administration?s 60 day time line is an exaggeration (fabrication) done to put
pressure on City Council to approve the deal without close review of the facts.

in the Crown Enterprises Land Swap .. Bridge Area, City property is being conveyed to the Crown/Moroun that
has already been occupied by the Ambassador Bridge for over a decade without the benefit of ownership. Are
there not some legal issues that need to be worked out prior to such a transfer? Were taxes charged for each
year the Ambassador Bridge occupied and profited from that City land? Were water drainage fees paid for
those parcels and the entire Ambassador Bridge site? Were the roads they closed properly vacated? it is
simply unacceptable to allow a private company to take public land without a deed and then reward that
abuse by giving them the land without penalty. No average taxpayer would be allowed to do.

i will end here and ask you please to take a look at the attached pages which go into more detail. Thank you.

Crown Enterprises Land Swap Bridge Area (1.9 acres)

Bridge Area land is valued by the City at $148521.

Why is the City transferring land to Crown that is already within the Ambassador
Bridge Port of Entry (AB (yellow hash marks)?

0

Was the Ambassador Bridge (Crown) using these parcels for all these many
years without the benefit of ownership? Was a lease in place?

Were City taxes assessed to Crown for these parcels owned by the City but
occupied by the Ambassador Bridge? if not, why not. What should be the
outstanding assessment with penalties? Should not those amounts be paid
prior to transfer?

Were city drainage rate charges applied to these parcels and the entire
bridge compound? Have they been paid?

Were the closed roads within the AB POE on 21515 and @20th streets
properly vacated? How much was paid to the City for those lands?

What are the penalties for occupying and profiting from the use of City land
without ownership or a lease?

What are the penalties for closing public roads without property vacating
the road? 

What was the per acre value of City land sold to MDOT for the Gordie Howe
Bridge? One could assume land to be used in the Port of Entry would
be of the same value of land that is part of the AB POE. Did the City charge
MDOT (Canada) the same $78,168/acre (148,521/13 acres) for such prime
land?

a value of $1,265,854. The page 9 header reads Crown Enterprises Lend Swap i-94 industrial Park

(24.2 acres)

(From EDC Board Member Questions page 9) D. Question from Board Member Hodge: 1. Please provide
a detailed breakdown on the potentiai scenarios for the additional $21 million payment for the land
should the titles not be conveyed without exception.

The $21 million payment is required if FCA and Crown do not reach agreement on additional
business opportunities. Two of the sites currently required for those business opportunities are in
the [-94 Industrial Park. if the $21 million is payable because Crown removed the HM property
from its Property Exchange Agreement with the City because they are unsuitable for
development, then the City will be required to pay $15 million of the $21 million.

. in the Crown Transaction Summary (Attachment 8-8) it states ?If the swap properties are not
acceptable through due diligence, etc, the DBRA will replace the land with the cash value
identified for each property.? However, it Crown does not accept the i-94 industrial Park property,
they will receive not the $1,265,854 identified on page 7 of the FCA Project Overview.

. What are the ?additional business opportunities? described above? Are these opportunities outside
the FCA Project Overview presented to City Council? .

It appears the payment is dependent upon Crown and FCA reaching an agreement on
"additional business opportunities? for the use of these two i-94 parcels and others parcels. The
answer above reads ?Two of the sites currently required for those business opportunities are in the i?
94 industrial Pork.?. it does not say he two sites required for those business opportunities are in
the l?94 industrial Park.? it should be explained what other parcels are required as part of the
?additional business opportunities.?

0 How can the City be ?nancially obligated for commercial transactions on "additional business
opportunities?j between two private business entities? Where is the oversite? There is no leverage
for the City to employ during negations to protect taxpayers because the negotiations are between
Crown and FCA. Detroit is told only be ready with the checkbook if no deal is executed.

Crown Enterprises Land Swap - West Grand Blvd/Toledo (3.1 acres)

West Grand Blvd/Toledo property is at 3600 Toiedo (3.1 acres) valued at $564,033.

C. Questions from EDC Board Member Bruhn: 4. What consideration has been given as to the impact of
Crown's acquisition parceis on the surrounding community? For example, the Neighborhood Framework
i?lan for the West Vernor Corridor cails for housing at West Grand and Toiedo. A 

planning process involving 14 community partners worked with the Pianning 8c Development
Department to develop this pian. How could Crown's acquisition affect further deveiopment in this area
and any other properties in the Southwest Detroit/West Vernor neighborhoods?

The Planning Development Department is currently reviewing this matter.

Someone (probably Crown) has evidently closed public roads in this area. (see photos -
burgundy lines on aerial view). Were these City Streets properly vacated? Either these roads
should be properly vacated (considering the Neighborhood Framework Pier: and public safety
needs) or roads should be required to be reopened and repaired. Could that be a condition of
the transfer??

Public Comment FCA negotiations questions 8L concerns
5-14?19
To City Council and EDC

From: Simone Sagovac, resident and member of the Southwest Detroit Community Bene?ts Coalition

Note: Crown Enterprises is referenced as ?Crown.? 
1) Re contingency payment- if ?unsuitable"

What has to be done, at what potential cost, and whose responsibility will it be to ensure
"suitability for development" in order that the City would not have by pay the additional 

2) Crown future development - conditions on transferred properties and due process guarantees

Reguest: No changes in zoning or permitting for any properties being transferred to Crown
without due public process, and no waiving or fast~tracking of public protection or engagement
processes

- Are there any such zoning or permitting measures being automatically provided or guaranteed
to Crown with the transfer of any properties to Crown?

- Are there any instances where public processes are being waived or altered?

3) w. Grand -Toledo property

The W. Grand -Toiedo property is directiy across the street from an active, welleestablished church in
SW Detroit, which is considered a ?sensitive receptor,? in terms of any industrial activity exposure. The
property is within a residential neighborhood that aiready experiences problematic truck traffic for
residents and the property was identified in the city-community W. Vernor Corridor planning process for
mixed use development.

Reguestz No transfer of this property to Crown -- but if the property is transferred, any agreement
should not automatically guarantee or provide for any future land use, zoning or permit that would
create additional negative impact by truck traffic or other industrial activities to the residents and
adjacent church.

4) Expedited approval process for Crown:

Stated: ?The City will provide an expedited approval process for Crown's intended development of
property for projects."

Page 42 of 58

 What speci?cally is meant by ?expedited approval process? and will it circumvent any public due
process for information and input or any public protections?

5) Deiray/Springwells/ Fort Wayne - Crown interest Area

A delineated area on the map (attached) provided by the city indicates a Crown Enterprise "interest
Area? that includes a portion of Fort Wayne and the Uelray Boat Launch among other land.

- What specific Crown plans have been disclosed to the city related to acquiring land in the
delineated interest area that includes a portion of Fort Wayne property and the Delray Boat
Launch; and what promises or intents, if any, has the city conveyed toward facilitating Crown?s
acquisition of additional properties in the delineated Crown interest Area?

6) UTS McNichols Area stipulation ?Crown option to purchase at market value in the UTS McNichols
area?

What does this provision that Crown gets priority over other open-market buyers, or are
there any other special conditions afforded to Crown with any purchases?

7) Needs/requests for future development processes, especially involving community benefits:

1. The full costs of prospective development should be transparently disclosed to the public prior to
negotiation of associated Community Benefits.

2. Current appraisals of land by quali?ed entities should be provided for all land involved in
development agreements, whether for direct use or stipulated in land transfers, and appraisals should
be disclosed to the public for evaluating the pubiic?s interests in agreements.

3. Future interests in properties: Neighborhood residents and property owners must be informed and
afforded opportunities for due process to provide input and defend their interests for properties
implicated in land transfers for developments before any Development Agreements are signed and
binding promises are made. Potential future use of the properties stipulated in transfers needs to be
disclosed to neighboring property owners, and no additional conditions should be guaranteed that
would waive the public rights to engage, to be informed, and to be protected with respect to the future
use of the property.

Thank you for considering these concerns.
