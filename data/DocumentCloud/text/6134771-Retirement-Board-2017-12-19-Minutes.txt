LABF Harassment Policy
Michael Walsh and Robert Molaro informed the Trustees that the LABF needed to establish a sexual harassment
policy by January 1, 2018 as a result of P.A. 100-0554 becoming law in the State of Illinois. In order to comply with
the new requirement, Mr. Walsh presented a draft Policy on Sexual and Other Harassment that Fund staff and Fund
Counsel had prepared. The Trustees requested that staff amend the draft policy in order to clarify the definition of
“manager” and to expand whom a person may report an instance of sexual or other harassment to as part of the
reporting process to include any Trustee or other person associated with LABF who is in a leadership position.
It was moved by Trustee LoVerde, seconded by Trustee Joiner, to approve The Laborers’ and Retirement Board
Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago (“LABF”) Policy on Sexual and Other Harassment, as amended.

 Correction to Duty Disability Administration
Date: 12/19/2017
Background:
Matters regarding awarding service credit to members on duty disability were discussed with the LABF Board at the
December 19, 2016 and January 24, 2017 Board meetings (see the attached report to the Board dated January 24,
2017). The Board requested that, going forward, LABF (1) take reasonable measures to ensure that LABF members
are aware that, unless otherwise specified in the Illinois Pension Code, they will only be awarded service credit for
periods of duty disability where they have accrued disability benefits from LABF, and (2) avoid penalizing members
for LABF’s historical misinterpretation of the Illinois Pension Code.
Measures Taken to Notify Members of the Requirement:
1. LABF worked with City Council’s Committee on Finance (the “COF”) on amendments to letters sent to LABF
members injured on the job notifying them that they should contact LABF about disability benefits to which
they may be entitled and that failure to do so could result in loss of service and salary credit for pension
purposes.
2. LABF secured access to customized reports in COF’s disability administration database system (iVOS) which
will allow LABF to identify approved workers’ compensation claims in a more timely and reliable manner.
LABF will utilize this and other information to generate letters to members whose claims are approved by
the City’s worker’s compensation administrators. Additionally, LABF utilized this same reporting to identify
members who had new approved worker’s compensation claims in the last several months and did not
apply for benefits from the LABF. These members were also sent letters informing them of the need to
apply for benefits from LABF.
3. LABF developed a duty disability brochure which will be made available in LABF’s office, will be included
with the letters LABF sends to members with new worker’s compensation claims, and will be posted
electronically on LABF’s website. Additionally, the brochures will be made available upon request to the
COF, City of Chicago, and labor unions as a tool to educate LABF’s membership.
Proposed Administrative Rule (Effective upon adoption by the LABF Board):
For periods of duty disability beginning after December 19, 2017:
 Employee members must apply, and have their applications approved by the Board, to begin accruing
disability benefits from LABF (an accrued benefit is a benefit granted by the Board regardless of monetary
compensation);
 Unless otherwise specified in the Illinois Pension Code, employee members shall only be eligible to receive
service credit corresponding to periods for which they have accrued disability benefits from LABF; and
 No duty disability benefit shall begin to accrue for any period of time more than one year prior to the date
on which the application for disability benefit is received by the Board (interpreted to include the Fund).
For any periods of duty disability beginning prior to and including December 19, 2017:
 Members must apply, and have their applications approved by the Board, to begin accruing disability
benefits from LABF (an accrued benefit is a benefit granted by the Board regardless of monetary
compensation);
 Current and former employees who have contributions with LABF and are not on annuity may apply for
past duty disability benefits from LABF:
o With respect to current employees, accrued benefits associated with periods of time more than
one year prior to the date on which the application for disability benefit is received by the Board
(interpreted to include the Fund) shall have no monetary component; and
o With respect to former employees, accrued benefits shall have no monetary component; and
 Unless otherwise specified in the Illinois Pension Code, members shall only be eligible to receive service
credit corresponding to periods for which they have accrued disability benefits from LABF.
