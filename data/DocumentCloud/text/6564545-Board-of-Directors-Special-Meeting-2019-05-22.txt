COMMENTS

Mr. Friedman addressed the Board and asked the Board for guidance surrounding the prevailing
wage policy. Mr. Friedman has received inquiries from developers, various businesses, and
consultants asking what the new policy means for projects coming to the Port. There have been
concerns about the capital stacks in certain projects because they weren?t contemplating the 100%
prevailing wage policy.

Mr. Friedman then referer to a presentation attached hereto as ?Exhibit A (slides Director
McNair stated that the dialogue outside of the Port and the Board has resulting in issues that were
not at all intended. The Policy is not intended to create a union vs. non?union battle, and not one
that the Port intends to engage in. The Spirit of the Policy was to take a leadership role in being
stewards of economic development in our region and to contribute where we can. Chairwoman
Roller thanked Director McNair for his comments and agreed with his remarks. Director
Applegate stated that the Port has long prided itself on being a model for how a public agency
ought to conduct itself, which is key to the discussion.

Mr. Friedman stated that things to consider regarding policy modification are to: 1) develop
exemption criteria; 2) eliminate all exemptions; and 3) consideration of certain types ofissuances
outside the scope of the policy. Director Wondolowski stated that if the issuance doesn?t involve
construction, it?s a moot point. If the issuance creates construction jobs, then it would fall under
the policy. Director McNair noted the examples provided were good and clear. In every issuance
that the Port engages in, there is some form ofconstruction in the project. Director Ramsey stated
she agrees with the categorizations provided but thinks each project can be handled on a case?by?
case basis without turning it into an exemption policy. Chairwoman Roller stated that it seems all
are in agreement ofthe importance of prevailing wage. Director McNair added that by having the
policy we are achieving our goals, though there are some projects that fall outside the four key
areas. The Port will need the support of entities that are providing part of the capital stack. The
City, County and others have a responsibility to publicly state their position. Chairwoman Roller
invited Councilman Brancatelli to add to the conversation. Councilman Brancatelli stated that the
project was presented at the Cleveland Citywide Development Corporation and
prevailing wage was recommended for the project and prevailing wage was unanimously
approved. He reiterated that the issue is about skilled labor building legacy projects, not union vs.
non-union. For this project, there is not a requirement for prevailing wage, however it is being
recommended. Chairwoman Roller indicated that the County Administration feels very strongly
that prevailing wage should be included in the project.

Inclusion, Equity Wages Policy

 

Mr. Carl Naso addressed the Board of Directors and referred to a presentation attached hereto as
?Exhibit Referring to slide 3, Director McNair noted that modification of the policy was a
well thought process that over a year. Cleveland has been identi?ed as a city of poverty. The Port
wants to play a progressive role in improving poverty in the city, and to ensure diversity, inclusion
and wages on projects in which the Port is involved. Director Smith stated any exemptions that
are made must be implemented in an equitable and consistent manner. Without having clear
criteria puts the Board in a difficult place. Director Smith then stated he was recusing himself
from discussion and vote.

Mr. Friedman agreed and requested input from the Board regarding possible exemption criteria.
Director Hoogenboom stated that the discussion the policy and whether there should be
exemptions at all, as Opposed to making that assumption, and then discussing the nature of the
exemption. Mr. Friedman agreed and stated that input is requested as to whether there should be
exemptions offered at all that should be the ?rst order of discussion. Director Applegate stated
that the Port could be inundated with requests for exemptions. There is no end to the potential
criteria that could be applied in making exemptions. Mr. Friedman has a concern that ifthe policy
states no exemptions, only prevailing wage, it is possible that projects will no longer come to the
port. Director Wondolowski added that there are developers in Cleveland that would come before
the Board and not ask for any exemptions. Mr. Wilcox stated that if it?s decided not to offer
exemptions, that the policy would need to be modified and voted on in order to be clear. Director
McNair stated that at the time the policy was created, there wasn?t enough information to determine
what should be exempt. Referring to slide 5, Director Wondolowski asked for clarity regarding
the statement on slide 5 that states ?National and other State issuers can issue in lieu of the port. .
. Mr. Naso replied that the City, State or other port authorities have the ability to issue the bonds.
Director Wondolowski disagreed with the concern that another city, county, state or port authority
would issue bonds and directly undermine the Port of Cleveland?s policy to ensure economic
stabilization for people in our region. Chairwoman Roller then suggested learning the policies of
other entities. Director Ramsey noted that she?s not aware of any exemptions granted by the City
or the County. Mr. Wilcox noted that most port authorities have not adopted prevailing wage for
bond ?nancing. Director Wondolowski noted that there are other port authorities entertaining the
same type of resolutions to pass. Mr. Friedman stated that additional fact finding should occur.
Mr. Hoogenboom asked Mr. Friedman to elaborate. Mr. Friedman replied that there are projects
in the pipeline in which developers are responding with a solid ?no? to prevailing wage. Director
Wondolowski asked the Board to consider continuing the discussion and not making any decisions
today.

Mr. Naso introduced and welcomed Ms. Rebecca Hedges, VP of Development. and Mr. Brian
Midlik, CIO, both of Stark Enterprises. Ms. Hedges and Mr. Midlik referred to a presentation
attached hereto as ?Exhibit Mr. Midlik stated that Starck is asking for an exemption or
