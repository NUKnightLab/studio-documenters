Public Building Commission of Chicago
Audit Committee Report
July 2018 Board Meeting
Meeting Chair:

Commissioner David Todd Whittley
Commissioner Samuel Wm. Sax
Commissioner Arnold L. Randall

The Audit Committee met on July 13, 2018. Our report is as follows:
The PBC’s Executive Director provided an introduction to the committee and details
regarding enhanced measures undertaken by the PBC in support of a Change Order Audit
performed by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). PBC management agreed with
recommendations provided by the OIG and has implemented actions to enhance the robust
system in place to manage construction change orders.
The Office of the Inspector General of the City of Chicago reported on the findings and
recommendations of the PBC Construction Change Order Audit. The OIG made six
recommendations to the PBC to ensure construction change orders are justified and
reasonably priced. PBC provided a response to the OIG recommendations and has been
working with the Audit team to identify efficiencies and process improvements.
The PBC’s Director of Finance reported the Commission’s Basic Financial Statements as of
and for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, and 2016. The PBC’s assets exceeded
liabilities by $___ million on December 31, 2017. Of this amount, $___ million was included
in net investment in capital assets and $___ million was restricted for use by the Daley
Center and for Commission operations.
The PBC’s total net position decreased by $____ and $__ million for the years ended
December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively, due to decreases in project revenue that directly
impact the Commission’s administrative fee.
Representatives from Deloitte provided the required auditor communications related to the
PBC’s Audited Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. Of note, there
were no audit adjustments, recorded or unrecorded. Deloitte further reported that there
were no material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the internal controls over
financial reporting.
The Audit Committee accepted the reports

 An Executive Session was convened for the purpose of presentation of Reports by Sharon
Jones, Independent Monitor with O-H Community Partners, Ltd. for F.H. Paschen, S.N.
Nielsen & Associates. The Audit Committee reconvened and accepted the Reports of the
Independent Monitor.
. That concludes my report.

a scope review was performed with Terracon Consultants, Inc. The Scope review meeting was held on May 7, 2018.
the scope review meeting and subsequent discussions it was determined that there were scope items that needed to be clarified:

individual.

It was determined that Terracon Consultants, Inc. should include a weekly walk~through and report summarizing safety and quality
observations.

however, the ITL will perform the required Field Quality Control tests and inspections.

Re: PBC Project #05115 Ebinger Elementary School Annex
Proposal for Additional services Passenger Elevator Consultant Services

Dear Mr. Quathamer,

Thank you for the opportunity to continue to service the Public Building Commission. Per the request of Chicago
Public School (CPS) representatives, Studio ARQ was given the directive to obtain the services of an elevator
consultant to review construction submittals and assist in the construction administration services related to the
elevator installation. Based on initial input from Donnelly Associates during the Design Development Phase, and
upon review of received proposals for Elevator consulting Services, we have determined that Donnelly 
Associates would best serve the project since they were instrumental in developing the scope and specifications
initially with CPS.

The fees for elevator consulting services have been provided in the attached proposal from Donnelly Associates,
dated February 15, 2018 for a total of $8,640.00. We respectfully request that these fees be added to our contract

for the Ebinger Elementary School Annex and Renovation.

Because Donnelly Associates has neither an MBE or WBE status, we have provided a letter requesting a waiver
from participation goal for this work in lieu of Schedule and forms.

Thank you for your continued trust and look forward in providing you with our continued professional service.
If you need additional information or documentation, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

As requested, We have obtained a preposal from Donnelly Associates, Inc. for Elevator
Consulting Services to review submittals, shop drawings, assist with construction administration
and perform on-site acceptance reviews for the elevator installation at Esmond School. After
review of the proposal, we feel that since Donnelly Associates, Inc. were directly involved in
the development of the current Speci?cations and standards for the CPS Elevator Modernization
Program, it is in the best interest of the project to accept the proposal as presented.

The proposal attached from Donnelly Associates, Inc. dated January 26, 2018 has itemized the
fees for services with a total in the amount of $8,640.00. We are requesting that these fees for

services be added to the Onyx Architectural Services, Inc. contract for the Esmond Elementary
School Annex Renovations project.

Seeing that Donnelly Associates, Inc. is neither MBE or WBE, we are requesting in the letter
attached a waiver from the MBE WBE participation goals for this work in place of the

Let us know if there are any questions or if any additional information is required.

Mr Fernandez:

The Additional Services proposal referenced above incorporates the scope of work to be

proposal is attached for your reference.

The elevator consulting services scope of work includes the review of construction
submittals and assistance in onstruction administration services related to the elevator
installation as indicated in the attached Schedule of Cost Elevator Consulting Services.
Donnelly Associates was selected for the elevator consulting services because they were
central to the development of standard elevator specifications. Despite having

With the above in mind, EC Purdy Associates requests that Donnelly Associates fee be
