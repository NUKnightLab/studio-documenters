DEMOLITION DEBRIS RECYCLING ORDINANCE (PROPOSED ORDINANCE).
Transmitting a Communication dated September 26, 2008, by Kevin N. Givens,
Director, Department of Environmental Control:
requesting authorization to amend Chapter 30 Environmental Control, Article IX,
Sections 30-960 through 30-969 as it pertains to the recycling of demolition debris
and amend Chapter 32 Fees, Section 32-1 as it pertains to the demolition debris
recycling permit fee.
The purpose of these amendments is to increase the amount of demolition debris in
suburban Cook County that is recycled. Regulating this activity will insure that a
minimum of 50% of demolition debris is recycled. This type of regulatory activity
imposes a higher level of environmental responsibility among contractors
performing demolition projects in Cook County while insuring an increase in the
production of recycled materials.
Paid fees will be deposited in the Cook County Waste Management Fund. The
purpose of the fee is to provide assistance for community based recycling activities
and supplement the resources of the Office of Environmental Control that must be
utilized to process permits, monitor and enforce this Ordinance.
