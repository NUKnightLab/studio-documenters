CHICAGO INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST
Contracting Manual

Introduction
In April 2012, the Chicago Infrastructure Trust (“CIT” or the “Trust”) was created via executive order
and Chicago City Council resolution. The Trust will provide focus and leadership to build a pipeline of
executable Public-Private Partnership (“P3”) projects that will meet Chicago’s infrastructure needs,
drive economic development and create jobs. Public-Private Partnership contracting is valuable to
the people of the City of Chicago because it harnesses private investment, expertise and innovation
to complete important infrastructure projects that the City of Chicago could not complete using
traditional public finance. In addition, P3 contracting leverages the technical and operating expertise
of private industry to perform design, construction, operational and maintenance functions that may
not be core competencies of the City of Chicago.
This Contracting Manual explains how the Trust will identify infrastructure projects and the process
and procedures for contracting using private partners. It includes policy discussions that will help
architects, engineers, construction companies, financing sources, service companies, other interests
and citizens understand how the Trust will operate.
Please note that terms in the manual will evolve over time, and you should look for the most current
version on the Trust’s website, www.shapechicago.org.

 CHICAGO INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST
Contracting Manual

Definitions
There are a variety of terms that are used regularly in discussing infrastructure contracting.
Definitions for a number of these terms are set forth in this Section I.
a. Potential Roles for Private Partner
i. Design – Create design for a project as specified in the contracting process through
competitive bid, collaborative bid, unsolicited bid, citizen-proposed bid or schedule
contracting.
ii. Build – Provide a plan and complete construction of an approved design as
specified, within an agreed time-frame. The builder shall have the capability, in all
respects, to perform fully the contract requirements and has the business integrity
and reliability that will assure good faith performance.
iii. Finance – Secure and provide financing to build and operate project requested.
Methods to finance can include government grants, government loans, public debt,
private debt and private equity. In many projects, there will be a mix of these
sources. Financing approaches will be considered as part of the evaluation process.
This will occur on a case-by-case basis, but generally the Trust will be concerned
with the value for money, financial return, financial capability and capacity of the
bidder.
iv. Operate – Assume responsibility to manage and staff an asset for a defined period,
according to project specifications. Operational performance will be subject to
review at regular intervals and on an ad-hoc basis.
v. Maintain - Assume responsibility to maintain and support an asset for a defined
period, according to project specifications. Maintenance performance will be subject
to review at regular intervals and on an ad-hoc basis.
b. Additional Relevant Terms
i. Availability Payment – Compensation made by the Trust to a private
concessionaire for its responsibility to design, construct, operate, and/or maintain an
asset for a set period of time, based upon particular project milestones or facility
performance standards.

Version 1.0   July 19, 2013

 CHICAGO INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST
Contracting Manual

ii. Best Price – The proposal that provides the lowest price to fulfill the requirements
as predetermined by the RFP.
iii. Best Value - The overall combination of quality, price and various elements of the
required services that, in total, are optimal relative to the Trust’s needs, as
predetermined in the RFP.
iv. Contract – The written agreement between the Trust and a vendor for the provision
of goods and/or services to the Trust by that vendor.
v. Evaluation Team – The board of directors and management personnel of the Trust,
plus any additional third-party experts or advisors the Trust deems necessary, to
evaluate proposals including RFI/RFQ/RFP, unsolicited bids, collaborative bids, bids
from citizens or schedule bids. The evaluation team may vary by project depending
upon the expertise required for evaluation.
vi. “Offeror” (also referred to as Bidder) - any individual, partnership, corporation, or
joint venture that formally responds to a Request for Information (RFI), Request for
Qualifications (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RPF). It also refers to suppliers who
submit unsolicited proposals, participate in collaborative proposals or submit
qualifications to be a schedule supplier. Offeror or bidder can include any company,
firm, partnership, corporation, association, joint venture, or other entity permitted by
law to practice engineering, architecture, construction contracting, or other services
required in the City of Chicago. Any company, firm, partnership, corporation, joint
venture or other entity that is barred or ineligible to perform the services required in
the City of Chicago will be excluded. Typically, the term offeror (or bidder) is used
prior to the award of a contract.
vii. Private Entity (also referred to as a Contractor) – The private interest involved in
P3 contracting that partners with the Trust to implement a project.
viii. Request for Information (RFI) – A solicitation sent to potential suppliers for the
purpose of securing feedback, developing strategy, building a database and
understanding potential project approaches based on the suppliers’ expertise. While
it is part of the competitive contracting process, it does not lead directly to
contracting, which is done based on a follow-up RFP or RFQ.

Version 1.0   July 19, 2013

5

 CHICAGO INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST
Contracting Manual

ix. Request for Proposals (RFP) – A solicitation to identify a preferred bidder to
implement a new project. This can include any or all phases of the project: design,
build, finance, operate and maintain. Bidders should expect to furnish evidence of
their experience and ability to meet the Trust’s requirements along with a proposed
price when responding to an RFP. This is because the Trust is as concerned with
the Bidder’s capability as with its proposed price.
x. Request for Qualifications (RFQ) – A solicitation released to obtain qualifications
that will identify best-qualified bidders that possess a technical expertise in specific
disciplines, financial capacity, financing capability and operating capability. RFQs
differ from RFPs in that pricing information is not requested. Often, an RFQ will be
issued to identify a set of potential bidders to receive an RFP.
xi. Sister Agencies – A group of agencies that serve the people of the City of Chicago
but subject to approval by the Chicago City Council, including: Chicago Public
Schools (CPS); Chicago Housing Authority (CHA); Chicago Park District (CPD);
Chicago Transit Authority (CTA); City Colleges of Chicago (CCC); Metropolitan
Pier & Exposition Authority (MPEA); Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of
Greater Chicago (MWRDGC) and Public Building Commission (PBC).
xii. Special Purpose Entity (SPE) – Any one or more companies, firms, partnerships,
corporations, joint ventures or other entities created or used for the express purpose
of completing a project. They may be multi-disciplinary in nature to provide expertise
for all required phases of a project. An SPE may be created in order to execute a
contract with the Trust or with a bidder.

xiii. Value for Money – The process of developing and comparing total project costs
when considering traditional contracting vs. alternative contracting such as a P3.
Value for money exists when the risk-adjusted costs of alternative contracting are
less than the risk-adjusted costs of traditional contracting.

II.

Best Practices Concepts
The Trust will structure each project to meet the specific needs of the people of the City of
Chicago for successful completion. In general, projects will typically reflect a set of key best
practices for Public-Private Partnerships:
a. Stakeholder Alignment – The Trust will secure alignment among stakeholders from all
relevant departments and agencies of the City of Chicago and the Chicago City Council.
This will create stability in the contracting process and provide assurance to participants
of the commitment to projects for which bid requests are released. Approval of terms of
final bids may be subject to approval of the Chicago City Council or other Agency boards
or Commissions, prior to contracting.
b. Duration – Agreements will typically run for 20 – 40 years, to enable building of realistic
financial models.
c. Shared Revenue Streams – To create a true partnership between public and private
entities, agreements may be designed to create mutual on-going interest through shared
revenue streams.
d. Asset Ownership – The Trust or City will typically retain ownership of underlying assets
(e.g., real estate, roads, right-of-ways) even when procuring long-term operating and
maintenance.
e. Shared Risk and Risk Allocation – Risks associated with the project will be allocated
between the public and private sectors based upon the party best able to manage and
mitigate them. Shared risk is a cornerstone of alternative contracting models.
f.

Risk Transfer - As the private entity assumes a greater share of responsibility via project
requirements, the private entity assumes a greater share of the risk. The table below
describes the range of potential project requirements and the associated degree of risk
transfer.

g. Full Scale Projects vs. Demonstration Projects – The Trust will target full-scale projects
for competitive bids as opposed to demonstration projects.
i. Full-scale projects demonstrate a more significant commitment on behalf of the Trust
and the City of Chicago than demonstration projects
ii. Consequently, they present the greatest opportunity to attract the strongest interest
from private partners who respond to RFIs/RFQs/RFPs. This will maximize
competition within the private sector and provide the most advantageous terms to
the people of the City of Chicago.
h. Evaluation Based on Short-term and Long-term Factors – The Trust will consider a
range of short-term and long-term factors when evaluating project approaches and bids,
to ensure that completed projects best serve the needs of the people of the City of Chicago.
These will be discussed in greater detail in Section VII, Proposal Evaluation. In general
they include:
i. Financial
ii. Technical
iii. Timeline
iv. Experience

Initial Programs and Project Selection
a. Initial Programs - The broad mandate for the Trust is to provide alternative, innovative
financing and project delivery for transformative infrastructure projects of all types –
including but not limited to renewable energy, transportation, utilities, social or cultural
facilities, government facilities, educational facilities, water, waste management, real
property, telecommunications, etc. Over time, the Trust anticipates working on projects
across the infrastructure spectrum; however, in order to focus its early efforts, the Trust
has prioritized the following initial program areas:
•

Energy: Leverage energy technologies, systems or programs to provide more cost
effective and environmentally friendly energy or reduce energy consumption.

•

Underutilized Property: Repurpose underutilized city assets (land, improved
properties, rooftops, right-of-ways, etc.) to their highest and best use to reduce
cost and increase revenue.

•

Transportation: Facilitate cost-effective renewal or expansion of transportation
infrastructure to provide better service at a lower cost and reduce congestion.

At all times, the Trust is open to exploring infrastructure projects of all types or receiving
unsolicited proposals related to any infrastructure project that aligns with its mandate.
b. Project Selection - The Trust will identify projects from a range of sources: its own
research about emerging technologies and best practices; City of Chicago and Sister
Agency operational goals, infrastructure needs and capital budget constraints; and input
from potential investors, citizens, public interest groups and other potential users. Both
greenfield and brownfield projects, defined as follows, will be considered:
•

Brownfield Projects: Existing assets or structure that require improvements, repairs
or expansion and may be partially operational or generating income.

•

Greenfield Projects: Assets or structures that need to designed and constructed
where no infrastructure improvements exist.

The Trust will maintain a pipeline of potential projects in different phases of pre-procurement
that will be prioritized based on their economic and social impact and their feasibility. As part
of the pre-procurement process, the Trust will engage the appropriate stakeholders and
subject matter experts in the evaluation and development of the project business case and
procurement approach. In all cases, the Trust will endeavor to obtain the government preapprovals relevant to a given transaction that will increase project certainty for private sector
participants before the CIT project contracting process is initiated. A high-level overview of this
pre-approval process for projects that involve assets, rights, permissions and liabilities of the
City of Chicago is outlined as follows:

of all bidders, who respond to an RFQ. The basis of award will be clearly defined in
the RFP. The RFP will also define proposal requirements, including technical
requirements and evaluation criteria.
The evaluation process will consider
understanding of the project, applicable experience, anticipated complex problems
and the solutions to those problems. Thoroughness and quality will also be considered.

b. Pre-Development Proposals - The Trust may enter into a pre-development agreement
when a project is not completely defined; financial feasibility has not been determined, but
looks financeable on a preliminary basis; or the Trust is seeking private sector innovation
and expertise in accelerating an optimally feasible project.
i.

The private partner participates in project planning and design and prepares the
master financial plan and master development plan.

ii.

The private partner absorbs initial phase work – “sweat equity.”

iii.

If project proves feasible, the private partner may deliver an unsolicited bid or
participate in a collaborative bid covering implementation.

c. Unsolicited Proposals – Private entities or individuals may choose to submit proposals
to the Trust when no RFI/RFQ/RFP has been issued.
