NOTICE AND AGENDA

(Approved by Cook County Commission on Human Rights at March 8, 2018 meeting)

Consistent with County Code, § 1.9, the following proposal, which was noticed and approved by
the Cook County Commission on Human Rights at its March 8, 2018 meeting will not be effective
until the sooner of May 7, 2018 or the date upon which this rule revision is received and filed by
the Rules Committee of the Cook County Board of Commissioners.
Revision 1: Document Preservation Obligation Runs to All Parties
Existing rule:
Section 420.135

Maintenance of Records by Respondent

Once a Complaint has been served on a Respondent, the Respondent shall preserve all records and other
material which may be relevant to the Complaint until the matter has been closed.
Revised rule:
Section 420.135

Maintenance of Records by Respondent Parties

Once a Complaint has been served on a Respondent, the Complainant(s) and Respondent(s) shall
preserve all records and other material which may be relevant to the Complaint or any defenses until the
matter has been closed by the Commission. Provided that a party has not previously incurred a duty to
preserve evidence through agreement, contract, statute or its own affirmative conduct, a Complainant’s
preservation obligation begins when the Complainant files the Complaint with the Commission, and a
Respondent’s preservation obligation begins when the Complaint has been served on the Respondent. A
party’s failure to meet its preservation obligations under this Rule may result in the Commission drawing
an adverse assumption about the content of the missing record or other material against the party that
failed to preserve that record or other material.
