Revised Chief Executive Officer's 90 Day - 6 Month -1 Year Plan for the Cook County Health
and Hospitals System

Mr. Foley presented his revised plan. He provided information on the status of recruiting efforts for the
positions of Director of Human Resources, Chief Compliance Officer, and the Director of Public Relations. He
stated that the search for a Chief Nursing Officer for Stroger Hospital has been modified; the search is now to
fill the position for a System-wide Chief Nursing Officer. He added that December 1st is the target date to
complete the searches for the positions of System Chief Information Officer, System Chief Financial Officer,
and System Chief Medical Officer.
.
Update on Strategic Planning efforts
Mr. Foley presented an update on strategic planning efforts. He has had regular meetings with Director
Greenspan, Director Golden, and the strategic planning group. They are planning the initial series of six town
hall meetings across the County to gather community input, starting in late July. They are working with various
groups and organizations, including the Health Care Consortium of illinois, to plan those meetings. After the
initial town hall meetings, and once a draft vision of strategies is completed, another series of town hall
meetings will be held to get input before the strategic plan is fmalized. There will also be a series of internal
meetings with various other groups such as leadership, physician groups, employees, etc.
Update on information technology and introduction ofnew Chief Information Officer, Steve
Zeelau

Mr. Foley introduced Steve Zeelau, Chief Information Officer for the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System.
Mr. Zeelau presented an update on Information Systems (Attachment #2).
Mr. Zeelau provided information on the Cerner upgrade. He emphasized that the System is the first health
system in the world to go live with this upgrade. This is a major accomplishment; once Provident Hospital goes
live, all major clinical systems will be on the same platform. Standardization and delivery of care will be
increasingly universal throughout the System using these information technology initiatives.
Questions were raised regarding the information systems' remaining gaps. Director Carvalho inquired whether
Mr. Zeelau could provide examples of such gaps. Mr. Zeelau responded that they do not have all information
which is electronic in nature in the emergency rooms, such as clinical results.
The Board discussed whether the System was doing computerized physician order entry (CPOE) across its sites,
and whether the System may qualify for stimulus dollars. Mr. Zeelau responded that they were looking into the
subject of stimulus dollars. Further discussion took place on current and potential interfaces between Cerner,
the Siemens system (which is currently used for billing) and the IRIS system.
Director Carvalho provided additional information on stimulus dollars. He stated that there are add-on
payments that will be available to those implementing meaningful use of electronic health records. Apart from
that, there will be up-front money that may be available for the costs of implementing electronic health records.
However, none of the guidance on that subject has been provided by the federal government; the System mayor
may not qualify for that funding. He mentioned that it was probably the add-on payments alluded to earlier in
the conversation.

Discussion took place on the subject of Cermak's issue with regard to access to medical records. Mr. Zeelau
provided an update on the status of the project. Mr. Foley stated that an update on the subject will be provided
at the next meeting of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee.
In response to Director Munoz' question regarding the status of the clinics in the Ambulatory and Community
Health Network, Mr. Zeelau responded that they are not yet fully integrated. Director Munoz requested that a
time line be provided for the Cemer rollout.

Mr. Zeelau provided information on the progress of the efforts to create the System's website, which is due to
go live by August 1stâ€¢ The Information Technology Steering Committee determined that the creation of the
website was the best way to address the needs of the human resources requirements and the interest from the
public. Marcel Blight, Acting Director of Public Affairs for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, is
Chairman of the subcommittee responsible for these activities. He is also responsible for determining the
content of the website.
The Board discussed the website. Chairman Batts stated that it was important that agendas for meetings of the
Board and its Committees be available on the website. Additionally, he suggested that a blog session space be
created for patients to provide input.
Director Carvalho mentioned other components that would need to be incorporated into the System's website,
including an online check register, and bidding/purchasing information as required by the System's procurement
policy. Additionally, he referred to the lllinois Open Meetings Act, and its requirement that meeting notices and
agendas of public bodies be electronically posted on its website. Although this requirement may currently be
met by the posting of such notices and agendas on the County's website, he stated that the System's website
must be capable of this function. Matthew B. DeLeon, Secretary to the Board of Commissioners, confIrmed that
such notice requirements are currently being met through electronic posting to the County's website.
Director Greenspan asked Mr. Zeelau to think about and return to the Board for follow-up discussions on the
following subjects: 1) clinical connectivity to the financial system, how charges are captured at the time of
encounter, and how equipment use and supply disposition is captured at the time of use; 2) commitment to
maintain the content of the System's website; and 3) the ability of information systems to automatically
generate accurate daily/monthly dashboard data.

Update on various activities involving peiformance assessments and benchmarking
Mr. Foley stated that the performance assessment by Navigant has been kicked-off. This will be a three month
process in order to complete the assessment.
With regard to the work currently being done by Solucient on the full-time equivalent employee benchmarking
study, Mr. Foley stated that the work will be completed soon. The System will then need to move forward on
the first phase of the reduction-in-force, to meet the goal of September 1St,

Update on the status ofnurse staffing at Provident Hospital of Cook County
Director Ansell asked for an update on the issue of nurse staffing at Provident Hospital of Cook County. Sidney
Thomas, Chief Operating Officer of Provident Hospital of Cook County, provided an update on the subject,
which involves position vacancies and nurse registry services. The Board discussed the information; it was
determined that Mr. Foley would further investigate the issue and repOlt back to the Finance Committee.

MISCELLANEOUS
Director Carvalho provided infonnation on current state legislative activities in Springfield. He stated that in
the absence of a budget as of May 30 th , they are now in overtime; a three-fifths vote is required to adopt
anything that takes effect immediately (including the budget). One issue that could affect the System directly is
a proposal to restructure Medicaid into a mandatory HMO structure. If this proposal passes, it has the potential
to disrupt use patterns for the System. More importantly, under this proposal, ifthere is no mechanism in place
for dealing with patients within this structure whose medical home is outside the System, there would be no
reimbursement for such care.

ADJOURNMENT
Director Butler, seconded by Director Golden, moved to adjourn.
UNANIMOUSLY AND THE MEETING ADJOURNED.

Re: Stroger Hospital Physicians
Dear Commissioner Collins:

.t has come to the attention of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System Board (System Board) that the County Board
may be considering whether to voluntarily recognize a union of Stroger Hospital attending physicians.
It is the position of the System Board that voluntary recognition of such a union would further complicate the challenges we
face in rapidly effectuating significant change in the Health System. In keeping with the spirit of the Health System
Ordinance which charges the System Board with perfonning human resources functions within the Health System, we
respectfully request that you allow the System Board to determine when and ifit is appropriate to recognize a collective
bargaining unit within the Health System. Enclosed is a summary of the System Board's position in this matter.

Thank you for your support and consideration,

v>t.JI7

POSITION OF THE COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM BOARD ON
VOLUNTARY RECOGNITION OF A STROGER HOSPITAL PHYSICIANS' UNION
The Cook County Board of Commissioners is considering whether to vote to voluntarily recognize that physicians
at Stroger Hospital of Cook County may unionize. The System Board, as the putative joint employer of the
Stroger physicians, opposes such an action because it would:
â€¢   Result in immediate unionization of a critical group of highly compensated supervisory professionals.
impairing the flexibility and speed with which the System Board can act to meet its charge.
â€¢   Be detrimental to patient care by creating a conflict of interest for Stroger physicians, who should have
an undivided loyalty to the Hospital as they supervise unionized Stroger resident physicians in carrying
out the hospital's core function, clinical patient care.
â€¢   Be detrimental to patient care by creating a conflict of interest between the obligation of Stroger
physicians to perform their delegated responsibility to assW"e patient safety and their loyalty to fellow
union members whose medical care they are supposed to self-POlice.
â€¢   Undermine existing managerial processes by unionizing a group of highly compensated, highly educated
professionals who are already extensively involved in Hospital decisions through their departmental and
medical staff structures, committees and leadership.
â€¢   Abandon the position the County has successfully taken in litigation on this very issue for a number of
years: that under the law, Stroger physicians are supervisory employees who are not entitled to unionize.
â€¢   Reduce the role ofthe System Board in carrying out its delegated human resources functions.
When it established the Health System, the County Board delegated governance of the System, including
authority over human resources functions, to an independent Board made up of individuals with substantial
expertise in the healthcare arena. While it is committed to maintaining a constructive relationship with the
collective bargaining units that exist within the System, the System Board urges the County Board to allow it to
apply its expertise and authority in determining when and if it is appropriate to recognize a collective bargaining
unit within the System.
The System Board has a short window of time within which to implement major reforms to achieve substantial
improvements in the operation and financial viability of the Health System and must act within severe budgetary
constraints. The County Board and the System Board have taken enormous strides and are on the cusp of
implementing major improvements.
Stroger Hospital is the flagship of the Health System and will lead much of the change that is to come. Stroger
.. physicians are vital to the process of change. The System Board is committed to a strong partnership with
physicians, to improved effectiveness of Medical Staff structures, and to revising physician compensation to
achieve parity across the Health System. Physician support will be imperative as new service lines are established
and some existing service lines are reorganized or discontinued. The System Board expects its highly
accomplished and professional physician partners to be at the forefront of needed change, while at all times
keeping the ultimate constituent group - the patients who have nowhere else to turn - firmly in view in front of all
other groups.
Background: Stroger physicians have repeatedly been held to be ineligible to form a union. The law
provides that supervisory employees have no right to be represented by a union because it recognizes that the
employer has a right to expect the undivided loyalty of its supervisory and management team. Supervisors who
are represented by a union are placed in a conflict of interest position particularly if they supervise other
unionized employees. The County has for many years considered it imprudent for attending physicians, who
supervise the unionized residents in performing the core patient care activities conducted at the Hospital, to be
unionized. The efforts of County Hospital physicians to unionize extend back to the 1980s. At that time, the

 12
Labor Relations Board I determined that these physicians were supervisory employees and therefore were not
entitled to unionize. The unionization effort re-surfaced in the late 1990s, resulting in another determination by
the Labor Relations Board, subsequently affirmed by the Ulinois Appellate Court, that County Hospital physicians
were supervisory employees and therefore were not entitled to unionize.2 Two to three years ago, the Service
Employees International Union (SEIU) filed a majority interest petition seeking to represent County-employed
physicians working within several facilities, including parts of the ambulatory clinic system and Stroger Hospital.
The County's position was again that the Stroger physicians were not appropriately included in the proposed
bargaining unit because they were supervisory employees. The County and the Union reached a settlement
agreement whereby the attending physicians working in the clinics were permitted to unionize but, since the
Stroger physicians were supervisory employees, that portion of the petition seeking their inclusion in the
bargaining unit was withdrawn. On July 30, 2007, in furtherance of this agreed resolution, the union submitted a
letter to the Labor Relations Board stipulating that there had been no change in the facts underlying the prior
rulings finding Stroger physicians to be supervisors who were not entitled to unionize. However, fewer than two
years after reaching this settlement, the SEIU has now filed yet another petition seeking to unionize Stroger
physicians and is facing an imminent deadline for dismissal of its petition because it has not provided evidence of
new facts to support its current petition.
Background: Stroger pbysicians direct tbe bospital's core function: patient care. As the only profession
licensed to practice medicine, physicians represent the very characteristics that are typically excluded from
unions: they are highly compensated, highly educated licensed professionals who decide what health services
will be provided to patients and direct the other members of the health care team in delivering these services the
very reason the hospital exists. In addition to directing the entire health care team in delivering patient care,
physicians play a major role in the complex departmentaJ and medical staff structures that manage the overall
delivery of health care services and through these structures they oversee the quality of medical care provided in
the hospital including peer review of the care provided by other physicians. All of this is true at Stroger Hospital,
but Stroger physicians fulfill another role that is relevant to unionization. Stroger Hospital is home to the historic
Cook County Hospital residency programs known for their contributions to the field of medicine and for training
physicians across the country and around the world. Stroger physicians run' these programs and supervise
unionized resident physicians who provide direct patient care.
Conclusion: Flexibility and momentum are needed to meet tbe challenge of change. The current environment
for planning and implementing changes in the Health System is formidable. Cumbersome financial, human
resources and purchasing structures need to be tailored to the modem health care industry. Costs mount as the
budget shrinks. Working with these challenges, the System Board is charged with identifying changes in the
range of services the Health System should provide, where they should be provided, which health professionals
should provide them, and how they should be provided. It needs to streamline operations, cut costs, eliminate
unnecessary duplication, improve productivity and pursue all available avenues of financial reimbursement. The
System must have the flexibility to make maximum use of its most talented and productive staff while pursuing
new billing and compensation strategies. It needs to move quickly to improve the Health System's finances.
Stroger Hospital will be at the forefront of Health System reform. Stroger Physicians lead the medical care
provided at Stroger Hospital. The System Board must engage Stroger physicians as partners in change, putting the
interests of the Health System and its patients first. In order to do so, it must exercise the full authority granted by
the spirit and letter of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System Ordinance and be given the latitude it needs
to promote partnership while opposing unionization of Stroger physicians.

REPORT TO CCHHS BOARD ON AFFILIATIONS
Affiliation agreements with local academic medical centers have provided Attending and Resident
Physicians, clinical patient care services or other resources when Stroger Hospital of Cook County (SHCC)
has not been able to meet patient care needs with SHCC staff. Updated affiliation agreements with local
academic medicaltenters are in the process of being brought to the CCHHS Board for the 2009-10
academic year. Previously, affiliation agreements were typically for three years. In academic year 2008Â­
09, all affifiation agreements with academic medical centers were made for just one year. The one year
agreement span was made in view of the changing financial landscape and the need for a strategic plan
to better define our future relationships. In the process of preparing for the 2009-2010 academic year,Â·
direction was given to again make all agreements one year in anticipation of a CCHHS strategic plan in
the next 6-9 months to help guide future agreements.
The steps in preparing the affiliation agreements forthe 2009-10 academic year have been:

1.. Individual SHCC clinical departments have reviewed the 2008-09 agreements and invoices to
. verify that services were provided as promised.
2.   Internal department needs were revisited to determine contract needs for 2009-10.
3.   SHCC clinical department heads have submitted information to the CMO assessing clinical
productivity of contracted physicians and summarized other benefits or issues with the
relationship.
4.   This information was reviewed with the CCHHS Ad Hoc Working Group on Medical School
Relationships to address the following questions:
a.

Are we paying appropriate costs for physician services?

b.

Are contracted physicians carrying an appropriate workload?

c.

Do the,se contracts meet a critical need for the HHS?

Although information obtained could answer (a) fairly adequately, data for (b) was lessÂ·
complete because of a shortage of reliable data from some clinical areas. Although (c) was
addressed by each department with respect to patient care demand, the role of each
agreement in the overall strategic plan for CCHHS remains undefined.
5.   Clinical departments worked with the Department of Planning, Education and Research and the
States Attorney's Office to finalize new agreements for the 2009-10 year.
6.   Discussions were held between SHCC and SAO staff and their counterparts at the. medical
centers to resolve differences and reach final contract language
7.   The dollar amount in each of the proposed new academic year contracts was reviewed with the
CCHHS Ad Hoc Working Group on Medical School Affiliations
8.   Contracts with a July 1 renewal date were submitted to the Purchasing department for
placement on the June 12 CCHHS Finance Committee agenda.
9.   Finance committee-approved agreements will be placed on the June 26 CCHHS Board agenda

A review of the proposed contracts for 2009-10 provided the following summary data:
Total affiliation agreement costs for the 2009-10 year should be about $11,067,000. The current
academic year total contracted costs are $11,368,618. Proposed agreements for 2009-10 show a 2.6%
decrease in contracted costs for the next academic year.
Actual invoiced expenses have always been less than total contracted costs for a given year. Based on
past experience, about 80% of overall contracted costs are actually spent. This is due to several reasons.
Staffing may change during the year and result in contracted personnel not being needed at SHCCor not
being available at the contracting medical center. Departments also contract using conservative
estimates and the actual contract costs are often less than the "worst-case" scenario. Based on data
from our Finance department, for the current 2008-9 contract year, we continue to anticipate that total
costs will be significantly less than the full contract amount.
Rush University Medical Center, our master affiliate partner, accounts for about 84% of all these
contracted dollars. Of the doliars to Rush, 56% are in Department of Medicine, 34% in the Department
of Surgery and 10% in the Department of Pediatrics. This remains about the same from the previous
year.
For agreements with the Rush Department of Medicine, over half the total amount provides for direct
patient care services that are not related to educational programs. The largest single contract (over 2
million dollars) is for Clinical Electrophysiology patient care services for patients with critical heart
rhythm problems that cannot be managed at SHCC.
The University of Illinois accounts for about 9% of total contracted dollars. Northwestern accounts for
about 12%. In both cases, the majority of these dollars fund surgical subspecialty physicians.
A major change for 2009-10 contracts resulted from UIC's decision to pull Orthopedics residents from
SHCC. An increase in the Rush and l'Jorthwestern Orthopedics agreements helped to offset that loss.
A net of about 60 residentphysician FTEs are contracted for from Our academic affiliates. The vast
majority of these contracted residents are in the Department of Surgery as SHCC does not currently
have its' own General Surgery residency. When added to the 391 residency positions that are SHCC
employees, a total of about 450 FTEs of resident physicians staff SHCC at anyone time.
A total of 15.2 FTEs of Attending Physician time is to be provided by our academic medical center
partners. The Attending Physicians contracted for are almost entirely in difficult-to-recruit subspecialties
of Medicine, Pediatrics and Surgery.
Information from the benchmarking studies and from other internal analyses will be used to better
assess the relationship between resources and patient care demands in the coming months. It is
anticipated that in the next academic year this information will be used to critically reassess both
attending physiCian and resident needs and to suggest appropriate readjustments in staffing. Changes
in phYSician staffing would impact both the physicians that are contractually employed through these
agreements as well as those directly employed at SHCC.
