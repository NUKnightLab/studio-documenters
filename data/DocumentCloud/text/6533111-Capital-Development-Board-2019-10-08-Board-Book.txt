Project Manager:

Timothy Dietz

Project History: The scope of the work provides for the construction of two new parking lots; a 15,000 square foot military
vehicle lot constructed of Portland concrete and a 21,000 square foot private vehicle lot constructed of hot-mix asphalt
pavement. Construction of these lots includes: aggregate base sources, pavement marking, drainage structures and piping,
security fencing and site lighting.
Construction of the parking lots required an existing, vegetation-covered, earthen railroad embankment be removed and
the site regraded. During the design phase, the existing earthen berm tested positive for soil contamination; however, not
enough testing was done to fully identify the boundaries of the contaminated soils. After removal of the vegetation and just
prior to the start of excavation, it was determined that more borings needed to be made to further test the soils and determine
the boundaries of the contamination. The results indicated that there were an additional 3,250 tons of contaminated soil that
were not identified in the original bidding documents.
A not to exceed Proceed Order in the amount of $160,000 was approved by the board in August 2019 to move forward with
the excavation. However, on Sept 12, 2019 the Capital Development board was informed that additional contaminated soil
was discovered that would require further testing to determine if it would need to be hauled to the subtitle D landfill as well.
The test confirmed that it would. Removal of the additional contamination will result in additional disposal fees. The
contractor continued with their excavations and calculations were done to determine how much additional material would
be involved. The contractor estimates that there could be an additional 16,733 tons of soils, bringing the total to 19,983
tons. By September 27, 2019 the contractor will have reached the $160,000 limit that was previously approved; thus the
need for the revised proceed order.
Description of RFP Change: Remove soils exceeding the Tiered Approach to Corrective Action Objectives tier 1 limits
and haul them to a subtitle D landfill. Soils identified as Non-Clean Construction and Demolition Debris (CCDD) soils shall
be used as fill under the new parking lots or transported to a disposal site permitted to accept such material. Actual
disposal tickets and time will be accurately kept to verify the costs. This will be classified as an undiscovered soil
condition.
Requested Action: We are requesting approval of the revised Proceed Order G-1R in the amount of $885,000 to allow
the contractor to proceed with disposal of the additional contaminated soils. This revised proceed order combines the
previously approved $160,000 with an additional $725,000 for a total of $885,000.

Project Manager:

Ed James

Project History: The scope of work for this project includes the construction of two 4,640 square foot pre-engineered wood
structure buildings with metal siding and metal roof at the Day Labor site. It also includes the construction of one 6,000
square foot pre-engineered wood building with metal siding, standing seam roof, heating, lighting, and ventilation at the
Riverton site. These building will be used for vehicle storage.
The site at Riverton is located on fill material that is not suitable for a typical foundation system and slopes sharply toward
the east. Redesign of the footings at the Riverton site is required because the original footing design is not responsive to the
type of existing sub surface soil and fill conditions detailed in the Geotechnical report.
Description of RFP Change: Aggregate piers will need to be installed below the footings with slab reinforcement and
upgraded thickness. Footings and foundations will need to be redesigned to work with the aggregate piers. This change will
be classified as an Architect/Engineer error.
Requested Action: We are requesting the approval of Proceed Order G-02 in the amount of $166,661.08 to address the
necessary corrections to the original design. IDOT has committed additional funding for this Proceed Order.

Project Title and Location: Altgeld Hall 1409 W Green St. Urbana, Illinois 61820

Illini Hall 725 S. Wright St. Champaign, Illinois

Project Scope of Work: The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is proposing the
complete restoration of the existing iconic Altgeld Hall and replacement of Illini Hall with a
new facility in its location for the Departments of Mathematics and Statistics, as well as
providing a hub for the creation site an incubator for data science on our campus.
Altgeld Hall is referred to as the architectural jewel of campus. Originally known as Library
Hall, it was built in 1897 as the main library for the University of Illinois. Designed by
Nathan C. Ricker and James M. White, the building is one of the oldest on the campus and is
listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Several building additions have been
completed, beginning with an extension of the library book stacks in 1914. The most recent
addition, consisting of a four-story classroom wing along the east side of the original
building, occurred in 1956. The goal of this project is to completely restore Altgeld Hall to a
level consistent with a world class academic enterprise for the Departments of Mathematics
and Statistics. The existing condition of the buildings is poor and the existing spaces within
the buildings were not well suited to their current uses. Though the entire exterior envelope
of the structure is recognized as historic, only a limited number of interior spaces are of
comparable significance. The remainder of the building will be repurposed as necessary to
coherently support the activities of the Mathematics Department.
Illini Hall, originally functioning as the University YMCA, was constructed in 1907 and
acquired by the University in 1939. The building is not listed on the Historic Register, and
though eligible to be listed, the building is being proposed for demolition and the University
is working with the Illinois State Historic Preservation Office (ISHPO) to mitigate any
adverse effects. The new 135,000 gross square foot Illini Hall building will provide
administrative and academic spaces to support a large portion of the Departments of
Mathematics and Statistics. The building is ideally located to site an incubator for data
science on our campus that will unleash the brilliance and energy of our faculty and students
on the data problems of today while preparing the workforce of tomorrow. It will connect
the university’s data scientists with business, industry, and the community, and it will be a
giant step towards our strategic goal of providing every Illinois student with the opportunity
for a meaningful exposure to data science.

Although the Turner-Clayco team ranked highest in all
categories, the selection committee believes that Turner-Clayco must focus on the
projects that they currently have in construction at the University of Illinois. TurnerClayco is a joint venture between Turner Construction Company and Clayco, Inc.;
This Firm is Recommended Because:

 however, as individual firms, both Turner Construction Company and Clayco, Inc. have
several very large projects currently in progress, and both firms have experienced
performance issues on these projects. See below for a short summary of these issues.
Turner Construction Company U12054 (BP1 & BP2) Illinois Street Residence Dining
Facility Renovation & Addition. All design phases were over budget, at the 95%
construction document phase. We added $8 million to bring the project back into budget,
however at bid time; the project came in $5 million under the estimate. Turner did not
include a necessary $150K in waterproofing scope for BP1, this scope was then moved to
BP2 for bidding, however the project timeline made it necessary to then put the
waterproofing back into BP1 as a Field Directive, with a not-to-exceed price of $150K.
Turner Construction Company took one year to submit their first invoice for this project.
U17018 Memorial Stadium Renovation and Football Performance Center Missed $180K
of under-pinning insulation under the decking scope. U18041 Illinois Street Residence Townsend and Wardall Halls Renovation BP1 came in $ 5M over budget. BP2 came in
$10M over budget. Turner Construction Company took seven months to sign their
contract for this project. Clayco, Inc. U16015 Design Center Clayco improperly assigned
backfill scope, this scope was included in two (2) separate divisions but neither division
contractors included the scope of work in their bid, which was found at bid scope
evaluation, which resulted in a $500K change order, and will add two (2) months to the
schedule. Due to the performance issues stated above and after careful consideration and
discussion, the selection committee recommends Team #2, Gilbane Building Company
for the CM role on this project. Gilbane is currently the CM on the Mechanical
Engineering Building - Renovation and Addition project, which has been going well.
Their project estimate was under budget through the 95% construction document phase.
At time of bid, the project came in under budget. As a construction manager, Gilbane
Building Company is ranked third as a Higher Education builder in the country. They are
more than capable of performing this service.
