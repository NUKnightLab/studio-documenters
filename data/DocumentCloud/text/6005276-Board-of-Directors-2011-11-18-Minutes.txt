D. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, November 10, 2011
During the presentation of the minutes by Director Carvalho, the subject of the proposed contract with
CommunityHealth for the provision of dental services was discussed. Director Carvalho noted that the
County Board is proposing to provide another $1 million in FY2012 for the provision of dental services.
Director Ansell stated that he volunteers for CommunityHealth. He noted that, over the next year, there
should be a process put in place to measure the deliverables relating to the proposed contract. Director
Carvalho suggested that this subject be followed up and information be reported through the Quality and
Patient Safety Committee.
Director Carvalho indicated that the Committee held an extensive discussion regarding a proposed contract
for the provision of medical gas supply. Previously, the contract for medical gas supply and maintenance
had been bundled into one contract. The request before the Committee was only for the provision of
medical gas supply; a contract for the maintenance was expected to be presented for consideration in the
near future. At the Committee meeting, following discussion, it was determined that proposed contract for
the provision of medical gas supply and the proposed contract for maintenance services would be presented
directly to the Board for consideration at their meeting on November 18th, so that the two contracts could be
considered at the same time and the cost-savings from using the GPO could be analyzed in context. These
requests are on the Agenda for this meeting, under Item IV(B).
Director Carvalho, seconded by Director Lyne, moved the approval of the minutes of the
Finance Committee Meeting of November 10, 2011. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:
The prior contract was a bundled agreement which covered bulk gases, cylinder gas, maintenance, upgrades and
repair services of the valves and regulators throughout Stroger Hospital. The industry does not typically go to market
with this approach due to the difficulty of monitoring the costs of demurrage, parts, service and associated products.
NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
A multidisciplinary team of CCHHS subject matter experts determined the best approach to manage costs, contract
performance and service was to unbundle the distinct products and service.
This contract request provides for the maintenance, upgrades and repair services as a separate service offering for
Medical Gas Systems: Medical-Surgical Vacuum Systems, Laboratory Air and Vacuum Systems for Stroger Hospital,
the CORE Center, and Cermak Health Services. Based on an analysis of pricing submitted by the GPO providers,
LifeGas, a Division of Linde Gas North America, LLC, was selected as the supplier of choice.
