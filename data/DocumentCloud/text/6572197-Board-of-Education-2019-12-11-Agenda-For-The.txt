RESCIND BOARD REPORT 08-0723-PO3
BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS, PHYSICAL RESTRAINTS AND ISOLATED TIME OUTS FOR
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
AND
ADOPT INTERIM PHYSICAL RESTRAINTS AND TIME OUTS POLICY

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RECOMMENDS:

That the Board rescind Board Report and adopt interim policy as set forth below and will
determine any permanent change after the public comment period.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this new policy is to comply with emergency action taken by the Illinois State
Board of Education to ban the use of seclusion and certain physical restraints in Illinois schools
and to improve data collection on all instances of time out and physical restraint. ISBE ?led emergency
rules effective November 20, 2019 (23 Adm. C. 1.285) and as amended on December 4, 2019. This
policy sets forth requirements, restrictions and procedures related to the use of physical restraints and time-
outs for all Chicago Public Schools students in accordance with emergency rules.

POLICY TEXT:

I. General

A. Time out and physical restraint as de?ned in Emergency Rule 23 Adm. C. 1.285 shall
be used only for therapeutic purposes, or as a means of maintaining a safe environment
for learning, to the extent necessary to preserve the safety of students and others.

B. Neither time-out nor physical restraint shall be used as a form of punishment.

C. When a student experiences three instances of nontherapeutic time out or physical
restraint, the school personnel who initiated, monitored, and supervised the incidents shall
initiate a review of the effectiveness of the procedures used and prepare an individual
behavior plan for the student that provides either for continued use of these interventions
or for the use of other, speci?ed interventions. The plan shall be placed into the student's
temporary student record. The review shall also consider the student's potential need for
an alternative program or for special education eligibility, or, for a student already eligible
for special education, change in program.

D. Any adult who is supervising a student in time out or applying physical restraint shall be
trained in de-escalation, restorative practices, and behavior management practices.

II. Physical Restraint
A. Physical Restraint means holding a student or otherwise restricting the student?s
movements. Physical restraint as permitted pursuant to Emergency Rule 23 Adm. C.
1.285 includes only the use of speci?c, planned techniques the "basket hold" and
"team control"). A physical restraint shall not impair a student?s ability to breathe or speak
normally. Prone or supine physical restraint shall not be permitted, except if all the following
criteria is met:

1) Before using a prone or supine physical restraint, the District or other entity
serving the student shall review and determine if there are no known
medical or limitations that contradict the use of a prone or
supine restraint.

2) The District or other entity serving the student deems the situation an
emergency, de?ned as a situation in which immediate intervention is
needed to protect a student or other individual from imminent danger of

19-1211-P05

3)

4)

5)

5)

7)

causing serious physical harm to himself, herself, or others and less
restrictive and intrusive interventions have been tried and proven
ineffective in stopping the imminent danger.

Prone or supine physical restraint is used in a manner that does not restrict
or impair a student's ability to breathe or communicate normally, obstruct
a student's airway, or interfere with a student's primary mode of
communication.

Prone or supine physical restraints are used only by personnel with
4required credentials who have completed required training under this
Policy.

Prone and supine restraints are used only if those interventions are the
least restrictive and intrusive interventions to address the emergency and
stop the imminent danger of serious physical harm to the student or others.

During each incident, one school staff person trained in identifying the

signs of distress must be assigned to observe the student during the entire
incident. That staff person may not be involved in the physical holding of
the student. The number of staff involved in physically restraining the
student may not exceed the number necessary to safely hold the student.
The prone or supine physical restraint ends immediately when the threat
of imminent serious physical harm ends, but in no event shall prone or
supine physical restraint last longer than 30 minutes. If, after 30 minutes,
the emergency has not resolVed or if an additional emergency arises the
same school day that meets the standards under Section ll. A. 2. a school
administrator, in consultation with a social worker, nurse, or
behavior specialist may authorize the continuation of the restraint or an
additional prone or supine restraint. No restraint may be continued nor
may additional restraints be applied unless it is authorized by a school
administrator.

if the student is restrained in a prone or supine physical restraint in at least
two (2) separate instances within a 30-school day period, the school
personnel who initiated, monitored, and supervised the incidents shall
initiate a review of the effectiveness of the procedures used. If the
personnel involved in the restraints do not include a social
worker, nurse, or behavior specialist, at least one of those staff members
must be included in the review. The review must include, but is not limited
to:

a) conducting or reviewing a functional behavioral analysis,
reviewing data, considering developing additional or revised
positive behavioral interventions and supports, considering
actions to reduce the use of restrictive procedures, or, if
applicable, modifying the individualized educational program or
the behavior intervention plan, as appropriate; and

b) reviewing any known medical or limitations that
contraindicate the use of a restrictive procedure, considering
whether to prohibit that restrictive procedure, and, if applicable,
documenting any prohibition in the individualized education
program or behavior intervention plan

B. For students with disabilities, the use of a Physical Restraint must be authorized by, and

included in, a student?s IEP where deemed appropriate by the student?s IEP team. A
Physical Restraint shall be used in compliance with a student?s IEP. Physical Restraints
shall not be used as a means of punishment.

19-1211-P05

C. The use of Physical Restraints is prohibited except when authorized by the (ii) used
by trained school staff, a student poses a physical risk to himself, herself, staff or others,
and/or (iv) use of the restraint is not known to be medically contraindicated. Only trained -
security personnel or other staff who have been appropriately trained in the safe application
of Physical Restraints may employ a Physical Restraint with a student.

D. Effective November 20, 2019, all school staff are required to document any use of physical
restraint using the form titled ?Physical Restraint and Time-Out Form" attached and
available on the ISBE website at 
The completed form must be:

1) sent to the student?s parents or guardians within 24 hours of the use of
physical restraint;

2) uploaded into the student?s Aspen records (and if a student with
disabilities, uploaded into 

3) emailed to CPS ODLSS Department at restrainttimeout@cpsedu; and

4) emailed to ISBE at restrainttimeout@isbe.net within 48 hours of the use
of physical restraint.

E. Nothing herein prevents school personnel from employing a momentary physical
intervention in accordance with the Board's Policy on Momentary Physical Interventions
with Students. .

Time-Out

A. ?Time-out" means a behavior management technique that involves the monitored
separation of a student from classmates with a trained adult for part of the school day,
usually for a brief time, in a non-locked setting.

B. Effective November 20, 2019, all school staff are required to document any use of time-out
using the form titled "Physical Restraint and Time Out Form? attached and available on the
website at 
The completed form must be:

1) sent to the student?s parents or guardians within 24 hours of the use of
time out;

2) uploaded into the student?s Aspen records (and if a student with
disabilities, uploaded into 

3) emailed to CPS ODLSS Department at restrainttimeout@cps.edu; and

4) emailed to ISBE at restrainttimeout@isbe.net within 48 hours of the use
of time out. .

C. A trained adult who is responsible for supervising the student must remain with the student
at all times during the time out. A student shall not be kept in time out for longer than is
therapeutically necessary. No less than once every 15 minutes, the trained adult must
assess whether the student has ceased presenting the speci?c behavior for which the time
out was imposed.

D. Use of isolated time-out is prohibited.

Compliance

School staff shall employ physical restraints and time-outs in accordance with the requirements
of this policy and the procedures and guidelines issued by the Chief Executive Of?cer or
designee. These guidelines will include the process the district will use to evaluate any incident
that results in an injury to the affected student and an annual review of the use of time-out or
physical restraint by CPS school staff.

Employees that violate this Policy, or the procedures and' guidelines issued by the Chief

Executive Of?cer or designee, are subject to discipline in accordance with the Board's

Employee and Due Process Policy.

RESCIND BOARD REPORT 12-0125-PO1
COMBINED AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT AND 504 POLICY
AND
ADOPTA NEW AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT POLICY

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RECOMMENDS:

That the Chicago Board of Education (?Board?) rescind Board Report 12-0125-P01 Combined Americans
with Disabilities Act and 504 Policy and adopt a New Americans with Disabilities Act Policy.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this policy is to create a system for the Chicago Public Schools (?District") to
address disability?related accommodations requests and complaints for employees and other individuals
with disabilities accessing CPS premises in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act 

POLICY TEXT:

I. APPLICABILITY

This policy applies to accommodation requests and complaints under the ADA made by employees,
employment applicants, parents/guardians, community members, Local School Council members,
volunteers, and other persons with disabilities accessing CPS premises. The request and complaint
procedures set forth in this policy apply to requests for disability-based accommodations and allegations of
disability discrimination as described and prohibited in the Board?s Comprehensive Non-Discrimination,
Harassment, and Retaliation Policy and as otherwise described herein.

This policy does not address the rights or remedies afforded to Chicago Public Schools students with
disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the individuals with Disabilities Education Act
(IDEA), or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504). Students? rights and remedies are
addressed in the Education of Students with Disabilities Policy, the IDEA Procedural Manual, Section 504
Procedural Manual, and other guidance documents developed by the Of?ce of Diverse Learner Supports
and Services (ODLSS).

II. SCOPE OF THE ADA

A. The ADA de?nes a disability as: a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one
or more major life activities; (ii) a record of such an impairment; or being regarded as having such an
impairment. The ADA also covers individuals who have an association with a person who has a disability.

B. The ADA prohibits discrimination in employment, public accommodations, transportation, state and
local government services and telecommunications based on an individual?s disability, record of a disability
or because the individual is regarded as having a disability.

C. No individual, by reason of a disability, record of a disability or because the individual is regarded
as having a disability, shall be excluded from participation in or be denied the bene?ts of District services,
programs and activities, or be subjected to discrimination by the District.



D. District services, programs and activities, when viewed in its entirety, are required to be accessible
to persons with disabilities. The District will accomplish this by, among other things, reassignment of
programs and events to accessible locations or renovation of existing facilities. However, a public entity is
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving
compliance with this section, nor is it required to take any actions that would result in a fundamental
alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity or in undue ?nancial and administrative burdens.

E. Communications with persons with disabilities are to be as effective as communications with others.
The District shall furnish auxiliary aids and services, such as qualified sign language interpreters and
alternate formats of written materials, where necessary to accomplish equally effective communications,
unless to do so would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity or in
undue ?nancial and administrative burdens. If a requested action to provide effective communication would
result in such an alteration or such burdens, the District will take other action that would not result in such
an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible,
individuals with disabilities receive the bene?ts or services provided by the District.

F. No person may?be retaliated against for exercising rights under federal, state or local laws
pertaining to equal opportunities for individuals with disabilities, inciuding, but not limited to, making a
request, grievance or complaint, or participating in an investigation.

G. No person shall be discriminated against because of a relationship or association with a person
with a disability.
H. As defined by the Chicago Building Code, the Illinois Environmental Act and Title II and Title of

the ADA, all new construction and alterations of District-controlled buildings shalt be designed and
constructed in such a manner that the facility or altered part of the facility is readily accessible to and usable
by individuals with disabilities. In addition, alterations to a primary function area will be performed such that
the path of travel to that area is readily accessible to the extent required by law.

I. Additional information regarding the ADA and its applicability to District services, programs or
activities can be obtained from the District's Talent Of?ce and Americans with Disabilities Act and
Compliance Of?ce (ADA Office).

J. For Employees and Job Applicants: No person, by reason of a disability, record of a disability
or because the individual is regarded as having a disability, shall be discriminated against in any term or
condition of employment, so long as the person is quali?ed and can perform the essential functions of the
job in question, with or without reasonable accommodation. The duty to reasonably accommodate extends
to both employees and job applicants. Reasonable accommodations shall be provided unless the
modi?cation{s) would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program or activity.

Ill. ACCOMMODATION REQUEST AND COMPLAINT PROCEDURES GENERAL
For the purposes of this policy, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
A. Definitions.

1. Accommodation Request: A request by or on behalf of an employee, job applicant, or any other
individual with disabilities accessing CPS premises to obtain any type of disability-retated

timeline and prOcedures for how empioyees, job applicants, and all other individuals with disabilities
accessing CPS premises can request reasonable accommodations are detailed in the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) Procedural Manual.

C. ADA Coordinator. The ADA Coordinator for the District is: (1) the ADA Administrator and is the
person for the District who determines whether an employee, job applicant, or other individual quali?es for
an ADA accommodation and what that reasonable ac'commodation will be. These are not school based or

ORIGINAL AGREEMENT: The original Charter School Agreement (authorized by Board Report 13-0626-
EX4) was for a term commencing July 1, 2013 and ending June 30, 2018 and authorized the operation of
a charter school serving no more than 560 students in grades through 8. The charter and Charter School

each year based on numerous factors related to its academic, financial and operational performance.

On November 27. 2019, the Of?ce of innovation and incubation provided written notice to Frazier Academy
Design Team. Inc. that the Chief Executive Officer intended to recommend to the Board the
revocation of the charter and Charter School Agreement for Frazier Prep effective at the end of the 2019?

2020 school year.

Section 27A-9icli2) of the Illinois Charter Schools Law states that a charter may be revoked if it fails to

states that, after being noti?ed of the reason for revocation, the charter school must submit a written plan

Frazier Prep received another Level 2 rating on SQRP for the prior 2018-2019 school year. Frazier Prep
was placed on the Academic Warning List for a second consecutive year due to its continued failure to
meet or make reasonable progress toward achievement of the content standards or pupil performance
standards.

On November 8, 2019, Frazier Academy Design Team. Inc. was noti?ed of a public hearind on November

The hearing notice was published in the November 9. 2019 edition of the Chicago Sun-Times. The hearing
was conducted on November 14. 2019.

Pursuant to the lIIinois Charter Schools Law and the Charter School Agreement. the CEO recommends
that the charter and Charter School Agreement for Frazier Prep be revoked at the end of the 2019? 2020
school year because Frazier Prep has been on the Academic Warning List for two consecutive years and
has failed to implement its remediation plan. -

Frazier Academy Design Team, Inc. shall wind down and cease operations of its charter school and return
its charter to the Board effective as of July 1- 2020. Both parties shall enter into a wind down agreement
with respect to the charter revocation.

viability, and legal and contract compliance. This evaluation included a review of the proposal, academic
results, ?nancial performance, governance documents, parental issues, facilities surveys, and special
education documentation. A public hearing was held on November 6, 2017 for all contract and charter
schools going through renewal to receive public comments, including Frazier Prep. The Office of innovation
and Incubation recommends that, based on the school?s performance on these and other accountability
criteria, as well as the school's demonstration of intent to satisfy the ?Additional Terms and Conditions?-
referred to herein below, Frazier Prep be authorized to continue operating as a charter school.

19-1211-EX2

indemnities to be provided to the charter school, in the written Charter Schooi Agreement and wind down
agreement for the charter school. Authorize the President and Secretary to execute the written Charter
School Agreement and wind down agreement for the charter school. Authorize the Interim Executive
Director of the Office of Innovation and Incubation to issue a letter notifying the Illinois State Board of
Education of the action(s) approved hereunder and to submit the approved proposal and signed Charter
School Agreement to the Illinois State Board of Education for certification. Authorize the General Counsel
to further negotiate and execute any amendments to the Charter School Agreement as required by-the

LSC REVIEW: Approval of Local School Council is not applicable to this report.

FINANCIAL: The ?nancial implications will be addressed during the development of the 2048-2049 2020-
?scal year budget. Since the School Code of Illinois prohibits the incurring of any liability unless an
appropriation has been previously made, expenditures beyond FY4829 are deemed to be contingent
liabilities only, subject to appropriation in subsequent fiscal year budgets.

EARLY TERMINATION RIGHT:
The Board shall have the right to terminate this agreement with 30 days written notice.

SCOPE OF SERVICES:

Student growth measures will compare students with similar characteristics to see how students grow

relative to each other and to capture the impact of instruction on student outcomes. Statistical models

developed for student growth will provide CPS with an unbiased estimate of instructional effectiveness



based on standardized test score results. This is critical in providing fair and accurate growth ratings for
use in our teacher evaluation system and SQRP.

Student growth measures will be computed at the school, grade, teacher, network, and student group
levels for both the NWEA MAP and PARCCassessments. The NWEA MAP results will be used in
teacher evaluation calculations, while both sets of results will be used to help CPS assess growth at
schools throughout the District. Vendor will also provide consultation and professional development to
CPS personnel to better understand the student growth models and how to effectively use them in an
accountability system.

DELIVERABLES:

In addition to student growth measures vendor will continue to provide consultation and professional
development to CPS personnel to better understand the student growth models and to effectively use
them in an accountability system.

Vendor's services will result in providing a necessary component of CPS's teacher evaluation system.
Student growth measures are based on complex statistical formulae that CPS does not have expertise
and capacity to calculate internally. Vendor will provide valuable data for use in better understanding
patterns of academic growth among CPS students. Expanding investigations into a PARCC student
growth measure helps CPS better evaluate how students are progressing against State-level standards.
Student growth measures developed for CPS are completely customized to CPS's needs.
