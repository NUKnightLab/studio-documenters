Report on CountyCare Health Plan (Attachment #1)
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, introduced the following representatives from Valence
Health, who were present to discuss the recent announcement of the acquisition of Valence Health by
Evolent Health: Karen Janousek, President of Health Plan Services; Kevin Weinstein, Chief Growth Officer;
and Leo Gutierrez, Vice President of Client Management.
Ms. Janousek read the following statement:
My name is Karen Janousek. I am the President of Valence Health’s Value Based Services
Unit, and I am the Executive Sponsor for CountyCare within Valence Health. I am joined by
Kevin Weinstein, who is the Chief Growth Officer at Valence Health, and Leo Gutierrez,
who is the Executive Director for the CountyCare account at Valence Health, and who is
your daily point of contact.
As you are aware, Valence Health has entered into a definitive agreement to merge the
majority of our business into Evolent Health. A bit of background, on the merger itself, the
reasons behind it, and what it will mean for CountyCare.

The vast majority of our business, which services provider-based organizations like yours,
and of which we do understand the strategic imperative of CountyCare to the System as a
whole, will be acquired by Evolent Health. The transition is expected to close in September
or October; once closed, Valence is expected to operate largely as a standalone subsidiary,
leveraging Evolent’s resources as appropriate, but not deviating from our current process of
serving our current clients.
With the exception of Andrew Eckert, who has served as our CEO for about one year, the
entire Valence Health operating executive team will be moving over to Evolent Health. The
executive group includes those of us here today, as well as our co-founder and company
president, Todd Stockard, and Phil Camp, who has overall responsibility for all of the
operations of Valence, and has worked very closely with CountyCare from the inception of
the Request for Proposals (RFP) through today. All of our offices, including both of our
Chicago locations, which are less than two miles from here, will continue to operate and
continue to support the contract we’ve entered into and are expected to grow significantly.
No Valence Health executives will be re-locating to Evolent offices at this time.
Evolent sought us out for the same reasons that many of our clients have done, our expertise
in Medicaid administration and provider-sponsored plans. Evolent, like Valence, is a
company dedicated to empowering providers. Today, they assist 13 provider-sponsored
plans and risk-bearing entities, but are primarily focused on Medicare and commercial
populations, not Medicaid. Additionally, while Valence has been more administratively
focused, Evolent has been more focused on clinical transformation. These complementary
efforts are the foundation of our merger, allowing each of us to offer a more comprehensive
set of solutions to our current and future clients. Additionally, Evolent has a very strong
balance sheet with over $130 million of cash on hand, which will allow for accelerated
investment in new services and solutions for all of our clients. And, as a combined
company, Valence and Evolent will have the scale necessary to provide additional support
to our clients at the local, state and federal policy levels.
Lastly, and most importantly, I’d like to address what CountyCare can expect from us, as we
move through this merger. First, stability. Nothing is changing in regards to how we
support and service CountyCare. You will have the exact same team working out of the
exact same offices here in Chicago. Second, account support. Again, nothing changes here.
You will still have the same daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly team meetings and executive
sponsor meetings. Lastly, as Valence and Evolent come together, and we begin to more fully
understand where each other’s solutions can best serve and assist clients, you can expect
that we will bring these solutions to your attention as is appropriate. It may be that they can
help accelerate the achievement of CountyCare’s goals in the service of Medicaid patients
here in Illinois.
Several questions were raised by Committee Members and were addressed by the Valence representatives
regarding Evolent and the merger. It was noted that Evolent has a total of thirteen (13) clients similar to
CCHHS nationwide. Director Junge inquired whether any of those clients are from the public sector. Mr.
Weinstein responded that he did not believe so, but will follow up and provide a definitive answer.
Mr. Weinstein noted that, because Evolent and Valence operate largely different sets of services today, and
because Valence will be the only provider of employee-based third-party administrator services there, there
is no plan to change the way Valence runs the value-based services unit, because there is not an analogous
business within the existing Evolent structure.

III.

Report on CountyCare Health Plan (continued)
Chairman Lerner noted that, as it gets closer to the integration time, Evolent may see an opportunity to take
some of the Valence people and move them to other clients; with that said, CCHHS’ concern is that it has the
center of attention with Valence, because it is so critical to the people it serves. Once the merger activities
have been finalized, Valence will then be owned by a parent. He suggested that, soon after this takes place, a
representative from the parent organization and the key people from Valence should come and meet with Mr.
Glass, Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer and Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer
of Finance and Strategy, to really do a drill-down on what this really means at the operational level. The
merger is expected to close in the fall, so that meeting can perhaps take place in the 4th quarter of this year;
Mr. Glass can report back to the Managed Care Committee regarding that meeting.
Director Richardson-Lowry noted that, in the nature of mergers and acquisitions, there is typically more
unknown than known. She valued the discussion today, and appreciates the plan for the 4th quarter drilldown and report back to the Committee, but she would also like whomever the team is at that point from the
newly-formed entity to appear back before the Committee, so that the Committee can have a better sense of
what the “going forward” actually is. Chairman Lerner concurred; he indicated that, if it works out from a
timing point of view, the November Managed Care Committee Meeting would be the time to have those
representatives back before the Committee, so they would need to meet with the staff before then.
Chairman Lerner stated that this Committee is not expecting anything but positive benefits from the merger,
but as has been mentioned, there are always unintended consequences that always come along when a new
partnership has been created. What this Board has to do is make sure that it is overseeing what is going on in
this organization for the benefit of the patients it serves. This Board wants assurances that its core business
is going to be attended to, and if there are positive benefits from the integration, this Board also wants to
know how those will affect the organization. He requested that these thoughts be communicated to the
management at Evolent Health.
Dr. Shannon stated for the record that, for those CountyCare members, with everything that has been heard
thus far regarding whatever relationship building and changes that are happening as a result of this merger
over the course of the coming year, he has not heard anything to suggest that anything would be visible to
members or that anything would change for CountyCare members. Ms. Janousek concurred with that
statement.
Mr. Glass provided an overview of the Report on the CountyCare Health Plan. The Committee reviewed and
discussed the information.
The Report included information on the following subjects:
•
•
•
•
•

Transition Update
CountyCare Non-Compliance Notice from the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family
Services

Report on CountyCare Health Plan (continued)
During the review of the information on slide 8, regarding the State’s Non-Compliance Notice, it was noted
that all other managed care plans in the state also received this notice. Mr. Glass indicated that he will find
out where CountyCare ranks with regard to percentage of compliance (currently at 53%) within the list of all
managed care plans. Additionally, Chairman Lerner inquired regarding the requirement of 75% compliance;
he asked whether that percentage applies to new or existing members. Mr. Glass stated that he will look into
that question and will provide a response.
During the discussion of the metrics on call center performance, Director Velasquez inquired regarding the
transition of call center activities from Texas to Chicago, which is planned to take place in 2017; she asked
whether that can happen sooner. Mr. Glass stated that the administration can look into doing that. Director
Richardson-Lowry indicated her displeasure with the call center performance metrics; she stressed that this
Board’s expectations are that these numbers will improve greatly or the Board will re-evaluate. Chairman
Lerner requested that this message be passed along to representatives at Valence Health.
