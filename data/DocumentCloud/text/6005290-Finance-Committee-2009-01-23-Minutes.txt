Batch Payments for FY2008
[Attachment 

Mr. Small provided information on the item. He stated that these are invoices that are being brought forward in a

2003 dollars. The County Comptroller, John Morales, has set a cut-off date of January 22, 2009, pending the
System?s approval to process these invoices totaling approximately $2.4 million against FY2003 funds.

Elizabeth Reidy, Deputy Chief of the Civil Actions Bureau of the Of?ce of the State?s Attorney, provided an
update on the process of drafting the procurement policy. She stated that on January 15, 2009, the Office of the
State?s Attorney forwarded a draft policy to Mr. Small for his review.

Mr. Small stated he has initially reviewed the draft, and has disseminated it to the appropriate in-house staff for
their comments; his goal is to present a ?nal policy for the Committee's consideration for the February 6th meeting.

Chairman Carvalho stated that he would like it to be presented to the full Finance Committee for a high-level
comparison; a policy subgroup can then review it in a more detailed manner.

Update on 2009 Budget Adoption and Implementation

Mr. Small provided an update on the ongoing 2009 Budget activities. He stated that there have been some
discussions with regard to the question of whether the System?s proposed budget could be reduced; the ?gure
preliminarily discussed as a possible cut is in the $15 million range. Chairman Carvalho emphasized that the
preference of the System should be that any cuts be done in a lump sum, rather than the County Board making
individual line item cuts, that any cuts should be ?accepted? by the System, but not ?agreed to," and that the FY09
Budget should allow the System Board the ?exibility to reallocate 110 Account ?rnds.

Re: PCG Proposal for Medicare Bad Debt Claiming
Dear Ms. Graves:

On December 14, 2003, Public Consulting Group submitted a proposal to Mr. Calkin to provide Medicare Bad Debt
Claiming services to the Cook County Health and Hospitals System. Under separate cover, PCG provided him with
descriptions of similar projects for other public hospitals (see attachment). This letter is a response to your request
for information about quali?cations for the above assignment. I

PCG is a full service management consulting ?rm that was established in 1986 to focus on state and local
gtwemment agencies. The ?rm has grown to a full-time staff of over 500 employees. corporate headquarters
is in Boston, Massachusetts and has of?ces in cities around the country including our of?ce in Chicago. Illinois.
PCG is licensed to do business in Illinois where we will manage the delivery ofserviccs for this engagement.

PCG provides many services to public hospitals and state Medicaid programs. The type of services we offer include
chargemaster reviews and rate setting, revenue cycle process improvement, insurance veri?cation and third party
liability, revenue maximization, cost reporting, SSUSSDI application assistance, implementation of operation
improvements, organizational development, system design and information technology consulting services. We have
conducted similar engagements for other healthcare providers and in every case, we have added signi?cant value to
operations and reimbursement practices through out the revenue cycle process.

PCG currently has a strong local presence and major revenue recovery projects underway with the State of Illinois and
the Chicago Public Schools. Our work with CPS has resulted in the recovery of over $500 million in Medicaid related
revenue since 1993. In 2005, the State of Illinois selected PCG to assist in the recovery of additional federal funds. PCG
has recovered over $125 million in Medicare and Medicaid related revenue for the State since 2006.

We appreciate the opportunity to assist the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and look forward to your
review of our proposal.

Sincerely,
