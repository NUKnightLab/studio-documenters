WHEREAS, Mr. Merenowicz has had an impact on numerous young lives from very diverse

track and field, football, and wrestling at Lincoln Way East, Hillcrest, and currently at his alma
mater Tinley Park; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Merenowicz was more than just a “supervisor” to all with whom he worked,
by always going the extra mile and providing good, sound advice, whether work related or a
personal matter.

T
Summary: On 3/11/2013, the Cook County Board approved contracts with the contractors
listed above under its Job Order Contracting (“JOC”) Program following a competitive bid
process (RFQ 12-28-340). The District is seeking to procure similar construction services in
certain cases to expedite projects under its capital improvement programs, pursuant to Section
182(X) of the District Code. Section 182(X) states: “If a governmental agency has awarded a
contract through a competitive method for the same or similar supplies, equipment, goods or
services as that sought by the District, the Procurement may be made from that vendor at a
price or rate at least as favorable as that obtained by that government agency without utilizing
a competitive procurement method set forth in the Procurement Code.”
JOC is a quantity-based procurement process that allows facility owners to complete a
multitude of repair and maintenance and construction projects with a single, competitively bid
contract.
The JOC contractors listed were selected by the County through a competitive
procurement process. The District plans to use JOC contractors in the following instances: 1)
the District receives unacceptable bids through the traditional bidding process, 2) time is of the
essence, and/or 3) the project is straight-forward job that is especially suited to
catalogue-based unit pricing. JOC contractors will be selected for District projects by either:
1) identifying projects for such selected contractors, or 2) conducting a second round bidding
process whereby certain select JOC contractors bid on projects in competition with each other
and (from time to time) non-JOC contractors. All projects for $25,000 or more will go through
the aforementioned second round bidding process, except for projects procured on an
emergency basis.
The District contracts will incorporate the same terms as the County’s existing JOC contracts
and will include a few additional terms, conditions, and instructions to contractors reflecting
the unique work desired by the District.
The JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group, for which
they are compensated by the successful bidder. The Gordian Group established and maintains
an area price book for Cook County, which is utilized by Cook County Government and
captures the prices for specific construction work items within this region. This price book
also will be utilized by JOC contractors for work procured by the District.

Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (“The
District”), as Licensor to grant a License the Village of Elmwood Park (“the Village”),
Licensee, to locate, operate and maintain a storm sewer outfall structure to the Des Plaines
River, a floodwall along Thatcher Avenue, and a floodgate at the entrance to Evans Field as
part of a Flood Mitigation Project to reduce flooding of Thatcher Avenue and adjacent
neighborhoods. The project will separate the storm water from an existing combined sewer
and eliminate the potential for combined sewage to enter District property. The floodwall will
allow Thatcher Avenue to remain open during flood events. In addition, the floodgate will
automatically close the entrance to Evans Field during flood events. The Village states that the
flood stage and duration will not increase due to the floodwall.

The proposed license also is contingent upon the Village’s agreement to acquire (at their
appraised value) two small parcels owned by the District that already have been deemed
surplus property by the District, thereby relieving the District of the responsibility and expense
for maintaining the same.
