Chair Hammock called attention to the committee structures. Generally, there have been three (3) appointed

members, which requires three (3) Directors for a quorum. He emphasized the importance of attendance at the

Secretary know in advance if they are going to be absent, as that helps in terms of managing the quorum.

At the January 24th Cook County Board meeting Commissioners approved the appointment of Michael Koetting
to the Cook County Health Board of Directors. Mr. Koetting is a healthcare and strategic planning consultant as
well as an adjunct member of faculty. From 2010-2015 he served as Deputy Director for Planning and
Reform Implementation for the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.

Members of the 1015t Illinois General Assembly were sworn in on January 9. The House and Senate return to
Springfield on January 29. Nearly 1,000 bills and resolutions have already been filed.

On January 14, Illinois Executive Branch officers were sworn in, including JB Pritzker, Illinois? 43rd Governor. You
can read Governor Pritzker?s full inaugural address here.

Theresa Eagleson has been named by Governor Pritzker to serve as the new Director of the Illinois Department
of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS). Ms. Eagleson currently serves as the Executive Director of the Office of
Medicaid Innovation at the University of Illinois, and had previously worked at HFS in various leadership
positions. The appointment requires Senate confirmation.

Governor Pritzker announced that Sol Flores would be joining his administration as Deputy Governor; she will
join Christian Mitchell, Jesse Ruiz, and Dan Hynes in this position. Deputy Governor Flores will oversee work
related to health and human services. Ms. Flores is the founding Executive Director of La Casa Norte, a
nonprofit serving homeless youth, adults, and families. A full list of administration staff and agency directors

named to date can be found onlile.

New state rules concerning the Lead Poisoning and Prevention Act were approved by the Joint Committee on
Administrative Rules (JCAR). The rules lower the blood lead level from 10 micrograms/deciliter (ug/dL) to 5
ug/dL which will allow more children to receive public health interventions and aligns with the Center for
Disease Control and Prevention?s recommended levels. This rule change will allow children with blood lead
levels at or above 5 ug/dL to receive a home visit from a public health nurse and, as resources allow, a public
health environmental inspection. The rule also increases enforcement authority for violations of the Lead
Poisoning Prevention Act and Code, including of property owners who fail to remediate properties.

 

An ordinance will soon be introduced to the Cook County Board of Commissioners that will align lead
prevention'and mitigation activities with state law and an existing Chicago city ordinance, as well as implement a
new administrative process to bring non-compliant property owners to a hearing for resolution of their

mitigation notices.

The first session of the 116th Congress was gaveled in on January 3, two weeks into what is now the longest
lapse in appropriations in US. history. Seven major federal agencies with about one fourth of the federal
workforce are "shut down,? with essential personnel working without pay and most employees furloughed.
Major legislation is not moving until a deal is concluded and the government reopens.

Texas v. United States: As expected, on January 3, sixteen Democratic states (including Illinois) and the District
of Columbia, appealed the decision of the District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruling the Affordable
Care Act (ACA) unconstitutional. The intervener?defendants argue the District Court ignored the intent of
Congress by ruling that eliminating the ACA's individual mandate penalty in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
invalidated the entire law. They argue that Congress left the remaining core features of the law intact, including
3 a 

Page 46 of 65

the federal subsidies and Medicaid expansion, undermining the judge?s reasoning that Congress intended the
law to be invalidated. At the same time the new Democratic House majority moved to intervene in the case to
defend the ACA. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has stayed the appeal at the request of the US. Department
ofJustice (DOJ), until ten days after the shutdown ends. The District Court proceeding on the remaining claims
before it are also on hold pending appeal.

While many legal believe the Fifth Circuit will overturn the District Court on the merits, the case could
ultimately end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.

a Medicaid: While divided government means that wholesale restructuring of the Medicaid program is off the
table for now, efforts are taking shape which could profoundly influence the shape the future of the program.
Most immediately, the delay in the ACA cuts to Medicaid DSH is set to expire on September 30 the end of FY
2019.

Last year the provision to delay the scheduled cut was enacted as part of the Bi-Partisan Budget Act of 2018
which passed in February and lifted the discretionary sequestration budget caps imposed by the Budget Control
Act of 2011. These caps will need to be lifted again for Congress to conduct its budget and appropriations work
for FY 2021, but all is on hold while the stalemate over FY 2020 funding drags on.

At the same time some on Capitol Hill have expressed an appetite for revising the allocation of Medicaid DSH
funding to the states. Senator Marco Rubio (Ft?Fla.) has introduced legislation which would base the allocation
on the percentage of those in poverty a state has, scrapping the current twenty-year?old formula. Proposals
such as this which create clear winners and losers are very difficult to move through Congress.

Conversations about new health system reforms are also gaining steam. Democrats, including a number of 2020
contenders, are debating various forms of "Medicare for All? (M4A) or ?Medicare for More,? while a growing
number of Democratic states are contemplating Medicaid buy-in proposals to expand coverage. Meanwhile,
some Republican states are expanding Medicaid and others are seeking, and gaining approval for work
requirement waivers from CMS. Democratic leaders generally continue to focus on shoring up the ACA and
opposing the Administration?s moves to weaken consumer protections and provide options outside the ACA
structure. It is worth noting that health insurance industry groups are gearing up to oppose M4A as attention
begins to turn toward the 2020 elections.

0 Administrative Action: In mid-January reports emerged that CMS is looking for ways to use its waiver
authorities under Medicaid to offer states greater flexibility to administer their programs in exchange for
accepting a "block grant.? Changing Medicaid from an eligibility-based entitlement program to a block grant for
states has long been a conservative policy objective. Details of the plans have not been made public.

On January 18, CMS proposed its Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for ACA plans in 2020. Among the
proposals, the administration supports legislation to restore cost sharing subsidy (CSR) payments that insurers
give to low income enrollees. They propose ending "silver loading,? where insurers raise premiums for "silver"
level plans in order to compensate for the loss of CSRs and invite comments on how to accomplish this. They
also propose lifting the income formula caps on out of pocket spending.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for at both the State and Federal level.
