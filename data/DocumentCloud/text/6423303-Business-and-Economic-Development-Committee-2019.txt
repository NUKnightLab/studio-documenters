Summary:
This contract will provide a Program Administrator who will work with the County
Commission and the Bureau of Economic Development to manage the County’s 2020 Census Complete
Count outreach and communications Program which sets out to increase awareness, promote
self-response, and improve the response rate in hard-to-count communities with the Cook County’s
residents during the 2020 Census count. The program includes developing and implementing an integrated
community outreach and media plan that includes strategies that are cost effective, focused, and tailored
to address barriers that prevent highly likely undercounted demographic populations from completing and
returning Census information.

with the Cook County Procurement Code. The William Everett Group was selected based on established
evaluation criteria.
The contract consists of two components: A Total Management Fee of $991,200 and Local Complete
County Committees (LCCC) and Local Government Complete County Commissions (LGCCC) Fiscal
Support Services. The Management Fee is a flat fee that includes all direct and indirect costs associated
with the Program Administrator and its team members providing the services related to the
Communications and Outreach Plan. To support the Census efforts of the LGCCC’s and LCCC’s, the
County is allocating up to $1,000,000 which will be distributed to them by the Program Administrator to
the extent such amounts are approved by the County Complete County Commission through a competitive
application process
