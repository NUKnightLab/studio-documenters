o Human Resources’ Role/Support of the CCHHS Strategic Plan: Principles Impacted, Objectives,
Highlighted Tactics and Measurements/Milestones

During the discussion of the subject of separations, it was noted that personal exit interviews are not conducted
with individuals leaving CCHHS due to several factors, including those relating to volume and timing; Ms. Lopez
noted that often, Human Resources is not notified at the point in time when the individual is leaving. She added
that a link to an exit survey is provided to individuals who have left CCHHS; the response rate to the survey has
been low, but she does have some survey results.
During the discussion of the information regarding achieving substantial compliance with the Employment Plan,
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, stated that the new Directors will be educated on the Employment
Plan during their orientation; that education is a requirement for all Directors. Director Junge noted that
orientation sessions for new Directors should include the subject of collective bargaining, and should review
details including the number of unions and what the relationship is with the County, so people have a good
understanding going into the bargaining period about the structure and how it works.

Report from Chief of Human Resources (continued)

is going to highlight one of the focus areas and hold a deeper-dive conversation in order to have a better
understanding of the subject matter; there will also be other modifications around the margins as it relates to
presentations, so the Committee will have an opportunity to have a more robust discussion of the information
presented.
