lender for the services and products described in Subsection (5)c of this definition, but only if the loan is

whichever is applicable, predatory loans that comprise either:
(1)

Five percent of the total annual number of loans made; or

(2) Twenty-five individual loans; whichever is less. Each financial institution and affiliate shall
be considered separately for the purposes of these calculations, and only loans secured by residential real
estate that is located within the County shall be considered. The term "predatory lender" shall not include
a financial institution, or its affiliates, that has submitted to the Chief Financial Officer a plan which is
accepted in writing by the Chief Financial Officer to discontinue the practice of making predatory loans
which plan:
a. Ensures the prompt disengagement from the practice of making predatory loans by
the financial institution and its affiliates; and
b. Ensures the complete cessation of the making of predatory loans by the financial
institution and its affiliates within 180 days after the plan is submitted; provided that no more than one
plan may be submitted on behalf of any financial institution.
Predatory loan means a threshold loan that was made under circumstances that involve any of the
following acts or practices:
(1) Fraudulent or deceptive acts or practices, including fraudulent or deceptive marketing and
sales efforts to sell threshold loans.
(2)

Prepayment penalties:

a.
That apply to a prepayment made after the expiration of the 36-month period
following the date the loan was made; or
b. That are more than three percent of the total loan amount if the prepayment is made
within the first 12-month period following the date the loan was made, or more than two percent of the
total loan amount if the prepayment is made within the second 12-month period after the date the loan
was made, or more than one percent of the loan amount if the prepayment is made within the third 12month period following the date the loan was made.
(3)
Balloon payments. A threshold loan that has a payment schedule with regular periodic
payments that when aggregated do not fully amortize the outstanding principal balance, except for bridge

loan because the regular periodic payments do not cover the full amount of the interest due, unless the
negative amortization is the consequence of a temporary forbearance sought by the borrower.
(6)

The financing of points and fees in excess of six percent of the loan amount.

(7) The financing of a single premium credit life, credit disability, credit unemployment, or any
other life or health insurance, directly or indirectly, into one or more threshold loans unless the lender, at
least three business days before the borrower signs the loan agreement, makes to the borrower a separate
oral disclosure, and a separate clear and conspicuous written disclosure containing the following
information, all of which must be true:
a. The total cost of the insurance premium and, separately stated, the total amount of
interest that will be charged for the financing of the insurance premium over the life of the loan.

commissions in connection with the insurance.
e. That the borrower may terminate the insurance at any time and receive a refund of the
unearned premium, and that the borrower will receive a refund of the entire premium if the borrower
cancels the insurance within 90 days after the policy goes into effect.
f. The term of the insurance coverage and, if different from the term of the loan, the
length of the difference. In addition, the written disclosure shall contain a signed and dated
acknowledgment by the borrower that the oral disclosure was made, and a signed and dated
acknowledgment by the lender that the oral disclosure was made.
(8)
Lending without due regard to repayment ability. The lender makes a loan if the lender
believes at the time the loan is consummated that the borrower or the borrowers (when considered
collectively in the case of multiple borrowers) will not be able to make the scheduled payments to repay
the obligation based upon a consideration of their current and expected income, current obligations,
employment status, and other financial resources (other than the borrower's equity in the dwelling which
secures repayment of the loan). A borrower shall be presumed to be able to make the scheduled payments
to repay the obligation if, at the time the loan is consummated, or at the time of the first rate adjustment in
the case of a lower introductory interest rate, the borrower's scheduled monthly payments on the loan
(including principal, interest, taxes, insurance and assessments), combined with the scheduled payments
for all other debts, do not exceed 50 percent of the borrower's monthly gross income as verified by the
credit application, the borrower's financial statement, a credit report, financial information provided to the
lender by or on behalf of the borrower, or any other reasonable means. This provision applies only to
borrowers whose income, as reported on the loan application which the lender relied upon in making the
credit decision, is no greater than 120 percent of the median family income for the Chicago Metropolitan
Statistical Area (MSA) (as defined by the Director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget). For
purposes of this division, the median family income shall be derived from the most recent estimates made
available by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, at the time the application is
received. For purposes of determining median income, only the income of the borrower or borrowers

11

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2011
shall be considered.
(9)
The payment by a lender to a contractor under a home improvement contract from the
proceeds of a threshold loan, other than:
a.

By an instrument payable to the borrower or jointly to the borrower and the

contractor; or
b. At the election of the borrower, by a third party escrow agent in accordance with
terms established in a written agreement signed by the borrower, the lender, and the contractor before the
date of payment.
(10) The payment from loan proceeds by a lender to a contractor under a home repair or
improvement contract, where the contractor has been, on two or more occasions within the previous 24month period, determined by a court or agency of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of any law or
ordinance prohibiting deceptive practices or similar conduct, unless:
a. The lender has no knowledge of the determinations; and
b. The lender has received a written affidavit from the contractor stating that there have
not been two or more such determinations regarding the contractor within the previous 24-month period.
(11) Such other circumstances that the Chief Financial Officer may determine to be predatory in
nature, in administrative rules promulgated to implement this division, which rules shall be submitted to
the County Board for approval.
Reverse mortgage means a nonrecourse security interest in the borrower's principal dwelling
where no interest or principal is payable on the secured loan (except in the case of default) until:
(1)

The borrower dies;

(2)

The dwelling is transferred; or

(3)

The borrower ceases to occupy the dwelling.

Threshold loan means a loan that is entered into after the effective date of this division and is
secured by residential real property located within the County on which there is situated a dwelling for
not more than four families or a condominium unit, or is secured by a cooperative unit within the County,
if:
(1) At the time of the loan's origination, the annual percentage rate of the loan exceeds by more
than six percentage points in the case of a first lien mortgage, or by more than eight percentage points in
the case of a junior mortgage, the yield on Treasury securities having comparable periods of maturity to
the loan maturity as of the 15th day of the month immediately preceding the month in which the
application for the extension of credit is received by the creditor; or

(2)

The total points and fees exceed:
a. Five percent of the total loan amount if the loan amount is $16,000.00
or greater; or

12

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2011

b. Eight hundred dollars if the loan amount is less than $16,000.00.
However, the term "threshold loan" shall not include a loan that is made primarily for a business purpose
unrelated to the residential real property securing the loan and shall not include a loan with a total loan
amount over $250,000.00.
Treasurer means the Treasurer of the County.
Sec. 34-342. County contracts.

(b) County contracts.
(a) (1) The Chief Financial Officer shall determine whether any financial institution seeking a
contract with the County is a predatory lender as defined in this division section. If the Chief Financial
Officer determines that any such financial institution is a predatory lender, the County will not award a
contract to such financial institution. For purposes of this division section, a County contract shall not
include designation as a County depository. The Chief Financial Officer shall notify the Treasurer of this
determination.
(b) (2)
With each bid or offer submitted by a financial institution for any contract with the
County, there shall be a pledge signed by the chairman of the board, chief executive officer, or other
officer of the financial institution acceptable to the Chief Financial Officer. The pledge shall be in
substantially the following form:

Cook County's Predatory Lending Ordinance. We further pledge that none of our
affiliates is, and none of them will become, a predatory lender as defined in this

business with the County.
(c) (3)
Nothing in this division section shall affect the validity of any contract entered into in
connection with any debt obligations issued by or on behalf of the County prior to a determination by the
Chief Financial Officer that an entity participating in the contract is a predatory lender.
(d) (4) The Chief Financial Officer, at the direction of the President of the County Board, may
suspend the ineligibility of a financial institution in order to allow Execution of a contract with the
financial institution upon written application by the head of a County agency or department affected by
the proposed contract setting forth facts sufficient in the judgment of the purchasing agent to establish:
(1)
a. That the public health, safety or welfare of the County requires the goods or services
of the financial institution; and
(2)
b. That the County is unable to acquire the goods or services at comparable price and
quality, and in sufficient quantity, from other sources.
Sec. 34-343. County depositories.

AND JEFFREY R. TOBOLSKI, COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
WHEREAS, the Cook County Health & Hospitals System is the largest provider of safety-net healthcare
services within the State of Illinois; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Health & Hospitals System serves patients from across the State of
Illinois; and
WHEREAS, the three public hospitals that compose the Cook County Health & Hospitals System have
provided billions of dollars in uncompensated care since their establishment to those who require care the
most; and
WHEREAS, it is the uninsured and medically indigent residents of the State of Illinois who rely upon the
Cook County Health & Hospitals System the most for a broad range of health services; and
WHEREAS, Medicaid funding is critical to the Cook County Health & Hospitals System to maintain its
historic role as a safety-net provider of healthcare to improve the health and well-being of all residents of
Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the Medicaid Disproportionate Share (DSH) Program and other Medicaid funding provides
critical dollars for the Cook County Health & Hospitals System for its large costs of uninsured care that it
provides to members of the county community; and
WHEREAS, the President of the United States and the United States Congress are currently in
negotiations to consider spending reductions and entitlement reforms to address the federal deficit and the
federal debt limit which is currently projected to be reached on August 2, 2011; and
WHEREAS, severe reductions to Medicaid are currently under consideration in Washington, DC,
including “blended” Medicaid rates, reductions to the Medicaid Disproportionate Share Program and
elimination of provider fee programs; and
WHEREAS, reductions to Medicaid and the Disproportionate Share Program would fundamentally
recalculate the available dollars that are available to the State of Illinois and the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System for treatment of those individuals who rely upon our health network for care; and
WHEREAS, substituting current rates at which the federal government currently reimburses states for
health services provided under Medicaid for a “blended” reimbursement rate would shift additional costs
to the states and ultimately, the Cook County Health and Hospitals System; and
WHEREAS, current estimates for a down payment on deficit reduction that would make $100 billion in
Medicaid reductions over the next 10 years would only exacerbate the tenuous situation of Cook County’s
safety-net hospitals and the services that the Cook County Health and Hospitals System is able to provide
to those in need.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners formally reassert our support for the preservation of Medicaid funding that allows the

29

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2011
Cook County Health and Hospitals System to provide services to the Medicaid populations and the
uninsured and underinsured residents of Cook County and the State of Illinois; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners urge
the President of the United States and the Illinois Congressional Delegation to fight against cuts to the
Medicaid Program that provides care to the most vulnerable individuals in Cook County and the State of
Illinois; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Clerk is hereby directed to immediately provide
a suitable copy of this Resolution to the President of the United States and to each Honorable Member of
the Illinois Congressional Delegation.

Under this proposed extension, the Chicago Community Trust will implement changes to the
program developed by the court in consultation with members of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, community outreach groups, housing counseling agencies, legal aid offices,
and housing policy and advocate groups. These changes will include, in addition to
maintaining face-to-face community outreach, developing, printing, and distributing an
informational brochure for residents facing foreclosure. The brochure will consist of a
process map to help residents understand each step in the foreclosure and mediation process.
The brochure will also provide a map of the court facilities to help ensure that residents reach
the correct location for assistance. The Chicago Community Trust will also develop a poster
for distribution and education about the Program. These modifications will ensure that all
program service providers are working with uniform and user-friendly materials and bring
consistency to communications within the program and among all service providers. This
consistency in communications will further enable the program to accommodate and assist
more residents facing foreclosure and ensure the highest quality services being provided in the
most economically efficient manner. As of May 31, 2011, there were 75,112 mortgage
foreclosures pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County. This extension will provide the
time necessary to fully evaluate the program modification. The Chicago Community Trust
was originally selected to manage the program’s community outreach services for a limited

requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to amend and increase by $25,390,722.00 and

$25,787,690.56
$140,022.00
$25,390,722.00
$ 51,318,434.56

Reason: The original terms of this contract was initially for two years with two one year
extension options. Aramark has agreed to waive the contractually allowed increase
based upon the Consumer Price Index variation, if the County agrees to extend this
contract for a two year period instead of two separate one year extensions. This will
result in a cost savings to the County of approximately $140,000.
In conjunction with the renewal period the Sheriff’s Office began a process to review
and renegotiate the terms of contract #08-84-387 Rebid with Aramark Correctional
Services. The Sheriff’s Office and the vendor have come to the following terms;
Aramark has agreed to reduce the price per meal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals
at the CCDOC and DCSI. This has been achieved through the reduction in average
calories per day from 2700 to 2300. This will result in a cost savings to the County of
approximately $700,000 over the next two years. The meal plan conforms with the
Illinois Jail Acts and Regulations. This new meal plan is also a healthier alternative to
the previous meal plan.
With the assistance of the State's Attorney an amendment has been drafted to reflect
these terms. The total overall savings for the two year period is approximately
$840,000.00 The current contract expires June 27, 2011.

RESOLUTION HONORING THE COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF FACILITIES
MANAGEMENT FOR THE 2011 NACO ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FOR
PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND EMPLOYEE
BENEFITS (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored
by Bridget Gainer, County Commissioner; Co-sponsored by Toni Preckwinkle, President,
Jerry Butler, Earlean Collins, John P. Daley, John A. Fritchey, Jesus G. Garcia, Elizabeth
“Liz” Doody Gorman, Gregg Goslin, Joan Patricia Murphy, Edwin Reyes, Timothy O.
Schneider, Peter N. Silvestri, Larry Suffredin and Jeffrey R. Tobolski, County
Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
HONORING THE COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF FACILITIES
MANAGEMENT FOR THE 2011 NACO ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FOR
PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND EMPLOYEE
BENEFITS ALTERNATIVE WORK PROGRAM-FACILITIES MANAGEMENT
WHEREAS, In January of 2009, The Cook County Department of Facilities Management
identified that the County had multiple employees off of work due to injury or illness.
Facilities Management recognized that many non-administrative employees (Skilled
Trades and Engineers) who were currently collecting disability benefits could return to
work in administrative functions. Over the past two years, Facilities Management has had
eleven (11) employees participate in the newly created Alternative Work Program; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has endured multiple budget cuts over the past four years and
many administrative positions have been eliminated. With an expanding workload and
fewer staff, AWP participants have performed many clerical functions including:
answering phones, entering work orders into the work order system, filing, and other
miscellaneous office duties. Upon completion of the AWP, participants gain a better
understanding and awareness of clerical, administration, and management challenges and
expectations; and
WHEREAS, as with many Counties in the United States, Cook County’s pension system
is minimally underfunded. All employees that become disabled while they are still
employed are paid partially through the pension system. Enrolling employees into the
AWP and getting these employees back to work has saved money within the system; and
WHEREAS, the Department of Facilities Management is very accustomed to the fact that
employees will get hurt while on the job. There is always a higher risk of injury within the
service occupations. In fact, according to OSHA statistics service workers account for
53.4 % of all injuries in the public sector. Employees spend months, if not years, on

124

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2011
disability. One of the reasons employees were off for such a long period of time due to the
fact that the administration did not actively pursue bringing these employees back to work;
and
WHEREAS, Cook County has been under budget constraints for the past seven years and
has had to continually lay off administrative staff in order to fulfill their budget
obligations. The administrators within Facilities Management needed help with simple
tasks that could not be completed due to expanding workload and fewer staff. The
administration was left with only a couple feasible options: 1) Hire more staff. 2) Better
utilize the workforce that was already in place. Due to the current budget constraints, all
innovative ideas were considered; and
WHEREAS, as with many Counties in the United States, Cook County’s pension system
is minimally underfunded. All employees that become injured while they are employed
with Cook County are paid partially through the pension system. When an employee files
for ordinary disability benefits (non-work related injury) the employee is paid 50% of their
salary for the duration of their time off. The entire disability payment is made from the
pension system. In cases where an employee files for duty disability benefits (work related
injury) the employee is paid 8 1/3% of their salary from the pension fund and 66 2/3%
from Workers’ Compensation; and
WHEREAS, the overall objective of the program is to bring service employees (Skilled
Trades, Engineers, etc.) who are on disability back to work in a clerical function as
effectively as possible. Each employee is taken on a case by case basis. An example
would be that Employee A has a torn ACL and hypothetically won’t be able to return to
work in six months while Employee B has a broken foot and could return in six weeks.
WHEREAS, the overall methodology is that an employee who is recovering from an
injury would be more likely to return to their original function (Skilled Trades, Engineer,
etc.) more expeditiously if they were already back to work in a clerical function than if the
same employee was recovering from their injury at home; and
WHEREAS, the Department of Facilities Management has partnered with the Department
of Risk Management to begin requesting physician documentation regarding work
restrictions that an employee would have if they were approved to come back to work in an
administrative function (also known as light duty). This is a crucial first step, because
physicians have become increasingly more cautious on work restrictions because they
don’t want a lawsuit filed against them by either the employee or the employer; and
WHEREAS, once a physician has submitted work restrictions and has authorized that an
employee can work in an administrative function, Facilities Management assigns the
employee to an administrative function within the Work Order Division. The Work Order
Division is responsible for opening and closing of work requests, disseminating work
requests, and filing daily time logs for the department. The WOD processes an average on
150,000 work requests each year through a computerized work order system; and
WHEREAS, after the employee begins working as a member of the work order staff,
he/she will receive proper training on: basic computer skills, work order processing, basic
clerical skills, answering and transferring of the phone, and filing. This can be an
overwhelming for an employee that has never spent time in an office environment before,
but over time the AWP participants adapt; and

125

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2011

WHEREAS, once an employee is enrolled in the AWP, the only way to get removed is to
either: return to full duty, physician release back to disability, or resignation. Of the eleven
employees that have been assigned to the program: seven have returned back to their
original position, three have resigned, and one is still enrolled; and
WHEREAS, one of the best parts of the AWP is the fact that Facilities Management has
not incurred any additional costs for implementation. The major costs for implementing
this type of program would be: supervision of participants, desktop computers, and work
order entry software; and
WHEREAS, all members that participate are supervised by the current data entry
supervisor. The supervisor already supervises nine (9) employees and adding additional
employees has proven to not be an additional burden. Facilities Management had
additional computers that were in storage due to their age. AWP employees did not
require top of the line systems, so they were issued refurbished computers that were
approximately four years old. The last major expense was the work order system which is
already in place within Facilities Management; and
WHEREAS, the overall goal of the Alternative Work Program is to get employees back to
work full time so they can complete their function that they were hired to do. The average
time spent by AWP participants in the program is 6 months while non-participants spend
over a year to return to work. There have been many other successes along the way that
have added to the programs overall success including: financial savings, better
understanding of administrative functions, and innovative administrative ideas; and
WHEREAS, financials savings was the easiest and most obvious result. The eleven
individuals that have gone through the program would have accumulated over $500,000 in
wages while not working. This savings is broken down into $90,000 savings for the
pension fund and $410,000 savings for workers compensation; and
WHEREAS, due to increased facility oversight, the amount of paperwork that is required
throughout the department has grown exponentially over the past few years. With the help
of AWP participants, Facilities Management has been able to organize and process their
needed paperwork much more effectively. “I found out that there is a never-ending
process of paperwork that I never knew existed” said AWP participant Andrew Ryndak,
“Once I got back on regular duty, I learned how to manage and get my paperwork done a
lot faster and easier”; and
WHEREAS, when it comes to innovative ideas, there is always an added benefit when a
newcomer is trained in performing administrative functions. One of the AWP participants
single-handedly changed the filing system for daily tracking logs that are used by
tradesmen. This individual saw that the filing was grossly inefficient and since his
departure six months ago, the filing system has stayed intact and is still the model for filing
such paperwork. Another AWP participant developed a “Key Phrase” document that
identifies work processes commonly used by tradesmen. This document will be
disseminated to bring continuity to our work requests.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, the Cook County Department of Facilities
Management has taken a proactive approach to bringing men and women back to work that
would otherwise have been sitting at home while they were recovering from their injuries.

126

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2011
Facilities Management has worked to create a positive experience for both the AWP
participant and the administration. Counties across the United States are looking for ways
to fully utilize their personnel and to give such personnel proper training and departmental
understanding while also saving money. The Cook County Department of Facilities
Management has been able to achieve this goal and has developed a usable model for other
Counties and would humbly accept a NACo Achievement Award for the Alternative Work
Program; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Cook County Finance Subcommittee on Pension
should convene to discuss how to implement this proactive approach Countywide.

Upon Board approval, Habitat for Humanity Chicago South Suburbs will assume ownership

financing of the ECMs, the parties will negotiate in good faith the terms of Phase 2, pursuant

in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what

obligations. At that time the balance in the account was $29,793.00 and 30 days prior to that the
balance in the account was $589,251.00. The transfer of funds is needed in order to provide

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 528-579, Computer Equipment, was identified as the source of transferred funds for
employee training and for maintenance and repair of data processing equipment and software
contract renewals since the only one item, Software Enterprise Licensing Agreement, that is
budgeted in Account 579 for Fiscal Year 2011 at an estimated cost of $395,000.00 is to be
purchased through the County Wide Computer Contract, renewed on May 17, 2011, at the
final cost of $263,110.97 resulting in a positive account variance, hence, the availability of funds
for transfer.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 528-579.
None

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Account 528-579, Computer Equipment, was identified as the source of transferred funds for

CONTRACT ADDENDUM
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 22, 2011 from
TARIQ MALHANCE, Chief Financial Officer
and
GREG WASS, Chief Information Officer

157

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2011
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract and to execute a contract with
Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA), Chicago, Illinois, to assist Cook County with
expediting the delivery of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
system, and system integration services. GFOA will also assist Cook County with the evaluation of key
business processes, the evaluation of the users, devices, and applications that currently interface with the
JD Edwards system, and with the development of an ERP System Integration RFP.
The analysis process will allow the County to accurately determine what business processes could be
improved prior to the new system, and to define the functions that should be enabled by the new system.
It will also allow County personnel to objectively evaluate proposal responses, references,
demonstrations, the qualifications of assigned vendor personnel, and project costs.
Reason:

After careful analysis, Cook County determined that it was in its best interest to expand the
scope of the ERP project to benefit all agencies, including those under the Office of the
President; the constitutionally elected offices; the Health & Hospitals System; and the Forest
Preserve District.
The expanded project scope increases the level of ‘due-diligence’ that is necessary to
accurately define the RFP Requirements, etc.. The benefits of the extended-effort accrue to
Cook County, resulting in essential information that is needed to integrate back-office
operations across the enterprise, and making it possible to determine the priority that should
be given to business process changes. They also make it possible for all qualified ERP
software firms and system integration firms to propose a Countywide solution.
GFOA subject matter expertise is needed to expedite the delivery of component work
products which enhance the ERP System Integration RFP and improve the vendor selection
process. No other firm provides the depth of knowledge in government ERP best practices,
the breadth of experience on large government ERP projects, the number of government ERP
references, or the ability to provide equivalent capabilities for less cost to Cook County.
A non-profit organization, GFOA has no affiliation with any software or hardware vendors,
and serves as a completely independent agent for its government clients. Their involvement
allows Cook County to demonstrate a commitment to projects that exhibit value, and a RFP
process that is transparent from beginning-to-end.
The growing number of problems related to the JD Edwards system heightens the need to
make the ERP Systems Integration RFP an immediate priority, and the Cook County ERP
Center of Excellence requests authorization to begin working with GFOA on the expected
July 12, 2011 Board approval date.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: not to exceed $569,240.00. (715-009-266 Account). Contract Period: July 15,
2011 through July 14, 2012.

820 ILCS 130/1 et seq. (1993), formerly Ill. Rev. Stat., Ch. 48, par. 39s-1 et seq.; and
WHEREAS, the aforesaid Act requires that the Board of Commissioners of the County of Cook

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE PRESIDENT AND BOARD OF
COMMISSIONERS OF THE COUNTY OF COOK:

workers employed in any public works by the State, county, city or any public body or any political
subdivision or by anyone under contract for public works," approved June 26, 1941, as amended, the
general prevailing rate of wages in this locality for laborers, mechanics and other workers engaged in the
construction of public works coming under the jurisdiction of this County is hereby ascertained to be the
same as the prevailing rate of wages for construction work in the Cook County area as determined by the
Department of Labor of the State of Illinois as of June 2011, a copy of that determination being submitted
hereto and incorporated herein by reference. As required by said Act, any and all revisions of the

Department's June determination and apply to any and all public works construction undertaken by the
County of Cook. The Definition of any terms appearing in this Ordinance which are also used in
aforesaid Act shall be the same as in said Act.
Section 2. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to apply said general prevailing rate of wages as

both the Secretary of State Index Division and the Department of Labor of the State of Illinois.
Section 6. The Bureau of Human Resources shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general
circulation within the area a copy of this Ordinance, and such publication shall constitute notice that the

awarding the contract shall cause to be inserted in the contract a stipulation to the effect that not less than
the prevailing rate of wages, as found by the Bureau of Human Resources, shall be paid to all laborers,

assessment. This is payable to the worker.
Section 9. There is an automatic two (2) year debarment of any contractor or subcontractor found to
have violated the Act on two (2) separate occasions. An affected contractor or subcontractor may request
the Department to hold a hearing on the alleged violations within ten (10) days notification of the second
violation.

Reason:

Under this proposed extension, Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) will
implement changes to the program developed by the court in consultation with members of
the Cook County Board of Commissioners, community outreach groups, housing counseling
agencies, legal aid offices, and housing policy and advocate groups. These changes will
include establishing housing counseling workshops in neighborhoods throughout Cook

agencies. These modifications will enable the program to accommodate and assist more
residents facing foreclosure and ensure the highest quality control of housing counseling
services provided in the most economically efficient manner. As of May 31, 2011, there were
75,112 mortgage foreclosures pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County. This extension
will provide the time necessary to fully evaluate the program modification IHDA was
originally selected to manage the program’s housing counseling services for a limited period
early in March 2010. In November 2010, a Request for Proposals (RFP) process was
completed. IHDA was the only respondent to the RFP.

Transmitting a Communication, dated June 23, 2011, from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $53,170.00 $1,276,257.00 and extend
for two (2) weeks one (1) year, Contract No. 10-41-33 with the Chicago Bar Foundation, Chicago,

$1,337,242.00
$2,560,330.00

Under this proposed extension, the Chicago Bar Foundation will implement changes to the
program developed by the court in consultation with members of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, community outreach groups, housing counseling agencies, legal aid offices,
and housing policy and advocate groups. These changes will include adding additional staff
attorneys, support staff, and mediators to increase capacity and to improve communications
among the Program service providers as well as ensuring timely services provided to the
litigants. These modifications will enable the Program to accommodate and assist more
residents facing foreclosure and ensure the highest quality control of legal aid and mediation
services provided in the most economically efficient manner. An increased capacity will also
enable the Court and the Program service providers to complete the mediation process in a
timely manner. As of May 31, 2011, there were 75,112 mortgage foreclosures pending in the
Circuit Court of Cook County. A two week extension will allow for a public hearing and
performance based metrics. A one year extension will provide the time necessary to fully
evaluate the Program modifications. The Chicago Bar Foundation was originally selected to
manage the Program’s legal aid and mediation services for a limited period early in March
2010. In November 2010, a Request for Proposals (RFP) process was completed. The

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 17, 2011 from
NANCY L. JONES, M.D., Chief Medical Examiner, Office of the Medical Examiner
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $100,000.00 from and to
the accounts listed below.
Reason:

Contract Maintenance rates are substantially higher than projected. There is an increased need
for disposal of hazardous waste - scavenger services. Due to legislation for fetal burials, costs
of burial shells have unexpectedly increased. As a result of unanticipated administrative hires,
there will be an increased printing cost. Since the transcription contract did not bid when
submitted to Purchasing, funds are being spent outside of that encumbered amount. Due to

177

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2011
under budgeted rental equipment, there is a need to increase this budgetary line. As a result
of unforeseen costs in upgrading the office with new radiology equipment and expansions,
the FY budget needs to be increased.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.

178

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2011

For all transfers, the account used for the source of the transferred funds was identified based on
available funds due to employees resigning and retiring during the fiscal year and fully funded
salary positions that were not immediately filled at the start of the Fiscal Year. Additionally, future
costs were taken into consideration. No other accounts were considered.
3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
There will not be any delays, cancellations, etc., in the account that funds will be transferred from.

4.

If the answer tithe above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The amount in this account was originally budgeted with the anticipation of hiring into vacancies
immediately. However, without a confirmed final budget, hiring was delayed to ensure that the
positions were fully funded. Additionally, two (2) employees retired December 31st and three (3)
appointed positions became vacant unexpectedly March 29th. These appointed positions were not
posted until May 16th and 20th almost 1 month after the request to hire's were submitted. We do
not anticipate the positions being filled until July 2011 at the earliest. Therefore, this created cost
savings that are necessary to fund the above-referenced costs for the operating accounts to continue
the regular operations of the office. We are currently going through the hiring process for five (5)
vacancies (including the three appoint positions which are not posted positions).

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 15, 2011 from
ANDREW PRZYBYLO, Secretary, Zoning Board of Appeals

197

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2011

requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $600.00 from Account 170190, Transportation and Other Travel Expenses for Employees to Account 170-240, Printing and
Publishing for the purpose of covering printing expenses.
Reason:

The Zoning Board of Appeals has updated the Rules of Practice and Procedure manual for
this department. Due to the amount needed to distribute, the cost of the print job exceeded
this department's appropriation in this account.

From Account 170-190

Total

$600.00

To Account 170-240

Total

$600.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
By May 31, 2011, it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations of the Zoning Board of Appeals. After paying the ZBA
Hearing Evaluations, there will be no funds remaining in the account for the Rules of Practice and
Procedure to be published. The balance on May 3, 2011 was $287.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The source account was identified for the surplus that would be available through the end of the
fiscal year.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
There will not be any projects, purchases, programs, contracts or other obligations that will be
deferred, delayed or cancelled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The 170-190 account was funded at historical levels. Due to restructuring, the department did not
have a need to utilize all of these funds.
