The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1. West Fulton Market Streetscape
27th Ward
Fulton-Randolph Market District
Proposed phase I streetscape improvement project on Fulton Market from Green
Street to Carpenter Street.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

1. The overall Phase I streetscape plan (from Green Street to Carpenter Street) is
approved as shown on drawings dated September 18, 2015. As proposed, the
raised sidewalk loading docks in all existing locations shall be maintained,
repaired or rebuilt to current elevations but modified as needed to provide
accessibility;
2. The materials, Unimix Integral Color Concrete, U18 Gull Grey, Broom
Finish, unsealed, for sidewalks, parking lanes and flush gutter; dark grey 24”
wide concrete detectable warning tile; asphalt driving lanes; cast iron ADA
truncated dome tiles at crosswalks; concrete bollards; 35’ spun aluminum
Davit Arm Light Poles; stainless steel bike racks; aluminum pipe railings and
aluminum and wood benches and furniture are approved as proposed. As
proposed, the paint color for pipe railing, trash cans, and for the non-wooden
portions of the street furniture is “Weathered Bark 84BR Semi-Gloss”; and,
3. For the block paving used in the project, as much historic block as possible
should be retained and reused.
2. 322 W. Willow
43rd Ward
Old Town Triangle District
Proposed rehabilitation of 2-story frame building into a single-family residence
including new basement and new rear addition.

 Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

1. As proposed, the existing roof and the front and side walls of the historic
building shall be retained and repaired in place. The permit plans shall
incorporate the drawings by the licensed structural engineer addressing how
the historic facades and roof should be supported, braced and protected, in
situ, during the demolition of the rear portions of the building and the interior
structure and the excavation and construction of the new addition as well as
during the foundation work;
2. The existing wood siding, which is in a deteriorated condition, may be
replaced with new wood siding to match the historic siding in size and profile.
Replacement of exterior siding shall be performed in phases, elevation by
elevation. Fiber-cement siding may be used as a substitute cladding material
on the rear elevation, and on side elevations on an elevation-by-elevation
basis, to the extent the building code requires non-combustible siding. The
fiber-cement siding shall have a smooth finish and otherwise match the
historic wood siding in size, profile, and finish. Details of the existing and
proposed siding shall be reviewed and approved by Historic Preservation staff
with the permit application;
3. The changes to the front façade, including window sizes and locations, new
trim and window surrounds shall be based on the physical evidence uncovered
after the removal of existing siding materials. Should no evidence be found,
the design of these elements shall be based on similar historic properties in the
district. The final design of the front façade as well as details of the new
aluminum-clad wood windows, trim and window surrounds shall be included
on the permit plans;
4. Side elevations shall be modified to incorporate trim around the new windows
to match existing trim found on the building and details should be included on
permit plans;
5. The entry door on the front façade shall be a paneled door of a design
consistent with historic doors on similar properties in the district. Enlarged
door elevation and details shall be included on the permit plans;
6. The detailing of the front porch, stair and railing shall be further developed
and the front stair shall incorporate decorative newel posts consistent with the
historic character of the property and the district. Enlarged plans, elevations
and details of the porch, stair and railings shall be included on the permit
plans; and,
7. The project requires a zoning variation and/or adjustment, and the
Commission takes no position regarding any requested variance/adjustment
relative to the zoning code requirements.
The Committee also advised the applicant that due to the condition issues with the
building the roof and the exterior walls should be made weather proof and secure
over the winter months or until the applicant is ready to proceed with the
construction at the site.
In addition, the Committee found that the amount of demolition involved with the
project, based upon the submitted information, does not trigger the requirements
of Section 2-120-825 governing the demolition of 40% or more of landmark
buildings.

 3. 1751 N. Fern Court
43rd Ward
Old Town Triangle District
Proposed third floor addition to existing non-contributing single-family residence.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

1. The project is approved as shown on drawings dated August 27, 2015. As
proposed, the new addition will be clad in brick to match the existing brick in
size, color, texture and joint profile and brick samples shall be reviewed for
approval by Historic Preservation staff with the permit application; and,
2. The project as proposed would require a zoning adjustment/variation to reduce
the side and rear yard setbacks. The Commission takes no position regarding
any requested variance/adjustment relative to the zoning code requirements.
4. 1839 N. Orleans
43rd Ward
Old Town Triangle District
Proposed rehabilitation of existing three flat into a single-family residence including a
rear addition, window fenestration alterations, and other exterior changes.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

1. The plans shall be modified to eliminate the proposed enlargement of the firstfloor single door opening on the front primary façade. The proposed
enlargement of the first-floor single door opening to three French doors on the
Orleans (front) façade would change the original fenestration pattern of the
building’s primary façade and would not meet the Commission’s standards,
criteria and guidelines;
2. On the north and south common brick (side) secondary façades, the
modifications to the masonry openings and the new windows are approved as
shown on plans dated 9/8/15;
3. Enlarged existing and proposed window details shall be included in the permit
plans to show that the new exterior profiles and brick molds will match the
historic profiles and brick molds. The window muntins may be simulated
divided-lites, and shall have substantial exterior and interior profiles and
spacer bars; and,
4. The new front porch wood railings shall have a painted finish.
5. 1606-08 N. Milwaukee
2nd Ward
Milwaukee Avenue District
Proposed new canopy above the main entry on the South elevation of the building.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

1. The canopy is approved as shown on drawings dated September 11, 2015.
Existing cast iron ornament shall be retained and repaired;
2. A sample of the proposed glass for the roof of the canopy shall be reviewed
for approval by Historic Preservation staff with the permit application; and,

 3. As proposed, no signage or heat lamps shall be installed on the new canopy.
6. 4120 S. Berkeley
4th Ward
Oakland District
Proposed new 2½ –story masonry single-family residence and attached rear garage.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

1. Given the historic development and siting of the attached masonry row houses
on this portion of the block, the proposed 2-1/2-story masonry infill
construction with 0’ side yards at the north and south sides of the subject
property are approved as these setback reductions match the predominant yard
depth of contributing buildings to the district’s character;
2. The front door shall have a design consistent with historic doors typical of this
building style found in the district. The front stoop shall incorporate
decorative newel posts and double pipes at the top and bottom rails. The
windows shall be wood or clad-wood with brick mold trim and a substantial
horizontal transom mullion. Enlarged section details of the front façade,
windows, door, stoop, railings, and decorative cornice shall be included in
permit plans for review and approval of Historic Preservation staff. The
articulation, depth, and detailing of these features are important aspects of the
design;
3. The applicant shall provide face brick, mortar, and stone samples for Historic
Preservation staff review and approval prior to order and installation. The
brick and stone colors and textures shall match typical colors and textures
found within the district, and the mortar shall have a narrow profile and match
the color of the face brick; and,
4. The finished wrap at the south elevation shall extend a minimum of 10’ from
the front façade. The siding on the remaining south elevation shall have a
narrower lap profile, such as 4”-6”-tall, and shall be painted a color consistent
with common brick with a smooth finish. Or alternatively, the remaining
south elevation may be clad with concrete masonry units with an integral
color to match common brick.
In addition, the Commission shall request in writing that the Zoning
Administrator approve an adjustment to reduce the side yard setbacks as per plans
dated 9/15/15 pursuant to Section 17-13-1003G “Setbacks in Landmark Districts”
of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance.
