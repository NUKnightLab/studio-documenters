PROPOSED LICENSE REQUEST
Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (“the Preserves”), as
Licensor to grant a License to 13500 S. Harlem Ave., LLC, Grantee, to locate, operate and maintain an existing
steel and wood retaining wall, pavement, light poles and appurtenances. The existing wall and improvements
were inadvertently installed at an angle to the property line approximately 15 years ago, resulting in much of the
wall encroaching on FPCC property. The 15.5 foot high wall supports FPCC land behind it; removal would leave
an unstable slope subject to erosion and collapse, and the land containing mature oak trees unsupported. No
additional land other than what is occupied by the encroachment is requested. In addition to the Licensing Fees, the
applicant will contribute $20,000.00 toward restoration activities in the FPCC.
Term: 10 Years
License Fee:

$3,500.00 (minimum license fee)

License Application Fee: $1,000.00

(Sec. 5-2A-4 and 5-2B-4)

Concurrence(s):
