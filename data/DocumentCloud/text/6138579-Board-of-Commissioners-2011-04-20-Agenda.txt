RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING EARTH DAY 2011
WHEREAS, there is a consensus among the world's leading scientists that global warming and climate
change caused by human emission of greenhouse gases is among the most significant problems facing the
world today; and

quality standards by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, partially due to the air pollution
emissions of the expansive industrial businesses within its boundaries; and
WHEREAS, while climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, it also presents enormous
opportunity to build a healthy, prosperous, clean energy economy now and for the future; and
WHEREAS, President Preckwinkle and the Cook County Board of Commissioners have shown
environmental accountability by initiating county-wide pollution reduction programs including:
Development of the private-public partnership with ComEd that will assist Cook County in

RESOLUTION
OPPOSING CONCEAL CARRY LAWS IN ILLINOIS AND COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, we strive to make Cook County a safe and positive environment for people to live, work
and raise their families; and
WHEREAS, gun violence destroys communities, neighborhoods, and families across Cook County and
the State of Illinois; and
WHEREAS, legislation introduced in the Illinois General Assembly that would allow for the issuance of
conceal carry weapons permits in Illinois is currently being considered; and
WHEREAS, allowing people to carry concealed weapons would not reduce crime, but rather put friends,
neighbors and police officers at grave risk; and
WHEREAS, recent polling from the Illinois Council Against Handgun violence shows that the majority
of Illinois citizens oppose allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons in public places; and
WHEREAS, rather than increasing the number of people permitted to carry guns, meaningful efforts to
protect people from gun violence should focus on curbing access to illegal guns, prosecuting dangerous
gun offenders and educating the public to meaningful alternatives to resolving disputes.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board President and the Cook
County Board of Commissioners urge the members of the General Assembly to reject any attempt to
legalize conceal carry permits in Illinois; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Cook County Clerk shall deliver a suitable copy of this
Resolution to each Member of the Illinois General Assembly.
