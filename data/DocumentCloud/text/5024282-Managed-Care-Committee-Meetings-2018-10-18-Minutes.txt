Report on CountyCare Health Plan (continued)
During the review of the information provided on Slide 9 of the presentation, the Committee discussed the
subject of CountyCare members, whose PCP is an ACHN provider, who go to outside PCPs for services.
Mr. Kiamos noted that this phenomenon is not unique to ACHN clinics; it is a problem for all medical
homes. Mr. Kiamos stated that, to address the problem, the first approach will be a repatriation effort to
outreach and communicate with those members, to ask them why they are not getting all of their care within
their PCP site. Some members might not be aware and may need to be reminded that the System uses a
medical home approach, and then get them engaged with their clinic for a visit. Others may know that they
are assigned to a site but prefer to go elsewhere; if that is the case, they will be changed to their preferred
site. Taking that approach will increase quality and Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set
(HEDIS) measures, and is a better way to deliver care. The other approach that he will implement is to
message all of CountyCare’s providers to let them know that the Plan will no longer pay for members who
are not empaneled to their clinics. That is pretty much on par with the majority of health plans in the market.
Director Driscoll inquired whether members can be surveyed to see why they are not exclusively going to
their PCP. Mr. Kiamos responded that this could be done in parallel with the other approaches.
Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, provided additional comments. He
stated that he believes that this is more of a call to action as a provider, rather than it being a plan issue. The
System clinics, as providers, are not establishing that personal relationship with the patients, and they need to
work on it. On the other hand, if the member already has a personal relationship with another clinic, they
need to be assigned over to the other clinic. Debra Carey, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Operations,
commented that clinic staff are actively reaching out to the new patients; however, they are challenged due to
inaccurate/outdated contact information for many of the patients.
