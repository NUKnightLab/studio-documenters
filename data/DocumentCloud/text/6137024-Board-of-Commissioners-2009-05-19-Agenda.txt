VETOES
ITEM #1
FOR INFORMATION ONLY
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 11, 2009 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
In accordance with the authority granted to me by section 2-6008 of the Counties Code and for the
reasons stated herein, I hereby transmit to you my veto of an amendment made to the Home Rule County
Retailer’s Occupation Tax (Chapter 74 Taxation, Article IV, Sections 74-150 through 74-152) passed by
the Board of Commissioners on May 5, 2009. Please place my veto message on the agenda for the next
meeting of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, May 19, 2009.
Please be advised that I am exercising my veto authority as President of the Board of Commissioners and
hereby veto Item No. 6 from the May 5, 2009, Cook County Board Meeting Agenda wherein the Cook
County Board of Commissioners amended the Home Rule County Retailer’s Occupation Tax reducing
the retailer’s occupation tax by 1% effective, January 1, 2010.
When I took office in December, 2006, Cook County was facing a deficit of over $500 million in a
budget of approximately $3 billion. Ratification of union contracts with yearly pay increases and other
enhancements with no identified source of revenue to pay for them contributed heavily to that budget
deficit—actions taken before I took office. To solve the Fiscal Year 2007 budget crisis, I called on
everyone in Cook County Government to cut 17% from offices across the board. My office led the way
with a 19% reduction from what was budgeted in FY 2006.
In Fiscal Year 2008, after cutting more than $125 million from initial budget shortfall estimates and
holding the line on property taxes, I asked the Cook County taxpayer to pay more in sales tax to pay for a
public health system and for vital services.
Before taxpayers were asked for one penny more in taxes, my Administration made substantial cuts in
county government spending. This was also the 12th year that Cook County did not raise the property tax
levy on its homeowners. After much debate, the majority of the Board of Commissioners voted to raise
the Cook County portion of the sales tax by one penny for the Fiscal Year 2008 budget. I truly believe the
one penny increase was the responsible course of action to take and obviously a majority of the Board of
Commissioners agreed with me.
When the Board of Commissioners agreed to raise the sales tax, I stood before the people of Cook County
and pledged to reduce that tax in the future if revenues increased in other areas to offset that reduction.
The approval of a new, five-year hospital assessment bill in Springfield and Washington DC that will
provide Cook County hospitals with tens of millions of dollars in new funding and an increase in funds
from a temporary FMAP increase from the federal stimulus bill allowed me to propose reducing the sales
tax by ¼%; this proposal is currently sitting in the Finance Committee. As I promised, when revenues to
replace a portion of that tax were identified, I moved to lower the tax burden on our residents.
On May 5, 2009, a majority of Cook County Commissioners voted to repeal the one penny sales tax
increase without identifying sources of revenue replacement or corresponding service reductions to close
the deficit that the government will face in Fiscal Year 2010. Those commissioners voted to eliminate
revenue that is needed to pay for county services.

VETOES continued
ITEM #1 cont’d
Before taking this action, there was no attempt by those commissioners to gather information from other
Cook County elected officials or the Cook County Health and Hospitals System on the viability and
ramification of this action on the criminal justice and health systems.
I stand firm in my commitment to support County services and to provide adequate funding in order to
protect and provide for our County residents. I remain committed to reductions in the sales tax; however
said reductions must only be made at the appropriate intervals with a complete understanding of the
revenues needed to fund County services.
While I hereby veto the action of the Board of Commissioners on May 5, 2009, I do so with the
commitment to gather appropriate information from other Cook County elected officials and the Cook
County Health and Hospitals System. It is important to fully understand the viability and ramification of
reductions of the Home Rule County Retailer’s Occupation Tax to the criminal justice and health systems
in order to effectively address amendments to the Home Rule County Retailer’s Occupation Tax currently
sitting in the Finance Committee, including my ordinance amendment which seeks a 1/4% reduction in
the Home Rule County Retailer’s Occupation Tax.
We will have the opportunity after full debate, disclosure and discussion, to reconsider this issue in a
responsible manner before the October 1, 2009 statutory deadline to alter the sales tax rate beginning
January 1, 2010.
For these reasons I urge you to reconsider your support of the repeal of the Cook County Retailer’s
Occupation Tax.

WHEREAS, in 2005, the General Assembly and the Governor passed legislation to create the Regional
Planning Board (now named CMAP) by combining the Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS) and
the Northeastern Illinois Planning Commission (NIPC). The bill received broad support from local
elected leaders and the civic and business communities to integrate planning for land use and
transportation in the seven-county region; and

ITEM #7 cont’d
WHEREAS, CMAP is developing the first comprehensive regional plan since Daniel Burnham’s Plan of
Chicago in 1901 through the agency’s GO TO2040 process. CMAP is coming to be viewed across the
seven counties of metropolitan Chicago as the best hope for accommodating an additional 2.8 million
residents expected by 2040; and
WHEREAS, the Comprehensive Regional Planning Fund was created by Public Act 95-0677. Funds are
disbursed by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) providing $5 million annually to support
regional planning in Illinois, of which $3.5 million is for CMAP. As the federally designated MPO for
our region, CMAP has an overall budget that relies primarily on $11 million in U.S. Department of
Transportation funds, which federal law requires be spent for regional transportation planning, with a 20
percent matching requirement; and
WHEREAS, Illinois and the Chicago region are preparing for long-overdue infrastructure investments
that depend on billions in federal stimulus and transportation funding. The Comprehensive Regional
Planning Fund is a guaranteed cost-effective way for Illinois to help ensure that taxpayers get
accountability and transparency in how public investments are made; and
WHEREAS, loss of the CRPF will seriously reduce regional planning capacity and cause a disastrous
“domino effect” whereby our region’s forfeit of $11 million in federal planning funds would render
CMAP unable to manage the regional Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), jeopardizing all of the
region’s federal transportation dollars and projects which total $2 billion annually as well as all of the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) economic stimulus funds and any new state capital
bill intended to leverage federally appropriated dollars; and
WHEREAS, the Comprehensive Regional Planning Fund is a critical component of funding for essential
regional planning and accountability, the loss of which would cause significant harm to the region and the
state.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County urges
Governor Quinn and the General Assembly to fully reinstate the Comprehensive Regional Planning Fund
to the State of Illinois FY10 budget; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to Governor Pat
Quinn, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), and the members of the Illinois General
Assembly representing Cook County and may it also be spread upon the official proceedings of this
Honorable Body.

Stabilization Program is to assist communities that have been or are likely to be affected by foreclosed
and/or abandoned properties. The program will provide affordable rental and home ownership
opportunities to eligible income households. Cook County has been allocated $28,156,321.00 for
implementation in suburban Cook County communities with the greatest need. Cook County utilized
HUD foreclosure and abandonment data to determine priority areas that are eligible for funding.
Cook County plans to enter into NSP agreements with municipalities, non-profits, and pre-qualified
organizations to coordinate NSP activities and stabilization strategies. Cook County also anticipates that
it will leverage this grant with existing CDBG and HOME funded projects.
I respectfully request approval to accept this grant award and that the Chief of the Bureau of Capital,
Planning and Facilities Management, or his designee, is authorized to execute on behalf of the County of
Cook, any and all documents necessary to facilitate administration of the program approved here in,
including but not limited to the NSP grant agreement and any modifications thereto. The approval of this
award for administration of the program by this Honorable Body will permit the Neighborhood
Stabilization Program to move forward.
Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award: $28,156,321.00.
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any.

Re:

HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME Program)

requesting re-approval of a HOME Investment Partnerships Program Loan to International Development
Equities Associates, Inc. (IDEA) for the substantial rehabilitation and conversion of the former American
Baptist Retirement Home located at 316 West Randolph, Maywood, Illinois. The original HOME Loan
was approved by the County Board of Commissioners on January 23, 2007. The first loan approval was
to the Heritage Development Group which has since sold its ownership interest in the Maywood
Supportive Care I, L.P. to IDEA, Inc. The requested increase in HOME funds is a result of escalating
construction and financing cost, and the withdrawal of first mortgage financing. The additional
$1,175,000.00 in HOME funds is necessary to make the project economically feasible.

ITEM #38 cont’d
As originally presented, the rehabilitated structure was projected to have 137 supportive living units, with
78-units as HOME assisted. However, due to changes in the construction configuration, the building will
now contain 130 supportive units of which 75 will be HOME assisted. In addition to the HOME funds,
other anticipated financing will include a FHA-insured first mortgage, equity raised through the sale of
Low Income Housing Tax Credits and deferred developer fees. The development budget is now projected
at $30,786,481.00 of which the new HOME loan amount of $3,000,000.00 accounts for approximately
9.7% of the total project costs.
The terms of the HOME Program loan will be structured as a 40-year amortized loan at 1% interest that
in-keeping with the FHA-insured mortgage requirements will be subject to the availability of surplus cash
flow. It is anticipated that the County will receive annual principal and interest payments of $91,032.00
to be used for other HOME eligible activities.
I respectfully request approval of this project, and that the Chief of the Bureau of Capital, Planning and
Facilities Management, or his designee, is authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook, any and
all documents necessary to further the project approved herein, including but not limited to the HOME
Loan agreement and any modifications thereto. The approval of this loan by this Honorable Body will
