17 and up as they are aging out of the system. The program provides wrap-around services to
young people. Each participant is paired with a “life coach,” who is a former foster child to
help guide the youth through the transition to independent life. Youth also receive the
services of a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, a General Education Diploma (GED)
instructor, and volunteers who mentor three (3) youth each. The proposal was the only
proposal that proposed focusing solely on foster youth and made an excellent case for need
and risk of foster children aging out of the system. The program will serve 50 youth. Using
former foster children to mentor current foster children could be a model for the system in the
future. The program will serve youth from all over the county, but anticipates most
participants will come from Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Bronzeville, Roseland, Austin,
South Shore, Humboldt Park and Lawndale.
The above provider was selected by a three (3) member Evaluation Committee. The
Evaluation Committee in total reviewed 108 proposals. The Evaluation Committee submitted

Submitting for your approval ONE (1) LOCAL AGENCY AGREEMENT AMENDMENT:
1. Local Agency Amendment #2 for Federal Participation
183rd Street,
U.S. Route45 (LaGrange Road) to 80th Avenue
in the Village of Tinley Park in County Board District #17
Section: 05-B6422-03-FP
Centerline Mileage: 2.13 miles
Fiscal Impact: $12,029,089.00 [$4,122,358.00 to be reimbursed from the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) and $5,534,000.00 to be reimbursed from the State of Illinois] from the
Motor Fuel Tax Fund (600-585 Account)
respectfully submits for execution and recommend for execution a Local Agency Amendment #2 for
Federal Participation, M-8003(167), with the State of Illinois, wherein Cook County will be the lead
agency to let, award a contract and supervise construction for improvements along 183rd Street
(County Highway B64) between U.S. Route 45 (LaGrange Road) and 80th Avenue, to be identified
as Section: 05-B6422-03-FP. This road will be constructed through the Village of Tinley Park.
Previously, your Honorable Body approved the original Local Agency Agreement for Federal
Participation on November 6, 2007 in the amount of $11,708,000.00 for construction of the 183rd
Street improvements. Subsequently, additional Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) federal
funding was secured and your Honorable Body approved a Local Agency Amendment #1 For Federal
Participation on April 1, 2009 in the amount of $13,315,000.00 to reflect the additional funding but
the State of Illinois did not approve the Amendment #1 due to various issues regarding construction
engineering costs. Further, your Honorable Body approved a new Local Agency Amendment #1 For
Federal Participation on January 16, 2013 which incorporated the final project costs and an amended
division of cost table, but erroneously referenced Illinois Commerce Commission funding.
The previous County approved Amendment #1 (dated January 16, 2013) is superseded by this
Amendment #2 which omits the erroneous reference to Illinois Commerce Commission funding and
shifts $446,847.00 from the State share to the County share of the Amended Division of Cost table
contained within said document. The total project cost of $12,029,089.00 and the FHWA funding of
$4,122,358.00 are not affected by this revision.

Cook will be responsible for the remaining balance of costs and the County share is revised to the
amount of $2,372,731.00 (previously $1,925,884.00) which still reflects a net reduction from the
estimated cost of $3,246,494.00 as per the original Agreement.

Under this proposed extension, the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) will
continue to operate a toll-free housing counseling helpline service and manage and
administer housing counseling services to residents in foreclosure. IHDA’s helpline
provides critical information to families facing foreclosure, assigns families to a HUDcertified housing counseling agency, and schedules housing counseling workshops and
appointments for the families. Housing counseling services are provided county-wide by
IHDA’s 12 HUD-certified subcontractors. Selected after a rigorous application process,
these agencies conduct housing counseling workshops and provide families with housing
counseling on a one-on-one basis. They help families facing foreclosure apply for loan
modifications or develop other options to avoid foreclosure whenever possible. Over the
past year ended March 31, 2013, the IHDA contract assisted more than 32,000 families
through the helpline, provided 5,000 families with free one-on-one housing counseling
sessions, and provided more than 3,000 families general housing counseling guidance at
more than 100 housing counseling workshops throughout Cook County. Each family
receives an average of four, one-on-one counseling sessions. As of March 31, 2013, there
were 75,533 mortgage foreclosures pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County.
IHDA was originally selected to provide the program’s housing counseling and helpline
services in March 2010 with the initiation of the program. A request for proposals (RFP)
process was conducted that year, but due to on-going and significant program
enhancements and developments, the RFP did not yield satisfactory results. A new RFP is
now in review with the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer. This extension will
provide services while the RFP is completed.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $951,750.00 (FY 2013: $389,500.00; and FY 2014:
Contract extension: August 1, 2013 through April 30, 2014. (310-260 Account).

Under this proposed extension, the Chicago Bar Foundation (CBF) will continue to manage
and administer legal aid and mediation services to homeowners in foreclosure. The services
are provided by the CBF’s three (3) subcontractors: Chicago Legal Clinic for pro bono legal
aid, Chicago Volunteer Legal Services for pro bono legal representation at mediation
sessions, and the Center for Conflict Resolution for mediator services. All services are
provided at no cost to the litigants and help them to understand their legal rights and
responsibilities, and provide defenses to the foreclosure. Over the past year ended March 31,
2013, the CBF contract provided 29,000 families with free legal advice and 1,148 families
with legal representation at mediation. More than 2,500 mediation sessions were conducted

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
ITEM #66
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 25, 2013 from
DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $30,000.00 from Account
529-240, External Graphics and Reproduction Services to Account 529-225, Postage for postage of
various mailings.
Reason:

Transfer funds are needed to cover postage utilized by departments within the Document
Storage Fund.

From Account 529-240

Total

$30,000.00

To Account 529-225

Total

$30,000.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On May 1, 2013 it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds.
The balance in the account at that time was $0 and the balance 30 days prior to that was $0. The
account was not budgeted for FY 2013 as there were no sufficient funds in the Document Storage
Fund (Department 529). Funds budgeted in the General Fund for postage, were not adequate to
cover mailings that were required by State Statutes. This shortage was due to unanticipated postage
rate increase in FY 2013.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 529-240 was identified as the source of transferred funds since the quantity of file jackets
to be printed in FY 2013 had to be reduced with the remaining amount to be funded from FY 2014,
hence the availability of funds for the transfer. As a result, funds allocated for File Jackets in FY
2013 were adjusted to accommodate a lower quantity. Hence, the availability of extra funds in this
account as a source of transfer.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 529-240.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

The Budget Department has reviewed and has no objection to this transfer.

ITEM #67
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 25, 2013 from
DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $45,507.00 from Account
335-240, External Graphics and Reproduction Services to Account 335-225, Postage for postage of
various mailings.
Reason:

The transfer of funds is needed to provide fund for postage of various mailings including
certified and restricted mail. Funds budgeted were not adequate to cover mailings that were
required by State Statutes, due to unanticipated postage rate increase and an increase in
mandatory mailings required by State Statutes in FY 2013.

Tickets (Traffic Citation Tickets) from the various Suburban Police Agencies. Hence, the
availability of funds for the transfer.
3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 335-240.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The funds to be transferred from Account 240 were received as a payment of reimbursement for the
printing costs of Personal Issue Tickets (Traffic Citation Tickets) from the various Suburban Police
Agencies. Hence, the availability of funds for transfer.

The Budget Department has reviewed and has no objection to this transfer.

ITEM #68
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 27, 2013 from
DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $150,000.00 from Account
529-240, External Graphics and Reproduction Services to Account 529-660, Rental of Facilities to
provide for various expenditure mainly 89th Street facility and shelving rentals through the end of the
fiscal year (September 1, 2013 through November 30, 2013).
Reason:

As the move into the new storage facility at Cicero has been delayed until FY 2014 and as
89th street storage facility related obligations were budgeted through the end of August 2013
(previously anticipated date of move), funds are needed in Account 660 Rental of Facilities in

RESOLUTION URGING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REQUIRE CELL PHONE
PROVIDERS TO KEEP IDENTIFICATION OF ALL CELL PHONE USERS ON FILE
WHEREAS, human trafficking is defined by the United States Department of State as “activities
involved when one person obtains or holds another person in compelled service; and

victims of this modern day form of slavery; and
WHEREAS, in the city of Chicago and suburban Cook County someone is reported missing every 30
minutes, many of those are girls as young as twelve years old who are held against their will and fall
victim to Human Trafficking; and
WHEREAS, recent statistics have named Human Trafficking the second largest most profitable criminal
enterprise among members of organized crime and violent street gangs; and
WHEREAS, modern technology allows traffickers to operate virtually undetected by the use of social
media where many victims are forced to pose for humiliating and degrading pictures that are then posted
on the internet and available to be viewed by individuals seeking to engage in sexual acts in exchange for
money further contributing to the sexual exploitation; and
WHEREAS, one of the most valuable resources available to traffickers to continue to remain undetected
while maintaining constant communication with victims of Human Trafficking, their associates, and
potential customers is the use of cellular phones; and
WHEREAS, no contract prepaid cell phones are referred to on the street as burners or drop phones and
are impossible to track because phone carriers do not require a contact, photo identification or a minimum
age; and

 page 38

WHEREAS, in instances where law enforcement’s only lead in rescuing a kidnapped victim is being
able to determine who a cell phone number is registered too, can be the difference between life and death.
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners urges the United States Congress and the Illinois General Assembly to pass legislation
that would require all cell phone carriers to secure and keep on file photo identification which includes a
physical address from any person wishing to obtain a cellular phone whether or not a contract is involved.
