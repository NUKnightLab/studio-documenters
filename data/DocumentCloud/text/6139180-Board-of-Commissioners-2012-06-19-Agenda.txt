 page 10
NEW ITEMS AGENDA
Meeting of June 19, 2012

(1) The firm's ownership by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person must be real,
substantial, and continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of the firm as reflected in
ownership documents. The owner(s) must enjoy the customary incidents of ownership and
share in the risks and profits commensurate with that ownership interest.
(2) The contributions of capital or Expertise by the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner(s) to acquire the ownership interest must be real and substantial. If Expertise is relied
upon as part of a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner's contribution to acquire
ownership, the Expertise must be of the requisite quality generally recognized in a specialized
field, in areas critical to the firm's operations, indispensable to the firm's potential success,
specific to the type of work the firm performs and documented in the firm's records. The
individual whose Expertise is relied upon must have a commensurate financial investment in
the firm.
(c) Only a firm that is managed and controlled by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
person(s) may be certified as a MBE or WBE.
(1) A firm must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions that limit the customary
discretion of the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s). There can be no
restrictions through corporate charter provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any other
formal or informal devices that prevent the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner(s), without the cooperation or vote of any non-Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged person, from making any business decision of the firm, including the making
of obligations or the disbursing of funds.
(2) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the power to direct or
cause the direction of the management and policies of the firm and to make day-to-day as
well as long-term decisions on management, policy, operations and work.
(3) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) may delegate various areas of the
management or daily operations of the firm to persons who are not Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged. Such delegations of authority must be revocable, and the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must retain the power to hire and fire any
such person. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must actually exercise
control over the firm's operations, work, management and policy.
(4) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have an overall understanding
of, and managerial and technical competence, experience and Expertise, directly related to the
firm's operations and work. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must
have the ability to intelligently and critically evaluate information presented by other
participants in the firm's activities and to make independent decisions concerning the firm's
daily operations, work, management, and policymaking.
(5) If federal, state and/or local laws, regulations or statutes require the owner(s) to have a
particular license or other credential to own and/or control a certain type of firm, then the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the required license or
credential. If state law, County ordinance or other law regulations or statute does not require
that the owner posses the license or credential, that the owner(s) lacks such license or

 page 11
NEW ITEMS AGENDA
Meeting of June 19, 2012

credential is a factor, but is not dispositive, in determining whether the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the firm.
(6) A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside employment or
other business interests that conflict with the management of the firm or prevent the owner
from devoting sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the firm to manage and control its
day to day activities.
(d) Only an independent firm may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An independent firm is one
whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another firm. Recognition of an applicant as a
separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is
independent and non-Affiliated. In determining whether an applicant is an independent Business, the CC
Director will:
(1) Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Firms in such areas as personnel, facilities,
equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.
(2) Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified Firms or persons
associated with non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's independence.
(3) Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Firms to determine whether a pattern
of exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Firm compromises the applicant's
independence.
(4) Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified Firms with
normal industry practice.
(e) An applicant shall be certified only for specific types of work in which the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and Expertise to manage and control the firm's
operations and work.
(f) The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or WBEs and nonCertified Firms. To be considered an eligible Joint Venture, at least one partner of the Joint Venture must
be a Certified Firm, with a share in the capital contribution, control, management, risks, and profits of the
Joint Venture which is equal to its ownership interest. Each Certified Firm partner must contribute
property, capital, efforts, skill and knowledge and be responsible for a distinct, clearly defined portion of
the work of the contract. Joint Ventures must have an agreement in writing specifying the terms and
conditions of the relationships between the partners and their relationship and responsibility to the
contract.
(g) In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the CC Director by rule may accept formal
certifications by other entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if the CC Director determines
that the certification standards of such entities are comparable to those of the County.
(h) The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the Office of
Contract Compliance. Failure of the firm to seek recertification by filing the necessary documentation
with the CC Director as provided by rule may result in decertification.

NEW ITEM #15 (cont’d)
(i) It is the responsibility of the Certified Firm to notify the CC Director of any change in its
circumstances affecting its continued eligibility for the Program, including decertification by another
agency. Failure to do so may result in the firm's decertification.
(j) The CC Director shall decertify a firm that does not continuously meet the eligibility criteria.
(k) Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by the
County. The challenged firm shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be
maintained.
(l) A firm that has been denied certification or recertification or has been decertified may protest
the denial or decertification as provided by rule.
(m) A firm found to be ineligible may not apply for certification for six (6) months after the
effective date of the final decision.
(n) A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for certification or a Certified Firm
as provided by rule. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the individual challenging the
eligibility of an applicant for certification or a certified form. The burden of proof shall rest with the
complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The CC Director shall be the
final arbiter of all challenges. The presumption that the challenged firm is eligible shall remain in effect
until the CC Director renders a final decision.
Sec. 34-294. Annual aspirational goals.
The Annual Aspirational Goals for the utilization of MBEs and WBEs on County construction
contracts and subcontracts shall be 24 percent for MBEs and ten (10) percent for WBEs.
Sec. 34-295. Project specific goals.
The CC Director, in consultation with the User Department, shall establish Project Specific Goals
for construction Contracts based upon the availability of at least three MBEs and three WBEs to perform
the anticipated subcontracting functions of the project and the County's utilization of MBEs and WBEs to
date.
Sec. 34-296. Counting MBE and WBE participation.
(a) The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the MBEs or WBEs own
forces shall be counted, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the MBE or WBE for the
work of the contract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the MBE or WBE (except supplies
and equipment the MBE or WBE purchases or leases from the prime Contractor or the prime Contractor's
Affiliate).

 page 13
NEW ITEMS AGENDA
Meeting of June 19, 2012

PRESIDENT continued
NEW ITEM #15 (cont’d)
(b) The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a MBE or WBE for providing a bona
fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing bonds or
insurance specifically required for the performance of a contract, shall be counted, provided the fee is
reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(c) When a MBE or WBE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of the
total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the Joint
Venture's contract that is performed by the MBE or WBE with its own forces and for which it is
separately at risk, shall be counted.
(d) Only expenditures to a MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function
shall be counted. To determine whether a MBE or WBE is performing a Commercially Useful Function,
the County will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the
MBE or WBE is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing
and other relevant factors. To perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be
responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining
quality and quantity, ordering the material, installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself.
A MBE or WBE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra
participant in the contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or
WBE participation. If a MBE or WBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would
be expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful
Function. When a MBE or WBE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the
Certified Firm may present evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e) One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from a MBE or WBE
Manufacturer or Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of the fees or transportation
charges for the delivery of materials or supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the
payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and are commensurate with fees customarily
charged for similar services.
(f) If a firm ceases to be a Certified Firm for any other reason than graduation from the M/WBE
Construction Program during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of work performed under a
contract with that firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted.
(g) In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of a MBE or WBE
shall not be counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-297. Contract pre-award compliance procedures.
(a) For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all
subcontractors from which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have
been established, its achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan
shall be due at the time the bid / proposal is due.
(b) Any agreement between a Contractor and a MBE or WBE in which the Contractor requires
that the MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.

 page 14

Meeting of June 19, 2012

NEW ITEM #15 (cont’d)
(c) Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CC Director will
determine whether the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). In making this
determination, the Director will consider, at a minimum, the Contractor's efforts to:
(1) Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings,
advertising and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs certified in the scopes of
work of the contract. The Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and WBEs with timely,
adequate information about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract to
allow MBEs and WBEs to respond to the solicitation. The Contractor must follow up initial
solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEs.
(2) Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to increase the
likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate,
breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBE
participation, even when the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items
with its own forces. It is the Contractor's responsibility to make a portion of the work
available to MBEs and WBEs and to select those portions of the work or material needs
consistent with the availability MBEs and WBEs to facilitate their participation.
(3) Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such negotiation
includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEs that were
contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for
the work selected for subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached with MBEs
and WBEs. The Contractor may not reject MBEs and WBEs as being unqualified without
sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities. That there may be some
additional costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEs is not in itself sufficient
reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as such costs are
reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the work of a contract with its
own organization does not relieve it of the responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all
scopes of work that could be subcontracted.
(4) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or
insurance as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.
(5) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies,
materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate.
(6) Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women community
organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government sponsored minority/women
business assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the
recruitment and placement of MBEs and WBEs.

NEW ITEMS AGENDA
Meeting of June 19, 2012

PRESIDENT continued
NEW ITEM #15 (cont’d)
(e) In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of other
Contractors in meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the apparent
successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably
questioned whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor could have met
the Project Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project
Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBE participation obtained by other
Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.
(f) A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the work, materials,
equipment or services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE and the agreed upon dollar value
shall be due at the time of bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(g) The CC Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the scope of
work and the letters of intent from MBEs and WBEs. The CC Director may request clarification in
writing of items listed in the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the opportunity
to augment listed participation or Good Faith Efforts.
(h) If the CC Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project Specific
Goals have been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User Department, the
CC Director and User Department shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent Department.
(i) If the CC Director finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the CC
Director shall communicate this finding to the User Purchasing Department and recommend that the
bid/proposal be rejected. A Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest
procedures.
Sec. 34-298. Contract administration procedures.
(a) Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the Project
Specific Goals become covenants of performance by the Contractors and incorporated in the contract.
(b) The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the performance of
the contract, and detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment
submitted to the County or as otherwise directed by the County. The CC Director and the User
Department shall monitor subcontractor participation during the course of the contract. The County shall
have full and timely access to the Contractor's books and records, including without limitation payroll
records, tax returns and records and books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its
commitment to MBE and WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion
of the contract. This provision shall be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision
allowing inspection of the Contractor's records by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.

NEW ITEM #15 (cont’d)
(c) The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEs
named in the Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CC Director, Purchasing Agent
and the User Department. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this subdivision
and a breach of contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause
termination of the executed contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the Contractor
to contract penalties or other sanctions.
(1) All requests for changes or substitutions of a MBE or WBE Subcontractor(s) named in the
Utilization Plan shall be made to the CC Director, Purchasing Agent and the User Department
in writing, and shall clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request. A Contractor shall not
substitute a MBE or WBE subcontractor or perform the work designated for a MBE or WBE
subcontractor with its own forces unless and until the CC Director, Purchasing Agent in
consultation with the User Department, approves such substitution in writing. A Contractor
shall not allow a substituted subcontractor to begin work until both the Director, Purchasing
Agent and the User Department have approved the substitution.
(2) The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should have been
known by either party before the submission of the Utilization Plan. Bid shopping is
prohibited. The Contractor must negotiate with the MBE or WBE subcontractor to resolve the
problem. Where there has been a mistake or disagreement about the scope of work, the MBE
or WBE can be substituted only where an agreement cannot be reached for a reasonable price
for the correct scope of work.
(3) Substitutions of the subcontractor shall be permitted only on the following bases:
(i) Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed.
(ii) Failure of performance.
(iii) Financial incapacity.
(iv) Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price.
(v) Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a solicitation where
agreement upon a reasonable price cannot be reached.
(vi) Failure of the subcontractor to meet insurance, licensing or bonding requirements; or
(vii) The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal.
(4) The final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed substitution, and the basis of any
denial, shall be communicated to the parties in writing by the CC Director.

PRESIDENT continued
NEW ITEM #15 (cont’d)
(5) Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the satisfaction of the
County, the Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan. The
Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in obtaining a new
MBE or WBE. If the Project Specific Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have
been made, the Contractor may substitute with a non-Certified Firm.
(6) If the County requires the substitution of a MBE or WBE subcontractor listed in the
Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall undertake Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization
Plan. The Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in
obtaining a new MBE or WBE subcontractor. If the Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good
Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a non-Certified Firm.
(d) If a Contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not previously
disclosed in the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of the CC Director to modify the
Utilization Plan and must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure that MBES and WBEs have a fair
opportunity to bid on the new scope of work.
(e) Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User Department at the time they
arise to establish the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the MBE or WBE goal.
(f) Prior to contract closeout, the CC Director shall evaluate the Contractor's fulfillment of the
contracted goals, taking into account all approved substitutions, terminations and changes to the contract's
scope of work. If the County determines that Good Faith Efforts to meet the MBE or WBE commitments
were not made, or that fraudulent misrepresentations have been made, or any other breach of the contract
or violation of this subdivision, a remedy or sanction may be imposed, as provided in the contract.
Sec. 34-299. Sanctions and penalties.
(a) The following violations of this subdivision may result in a breach of contract:
(1) Providing false or misleading information to the County in connection with submission of a
bid, responses to requests for qualifications or proposals, Good Faith Efforts documentation,
post award compliance, or other Program operations.
(2) Committing any other violations of this subdivision.
(b) A Contractor or subcontractor is subject to withholding of payments under the contract,
termination of the contract for breach, contract penalties, or being barred or deemed non-responsive in
future County solicitations and contracts as determined by the County's Purchasing Agent, if it is found to
have:
(1) Provided false or misleading information in connection with an application for certification or
recertification or colluded with others to do so;
(2) Provided false or misleading information in connection with the submission of a bid or

construction marketplace, and the permissible scope of any narrowly tailored remedies to redress
discrimination against MBEs or WBEs so that the County will not function as a passive participant in a
discriminatory marketplace.
(d) This subdivision shall sunset on or before June 30, 2016.

NEW ITEMS #16
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
TONI PRECKWINKLE, President and BRIDGET GAINER, County Commissioner
ESTABLISHING A COOK COUNTY LAND BANK ADVISORY COMMITTEE
WHEREAS, the current housing and economic crisis has deep and wide-ranging consequences in Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, the growing incidence of vacant, abandoned, tax-delinquent, and foreclosed properties in
neighborhoods throughout the region have had a chilling effect on economic development and cause harm
to overall economic health; and
WHEREAS, the problem only threatens to deepen as more than 85,000 foreclosure cases are currently
pending in Cook County which may lead to the lowering of neighbors’ property values, weakening the
tax base, and imposing additional costs on local government; and
WHEREAS, foreclosure and vacant buildings cannot be contained by suburban borders, ward boundaries
or districts; we must tackle vacant and abandoned properties throughout the County by repurposing the
tools and resources that reside in our home rule authority; and

 page 23
NEW ITEMS AGENDA
Meeting of June 19, 2012

PRESIDENT continued
NEW ITEM #16 (cont’d)
WHEREAS, we must employ these resources in partnership with other local governments and agencies
to preserve communities, spur growth and development; and
WHEREAS, creating a Countywide Land bank as a revitalization tool would have the ability to provide
redevelopment and revitalization services to participating municipalities in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, to help address the further increase and threat of vacant and abandoned property, Cook
County proposes the creation of a Land Bank that could be applied countywide; and
WHEREAS, the formation of a Land Bank could assist in returning vacant and foreclosed property in
Cook County back to active tax paying status, but also to be a catalyst to foster quality economic
development, increase affordable housing and provide long-term community stabilization, revitalization
and preservation; and
WHEREAS, across the country, Land Banks have been a successful tool in creating and maintaining
affordable housing including through the transformation of vacant buildings into rental and viable
commercial properties; and
WHEREAS, we must explore the formation of a Cook County Land Bank and recommend additional
ways to reduce the financial and social cost to our communities and local governments by reducing and
re-purposing vacant, abandoned, and non-tax-producing properties; and
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the President of the Cook County Board assemble a
Cook County Land Bank Advisory Committee (“Advisory Committee”) that may include but not be
limited to representatives from the President's Office, Cook County Bureau of Economic Development,
City of Chicago, Housing Authority of Cook County, Office of the Cook County State’s Attorney,
Suburban Elected Officials, Suburban Mayors and Managers Associations, regional planning agencies,
civic leaders, affordable housing developers, and local realtors within 60 days of the passage of this
Resolution; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Advisory Committee shall consider potential models for a
Cook County Land Bank, including but not limited to: (1) creation of a not-for-profit redevelopment
authority established under the County’s charter in partnership with the Bureau of Economic
Development; (2) creation of a permanent Countywide Advisory Board established by the Cook County
Board President to work with a designated not-for-profit development authority or the Cook County
Bureau of Economic Development to approve the placement of property into a Land Bank Authority
created by the Cook County; or (3) creation of a not-for-profit redevelopment authority established under
the Housing Authority of Cook County in partnership with Cook County; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, in determining the recommended Cook County Land Bank model, the
Advisory Committee shall consider at a minimum the following goals: (1) ability to eliminate harms
caused by vacant, abandoned, and tax-delinquent properties by returning them to productive use; (2)
ability to eliminate barriers to returning properties to productive use, such as cloudy title; and (3) ability
to hold properties for a limited duration until they can be effectively conveyed to new owners in
accordance with redevelopment plans; and

Meeting of June 19, 2012

PRESIDENT continued
NEW ITEM #16 (cont’d)
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, in determining the recommended Cook County Land Bank model, the
Advisory Committee shall at a minimum consider the following benefits of creating a Countywide Land
Bank: (1) vacant, abandoned, and tax-delinquent properties that have been allowed to become growing
liabilities to communities could be returned to productive use; (2) the tax base could be strengthened by
returning unproductive properties to productive use; (3) planning capacity available to local communities
could be increased; and (4) property targeted for redevelopment could be held in trust, reducing the
number of repeated transfers of low value property by speculators; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Advisory Committee should take into consideration the potential
budget, target areas, scope of services and governance of a Cook County Land Bank with the goals stated
above; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Advisory Committee shall further evaluate methods and
recommend initiatives to further market existing tax credit classes via the Cook County Bureau of
Economic Development which would allow for the conveyance of various tax exemptions upon the
authorization of the Cook County Board that could lead to revitalization, incentivize economic growth,
facilitate affordable housing and increase open space; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Advisory Committee shall make recommendations within 60 days
of appointment of the Advisory Committee, to the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook
County recommending a model or models for a countywide Cook County Land Bank; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Advisory Committee shall make recommendations within 90 days
of appointment of the Advisory Committee, to the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook
County recommending additional ways to market and benefits of marketing existing tax credit classes.

COOK COUNTY CEMETERY (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed
Resolution sponsored by John A. Fritchey, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
COOK COUNTY CEMETERY
WHEREAS, recent events as well as investigations by the Cook County Sheriff have
brought into serious question and unfortunate light, the manner by which the Cook County’s
indigent, unclaimed and unknown individuals have been buried; and
WHEREAS, disturbing practices have included persons stacked eight coffins high, bodies
placed in coffins with unidentified limbs and skeletal remains from other bodies, medical
waste and non-human debris, and coffins buried haphazardly in a manner making future
location for personal or law enforcement purposes, difficult if not impossible; and

 FINANCE AGENDA
JUNE 19, 2012
PAGE 19

WHEREAS, such practices not only demonstrate an unacceptable lack of respect for the
least fortunate among us and are unbecoming of a civilized society, but additionally impede
ongoing criminal investigations in cases of unknown decedents, as the identifying
characteristics of hundreds of unidentified remains buried by the County have failed to be
entered into the NCIC (National Crime Information Center), the nationally recognized
database for tracking crime-related information; and
WHEREAS, the discovery of the above-mentioned practices led to the introduction and
passage of an ordinance on May 4, 2011, setting new standards and safeguards for the
manner in which burials of the indigent, unclaimed and unknown are handled in Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, said ordinance clarified the role and responsibilities of the Office of the
Medical Examiner in preparing the bodies for burial as well as the methods by which burials
are to be conducted by cemeteries that have contracts with the county for such burials; and
WHEREAS, this Government is ultimately responsible for these individuals, and
consequently it is the in the best interest of the County and its residents for the County to
once again operate a cemetery for the burial of our County’s indigent, unclaimed and
unknown persons; and
WHEREAS, for over a century, from 1854-1971, Cook County operated, maintained and
administered its own cemetery, the most recent site having been located on the land adjacent
to the Oak Forest Hospital, known as the Cook County Cemetery for the Indigent, where
tens of thousands of individuals have previously been laid to rest; and
WHEREAS, the reestablishment of a permanent Cook County Cemetery would not only
ensure that our indigent are put to rest in a respectful manner, but it would also facilitate
proper documentation for law enforcement purposes, proper maintenance, as well as save
the County millions of dollars; and
WHEREAS, with the use of approximately 5 acres of land contiguous to the location of the
former Cook County Cemetery for the Indigent, the County could establish a cemetery
capable of meeting the needs of the County for the next 100 years; and
WHEREAS, the aforesaid land is presently owned and maintained by the Forest Preserve
District of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, since the Forest Preserve acquired said cemetery, no plan for addressing the
former cemetery site has been forthcoming, and as such, ample opportunity still exists to
determine a proper use of that parcel and the surrounding areas; and
WHEREAS, there exist several precedents for the co-existence of cemeteries on Forest
Preserve property, including Bachelors Grove Cemetery, Sauerbier-Burkhardt Cemetery and
the above-mentioned Cook County Cemetery for the Indigent; and
WHEREAS, the County Highway Department already owns the equipment necessary to
operate and maintain such a cemetery; and

 FINANCE AGENDA
JUNE 19, 2012
PAGE 20
WHEREAS, the Cook County Sheriff has expressed a willingness and ability to provide
sufficient labor necessary to operate and maintain such a cemetery; and
WHEREAS, based upon anticipated costs for the currently mandated indigent burial
program, the reestablishment of a County cemetery can reasonably expect to save Cook
County taxpayers in excess of $175 million over the next 100 years.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners
that the Office of the Medical Examiner, the Office of the Cook County Sheriff, the Cook
County Bureau of Administration, the Cook County Real Estate Management Division, the
Cook County Highway Department, the Forest Preserve District of Cook County and any
other agency deemed necessary are hereby directed to cause a plan to be completed and
presented to the Board of Commissioners for the reestablishment of a Cook County
Cemetery at the aforementioned site for the purpose of indigent, unclaimed and unknown
burials; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that said plan shall include the creation of an
intergovernmental agreement between the County of Cook and the Forest Preserve District
of Cook County to locate said cemetery on the 5 acres to the immediate west of the old
Cook County Cemetery for the Indigent; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that said intergovernmental agreement shall stipulate that
the reestablished Cook County Cemetery shall remain Forest Preserve property in order to
ensure its permanency; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that said plan shall provide the structure by which the
affected agencies shall coordinate and delegate responsibilities in order to establish, operate
and maintain such a cemetery; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the results of the aforementioned plan shall be
delivered to the Cook County Board of Commissioners no later than August 1, 2012, with
an implementation date of January 1, 2013.
Effective Date: This Resolution shall be effective upon passage.
This item was deferred on June 5, 2012.
