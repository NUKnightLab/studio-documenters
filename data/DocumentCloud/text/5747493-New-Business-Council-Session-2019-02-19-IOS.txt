in relation to the City?s FY 2019 budget and Four-Year Financial Plan for FY 2019 
FY 2022, and forecasted FY 2023.

4. SCOPE

4.1. This Memorandum is not intended tO convey any statements nor Opinions on the

5.2. Background: The proposed contract?s ?nancial provisions would impact Public Works
and includes an annual wage increase of 2% for all members between FY 2020 FY
2023. It also assumes an immediate market rate adjustment occurs to increase base

5.3. Fiscal Impact: As shown in the table below, the proposed contract would add
approximately $130,000 in costs over the FY 2019 FY 2023 period. Those costs will
be incurred in the Major Street Fund. To offset the incremental cost, the City can utilize
cost savings from operational efficiencies identi?ed by Public Works, such as a
reduction in maintenance expenditures. Thus, the proposed contract would not require
the identification of any additional resources, and there is no net negative impact on
the City?s FY 2019 budget and Four?Year Financial Plan for FY 2019 FY 2022, and
