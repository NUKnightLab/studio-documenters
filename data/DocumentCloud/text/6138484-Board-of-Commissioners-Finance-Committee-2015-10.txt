(4) Permit to cCremate a dead human body obtained from the Office of the Medical Examiner, by facsimile
or electronic filing, unless the Medical Examiner determines that the decedent and the authorized person
is indigent and unable to pay the permit fee, or other special circumstances warrant fee waiver in the
Medical Examiner’s discretion.

Office and then request to return them to the Office after determining that the family has no funds for
burial. This cost would include the cost of the burial shell and the burial cost.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
COOK COUNTY SERVICE OCCUPATION TAX
WHEREAS, just two short years ago, the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners made good
on the pledge to taxpayers and businesses by repealing the last .25% of the so-called ‘Stroger sales tax’; and
WHEREAS, the decision and votes to cut taxes on everyday items a majority of residents need to help working
families, toothpaste, milk, baby formula and other everyday necessities, was made as a means of lessening
the
burden on them and stimulating the economy; and
WHEREAS, the tax rollback fulfilled a pledge we made to businesses that were concerned their customers would
buy goods outside Cook County and as such, not only benefited Cook County shoppers, but also the retailers that
serve them; and
WHEREAS, economic development also benefited as the tax climate is one of the many variables that
businesses consider when deciding where to create jobs; and
WHEREAS, the cumulative effect of the sales tax rollback yielded roughly $440 million in annual savings
taxpayers; and
Page 67 of 70

for

 WHEREAS, a sales tax is recognized as an inherently regressive tax that disproportionately impacts the least
fortunate among us; and
WHEREAS, the same arguments and reasoning used to gather support and passage of the rollback of the
regressive sales tax are just as valid today as they were then; and
WHEREAS, the recent decision to reinstate the 1% sales tax increase in its entirety restores these same burdens
on Cook County residents, families and businesses that compelled the Board to roll back this tax in the first place;
and
WHEREAS, given that the proposed 2016 budget has yet to be introduced, raising the sales tax was a premature
burdening of our taxpayers with hundreds of millions of dollars in new taxes each and every year into perpetuity;
and
WHEREAS, as a result of this action, Cook County consumers and visitors are facing a nation-leading sales tax
of between 10.25 percent and 11.25 percent. The highest rate, 11.25 percent, would be paid by consumers in the
Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority area, which makes up most of the City of Chicago’s core; and
WHEREAS, this access to a massive influx of new taxpayer dollars will only serve to lessen pressure on the
administration of the President and on the Board to continue to seek ways to improve the efficiency, transparency
and operations of Cook County government; and
WHEREAS, in order to preserve the impetus and maintain the pressure to continue to reform county government
and reaffirm that there is more that needs to be done, and done soon, this Honorable Body should take a proactive
approach and commit to roll back this most recent sales tax increase;
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED, by the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners that
Chapter 74, TAXATION, Article V. - SERVICE OCCUPATION TAX, Sections 74-190 through 74-192 be
