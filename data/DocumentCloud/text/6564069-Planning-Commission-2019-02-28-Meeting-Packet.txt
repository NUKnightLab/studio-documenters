Proposed Text Amendments: Text that is struck through is text proposed for deletion, new
proposed text is underlined.

502-A (4) Prohibited Activities (Modified)
(A) No activities shall be permitted or authorized to be established which, when conducted in
compliance with the provisions of this resolution, are or may become hazardous,
noxious, or offensive due to the emission of odor, light, dust, smoke, cinders, gas, fumes,
noise, vibrations, electrical interference, refuse matters, or water-carried wastes
including, but not limited to, outdoor fire boilers. Any use or operations of medical
marijuana cultivators, processors, dispensaries, and/or testing laboratories are prohibited.
Definitions (NEW):

permitted under Chapter 3796. of the Revised Code).
Processor

• Dispensary
• Testing Laboratory
Staff Research:
In 2018 Northfield Center Township passed a similar moratorium of medical marijuana.

1. The Zoning Commission is proposing to add a new #97 definition to Chapter 130,
“Definitions” in the Northfield Center Township Zoning Resolution. The proposed text
is as follows:
97. MEDICAL MARIJUANA: Medical Marijuana shall have the meaning as
that term defined in the Ohio Revised Code 3796.01 (A) (2) as adopted by HB 523.
2. The Zoning Commission is proposing to add a new Section, Sec. 230.12, in Chapter
230, “General Provisions” of the Northfield Center Township Zoning Resolution. The
proposed text is as follows:
Sec. 230.12 MEDICAL MARIJUANA.
Purpose: To establish a permanent ban on the acceptance of any application
for, or the granting of, any zoning certificate for any building, structure, use, expansion of
use, or change of use that would enable the cultivation, processing, distribution or sale of
medical marijuana in Northfield Center Township. No existing business in Northfield
Center Township may expand in any way that would establish the cultivation, processing,
distribution, or sale of medical marijuana.
Within Ohio there have been several municipalities that have passed either a ban or a
moratorium on the sale and/or the cultivation/production of medical marijuana. West Chester
Township, Sharonville, Blue Ash, Colerain Township and Fairfield also ban all medical
marijuana-related businesses. Moratoriums are in place in Ross and Sharon townships, and in
Hamilton. (from Cincinnati.com, “liberty twp. puts block marijuana dispensaries”)
Hamilton, Ohio has a ban on Medical marijuana in its zoning code:
Definitions: Medical Marijuana: shall have the same meaning as set out in Ohio Revised Code Section
3796.01(A)(2). (OR2017-12-132)

 Medical Marijuana Cultivation, Processing, or Retail Dispensing: shall mean any business, building,
structure, or land used for the cultivation, processing, or retail dispensing of Medical Marijuana. (OR
2015- 2-14) (REVISED: OR2017-12-132)
They also added it as a prohibited use in zoning districts:
Prohibited Use Medical Marijuana Cultivation, Processing, or Retail Dispensing: As Defined in Section
1108.00. (OR 2015-2-14) (REVISED: OR2017-12-132)
Sharon Township has a ban on medical marijuana in its zoning code by listing under General
Provisions: Medical marijuana cultivators processors and dispensaries are prohibited from being
located in all zoning districts of Sharon Township.
Staff Comments:
The definition of testing laboratory is proposed as:
Testing laboratory
means an independent laboratory located in Ohio that has been issued a certificate of operation
by the department to have custody and use of controlled substances for scientific and medical
purposes and for purposes of instruction, research, or analysis.
Staff recommends the removal of the word “means” at the start of the definition and to clarify
which department issues a certificate and that the laboratory restrictions are for medical
marijuana ie
Testing laboratory
A laboratory that has been issued a certificate of operation by the Ohio Department of
Commerce to have custody and use of controlled substances for scientific and medical
purposes and for purposes of instruction, research, or analysis of medical marijuana.

Recommendation: Staff recommends to the Summit County Planning Commission that the
proposed text amendments be APPROVED.

430.04B.3.b)(3) says screening vegetation has 12 months to reach 6 feet.

Staff recommends the following placement for the new text:

 Screening of residential areas from commercial and industrial areas:
•

The earthen berm shall be a minimum of 6 feet in height, and a minimum width of 20
feet. The height will be measured form the natural grade. 430.04 B. 3. b) (3)

•

A dense vegetative planting including trees, evergreens, shrubs and hedges effective
in summer and winter shall be required. 430.04 B. 3. a) (1)

•

Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of 6 feet in height at the time of planting.
Evergreen plantings shall be planted at a maximum distance of 10 feet on center to
provide an effective buffer unless otherwise specified. 430.04 B. 3. a) (1) (a)

•

Shrubs and hedges shall be used to fill in between evergreen trees to ensure screening
is effective. 430.04 B. 3. a) (1) (b)

•

The current owner shall maintain the required landscaping in good and healthy
condition. In the event any required landscaping material dies or is destroyed, it shall
be replaced within 6 months. Replacement material shall conform to the original
intent of the landscape plan. 430.04 B. 3. d) (1)

•

Ground cover shall be used and maintained on the berm to prevent erosion of the
berm. 430.04 B. 3. a) (4) (a)

•

The evergreen screening shall be a minimum of 6 feet in height at time of planting.

within three years after the initial installation.
(a)
Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of 6 feet in
height at the time of planting. Evergreen plantings
shall be planted at a maximum distance of 10 feet
on center to provide an effective buffer unless
otherwise specified.
(b)
Shrubs and hedges shall be used to fill in between

(2)
Vegetation shall be a minimum of 6 feet high measured
from the natural grade, in order to accomplish the desired
screening effect. The required height shall be achieved no
later than twelve months after the initial installation.
Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of 6 feet in height at
the time of planting.
(3)
The earthen berm shall be a minimum of 6 feet in height,
and a minimum width of 20 feet. The height will be
measured form the natural grade.
