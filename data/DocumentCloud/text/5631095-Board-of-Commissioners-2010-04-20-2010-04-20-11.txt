EXPLANATION
Program Overview: The overall Rockwell redevelopment plan, as part of the Chicago
Housing Authority (“CHA”) Plan for Transformation Program, provides for the development
of approximately 780 new units of mixed-income rental and for-sale housing. The total 780
units of housing will consist of approximately 66% rental housing and 33% for-sale housing.
East Lake/West End LLC entered into a development agreement with the CHA to develop 690
60 East Van Buren, 12th Floor · Chicago, Illinois 60605 · (312) 913-7282 · www.thecha.org

 units of those units in a development named West End. Phase I of this development (divided
into two construction sub-phases, Phase IA and Phase IB) involved the development of 189
units of mixed-income rental and for-sale housing.
Development Entities: East Lake/West End LLC is the master developer of the 690-unit
West End project. The sole member of East Lake/West End LLC is East Lake Management
and Development Corporation. The Phase II rental development will be owned by East
Lake/West End II, LP. East Lake/West End II, LP is comprised of East Lake/West End LLC
as the general partner and an entity affiliated with Alliant Capital, Ltd. as the limited partner.
The limited partner will own 99.99% of East Lake/West End II, LP.
West End Phase II Development Summary: The West End Phase II development will create
112 units of mixed income rental housing and a community park. The 112 rental units will be
comprised of 65 ACC/Low Income Housing Tax Credit (“LIHTC”), 33 affordable (LIHTC),
and 14 market-rate units. Of the 65 units set aside for public housing residents, there will be 5
one bedroom, 7 two bedroom, 45 three bedroom, and 8 four bedroom units.
This phase will be located in an area generally bounded by South Campbell Street to the east,
West Van Buren Street to the south, South Maplewood Avenue to the west, and West Adams
Street to the north, with the new proposed park located at the northwest corner of South
Maplewood Avenue and West Jackson Boulevard. The West End redevelopment was designed
to reincorporate smaller, pedestrian-friendly street blocks and architecture compatible with that
of the surrounding neighborhood. As part of the redevelopment, new streets, alleys, and
utilities will be constructed by the Chicago Department of Transportation to support the new
housing development. The building features in Phase II continue this objective by
complementing what was constructed in Phase I.
This Phase will contain a total of twenty-two 3-flats, 4-flats, 6-flats, and 10-flat structures
offered through seven different building types. The buildings will be constructed of brick
masonry with full brick exteriors on all sides. The building types and unit types will be mixed
throughout each block, with a solid mix of ACC, affordable, and market rental units in each
block, in efforts to create a strong, mixed income rental community. Each building type and
unit will be constructed with the same quality and materials so that each unit will be
indistinguishable between income levels.
Financing:
The total development budget for West End Phase II Rental will be approximately $39,248,910
and is expected to be funded by the approximate following sources of permanent financing:
(1) $1,369,979 First Mortgage: The Private Bank plans to provide the permanent first
mortgage loan in the approximate amount of $1,369,979 with a fixed interest rate projected
to be 30 day LIBOR plus 350 basis points. It will be forward locked for a term of 24 months
at the time of closing. The loan will have a 15 year term and a 30-year amortization period.
(2) $14,372,002 CHA HOPE VI Loan: CHA will loan approximately $14,372,002 of HOPE
VI, General and/or other funds to the project for a term of approximately 40 years plus the
construction period, bearing interest at a rate of zero percent or at a rate to be determined.

 (3) $6,212,783 CHA CFRC Loan: Of the total $7,337,783 Capital Fund Recovery Competition

$6,212,783 will be loaned to the project with a term of approximately 40 years plus the
construction period, bearing an interest rate of zero per cent or a rate to be determined. The
remaining $1,125,000 CFRC funds will be provided in the form of a CHA bridge loan. The
City of Chicago will provide a Tax Increment Financing (“TIF”) Note, collateralized by
future increment generated from the designated Midwest Redevelopment Area in which this
entire development is located.
(4) $1,125,000 TIF Loan: $1,125,000 loan collateralized by future TIF increment from the
Midwest Redevelopment Area. CHA plans to use the CFRC funds in the amount of
$1,125,000 as a bridge loan for the TIF Note to be issued by the City of Chicago. The bridge
loan will be repaid to CHA by the City of Chicago with annual tax increment payments until
fully repaid.
(5) $16,169,146 LIHTC Tax Credit Equity: The LIHTC tax credit investor, created by Alliant
Capital, Ltd., will provide equity in the approximate amount of $16,169,146. Equity will be
generated by the syndication of approximately $2,215,173 FY2010 LIHTCs from the
following two sources: a) $715,173 - City of Chicago Department of Community
Development (“DCD”); b) $1,500,000 - Illinois Housing Development Authority (“IHDA”).
The equity amount is based on a purchase price of $0.73 per dollar for the ten year allocation.
Additional project sources include approximately $6,293,243 in HOPE VI funds for demolition
costs, acquisition, Receiver administrative fees and other project costs plus Capital funds in the
amount of $1,500,000 for remediation costs. An amount of $721,786 in HOPE VI funds has
been disbursed to date to the Developer for eligible predevelopment costs in accordance with the
predevelopment loan in the total amount of up to $965,998. The predevelopment loan will be
repaid from equity at closing.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the Chicago Housing Authority to: 1) Submit a
Mixed-Finance Proposal, Evidentiaries, and Disposition Application to the United States
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD); 2) Commit HOPE VI permanent loan
