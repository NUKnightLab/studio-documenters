COMPREHENSIVE GUN CONTROL
WHEREAS, according to national statistics, every year in our country, a firearm is used in nearly 500,000
crimes, resulting in the deaths and injuries of more than 110,000 people; and
WHEREAS, according to statistics from USA Today, between 2006 and 2017 there were mass shootings
approximately every 16 days in the United States, with the most recent incident in Parkland Florida sparking
a renewed and broad sweeping national conversation on the need for common-sense gun solutions to keep
our citizens safe while protecting the 2nd Amendment; and
WHEREAS, in Chicago and Cook County, particularly minority communities that often have the greatest
economic needs, gun violence is a traumatic and daily occurrence that has reached a crisis point, prevents
economic growth and leads to increased incarceration and the perpetuation of the cycle of violence; and
WHEREAS, according to statistics in 2017, there were 743 homicides as a result of gun violence in
Chicago and Cook County; and
WHEREAS, gun violence has taken a massive toll on Cook County, taking the lives of countless men and
women, many young, leaving physical, psychology, emotional scars for the victims and their families that
survive, and producing untreated and pervasive trauma in communities, individuals and children; and
WHEREAS, the effects and costs of gun violence can be seen throughout the county in our criminal justice
system, included but not limited to the offices of the Sheriff, State’s Attorney, and Public Defenders, the
hospital system, and Medical Examiner’s Office; and
WHEREAS, the time is now for comprehensive gun control laws. It is time for our federal and state
representatives to take a stand on this crisis; and
WHEREAS, Cook County echoes President Donald Trump’s call for strengthened background checks, the
ban of bump stocks and raising the age from 18 to 21 for the purchase of assault-style weapons; and
WHEREAS, Cook County calls upon its residents to reach out to their elected officials to urge the passage
of a variety of common-sense gun control policies in Springfield, including but not limited to requiring gun
dealers to be licensed, strengthened background checks, and banning the use of military-style weapons,
high capacity magazines and the civilian sale of body armor.

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, a step toward more comprehensive gun safety laws is a step
in the right direction because every gun death, is one too many; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Cook County President and the Cook County Board Commissioners
call upon Washington D.C. and the State of Illinois to pass comprehensive gun control laws immediately
to protect all residents of our country.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
URGING THE STATE OF ILLINOIS TO ENACT OPIOID PRESCRIPTION LIMITS
WHEREAS, the opioid epidemic in our country has risen to extreme levels, causing the deaths of tens of
thousands of Americans, and billions of dollars in economic costs; and
WHEREAS, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in 2016 116 people died
every day from opioid-related drug overdoses; and
WHEREAS, 42,249 people died from overdosing on opioids in that year alone; and
WHEREAS, of those deaths, 17,087 were the result of overdosing on commonly prescribed opioids; and
WHEREAS, the cost of these drugs totaled $504 billion in 2016; and
WHEREAS, most recently, the state of Florida passed a bill to combat this crisis by instituting prescription
limits on opioids and increasing funding for treatment; and
WHEREAS, Florida will be the 25th state since 2016 that has passed legislation that imposes some limits
or guidelines on opioid prescriptions, and only the 3rd to create statutory limits of three or four days for
Schedule II painkillers like OxyContin and Fentanyl; and
WHEREAS, Illinois is not one of the states with any of these imposed limits, and as a result the opioid
epidemic remains relatively unchecked; and
WHEREAS, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) now supports policies
limiting the supply of opioids for acute pain treatment; and
WHEREAS, PhRMA has concluded that too often, individuals receive a 30-day supply of opioid medicines
for minor treatments or short-term pain, and that overprescribing and dispensing can lead to patients taking
opioids longer than necessary or to excess pills falling into the wrong hands; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the members of this board, as public servants to the
residents of Cook County, urge the Illinois General assembly to pass comprehensive legislation to limit
prescriptions to these opioids to five days in order to combat the crisis currently affecting our communities
and state as a whole.
