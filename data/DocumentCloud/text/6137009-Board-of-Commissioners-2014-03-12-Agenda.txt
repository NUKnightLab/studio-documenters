l. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure
proper review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under
Amended Class 6a.
(7)(8) Class 6b. Real estate used primarily for industrial purposes, consisting of all newly
constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or
abandoned property, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and
other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to
their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the
rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land
eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the
rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or
Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has
determined that the incentive provided by Class 6b is necessary for development to occur on
that specific real estate and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be,
supports and consents to the Class 6b application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the
Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility
application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an
assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not
filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a
letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution
or Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested.

b.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from the
affected districts.

c.

Class 6b applications for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and other
structures must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of such
new construction or substantial rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 6b incentive. With
respect to abandoned property, the Class 6b application must be made to the Assessor prior
to the commencement of the reoccupation of the vacant and unused property.

d.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine
that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purpose of Class 6b, unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not
been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or

Page 9 of 66

BOARD AGENDA

March 12, 2014

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been
vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall
be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b
application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the
County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned"
for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The
applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special
circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution
to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special
circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution
validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b
need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor,
but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to
request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b
eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance
regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the
instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that
special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of
a Class 6b under the TEERM Program if there has been no purchase for value and the
buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least 12 continuous
months. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting
to the Class 6b application under the TEERM Program. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that
of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that
the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to
that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance
with the required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to
the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and
provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution
finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or
Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes
of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor,
but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to
request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b
application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the

County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special
circumstances has been requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program: In the instance where real estate does not
meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County
Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding that
the property is deemed "qualified" for purpose of Class 6b under the SER Program if:
1.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same location for a
minimum of ten years prior to the date of application for the SER Program;

2.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of hardship
supporting a determination that participation in the SER Program is necessary for the
industrial enterprise to continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff,
and that without such designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically
viable causing the property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused; and

3.

The applicant is not receiving another Cook County property tax incentive for the same
property.

The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, and a determination that the applicant's participation in the SER Program is
necessary for the industrial enterprise to continue operations at its current location and
maintain its staff, and that without such designation the industrial enterprise would not be
economically viable causing the property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and
unused, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the
Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of
the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"qualified" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained.
The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of
special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners
of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the
property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to
that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances
exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a
finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at
the time of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the
Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to
Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the applicant
shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be,
confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been
requested.

Applications for the TEERM Program or SER Program under a Class 6b application must be

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Class 6b
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the property and the number
of persons employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports, recipients shall be required to
certify whether the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER
application continues its operations at that location. In addition, recipients of Class 6b
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program shall be required to report to the Assessor
within 30 days if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER
application ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports will be forwarded by
the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the
County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within the time
established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating
to the nonfiling. Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the
time of the SER application ceases operations at that location, then the Class 6b incentive
granted pursuant to the SER program shall terminate.
e.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed
and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial
reoccupancy, or in the case of incentives granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, from the
date of the notice of approval. In the case of incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program,
this classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date of the notice of
approval, or until the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER
application ceases operations at that location if that occurs sooner.

f.

Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program, this
incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten percent
assessment level pursuant to section 74-64(7), if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of intent to request renewal of the incentive
from the municipality or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial
use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and
consents to renewal of the Class 6b; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the
Assessor's Office before the expiration of the ten-percent assessment level period.

g.

Class 6b incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER Program are
not renewable. For all other Class 6b incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited
as long as the property continues to apply and meet the requirements for Class 6b.

h.

A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office
to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from
the affected districts.

i.

If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant

the applicable classification under this division.

j.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class
6b.

k.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class
6b recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class
6b site. A copy of such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of
the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected
districts. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall
result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(8)(9) Class C. Real estate which is to be used for industrial or commercial purposes, including
abandoned property, as defined in Section 74-62, including the land upon which such property is
situated; or vacant land; where such real estate because of contamination has undergone
environmental testing and remediation and has received a "No Further Remediation Letter" from
the site remediation program.
a.

To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No Further
Remediation Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation objectives based on the
industrial or commercial use.

b.

The owner of the property is rendered ineligible for the Class C classification by having
previously owned or operated the site, directly or indirectly, or having been a partner or
being associated through a family or business relationship with anyone who has owned or
operated the site, which ownership or operation caused the contamination which was
remediated pursuant to a site remediation. A present owner who can successfully
demonstrate that the owner was not responsible for the contamination may be eligible for
Class C classification.

c.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an ordinance or
resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has

Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of the County
Board from the affected districts.
d.

To qualify for the Class C classification, an application for Class C classification must be
made within one year of the receipt of the "No Further Remediation Letter." Where an
application for Class C classification encompasses less than all of the contiguous property
owned by the applicant upon which remediation has been completed, the one year limitation
will be waived for any subsequent separate application for Class C classification for the
remainder or for additional portions of the property, provided that such subsequent
application is made within seven years.

e.

Additionally, to qualify for the Class C classification, the estimated remediation costs,
including site investigation, testing, oversight, remediation and removal costs, monitoring,
and engineering and legal fees associated with the remediation process, must total at least
$100,000.00, or alternatively, must total at least 25 percent of the market value of the real
estate as determined by the Assessor's property record card in the year prior to the
remediation, whichever is less.

f.

The initial Class C classification shall continue for a period of 12 years for both industrial
and commercial property. For industrial property, this incentive may be renewed during the
last year a property is entitled to a 16 percent assessment level, if the following requirements
are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of
the incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in
an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use
of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and
consents to renewal of the Class C; and

3.

A copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office
of the Assessor before the expiration of the 16 percent assessment level period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to
apply and qualify for Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment on
or before the adoption date of the ordinance from which this division is derived
will be eligible for this renewal term at the end of their original incentive period
subject to the above requirements. The notice of intent to request renewal which is

filed with the Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the
effected districts.
g.

If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class C treatment, but the assessment level
is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive
a 16 percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and
approval of the resolution and renewal application. However, if, as of that effective date, the
taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the
incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level based on
renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be
phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After such ten-year period
expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable
classification under this division.

h.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the
commercial Class C incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to
renewal and the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.

i.

The Assessor shall review the application and supporting documentation to determine
eligibility for the Class C classification. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the
foregoing necessary to ensure proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and
continued eligibility for the benefits provided under the Class C classification.

j.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class
C recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class C
site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established by
the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(9)(10) Class 7a. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, comprising a qualified
commercial development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in an area
in need of commercial development, where total development costs, exclusive of land, do not
exceed $2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including
the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, as defined in this division,
including the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures
which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value,
including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds
vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the
incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the
total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine
that special circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of
Class 7a. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special

circumstances, shall be included in the resolution or ordinance supporting and consenting to
the Class 7a application. Not withstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not be
determined to justify finding that a property is deemed "abandoned" where:
A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not
been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or
B.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been
vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

Such resolution or ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the ordinance or
resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate
such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a and a
resolution to that effect shall be included with the Class 7a eligibility application filed with
the Assessor.
b.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed
and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial
reoccupancy. After such 12-year period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable
classification under this division.

c.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class
7a recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 7a
site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established by
the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(10)(11) Class 7b. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, as defined in this division,
comprising a qualified commercial development project, as determined pursuant to Section
74-65(a), located in an "area in need of commercial development", where total development
costs, exclusive of land, exceed $2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or
other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, as
defined herein, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other
structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their
value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation
adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for
the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to
the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine
that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 7b. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the
special circumstances, shall be included in the resolution or ordinance supporting and
consenting to the Class 7b application. Not withstanding the foregoing, special

Page 16 of 66

BOARD AGENDA

March 12, 2014

circumstances may not be determined to justify finding that a property is deemed
"abandoned" where:
A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not
been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or
B.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been
vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

Such resolution or ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the ordinance or
resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate
such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b and a
resolution to that effect shall be included with the Class 7b eligibility application filed with
the Assessor.
b.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed
and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial
reoccupancy.

c.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class
7b recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class
7b site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established
by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the
nonfiling.

(11)(12) Class 8. Real estate used primarily for industrial and commercial purposes, consisting of all
newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated;
or abandoned property, as defined in this division, including the land upon which such property is
situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent
such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation.
a.

Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the
improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as
the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the
improvements on the parcel. Such real estate must be either obtained through the Cook
County Tax Reactivation Project or must be located in one of the following designated
geographical areas:
1.

An area which has been certified as in need of substantial revitalization in accordance
with the provisions of Section 74-65(b);

2.

An enterprise community as proposed and approved by the County Board on June 22,
1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, and the municipality in which such
real estate is located, or, if in an unincorporated area, the County must by lawful

Resolution determine that such real estate is consistent with an overall plan for the
rehabilitation of the area; or
3.

b.

Any one of the following five townships: Bloom; Bremen; Calumet; Rich; and
Thornton.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine
that special circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of
Class 8, unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not
been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been
vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall
be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 8
application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the
County Board is required to validate such, a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned"
for purposes of Class 8, and a Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must
obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances
and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior
to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A
certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well
as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 need not be filed at the time of filing
the Class 8 application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than
the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 8. If the Resolution
is not filed at the time of the Class 8 application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time,
a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution
or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the
instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that
special circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 8
under the TEERM Program, if there has been no purchase for value and the buildings and
other structures have been vacant and unused for at least 12 continuous months. The finding
of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included
in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 8 application. If the
Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is
required to validate such, a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of

such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its
determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A
certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well
as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 need not be filed at the time of filing
the Class 8 application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of
the incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in
an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the

BOARD AGENDA

March 12, 2014

The Assessor determines that all application qualifications, except the major
rehabilitation or new construction requirement, were maintained during the incentive
period.

When the Class 9 classification is due to expire or is terminated by action of the owner or the
Assessor, the property owner shall, in a manner and form determined by the Assessor, notify
all Class 9 tenants of the date of the termination of Class 9 classification. Once the Class 9
classification is terminated, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under
this division.

(13)(14) Class S. Real estate otherwise entitled to Class 3 classification under this division, consisting
of land and existing buildings and structures, which is has been subject to a Section 8 contract
renewal. The portion of the land and building eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion
as the number of Section 8 units bears to the total number of units. The proportion shall be applied
only to property used for residential purposes, and not to portions of the property, if any, used for
commercial purposes.
a.

Property qualifies for the Class S classification if its Section 8 contract has been renewed
pursuant to one of the following alternatives:
1.

HUD has approved renewal of the Section 8 contract under the mark up to market
option, after finding that:
i.

The property has received a physical inspection score of at least 60, in an
inspection by HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center, confirming that the property
is decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair with no uncorrected exigent health and
safety (EHS) violations;

ii.

The property does not have a low- and moderate-income use restriction that cannot
be eliminated by unilateral action by the owner. If, however, the current rent is
lower than the use restriction, HUD may use the mark up to market option to
increase the rents to the use restriction level, which would be a renewal qualifying
for the S classification; and

iii. A rent comparability study conducted by HUD has demonstrated that comparable
market rents are above 100 percent of the HUD Fair Market Rent.
2.

HUD has approved a contract renewal for five years of the Section 8 contract under the
mark up to market under HUD's discretionary authority, after finding that the property
meets at least one of the required criteria:
i.

A vulnerable population is affected,

ii.

There is a low vacancy rate in the area, which would make tenant based assistance
difficult to use, or a lack of comparable housing, or

Page 22 of 66

March 12, 2014

iii. The project is a high priority for the local community, as demonstrated by a
contribution of state or local funds to the property.
3.

b.

HUD has approved renewal of a Section 8 contract for a not for profit corporation under
any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8
Renewal Policy Guidelines.

Additional requirements for qualification for the S classification are:
1.

At least 20 percent of the living units must be Section 8 units for qualifying low and
moderate-income persons.

2.

The owner must agree to retain at least the existing number of Section 8 units for at least
five years after the expiration of the expiring or expired Section 8 contract.

3.

For the duration of the Class S classification period, applicant must file annually with
the Assessor, on or before a date determined by the Assessor, a sworn statement
verifying continuous compliance with the Class S provisions of this division.

4.

Applicant must agree to notify the Assessor's Office if the Section 8 contract is
terminated prior to its expiration date. Applicant shall provide to the Assessor's office a
copy of any notice of default or notice of abatement received from HUD.

c.

When the applicant applies to HUD for a contract renewal, no less than 120 days prior to the
expiration of the contract, the applicant shall notify the Assessor's Office of the application,
on a form provided by that office. Upon receiving approval of the contract renewal from
HUD, the applicant shall file an application for the incentive with the Assessor's Office, on a
form provided by that office. The application shall be supported by a copy of HUD's letter
approving the contract renewal and a copy of the executed renewal contract.

d.

Any property which, as of November 23, 1999, has an existing Section 8 contract with a
mark up to market option may apply for Class S classification for the any portion of the 2001
assessment year encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract
term, including any renewals approved with the mark up to market option. The classification
shall continue until the expiration or termination of the Section 8 contract.
Any property which, as of (DATE AMENDMENT APPROVED), has an existing Section 8
contract renewal may apply for Class S classification for any portion of the 2006 assessment
year encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term,
including any renewals approved with the mark up to market option, mark up to market
option under HUD's discretionary authority or a Section 8 contract that has been renewed by
a not-for-profit corporation under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as
described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines. The classification shall continue
until the expiration or termination of the Section 8 contract.

e.

The incentive may be renewed if the Section 8 contract is again renewed under any of the
following three options: 1) the mark up to market option; 2) the mark up to market option
under HUD's discretionary authority; or 3) by a not-for-profit corporation under any
available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal
Policy Guidelines. Upon filing an application with HUD, no less than 120 days prior to
termination of the contract, for renewal of the Section 8 contract, the taxpayer shall provide
notice to the Assessor's Office of its application for renewal. The taxpayer shall provide a
copy to the Assessor's Office of HUD's approval of the contract renewal, or notification of
other action.

f.

The Assessor's Office shall adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure
proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the
benefits provided under Class S.

(14)(15) Class L. Real estate which is to be used for commercial or industrial purposes and which is
designated as Class 3, Class 4, Class 5a or Class 5b pursuant to this division; is a landmark or
contributing building; and has undergone substantial rehabilitation. The substantial rehabilitation
must constitute an investment by the owner of at least 50 percent of the building's full market
value as determined by the Assessor in the assessment year prior to the commencement of the
substantial rehabilitation.
a.

Generally, the incentive shall apply only to the building and will not apply to the land
underneath the building. However, if the entire building has been vacant and unused for at
least 24 continuous months prior to the filing of the eligibility application with the Assessor,
the land upon which the building is situated shall also be eligible for the incentive.

b.

Prior to filing a Class L eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain an
ordinance or resolution from the unit of local government in which the real estate is located,
which expressly states that the local government:

c.

1.

Has determined that the incentive provided by Class L is necessary for the substantial
rehabilitation of the property;

2.

Supports and consents to the granting of the incentive; and

3.

Has reviewed and accepted its preservation commission's written recommendation of
the project for the Class L incentive. This recommendation will specify the project's
budget and proposed scope of work and will specify that the project will meets or
exceeds the Standards of the United States Department of the Interior for
Rehabilitation, Preservation, Restoration, and Reconstruction of historic properties.

A certified copy of the ordinance or resolution need not be filed with the Assessor at the time
the Class L eligibility application is filed but the ordinance or resolution must be filed with
the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to
Class L.

A copy of the resolution or letter confirming that a resolution has been requested, whichever
is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of
the Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts.

f.

Additionally, to qualify a landmark building or contributing building for Class L
classification, an eligibility application must be made to the Assessor within one year prior
to the commencement of substantial rehabilitation. After the substantial rehabilitation has
been completed, the preservation commission shall review the project to determine that it is
eligible under Subsection (14) of this section. The applicant must supplement the eligibility
application with a copy of the determination of the preservation commission prior to
classification of the real estate as Class L.

g.

The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such
substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.

h.

For property which was initially classified as Class 3, 4 or 5b, this incentive may be renewed
during the last year a property is entitled to a 16 percent assessment level, if the following
requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of
the incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in
an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use
of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and
consents to renewal of the Class L; and

3.

A copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office
of the Assessor before the expiration of the incentive period.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and
qualify for Class L. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's
Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for
distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts.

i.

If, as of November 23,1999, a property is receiving Class L treatment, but the assessment
level is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and
receive a 16 percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and
approval of the resolution and renewal application. However, if as of the effective date, the
taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the
incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level based on
renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be
phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After expiration of the last
incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this
division.

j.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the
commercial Class L incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to
renewal and the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.

k.

The Assessor shall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits
provided under Class L.

l.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class
L recipients as to the continued landmark status of the property and the number of persons

Sec. 74-65. Qualifications for commercial development project status.
(a) To qualify as a commercial development project under Class 7a or 7b, it is necessary that the project be
located in an area in need of commercial development in that:
(1) The area is, or has been within the last ten years, designated by Federal, State or local agency as a
conservation, blighted or renewal area or an area encompassing a rehabilitation or redevelopment
plan or project adopted under the Illinois Urban Renewal Consolidation Act of 1961, as amended,
or the Commercial Renewal Re-development Areas Act of 1967, as amended, or that the area is
located in a Federal Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by
the County Board on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, or the
Commercial District Development Commission Ordinance of the City of Chicago or designation
of like effect adopted under any similar statute or ordinance;
(2) Real estate taxes within the area, during the last six years, have declined, remained stagnant or
potential real estate taxes are not being fully realized due to the depressed condition of the area;
(3) There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation of the
commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably timely basis if

Page 27 of 66

 Cook County Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

March 12, 2014

granted Class 7a or 7b designation and will therefore result in the economic enhancement of the
area;
(4) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation will
materially assist development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of the area and the commercial
development project would not go forward without the full incentive offered under Class 7a or 7b;
and
(5) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation is reasonably
expected to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and employment
opportunities within the area.
(b) Prior to filing a Class 7a or 7b eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain from
the municipality in which the real estate is located, or the County Board if the real estate is located in
an unincorporated area, an ordinance or resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County
Board, as the case may be, has determined that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this
section are present and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and
consents to the Class 7a or 7b application to the Assessor. A certified copy of such ordinance or
resolution shall be included with the Class 7a or 7b application at the time of filing the application with
the Assessor. A copy of the ordinance or resolution, whichever is submitted, will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of the County Board
from the affected districts. The application shall include any other information deemed necessary by
the Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the commercial development project qualifies for
the Class 7a or 7b classification and shall bear the expense of doing so.
(c) Inasmuch as the County desires to encourage economic development in the neighborhoods of the
County, support the increased use of the incentive by smaller projects and to limit the expense of such
applications, the Assessor shall liberally construe the requirements of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of
this section for Class 7a applications.
(d) The Assessor shall adopt rules, including a provision to ensure a proper review of the application and
supporting data.
(e) Certification of a commercial development project shall not be denied by reason of insufficient size if
it otherwise qualifies hereunder. In determining what constitutes the "full incentive offered" as
provided in Subsection (a)(4) of this section, consideration may be given to any lawful
intergovernmental participation agreements under which the project developer has agreed, as a
precondition to Class 7a or 7b certification, to share a portion of future profits with the appropriate
taxing districts.
(f) For Class 7a applications, where the Assessor finds that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of
this section exist, the Assessor shall, within 60 days after receipt of the application and necessary
supporting data, certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7a treatment under this
division.

BOARD AGENDA

March 12, 2014

(g) In order to determine Class 7b applications, upon receipt of the application and all the necessary
supporting data, the Assessor shall forward it to the Economic Development Advisory Committee of
the County. The Committee shall within 30 days return the application to the Assessor with a finding
stating whether the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this section are present. The Assessor
shall review the application, supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate facts.
Where the Assessor finds the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this section exist, the
Assessor shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the Committee's findings, certify the commercial
development project eligible for Class 7b treatment under this division.
(h) Class 7a and 7b certifications shall lapse within one year from the date of issuance unless new
construction or substantial rehabilitation, or in the case of abandoned property, reoccupation of the
commercial development project has commenced prior to its expiration.
(i)

To be certified as an area in need of substantial revitalization for purposes of Class 8 classification it is
necessary that:
(1) The municipality in which the area is located or, if an unincorporated area, the County determine
by lawful resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and that it is not
economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish the necessary modernization,
rehabilitation, and development of the area without public assistance and encouragement, or a
determination of similar import;
(2) The municipality or, if in an unincorporated area, the County apply to the Assessor for
certification of the area as one in need of substantial revitalization;
(3) Upon receiving an application to certify an area as in need of substantial revitalization, the
Assessor shall review the application, supporting data and other appropriate factors relevant to a
determination of the severity of the economic conditions of the area. In determining whether the
"in need of substantial revitalization" requirement is met, the Assessor shall give strong
consideration and substantial weight to the fact that an area is located in a Federal empowerment
zone or enterprise community, as proposed and approved by the County Board on June 22, 1994,
or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994.

(j)

Upon finding that existing factors convincingly demonstrate that the area is in need of substantial
revitalization, as defined in this division, the Assessor shall grant such certification to the area. In
making this determination statistical data relevant to the surrounding area as well as the specific area
for which certification is sought may be considered. The surrounding area for the City of Chicago shall
be the community area as defined in this division; for all other areas in the County it shall be, where
applicable, the municipality in which the area is located.

(k) If a municipality within an Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the County Board on
June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, determines by municipal resolution that
the area is in a state of economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for private
enterprise to accomplish the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area
without public assistance and encouragement, or a determination of similar import and submits a

request for Class 8 certification, such certification shall be automatic pursuant to this division.
However, each property eligible for a Class 8 incentive within the certified area must file an
application in a timely manner.
(l)

Any Class 6a incentive that is still active can be renewed. The Class 6a incentive is defined in this
division. The renewal procedures described in Section 74-63 apply to Class 6a as well.

Sec. 74-66. Property in two or more classes.

and conditions of this division after January 1, 1995, shall be entitled to receive such classification
under such terms and conditions.
(b) Real estate granted a Class 6a, Class 6b, Class 6c, Class 7a, Class 7b or Class 8 classification on or
before December 31, 1999, shall retain such classification under the terms and conditions of this

Fiscal Impact:

$32,320.00

Accounts: 9000 - Provident Medical Center
Contract Number(s): OMP-10-45-2530
Summary: Provident Hospital had 2-Underground Storage Tanks (UST), one (1)-5,000 and one
(1)-15,000 gallon tank, both installed in 1993; the tanks are used to store fuel for the Hospital’s
emergency generators.
The City of Chicago, Bureau of Fire Protection issued notice in September 2008 to comply with the State
of Illinois rules for abandon and removal of the 5,000 gallon UST after an initial test conducted by
Provident Hospital (July 2008) failed the tank tightness test.
Cook County entered into contract with Clean World Engineering (CWE), LTD., for engineering
services, for removal and replacement of one (1) 5,000 gallon UST. Subsequently the Chicago Fire
Department followed up with the hospital in 2010 and restricted the usage of the second tank (15,000
gallon) due to corroded piping and possible contamination. After receiving the notification, the County
expanded the scope of work to include the 15,000 gallon UST to be removed and replaced.
This additional professional services scope resulted in an increase of $32,320.00 to the project.

Summary: Transmitted herewith is a request for the approval to accept a U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD) grant of Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery
(CDBG-DR) funds in response to disasters occurring in 2013, authorized under the Disaster Relief

been affected by a natural disaster (in this case, severe storms and flooding during the period of
4/16/2013 to 5/5/2013). The program will provide necessary expenses related to disaster relief, long-term
recovery, restoration of infrastructure and housing, and economic revitalization in the most impacted and
distressed areas resulting from a major disaster declared pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster
Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1974 (Stafford Act). Cook County has been allocated $13.9
million. The Cook County Department of Planning and Development met with or consulted studies done
by the Cook County Departments of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, Environmental
Control, and Transportation and Highways, the Cook County Forest Preserve District, the Illinois and
Federal Emergency Management Agencies (IEMA and FEMA, respectively), the Metropolitan Water
Reclamation District, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as well as municipal and township leaders to
discuss areas that were most affected by the 2013 disaster and important projects that need to be done.
The Department of Planning and Development desires to fund projects that strategically assist with the
recovery efforts and support other investments which are occurring in the area. The proposed budget line
items are outlined in the Action Plan, which will be posted for public comment upon Board approval of
this request.
Cook County plans to enter into CDBG-DR agreements with municipalities, townships, for-profit and
non-profit entities to implement CDBG-DR activities or to directly implement activities.
I respectfully request approval to accept this grant award and that the Chief of the Bureau of Economic
Development or his designee, is authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all
documents necessary to facilitate administration of the program approved here in, including but not
limited to the CDBG-DR grant agreement and any modifications thereto. The approval of this of the
