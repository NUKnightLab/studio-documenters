Proposed Transfers of Funds (Attachment #6)

Mr. Elwell provided an overview of the proposed Transfers of Funds.
Director Reiter, seconded by Director Thomas, moved the approval of the proposed
Transfers of Funds. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

D.

Proposed grant award from CCHHS to the Cook County Health Foundation in the amount of
$200,000.00 for Fiscal Year 2018 (Attachment #7)

Mr. Elwell provided an overview of the proposed matter. He stated that this is part of a longer-term strategy to be
able to develop charitable outlets and opportunities to increase CCHHS’ ability to do what is needed for its patients.
CCHHS provided the Foundation with some original seed money for operating expenses three (3) years ago, and,
with this request, is preparing to again help with their operating costs so they can continue working to develop longterm philanthropic opportunities. Their fundraising concept to date is that 100% of the proceeds go to CCHHS;
however, this concept does not include operating expenses for the Foundation. They do not currently have full-time
staff, but plan to eventually hire an executive director. Mr. Elwell estimates that the Foundation may need perhaps
one (1) more year of funding from CCHHS for operating expenses until they are able to budget those and function
on their own.
Dr. Shannon reminded the Board that the Foundation’s annual gala will be held on June 27th; their aspirational goal
for fundraising for that event is $300,000.
Director Driscoll, seconded by Director Thomas, moved the approval of the grant award
from CCHHS to the Cook County Health Foundation in the amount of $200,000.00 for
Fiscal Year 2018. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

VII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (Attachment #9)
Dr. Shannon provided an update on several subjects; detail is included in Attachment #9.
Dr. Shannon commented on a report from the Cook County Office of the Independent Inspector General (OIIG) that
was recently issued; this report characterized opportunities in which the organization might be able to improve in
collection of fees for services that have been provided. This report was published on March 22nd; the administration
is currently working on a response to that report. Director Richardson-Lowry noted that she found the report to be
observational and directional; she added that it will be useful if the administration can provide to the Board a timeline
and action steps that will be involved.

JOHN JAY SHANNON, MD

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

COOK COUNTY HEALTH HOSPITALS SYSTEM
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

March 29, 2018

Employee Recognition

The Trauma team was notified this week of a one year Victims of Crime grant award through the Illinois
Criminal Justice Information Authority to expand its youth violence prevention and outreach program. This
grant will allow for the expansion of the Healing Hurt People Chicago program (HHP-C) to include older
patients ages 19-late 205 and is renewable for two additional years. Youth injured by violence are among those
most at risk for future violence and injury. Healing Hurt People?Chicago was established in 2013 as a
partnership between Stroger Hospital, the University of Chicago Comer Children?s Hospital and Center for
Nonviolence and Social Justice at Drexel University in Philadelphia to provide violently-injured youth support
and address the trauma that can drive the cycle of violence. HHP-C trauma intervention
specialists provide and support services to injured youth and their families, including
assessing safety and other basic needs to reduce high?risk behaviors, help patients stay safe and create futures
for themselves.

HHP-C makes a positive impact on patients: increasing their safety, providing opportunities for support and peer
learning, helping them to enroll in or stay in school, find jobs, navigate medical systems, and linking them to
social services and trauma-specific mental health services. For participants who received HHP-C services for at
least six months, 84% experienced decreases in PTSD 89% exhibited increased self-efficacy, 80%
engaged in less aggressive behavior, and only 8% of youth were reinjured, none seriously.

social workers Reverend Carol Reese and Andy Wheeler are the driving forces behind the success of this
program at Stroger Hospital.

John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital has again been re-designated as a Level hospital for perinatal care, which means
it provides the highest level of care to pregnant women and their newborns. Stroger was also once again
designated as an Administrative Perinatal Center, meaning that it is qualified to assist other community
hospitals in treating high?risk individuals. We?d like to acknowledge the people who made both of these
recognitions possible: Dr. Edward Linn, Chair of Obstetrics and Gynecology; TaShunda Green?Shelton, Director
of Maternal-Child Health; Omar La Blanc, Perinatal Administrator; Andrea Cross, Perinatal Network
Administrator; Dr. Mopelola Akintorin, Division Chief of Neonatology and Interim Chair of the Department of
Pediatrics; and Dr. Heather Stanley-Christian, Co-Director of the Perinatal Center.

Every year in honor of Doctor?s Day, votes for a "Doctor of the Year? - a physician who exemplifies the
dedication and commitment to mission and provides high quality compassionate care to our patients.
The recipient of this year?s Doctor of the Year is Dr. Courtney Hollowell, Chair of the Division Urology Surgery.
Dr. Hollowell has published numerous articles in peer-reviewed journals and is nationally recognized as an
expert in urologic oncology (Prostate, Kidney, Bladder, Penile and Testicular Cancer), genitourinary
trauma/reconstructive surgery and men?s health issues.

 

Activities and Announcements

0 As of February 17, 2018, the Illinois Department of Public Health has reported more than 6,000 confirmed cases
of influenza throughout the state. While activity appears to be on the decline locally and nationally, has
exceeded 600 cases which is nearly three times last year?s numbers. Routine screening of all patients and visitors
for influenza-like illness as well as visitor restrictions for individuals exhibiting of influenza and all
children under the age of 12 at Stroger and Provident Hospitals continue.

IMPACT 2020 Objective 1.2

In the aftermath of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, gun control
measures have once again come to the forefront of local and national policy conversations. Student survivors of
the shooting and their families have created a strong unified voice against school violence and easy access to
firearms, compelling concerned citizens across the country to take action alongside them.

The student activists coordinated March for Our Lives, a rally held on Saturday, March 24 in Washington DC, to
?demand that their lives and safety become a priority and that we end gun violence and mass shootings in our
schools today?. Approximately 800 sister events were held across the world on the same day. This movement
has proven to be unique in its reach and staying power, and could seemingly be the impetus for the first real
federal gun control legislation since the early 1990?s.

The impact of gun violence on patients, community and staff is all too real. As a provider of care and
steward of public health, is obliged to advocate for policies that uphold the health and safety of the
residents of Cook County. In 2017, Stroger Hospital cared for more than 1,100 patients with gunshot
wounds, more than 130 of whom were less than 18 years of age. Between February 14 and March 18, the weeks
following the tragedy in Parkland, Florida, 191 people havebeen shot in Chicago.

A contingent from Cook County traveled to Washington DC, joining a crowd of hundreds of thousands, to add a
local perspective to the national conversation about federal gun control. The delegation included: Toni
Preckwinkle, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners; Dr. Jay Shannon, Dr. Faran Bokhari, Chair,
Trauma Burn Surgery; Rev. Carol Reese, Violence Prevention Coordinator and Co-Director, Healing Hurt
People-Chicago Andy Wheeler, Patient and Family Support Services Coordinator; Dantrell Blake, Stroger
Hospital patient, gun violence survivor, HHP-C Peer Leader; Deshon Hannah, Stroger Hospital patient, gun
violence survivor, HHP-C Peer Leader.

 

 

In addition to participating in the march, the group visited Congresswoman Robin Kelly the trauma team
at George Washington University Hospital and spread our messages through multiple national and local media
interviews.

Despite Chicago and having some of the strictest gun laws in the United States, the region continues to
be the epicenter of this modern public health epidemic. The experience in Chicago and Illinois demonstrates
why state-by-state laws are not sufficient and why we need federal gun control laws. The Cook County Health 

and other measures- to combatrthemorta?lityand 
morbidity caused by firearms:

Banning high?capacity automatic/semiautomatic firearms, bump stocks and silencers

 

0 Strengthening permitting and universal background check requirements for all gun owners, including
mandatory training and a waiting period

0 Requiring anyone who sells a gun to have a dealer license
0 Requiring reporting of a lost or stolen gun within 48 hours

2 Page

 

0 Funding research on gun violence to develop public health interventions
0 Investing in trauma informed care services to support victims of gun violence in their recovery

will continue to call for strong federal gun control legislation to reduce gun violence and improve the
health of our communities.

2020 Focus Areas 6 and 7

Through March 22, 2018 Fresh Truck partnership with the Greater Chicago Food Depository (GCFD) has
resulted in 101 visits to 12 health centers Austin, Cicero, the CORE Center, Cottage Grove, Englewood,
Logan Square, Near South, Oak Forest, Prieto, Robbins, Woodlawn, and Provident/Sengstacke.

Collectively, the Fresh Truck distributions have resulted in the provision of fresh fruits and vegetables to 12,371
individuals, representing 41,025 household members. Most of the individuals benefiting from the Fresh Truck
screened positive for food insecurity at a health center visit. A total of 332,697 pounds of fresh produce
has been distributed at health centers through March 22, 2018. The move to a permanent Vista Health
Center location has delayed the staff training and start date for the Fresh Truck, which is now expected to take
place by the end of OZ of 2018.

IMPACT 2020 Objectives 6.2, 6.3, 7.4

The quarterly CountyCare Enrollee Advisory Committee (EAC) meeting took place at the Erie Evanston-Skokie
Health Center located in Evanston. The EAC meeting provides CountyCare Health Plan members with an
opportunity to have an open dialogue with staff on the plan and its benefits. Eleven CountyCare members and
three caretakers attended the meeting and spoke about their experiences with the plan. A third of the
attendees were male and the group represented multiple races and ethnicities.

From a programmatic point of view, most members were extremely happy with the plan and its offerings. One
member mentioned that she needed extra help with referrals and that she did not know about care
coordination. Care Coordination and access to referrals was a point to which most members expressed the
need for further education and help. One member who had brain surgery said that CountyCare was better than
the marketplace plans that she had previously. She was extremely grateful for everything that the plan did to
better her health. Her husband, who is not a legal resident, was referred to to talk about the Carelink
program. One former FHN member mentioned that CountyCare?s phone center staff is great and nicer to deal
with than the former plan?s staff. She is extremely happy with her new plan. One member kept asking about the
financial eligibility guidelines as he is worried of losing coverage should he exceed the financial threshold.

There was an in depth discussion on the new Incentives/Rewards program and the members were impressed
with the offerings and ready to start using them. At least half of them recalled receiving and reading the
recently mailed Rewards card. In addition, members mentioned that the CountyCare manual was also a good
way to explore healthcare options. This particular group likes the CountyCare website and they encouraged us
to incorporate a mobile platform. Members did not mention any issues with transportation to meetings as most
of them drive their own cars. One did mention parking costs at hospitals.

We received 64 surveys from individuals who received the invitation but did not attend. The results are very
similar to those from other EACs.

1) 94% would recommend the plan to others

2) 94% have made recent medical appointments

3) 91% have a PCP

4) 47% has called member services

5) 30% has visited the website

6) 31% identified food security as an issue

Earlier this month the Senate Public Health Committee passed legislation which closes the
current loophole in state administrative code that allows healthcare employees to decline an annual flu vaccine
when they have a "philosophical or moral reluctance?. The bill also codifies portions of the administrative code
concerning medical contraindication, religious belief, and already receiving the vaccination as reasons for
exemption. The bill has been placed on the Senate calendar for 2nd reading.

On March 12, 2018, the Governor signed legislation that redesigns the state?s hospital assessment program. A
bipartisan, bicameral legislative working group worked with the Illinois Hospital Association, the Illinois
Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS), and other stakeholders on hospital assessment redesign
language. The legislation includes language requested by and the University of Illinois Hospital and
Health Sciences System (UIHHSS) that would allow our institutions to directly receive Medicaid Graduate
Medical Education (GME) payments. HFS is currently working on the related state plan amendments for
approval by the federal Centers for Medicaid Services (CMS).

The House is in recess until April 9, 2018. The Senate is in recess until April 10, 2018. May 31, 2018 is the last
day of the Illinois General Assembly?s Regular Spring Session, after which a 3/5?1 majority is required in both
chambers to pass legislation (instead of a simple majority).

On Friday, March 23, 2018, the President signed HR 1625, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 into law
(PL. 115?141), averting a government shutdown and funding federal agencies through the rest of the federal
fiscal year (FFY). FFY2018 ends September 30, 2018. Negotiation of the Omnibus Appropriations Bill centered
on the following:

SIPage

 

 

 

ACA Stabilization: Bipartisan negotiations led by Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray (D-WA) to
authorize cost sharing reduction (CSR) payments, set up a federal reinsurance program and give states
additional flexibility under section 1332 waivers collapsed over adding abortion restrictions.

Gun Violence Research: The bill clarifies that the Dickey Amendment does not prohibit the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) from studying gun violence. US. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex
Azar had already told Congress that he supported gun violence research at the CDC.

Fix NICS Act: A bipartisan measure to improve reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background
Check System (NICS) database was included in the bill.

Funding to Combat Opioid Crisis: HHS is allocated $1 billion for state and tribal grants created under the 21St
Century Cures Act. About $500 million will go to CDC prevention and surveillance, and another $500 million will
go to the National Institutes of Health for research on opioid addiction and new non-addictive pain therapies.
$130 million is allocated to address opioid addiction in rural areas and $94 million is allocated to the Food and
Drug Administration for enforcement and interdiction.

CDC Funding: The CDC will receive $8.3 billion, $1 billion over FFY 2017, including a $45 million increase for
public health preparedness and $30 million for infectious diseases programs. The Prevention and Public Health
Fund is funded at $800 million, the same as in FFY 2017.

Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Funding: SAM HSA is funded at $5.2
billion, $1.4 billion over FFY 2017, with mental health programs receiving $306 million and substance use
prevention and treatment activities allocated $1.1 billion in new funding. Community Mental Health Services
Block Grants are allocated $701.5 million, $160 million over FFY 2017. Substance Abuse Prevention and
Treatment (SAPT) Block Grants are funded at $1.9 billion, the same as in FFY 2017.

House Opioid Hearing Prevention and Public Health Solutions: On March 21 22, 2018 the Health
Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee held hearings focused on prevention and public
health policy approaches to combatting the opioid addiction crisis. Leadership aims to bring a comprehensive
package of legislation to the House floor in May.

Senate Hearing on 3408: The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) held a
hearing on the 3408 program on March 15, 2018. The panel?s Republicans largely lined up with the
pharmaceutical industry, while the Democrats appeared more sympathetic to the hospitals. There seems to be
momentum building for legislation aimed at more transparency in the program.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for at both the State and Federal level.
