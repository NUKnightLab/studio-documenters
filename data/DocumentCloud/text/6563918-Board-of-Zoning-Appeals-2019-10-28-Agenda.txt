residence with attached 2 bay garage and rear balcony in an A1 One-Family Residential District. The
owner appeals for relief from the strict application of the following sections of the Cleveland Codified
Ordinances:

Planning Commission and on record in the office of the County Recorder shows a setback
building line along any frontage for the purpose of creating a front yard or side street yard
line, the building line thus shown shall apply along such frontage in place of any other yard
line specified in this chapter unless specific building lines shown on the Building Zone Map

 2. Section 341.02 which states that approval of Cleveland City Planning Department is required.
3. Note: it has been determined that in 1990 a prior owner of the subject property made a
request for variances similar in this case in Calendar Number 90-27 and the appeal was denied
by the Board. Pursuant to Rule XIII of the Rules and Regulations of the Board of Zoning
Appeals this appeal may be considered a “refiling”, which must be dismissed unless the
appellant can present evidence to justify the denial of the application of res judicata, including
substantially changed circumstances, substantial new relevant evidence that was not available
at the hearing on the prior appeal, or that the application of res judicata would create manifest
injustice. (Filed August 26, 2019-No Testimony). FIRST POSTPONEMENT MADE AT THE REQUEST OF
THE APPELLANT'S ATTORNEY DUE TO A SCHEDULING CONFLICT.
