1.
Status of Legislative Policy Division submitting report relative to Benchmark Comparison
of the City of Detroit's 2018 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) with Other
Cities. (The Legislative Policy Division (LPD) compared the City's fiscal year 2018
Government Wide Statement of Net Position (i.e., balance sheet) and Statement of
Activities for Governmental Activities (i.e., income statement) with other Cities
including: Flint, Michigan; Memphis, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky; Grand
Rapids, Michigan; Boston, Massachusetts; Portland, Oregon; Charlotte, North
Carolina; and Kansas City, Missouri. Most of the cities chosen were comparable in
size to Detroit. Grand Rapids was chosen because it is the State of Michigan's second
largest City and in good financial condition. Flint was chosen because it has similar
challenges as Detroit. We also chose a mix of cities that were either in good or poor
fiscal health for comparative purposes.) (BROUGHT BACK AS DIRECTED ON 925-19)
