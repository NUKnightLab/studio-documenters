Honda Super Quiet Series Generator

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

 

Honda Power Equipment sets a new standard in portable power with the introduction of an all-
new inverter generator. Part of Honda Power

Equipment?s Super Quiet Series of generators, the new
lineup is the perfect portable generator for

work, home or play.

The all?new Honda inverter generator offers
tremendous value to users, delivering 10 percent more
power (200 watts) than the outgoing model, the
company?s most popular portable model for the same
price. The heart of the additional power the new
generator delivers is the Honda GXR120 engine. With
more power, better performance and improved ease of

 

use and maintenance, the all-new Honda is the perfect choice for consumers to power
what they need for work, home or play.

In addition to more wattage, the all-new delivers consumers additional user-friendly
features including a fuel shut off valve that allows the engine to run with the fuel supply off,
helping prevent issues related to stale fuel; a large spout and oil drain gutter for cleaner, easier
oil changes; a smooth, light effort recoil; a user?friendly design that incorporates color-coded
startup points to start the generator; and increased ventilation that improves airflow resulting in
better cooling of key components.
