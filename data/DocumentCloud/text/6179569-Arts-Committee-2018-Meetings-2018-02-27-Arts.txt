WPB Arts Committee
Minutes
January 23, 2018
In attendance: David Ginople (chair), Sam Choudhury (SSA program manager), Hans Kumler (SSA
program specialist), Pamela Maass (WPB executive director)

1. The committee discussed project updates:
a. Wicker Tree--Artist Mike Helbing’s latest correspondence regarding this art installation
indicates he plans to move forward with construction and installation of the sculpture,
pending approval of drawings from the Park District. There has been a delay with the Park
District in agreeing to structural design and placement within the Park itself.
b. Worker Cottage—DG shared history of project with SC and HK, who were not involved at the
start of this project. SC shared invoice 2 of 4 from artist Lynn Basa. Payment will cover
execution and fabrication of installation.
2. Implementation Plan Review
a. SSA Commissioners Retreat is upcoming Friday Feb. 9th. Since quorum was not met at this
meeting, no projects were voted on by the committee to pursue in 2018. This will be
discussed at the February Arts Committee meeting.
b. DG suggested that the arts committee consider other means of bringing art installations to
the community that are easier to implement. DG suggested the Chicago Sculpture Exhibition
as a possible option.
3. The committee discussed the need to develop a list of deliverables for part-time Arts Administrator,
being hired in Feb.
