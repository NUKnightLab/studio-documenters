MR. JOHNSON:

I'd like to introduce

2

myself.

3

am Chip Johnson, chief officer of Family and

Community Engagement in education.

I'm no stranger to these meetings.

I

This meeting is part of the

6

proposed reassignment boundary of National

7

Teachers Academy, which was formally introduced

8

on December 1st.

9

to the Board on December 1st following months

I will say formally proposed

10

of community engagement leading up to the

11

announcement.

12

We are here today on behalf of

13

the CEO, Dr. Janice Jackson, to share some

14

basic information and to hear from you about

15

the specific proposal.

16

As I mentioned a moment ago, the

17

purpose of this meeting is to allow CEO Jackson

18

and the board to hear feedback from you about

19

the specific proposal under discussion.

20

I will start by reading a brief

21

introduction on logistics, and then I will run

22

through the presentation that you might have

23

seen last week if you were here.

24

After this, we will allow you

time for you and the public comment.

The meeting will end

approximately 8:00 o'clock promptly.

4

hoping that will be 8:00 o'clock.

5

would also like to encourage you -- Reverend

This followed most of

Following this announcement, CPS

8

hosted two community meetings, this is the

second one, and then one public hearing that

10

will be held at the end of this month,

together, additional public feedback.

12
13

After these meetings and the
hearings, we will review all input.

14

And after this, CEO Dr. Jackson

15

will make a recommendation to the board to vote

16

on the proposed action.

17

Following the potential

18

recommendation, the board will vote on whether

19

or not to approve the proposed action at the

20

February board meeting.

21

Over the past week, we have

22

engaged various communities on this proposal

23

and got feedback that formed adjustments to the

24

proposal.

We heard from various communities,
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 7
1

including parents and community members at

2

Drake, Haines, Healy, NTA, South Loop and Ward.

3

We heard from community members from Armour

4

Square, Bronzeville, Bridgeport, Chinatown and

5

South Loop.

6

and our state representatives.

And also heard from our aldermen

7

We have conducted three large

8

community meetings between May and June of

9

2017.

We had five meetings with the steering

10

committee comprised of community leaders across

11

these groups.

12

with various stakeholders and received over 900

13

e-mails at transitions@CPS.edu.

14

Over 30 small-group meetings

From this engagement, we had a

15

lot of feedback from various perspectives,

16

including those interested in a high school and

17

potential boundaries, as well as others who

18

want to maintain NTA as an elementary school,

19

including its strong culture and staff.

20

We have worked to adjust our

21

proposal in response to various points of

22

feedback, including expanding South Loop to

23

incorporate all of NTA's current boundary and

24

releasing an initial draft boundary for
TOOMEY REPORTING

2

community feedback.
We want to take time to explain

3

the proposal today and where it stands and

4

continue to gather feedback from these

5

community meetings.

6

In terms of the proposal, itself,

7

all proposed changes are supposed to begin

8

school year 2019-20.

9

components here.

There are two key

On the elementary school

10

side, this proposal involves a new

11

state-of-the-art South Loop facility,

12

three-campus model at South Loop and expanding

13

boundaries of South Loop to incorporate all of

14

NTA's current boundary over time.

15

On the potential high school

16

conversion, this proposal involves NTA, rather

17

than converting to a high school over time,

18

transitioning grades pre-K through 3 to South

19

Loop while allowing students in grades 4

20

through 8th grade to remain at NTA or transfer

21

to South Loop and provide a guaranteed seat for

22

all NTA students to attend the high school,

23

regardless of where they live.

24

In the following slides, we will
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 9
1
2

go through a few key details of this proposal.
In terms of the high school

3

conversion timeline, this proposal involves the

4

following changes for 2019-20:

5

pre-K program at NTA to South Loop; enrolling

6

incoming kindergarten students at South Loop;

7

rising students in grade 1st through 3rd grade

8

will be reassigned to South Loop or have the

9

option to transfer to another school; NTA

Transition of

10

students in grade 4 through 8th grade to either

11

stay at NTA or to transition to South Loop.

12

All NTA students will have a

13

guaranteed seat at the high school regardless

14

of where they live.

15

Starting in school year 2019-20,

16

NTA will begin a gradual conversion to a high

17

school over time.

18

As you can see below, NTA would

19

contain students 4 through 9 in 2019-20.

20

then in subsequent years, NTA would gradually

21

phase in high school grades while phasing out

22

the elementary school grades.

23
24

And

So by 2022-23 school year, NTA
would contain students in grades 7 through 12.
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 10
1

And in school year 2024 through 25 and beyond,

2

NTA would only contain the high school grades 9

3

through 12.

4

We will ensure that the high

5

school and elementary grade transitions will be

6

managed with the appropriate safety and

7

security considerations.

8
9

In terms of the transition for
specific NTA students, starting in 2019-20, the

10

pre-K program at NTA will be located in South

11

Loop.

12

For students in the neighborhood

13

program, rising kindergarten students living in

14

the current boundaries of NTA will not offer

15

kin -- I'm sorry.

16

NTA, will be zoned to South Loop.

17

offer a kindergarten option.

18

In the current boundaries of
NTA will not

Rising 1st through 3rd grade

19

students at NTA will be reassigned to South

20

Loop regardless of where they live.

21

22

elementary schools.

2

students can stay at NTA through graduation or

3

transfer to South Loop's neighborhood track.

4

They can also decide to transfer to South Loop

5

in subsequent school years.

6

For students in the regional

7

gifted center program, which we eventually

8

refer to as RGC, kindergarten through 3rd grade

9

will be located at South Loop.

In subsequent

10

years, the RGC program will phase in grades at

11

South Loop.

12

Rising NTA RGC students will be

13

reassigned to the RGC program at South Loop.

14

They will also have the option to transfer to

15

other elementary schools.

Staff at the Office of Access and

17

Enrollment will help students and families

through 8 will remain at NTA and phase out over

time.

school year 2019-20 and in future years.

In terms of how the elementary
TOOMEY REPORTING

 January 16, 2018
Page 12
1

school boundary will change, South Loop's

2

boundary will expand to include all of NTA's

3

current boundary over time.

4

change over time is in sequence with the

5

transition of elementary school students and

6

the phaseout of elementary school grades at

7

NTA.

8
9

This boundary

So, for example, in school year
2019-20, kindergarten through 3rd grade at NTA

10

transitions to South Loop; and likewise, the

11

boundary for kindergarten through 3rd grade

12

students in NTA's current boundary will be in

13

South Loop.

MR. JOHNSON:

Kindergarten through 3rd grade at NTA

18

transitions to South Loop; and likewise, the

19

boundary for kindergarten through 3rd grade

20

students in NTA's current boundary will be

21

South Loop.

22

NTA will offer grades 4 through

23

8, so boundaries for students -- excuse me.

24

understand your passion, and I understand your

respect the equity of the presentation.

6

you.

7

There are other people

I ask you
Thank

(Audience shouting)

8

NTA will offer grades 4 through

9

8, so the boundaries for students in grades 4

10

through 8's NTA boundary will still be NTA.

11

All students residing in this

12

boundary in grades 4 through 8 will also have

13

the option to attend South Loop Elementary

14

School.

15

We recognize that this change

16

will be difficult for some families and

17

students.

Loop --

We engaged both NTA and South

19
20

(Shouting by audience.)
MR. JOHNSON:

We engaged both NTA and

21

South Loop parents in developing this

22

transition plan, including multiple steering

23

committees.

24

Ultimately, we developed a draft
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 14
1

plan that budgets 3.5 million to support that

2

transition of NTA students to South Loop and

3

the coming together of these two school

4

communities.

5

Some of the key transitions that

6

we included were:

7

events activities designed to support the

8

community building and culture integration

9

starting the year prior to any proposed

10

The budget for variety and

actions.

11

Another one was the creation of a

12

Joint Culture and Climate Team comprised of

13

staff, parents and student representatives from

14

both NTA and South Loop.

15

Then the principal and

16

school-based transition coordinators to assist

17

with implementation of new programs and

18

practices at each school.

19

provide logistical support, examples are

20

recording transfers and the like, and the other

21

supports identified by both schools'

22

leadership.

23
24

We would also

training opportunities for all school staff and

2

transportation for transferring NTA students to

3

commute to South Loop Elementary School.

4

In addition, as part of this

5

proposal, all NTA students as of school year

6

2018-19, regardless of where they live, will

7

have a guaranteed seat at the high school as

8

they matriculate from elementary school to high

9

school.

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:

You might be loud,

but you ain't making any sense.
MR. JOHNSON:

That's your opinion.

The slide that you see here,

14

regarding the feedback from the last meeting

15

regarding capacity and enrollment in the high

16

school, the data shows that under a reasonable

17

set of assumptions based on current data, all

18

students from the enrollment boundary,

19

including both neighborhood and preference

20

boundary, will be able to attend.

21

Now, before we get started, each

22

participant will have two minutes to speak.

23

You will receive notice with 30 seconds left at

24

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 18

My purpose for doing so is to

2

address some of the comments that had been made

3

from outside communities.

4

My children have ridden two

5

trains with their father every single day since

6

they were in kindergarten.

7

At the last meeting, someone

8

asked us if we have been south of 37th Street.

9

We live in the hundreds.

The Red Line stops

10

directly in front of NTA.

11

have not had a single tardy with public

12

transportation.

13

And amazingly, they

I would also like to add, they

14

travel 13 miles to school, that's 13.

15

know that math is hard for some of you, so

16

that's 26 miles round trip.

17

during rush hour every day.

18

And I

I drive them home

So when I hear stories how hard

19

it is for someone's high schooler to travel

20

four, six or eight miles, I'm not buying that

21

as a reason to destroy 750 people's children

22

for a high-quality education.

23
24

Under the new plan, my son can
stay at NTA in a construction zone, my daughter
TOOMEY REPORTING

gets put into South Loop, and my

2

two-year-year-old wouldn't have a seat at

3

either one.

4

We will become one of those

5

families all too common fed up with CPS.

6

Splitting children across three different

7

buildings is not good for any child.

9

The next issue I would like to
address is when I hear people say I don't have

10

a high school.

11

The high school in my neighborhood is Level 2.

12

But I would never say I do not have a high

13

school.

14

Everyone has a high school.

If you are insinuating that this

15

school does not exist, I hear you.

not like your neighborhood high school, that's

are there that is not a good enough school for

you.

things when someone didn't understand.

Currently, 93 percent of Haines,

Good evening.

My name is

I am here as a proud
I'm also a

I want to share my particular

10

perspective, which is that, in my view, the

11

status of NTA as a 1+ school or the debate

12

about whether the gifted RGC scores are what

13

attributes to their -- its rating misses the

14

point; and therefore, I would not like to make

15

the argument NTA should not be closed because

16

it's a 1+ it school.

17

argument it should not be closed because what

18

it represents to the students and to the

19

parents, what it means as a community that

20

previous students have said what it is to them.

21

And that a school, its greatness, what it can

22

do for students is determined by relationships

23

that are established between the different

24

members of the community, between the staff

I want to make the

TOOMEY REPORTING

I don't have a good answer for her.

Even people in our

And I have to explain to my daughter

Why do I have to give up my school?

And

The one

10

answer that I would like to give her, that I

11

think about giving her, is that the truth is if

12

she were going to a school which was not

13

predominantly African American, which was not

14

predominantly low-income, she would not have

15

to, because they would have political will and

16

clout to stand up to it.

17

say that.

18

And it pains me to

Now I don't have a good answer to

19

give her as a CPS employee or as a parent to

20

tell her why it is she has to give up her

21

school and why it should be fair that she has

22

to give up her school so other people can have

23

it.

I want to leave my testimony on

And we have other kids, too, like the kids from

Chinatown, seem like they going through the

3

same thing that we going through, but instead

4

of allowing us to go to school together -- in

5

which you have other parents, other Caucasian

6

families that took a chance and enrolled their

7

kids into a predominantly black school, and

8

felt -- you know, realize that it was

9

prosperous for them and their children.

And

10

they got a chance to see that we can pull

11

together.

12

Taking our schools from us

13

is -- you have, like, other kids from

14

Englewood, their school's closing, and they are

15

able to go to Phillips.

16

from Chinatown a chance to go to Phillips,

17

maybe they can enhance what we already have at

18

Phillips, to better all our schools.

19

what I'm saying?

20

And we give the kids

You know

You have a lot of parents that

21

wasn't able to get good educations, so they had

saying in the media is to right this wrong that

12

occurred in 2005, she is completely unaware of

it.

14

So for the hearing officer, for

15

CPS and for Chip, you are clearly willing to

16

move these families back and forth and

prejudice the same families that were

to stop talking so you can do the presentation,

is we want you to hear our voice in what we are

doing.

We're trying to help our school to do

what we are doing, because my mom lived here

had to go until my dad helped us move.

consideration that this board has had the most

statistics where it starts one year before,

has the right to continue to destabilize

22

south side, June 21, 2017, admitting there are

23

1500 available high school seats in the area,

24

but you said that's a valid argument in terms
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018

6

to be rooted in this quote that he gave, which

7

is, All the children are well, which is on the

8

side of a table, which means life is good.

9

it means that the daily struggles of existence,

10

even among poor people, include the proper care

11

implication meaning that all of the children

We've told you what we lost at NTA, our

teachers working together to help NTA in

Most importantly, NTA

2

will eventually go away.

Future generations

3

will lose access to this gem, which has so ably

4

served low-income, African American majority

population.

6

As my friend here points out,

7

this proposal doesn't meet the needs of the

8

near south community.

9

won't be able to serve the whole community.

Even when it opens, it

10

Nicole, first all for coming up and taking a

3

stand and saying that she agrees that NTA

should not be compromised in terms of our

5

education for the students there to gain a high

6

school.

7

And I want to thank you,

What I want you to realize, and I

8

want to make sure is on record today, is that

9

the politicians continue to pit us against each

10

other, and they give us false choices.

11

So Pat Dowell, on Friday, June

12

2nd, 2017, Dr. Jackson had e-mailed Alderman

13

Dowell, in which Dowell states, "I see that the

14

NTA parent groups are trying to make a

15

segregation argument.

16

an answer for that should it rear its ugly head

17

at the meeting.

18

(inaudible) increases diversity of the South

19

Loop Elementary School.

20

before the meeting, let's discuss."

21

I think we should have

From my perspective

If you have time

So what's interesting is that

22

Dowell, as alderman, that's passed out as part

23

of the community and as a stakeholder, believes

24

that closing NTA will increase diversity at the
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 74
1

South Loop Elementary School, and there is no

2

discussion of this by the alderman on how this

3

proposal will negatively impact NTA.

4

no data presented that says that any of these

5

outcomes will be positive for any of the

6

children or communities involved.

7

There is

And I (inaudible) Alderman Dowell

8

quoted in the media saying segregation is not

9

her job, and she was not going to take it on.

10
11

It is very interesting this is
now an argument.

12

Again, I would like for us, the

13

NTA parents that have reached out on several

14

occasions, this is a false choice.

15

not have to be compromised for us to have a

16

high school that serves each community that is

17

deserving of a high school.

18

to accept that.

19

NTA does

And we do not have

So continue to fight against it.

20

And for those of you that would like to join

21

us, again we still welcome you, and you are

22

welcome to come to NTA as well for elementary

school.

 January 16, 2018
Page 75

believe I don't have very much to add to the

2

discussion.

3

is being -- what is taking place.

4

Everybody is pretty clear on what

The CPS officials do not reflect

They reflect what downtown

they have to do what's needed to provide

sustenance to their family and their

13

are actually listening, what alternatives have

14

they come up with?

15

alternatives for NTA being a high school?

16

is it the one and only plan that you guys had?

17

And rather than listen to any genuine

18

alternatives, it's just basically again meeting

19

the state mandate that is required of you

20

before you move on to the next option, which is

21

basically closing down.

22

Have you made any

Is there, I ask you, not

forces -- these communities that are

represented here tonight, you deserve both, a

Don't let anybody from the outside

MS. UN:

Hi, everyone.

My name is Angela.

7

I work for the Coalition for better

8

Chinese-American Community.

9

to address something that I heard, which was

And I just wanted

10

the lack of, like, presence of the Chinese

11

community.

12

I just want people to know that,

13

like, a lot of the community members have

14

different opinions.

15

sympathetic.

16

know about it.

17

obviously organizations try to -- we've been

18

doing the assessments, and we do try to get the

19

community members out, but, like, a lot of the

20

problem is the language access issue.

21

just want people to -- parents to realize that.

22

might feel comfortable with language wise.

Unless, like, that's just not something that

4

people are going to, like, consider in the list

5

of priorities of things, because you're just

6

really, like, working.

7

like, that shouldn't be happening, that should

8

be happening, but, like, political opposites is

9

so limited.

That's not to say that,

Getting people to register to vote

10

is just so hard because of the language

11

barrier.

12

trying, some groups aren't.

13

ultimately we all like want to not be quiet or

14

absent, to really work together and have like

15

better engagement and be able to speak for

16

ourselves.

17

So I think that some groups are
