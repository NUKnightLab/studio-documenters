VII. Programs & Services
a. BIP, Sign Removal and Security Camera Rebate Programs
i. Security Cameras and Security Camera Rebate Program
1. CPD Officers Khan and Sgt. Quadri discussed camera options to
help reduce crime in the area. They like license plate capability
cameras, which use two cameras - one to zoom in and another
that takes pictures of the area.
2. The suggested the best thing is to do an audit to see who has
working cameras and prepare a map of existing coverage and
which coverage has quality footage. We can then fill in the gaps
with cameras that offer CPD direct access.
3. Comcast has a program in Detroit that’s a monthly third party
program, and OEMC referred the CPD to them. OEMC has a
system to look at the camera video.
4. CPD prefers to have remote access to cameras rather than going
to the store because the benefit is regardless of leasing or owning
cameras OEMC owns the footage.
5. Revise application that cameras need to be installed enough on a
façade to capture faces.
6. Next step – Officer Khan will task his team to do the audit.

1. Destiny Studio 2522 W. Devon – motion to approve by Peter with
