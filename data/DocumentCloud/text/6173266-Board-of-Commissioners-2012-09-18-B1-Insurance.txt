GENERAL BACKGROUND

Aon directly and indirectly (through one wholesaler) solicited requests for insurance premium
quotes from 28 carriers (most with the ability to quote multiple lines of coverage) on July 1,
2012. This year, Aon received quotes from several new carriers. However, after an executive
review of the proposals, CHA has decided to remain with all of the incumbent insurers except for
one. After reviewing the responses, AON and Risk Management Department
recommend that the above mentioned insurers provide the required insurance coverage for CHA
for the Period October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013.

The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies and applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.

The EVP of Finance concurs with the recommendation to purchase insurance coverage through
its Broker of Record with the same policy limits and retention levels for all lines as in the prior
year?s program.

The CEO/President recommends the approval to execute contracts for insurance coverage for the
CHA, for the period of October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013, for an aggregate amount

not-to-exceed $1,243,043.00 through its insurance broker of record, AON Risk Services Central,
Inc.
