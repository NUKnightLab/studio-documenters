Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company (GRS) Experience Study
Alex Rivera and Ryan Gunderson of Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company (“GRS”) presented the 2017
Actuarial Experience Study which they prepared for the period from January 1, 2012 through December
31, 2016. See attached document. GRS reminded the Trustees of the purpose of the Experience Study and
reviewed a PowerPoint presentation outlining the demographic and economic assumptions that they
recommend be implemented by the LABF. See attached GRS Experience Review presentation. The
Trustees followed-up with questions on the recommendations. The Trustees discussed and requested
additional information regarding the recommended investment return assumption, and specifically asked

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Executive Summary 
The results of the five‐year experience review of the Laborers’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity
and Benefit Fund of Chicago are presented in this report. The review was conducted for the purposes of
updating the actuarial assumptions used in:



Valuing the actuarial liabilities effective as of December 31, 2017, and
Projecting the minimum required statutory City contribution for payment year 2023. City
contributions for payment years 2018 through 2022 are fixed by statute.

The last comparable experience review was prepared for the period January 1, 2004, to December 31,
2011. In this report, we review the current actuarial assumptions and methods and compare them to the
actual experience of the Fund for the years 2012 through 2016.
The table below lists each of the primary assumptions and methods that we analyzed, including our
recommendations for each item, and the overall financial impact of the recommended changes.

The overall impact of the recommended changes would be an increase in the actuarial liability of approximately 4.5 percent and a decrease in
the funded ratio of 2.2 percentage points. The projected City contribution to the Fund in payment year 2023 (first year City contribution is
calculated as opposed to a pre‐determined amount) under the funding policy established by Public Act 100‐0023 (PA 100‐0023) would increase
from 42.2 percent to 47.1 percent as a percentage of projected capped payroll and $123.1 million to $135.9 million as a dollar amount.
New assumptions will first be used in the December 31, 2017, actuarial valuation, at which time experience gains or losses incurred during 2017
will also be recognized.

 SECTION 

INTRODUCTION

Introduction 
Background 
For any pension plan, actuarial assumptions are selected that are intended to provide reasonable
estimates of future expected events, such as Fund investment returns, interest crediting and patterns of
retirement, turnover and mortality. These assumptions, along with an actuarial cost method, an asset
valuation method, the employee census data and the plan’s provisions are used to determine the
actuarial liabilities and overall actuarially determined funding requirements for the plan. The true cost to
the plan over time will be the actual benefit payments and expenses required by the plan’s provisions for
the participant group under the plan. To the extent the actual experience deviates from the actuarial
assumptions, experience gains and losses will occur. These gains (losses) then serve to reduce (increase)
future actuarially determined contributions and increase (reduce) the funded ratio.
A periodic review and selection of the actuarial assumptions is one of many important components of
understanding and managing the financial aspects of the Laborers’ and Retirement Board Employees’
Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago. Use of outdated or inappropriate assumptions can result in
understated costs which will lead to higher future contribution requirements or perhaps an inability to
pay benefits when due; or, on the other hand, produce overstated costs which place an unnecessarily
large burden on the current generation of members, employers, and taxpayers.
A single set of assumptions is typically not expected to be suitable forever. As the actual experience
unfolds or the future expectations change, the assumptions should be reviewed and adjusted accordingly.
It is important to recognize that the impact from various outcomes and the ability to adjust from
experience deviating from the assumption are not symmetric. Due to compounding economic forces,
legal limitations and moral obligations, outcomes from underestimating future liabilities are much more
difficult to manage than outcomes of overestimates. That asymmetric risk should be considered when
the assumption set, investment policy and funding policy are created. As such, the assumption set used in
the actuarial valuation process needs to represent the best estimate of the future experience of the
System and be at least as likely, if not more than likely, to overestimate the future liabilities versus
underestimate them.
Using this strategic mindset, each assumption was analyzed compared to the actual experience of LABF
and general experience of other large public employee retirement funds. Changes in certain assumptions
and methods are suggested based on this comparison to remove any bias that may exist and to perhaps
add in a slight margin for future adverse experience where appropriate. Next, the assumption set as a
whole was analyzed for consistency and to ensure that the projection of liabilities was reasonable and
consistent with historical trends.
The Actuarial Standards Board (“ASB”) provides guidance on measuring the costs of financing a retirement
program through the following Actuarial Standards of Practices (“ASOP”):
•
•
•
•

ASOP No. 4, Measuring Pension Obligations and Determining Pension Plan Costs or Contributions;
ASOP No. 27, Selection of Economic Assumptions for Measuring Pension Obligations;
ASOP No. 35, Selection of Demographic and Other Noneconomic Assumptions for Measuring 
Pension Obligations; and
ASOP No. 44, Selection and Use of Asset Valuation Methods for Pension Valuations.

 Introduction 
The recommendations provided in this report are consistent with the preceding actuarial standards of
practice.
The ASB recently adopted the Actuarial Standard of Practice No. 51, Assessment and Disclosure of Risk
Associated with Measuring Pension Obligations and Determining Pension Plan Contributions. ASOP No.
51 will be effective for any actuarial work product with a measurement date on or after November 1,
2018.

Summary of Process  
In determining liabilities and contribution rates for retirement plans, actuaries must make assumptions
about the future. The actuarial assumptions are usually divided into two categories:
•

•

Economic assumptions, which include:
o Assumed rate of price inflation (as measured by the change in the Consumer Price Index
for all Urban consumers)
 Underlies all other economic assumptions
 Basis for cost‐of‐living increases and increases in the pay cap for pensionable pay
for members hired after January 1, 2011
o Assumed long‐term rate of return on investments
 Rate at which projected benefits are reduced to present value
o General wage increases and payroll growth assumption
 Reflects inflationary forces on increases in pay for all members
 Reflects expectation of growth in payroll and affects level percent of pay
contribution requirements
o Salary Increases
Demographic assumptions, which include:
o Mortality rates
o Retirement rates
o Withdrawal (Turnover) rates
o Disability rates

For some of these assumptions, such as the mortality rates, past experience provides important evidence
about the future. For others, such as the investment return assumption, the link between past and future
results may be weaker. In either case, actuaries should review the plan’s assumptions periodically and
determine whether these assumptions are consistent with actual past experience and with anticipated
future experience.
The last such actuarial experience study was performed following the December 31, 2011, actuarial
valuation and the recommendations were adopted on February 9, 2013, and became effective for the
December 31, 2012, actuarial valuation. For this experience study, we have reviewed LABF’s experience
for the five‐year period from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2016.
In conducting experience studies, actuaries generally use data over a period of several years. This is
necessary in order to gather enough data so that the results are statistically significant. In addition, if the
study period is too short, the impact of the current economic conditions may lead to misleading results. It
is known, for example, that the health of the general economy can affect salary increase rates and

 Introduction 
withdrawal rates. Using results gathered during a short‐term boom or bust period will not be
representative of the long‐term trends in these assumptions. Also, the adoption of legislation, such as
plan improvements or changes in salary schedules, will sometimes cause a short‐term distortion in the
experience. For example, if an early retirement window was opened during the study period, we would
usually see a short‐term spike in the number of retirements followed by a decrease of retirements for the
following two‐to‐four years. Using a longer period prevents giving too much weight to such short‐term
effects. On the other hand, using a much longer period could dampen real changes that may be
occurring, such as mortality improvement or a change in the ages at which members retire.
In an experience study, we first determine the number of deaths, retirements, etc. that occurred during
the period. Then we determine the number expected to occur, based on the current actuarial
assumptions. The number of “expected” decrements is determined by multiplying the probability of the
occurrence at the given age, by the “exposures” at that same age. For example, consider a rate of
retirement of 15 percent at age 55. The number of exposures can only be those members who are age 55
and eligible for retirement at that time. Thus they are considered “exposed” to that assumption. Finally,
we calculate the A/E ratio, where "A" is the actual number (of retirements, for example) and "E" is the
expected number. If the current assumptions were “perfect,” the A/E ratio would be 100 percent. When
it varies significantly from this figure, it is a sign that new assumptions may be needed. However, in some
cases we prefer to set our assumptions to produce an A/E ratio a little above or below 100 percent, in
order to introduce some conservatism. Of course we not only look at the assumptions as a whole, but we
also review how well they fit the actual results by gender, by age and by service.
If the data leads the actuary to conclude that new tables are needed, the actuary may "graduate" or
smooth the results, since the raw results can be quite uneven from age to age or from service to service.
Please bear in mind that, while the recommended assumption set represents our best estimate, there are
other reasonable assumptions sets that could be supported, and would show higher or lower liabilities or
costs.

Summary of Recommendations 
Our recommended changes to the current actuarial assumptions may be summarized as follows:
Economic Assumptions
•

Price inflation: We recommend decreasing the rate of price inflation from 3.00 percent to 2.25
percent.

•

Retiree Cost‐of‐Living Adjustment and Increases in the Pay Cap for Pensionable Pay for 
Participants Hired on and After January 1, 2011: We recommend reducing the assumed rate of
COLA and increases in capped pay for participants hired on or after January 1, 2011, from 1.50
percent to 1.125 percent (from 50 percent of 3.00 percent to 50 percent of 2.25 percent).

•

Investment return: We recommend decreasing the nominal investment return assumption from
7.50 percent to 7.00 percent. Based on the results of the asset allocation study performed in
September 2017, by LABF’s investment consultants (Marquette Associates), the adopted portfolio
produced a median annual return of 7.80 percent over the next 10 years. However, using a
Laborer’s and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago

 Introduction 
blending of the current capital market assumptions from independent sources and LABF’s current
asset allocation, produced a median annual return of 7.08 percent over the next 20 years.
•

General wage inflation and payroll growth assumption: We recommend a general wage inflation
assumption of 0.75 percentage points above inflation, or 3.00 percent. This assumption serves as
the across‐the‐board portion of salary increases and the rate at which the pay at hire is assumed
to increase in future years for projection purposes.

•

Salary increase: We reviewed salary experience for the period from January 1, 2012, to December
31, 2016. Overall, salaries did not increase as much as assumed. We determined salary increases
between actuarial valuations and calculated average annual salary increases. Rates were
increased for members during the first three years and seventh year of service and decreased for
the remaining years of service with underlying wage inflation of 3.00 percent. On an aggregate
basis the proposed salary increase assumptions are lower than the currently assumed salary
increase rates.

Mortality Assumptions
•

We recommend updating post‐retirement mortality tables to the most recently published national
“blue collar” tables, the RP‐2014 Blue Collar Healthy Annuitant Mortality tables. We also
recommend assuming mortality rates will improve in the future using a fully generational
approach, but with the most recently published projection scale, MP–2017. These new mortality
tables are a move from a single‐dimensional age‐based table to a two‐dimensional table, where
the year a person was born also influences their mortality rate.

•

We recommend updating pre‐retirement mortality tables for active employees to the most
recently published national “blue collar” tables, the RP‐2014 Blue Collar Employee mortality
tables. We also recommend assuming mortality rates will improve in the future using a fully
generational approach, but with the most recently published projection scale, MP–2017.

•

We recommend applying certain scaling factors to the base tables based on the actual mortality
experience and the credibility that can be applied to that experience.

Other Demographic Assumptions
•

Retirement rates: We continue to recommend using predominantly service‐based rates with
higher rates at older ages. The actual rates of retirement were less than expected for all ages
signifying that members are retiring later and in less numbers than expected. We recommend
decreasing rates for all age and service bands.

•

Turnover rates: Overall, the observed experience showed that fewer members terminated
employment than expected. We recommend modifications to the current service based rates.
These modifications include increasing the rate of termination during a member’s first year of
service and decreasing rates for service beyond one year.

 Introduction 
•

Disability rates: We recommend continuing to value disability as a term cost only, as a majority of
disabilities were short‐term in nature. We recommend that disability costs be increased from 2.50
percent of payroll to 3.00 percent of payroll and continued to be valued as a term cost. We
believe that it is appropriate to continue considering these members as active members that are
expected to accrue additional future benefits and load the normal cost to reflect near‐term cash
flow for the disability benefits. We will review the data periodically to ensure that the assumption
remains reasonable.

Cost method: The actuarial cost method is Entry Age Normal, which is required to be used by
State Statute.
 
Amortization method: The State Statute requires fixed City contributions for payment years 2018
through 2022 and level percentage of pay contributions thereafter, such that the funded ratio
reaches 90 percent by the end of 2058. There is no separate amortization of the unfunded
accrued liability that leads to a 100 percent funding of the accrued liability. This funding method
may not comply with generally accepted actuarial principles for the funding of a retirement fund
because the funding method targets 90 percent instead of 100 percent.

•

Asset smoothing method: The asset smoothing method is also defined by State Statute. Gains
and losses, the difference between the actual investment return and expected investment return,
are smoothed in over a five‐year period at a rate of 20 percent per year.

•

Administrative expenses: We continue to recommend including administrative expenses as an
additional component of the normal cost. Administrative expenses are based on the previous
years’ administrative expenses increased by the inflation assumption (2.25 percent) and
discounted to the beginning of year. Future administrative expenses, for projection purposes, are
assumed to increase at the assumed rate of inflation.

•

Dependent assumptions: Dependent assumptions for current active members are used in the
actuarial valuation for purposes of valuing liabilities for pre and post‐retirement death benefits.
We recommend decreasing the current marriage assumption from 85 percent to 75 percent based
on the demographics of the valuation census data over the experience study period. The male
spouse is assumed to be three years older than the female spouse. No dependent assumptions
are made for current retirees as actual eligible spouse data is provided.

•

Decrement timing: We recommend maintaining decrement timing of middle of year.

ANALYSIS OF EXPERIENCE AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Analysis of Experience and Recommendations 
Economic Assumptions 
Economic assumptions reflect the effects of economic forces on the projections of retirement benefits
payable from the plan and in the discounting of those benefits to present value.
These assumptions are based, at their core, on the assumed level of price inflation. Each economic
assumption is then developed from expected spreads over price inflation.
The key economic assumptions are:
•
•
•

Assumed Rate of Inflation – The rate of price inflation (as measured by the Consumer Price Index
for all Urban consumers) which underlies the remainder of the economic assumptions.
Assumed Rate of Investment Return – The rate at which projected future benefits under the
pension plan are reduced to present value.
Rate of General Annual Pay Increases – This reflects inflationary forces on increases in pay for
individual members.

Actuarial Standards of Practice No. 27 
Actuarial Standards of Practice No. 27, Selection of Economic Assumptions for Measuring Pension
Obligations, provides guidance to actuaries on giving advice on selecting economic assumptions for
measuring obligations for defined benefit plans. ASOP No. 27 was revised and adopted by the Actuarial
Standards Board (ASB) in September 2013 (applicable to valuation dates on or after September 30, 2014).
The standard requires that the selected economic assumptions be consistent with each other. That is, the
selection of the investment return assumption should be consistent with the selection of the wage
inflation and price inflation assumptions.
As no one knows what the future holds, it is necessary for an actuary to estimate possible future
economic outcomes. Recognizing that there is not one right answer, the current standard calls for an
actuary to develop a reasonable economic assumption. A reasonable assumption is one that is:
1. Appropriate for the purpose of the measurement;
2. Reflects the actuary’s professional judgment;
3. Takes into account historical and current economic data that is relevant as of the measurement
date;
4. Is an estimate of future experience; an observation of market data; or a combination thereof; and
5. Has no significant bias except when provisions for adverse deviation or plan provisions that are
difficult to measure are included.
However, the standard explicitly advises an actuary not to give undue weight to recent experience.
Each economic assumption should individually satisfy this standard. Furthermore, with respect to any
particular actuarial valuation, each economic assumption should be consistent with every other economic
assumption over the measurement period. Generally, the economic assumptions are much more
subjective in nature than the demographic assumptions.

 Analysis of Experience and Recommendations 
Inflation Assumption 
By “inflation,” we mean price inflation, as measured by annual increases in the Consumer Price Index
(“CPI”). This inflation assumption underlies most of the other economic assumptions. It affects
investment return, salary increases, and overall payroll growth. The current annual inflation assumption
is 3.00 percent. This assumption was left unchanged in the last experience study.
Over the five‐year period from January 2013 through December 2017, the CPI‐U has increased at an
average rate of 1.43 percent.
The following table shows the average inflation over various periods, ending December 2017.

As the above chart illustrates, the high inflation of the 1970s and 1980s is well in the past. The geometric
average price inflation was 2.56 percent per year over the last 30 years from December 1987 to
December 2017, 2.14 percent over the last 20 years and 1.61 percent over the last 10 years.
Future Inflation Expectations 
Since price inflation is relatively volatile and is subject to a number of influences not based on recent history,
economic assumptions are less reliably based on recent past experience than are the demographic
assumptions. Therefore, it is important not to give undue weight to recent experience. We must also
consider future expectations as well.
One source of information about future inflation is the market for US Treasury bonds. Simplistically, the
difference in yield between non‐inflation‐indexed and inflation‐indexed treasury bonds should be a
reasonable estimate of what the bond market expects on a forward looking basis for inflation. As of the end
of December, the difference for 20‐year bonds implies that inflation over the next 20 years would average
1.92 percent. The difference in yield for 30‐year bonds implies 1.97 percent inflation over the next 30 years.
However, this analysis is known to be imperfect as it ignores the inflation risk premium that buyers of US
Treasury bonds often demand as well as possible differences in liquidity between US Treasury bonds and
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS).

 Analysis of Experience and Recommendations 
We also surveyed the inflation assumption used by various investment consulting firms. In our sample of
these firms, the inflation assumption ranged from 2.00 percent to 2.75 percent, with an average of 2.25
percent.
Another point of reference is the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) 2017 Trustees Report, in which the
Office of the Chief Actuary is projecting a long‐term average ultimate annual inflation rate of 2.6 percent
under the intermediate cost assumption. The ultimate inflation assumption is 2.0 percent and 3.2 percent
respectively in the high cost and low cost projection scenarios. The Social Security Trustees report uses the
ultimate rates for their 75‐year projections, much longer than the longest horizon we can discern from
Treasuries and TIPS.

 Analysis of Experience and Recommendations 
Recommendation 
Based on this information, our opinion is that it would be reasonable to lower the current price inflation
assumption of 3.00 percent. However, we caution against lowering the price inflation assumption too low
(i.e., below 2.00 percent). (The Federal Reserve’s target and the Social Security Trustees’ ultimate high
cost assumptions are both 2.00 percent.) We are recommending the inflation assumption be reduced from
3.00 percent to 2.25 percent. This reduction recognizes lower inflation expectations in both the near and
longer term. The change will bring it closer to recent inflation levels and closer to levels expected in the
financial markets. As you will see, this change also affects all other economic assumptions.

Retiree Cost‐of‐Living Adjustment (“COLA”) and Increases in the Pay Cap for 
Pensionable Pay for Participants Hired on and After January 1, 2011 
Automatic annual increases in the retirement annuity differ for employees who first become a participant
before or on or after January 1, 2011. Employees who first become a participant before January 1, 2011,
receive an increase equal to 3.00 percent of the current retirement annuity amount. Employees who first
become a participant on or after January 1, 2011, receive an increase equal to the lesser of 3.00 percent
or one‐half the annual change in the Consumer Price Index‐U, whichever is less, based on the originally
granted retirement annuity.
Based on the recommended price inflation assumption of 2.25 percent, we recommend a retiree COLA
assumption of 1.125 percent for employees who first become a participant on or after January 1, 2011.
For participants who first became members on and after January 1, 2011, pensionable salary, upon which
benefits and member contributions are based, is limited to $106,800 in 2011 and increased by the lesser
of 3.00 percent and one‐half of the annual unadjusted percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index‐U
(but not less than zero) as measured in the preceding 12‐month period ending with the September
preceding the November 1, which is the date that the new amount will be calculated and made available
to the pension funds.
Based on the recommended price inflation assumption of 2.25 percent, we recommend an assumption of
1.125 percent for future increases in the pay cap for pensionable pay.

Investment Return Assumption 
The investment return assumption is one of the principal assumptions used in any actuarial valuation of a
retirement plan. It is used to discount future expected benefit payments to the valuation date in order to
determine the liabilities of the plans. Even a small change to this assumption can produce significant
changes to the liabilities and contribution rates. Currently, it is assumed that future investment returns
will average 7.50 percent per year, net of investment expenses.

The allocation of assets within the universe of investment options will have a significant impact on the
overall performance. Therefore, it is meaningful to identify the range of expected returns based on the
fund’s targeted allocation of investments and an overall set of capital market assumptions.

Based on an analysis performed by Marquette Associates, which includes capital market assumptions
developed by Marquette Associates, the current target asset allocation produces a median return (50th
percentile) of 7.8 percent per year gross of investment fees over the next 10 years.
For comparison purposes, we applied the Fund’s target asset allocation, and performed a similar analysis
using capital market assumptions from a sample of 10 nationally known investment consulting firms.
Four of the investment consulting firms provided us with capital market expectations for longer time
horizons (20 to 30 years). Eight firms provided us with capital market expectations for shorter time
horizons (10 years or less).
These investment consulting firms periodically issue reports that describe their capital market
assumptions; that is, their estimates of expected returns, volatility and correlations among the different
asset classes. The assumptions for most of the investment consultants are for 2017. While some of these
assumptions may be based upon historical analysis, many of these firms also incorporate forward‐looking

adjustments to better reflect near‐term and long‐term expectations. The estimates for core investments
(i.e., fixed income, equities and real estate) are generally based on anticipated returns produced by
passive index funds, and do not consider additional returns which may be generated through active
management.
Given LABF’s current target asset allocation and the capital market assumptions from the investment
consultants, the development of the expected one‐year nominal return, net of investment expenses, is

 Analysis of Experience and Recommendations 
Based on each investment consulting firm’s assumptions, we estimated the expected real return of LABF’s
portfolio (col. (4)). Next, based on the actuary’s recommended inflation, we estimated the nominal return
net of expenses (col. (6)). As the tables show, the average one‐year nominal return (net of expenses) of
the firms with a short‐term investment horizon is 7.22 percent, and 7.83 percent using firms with long‐
term investment horizon, compared to the current investment return assumption of 7.50 percent.
However, in addition to examining the expected one‐year arithmetic return, it is very important to review
anticipated volatility of the investment portfolio and understand the range of long‐term net returns that
could be expected to be produced by the investment portfolio.
The following tables provide the 40th, 50th and 60th percentiles of the geometric average (10‐year for
short‐term investment horizon and 20‐year for long‐term investment horizon) of the expected nominal
return, net of expenses based on the recommended inflation assumption of 2.25 percent. The tables also
show the probability of exceeding the current 7.50 percent assumption and alternative lower
assumptions.

 Analysis of Experience and Recommendations 
As these tables indicate, the average expected rate of return at the 50th percentile based on (1) LABF’s
current target asset allocation, (2) the recommended inflation assumption of 2.25 percent and (3) the
capital market assumptions from the investment consultants is 6.44 percent under the shorter term
investment horizon and 7.08 percent under the longer term investment horizon.
Additionally, the average results of the investment firms with shorter term expectations indicate there is
about a 39.8 percent chance that the Fund will produce an average return that exceeds 7.50 percent in
the next 10 years, a 42.2 percent chance that the average return exceeds 7.25 percent and a 44.6 percent
chance that the average return exceeds 7.00 percent.
The average results of the investment firms with longer term expectations indicate there is about a 44.1
percent chance that the Fund will produce an average return that exceeds 7.50 percent in the next 20
years, a 47.6 percent chance that the average return exceeds 7.25 percent and a 51.1 percent chance that
the average return exceeds 7.00 percent.
A very important fact to consider when deciding what weight to put on shorter term results or longer
term results is the amount of benefits that are projected to be paid in the next 10 years. As shown in the
following table, about 52 percent of the actuarial accrued liability as of December 31, 2016, is attributable
to benefits that are projected to be paid in the next 10 years. Therefore, it is extremely important to
consider shorter term expectations in addition to longer term expectations when setting the economic
assumptions.

The National Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems (NCPERS) issued a publication in
January 2018, entitled “2017 NCPERS Public Retirement System Study”. As stated in the overview, “The
average investment assumption is 7.5 percent. This is the same as 2016…about 85 percent of funds who
have responded in 2017 have reduced their assumption or are considering doing so.”

Recommendation 
Based on our analysis of the expected investment return and the current target asset allocation, we
recommend reducing the investment return assumption to 7.00 percent for the actuarial valuation as of
December 31, 2017, reflecting an inflation assumption of 2.25 percent and a real rate of return of 4.75
percent. This recommendation falls within the range of expected geometric returns (i.e., 50th percentile)
of 6.44 percent to 7.08 percent, based on the average of the investment consultants’ expectations using
short and long‐term investment horizons.
We recommend that the assumed investment return be monitored for continued appropriateness
between experience reviews. Also, any significant changes in the target asset allocation of LABF may
warrant an additional review of the rate of return assumption.
We believe that this assumption can be supported by the Actuarial Standard of Practice No. 27. Under
the Standard, all economic assumptions must be selected to be consistent with the purpose of the

 Analysis of Experience and Recommendations 
measurement. The purpose of the measurement is to determine the contribution rate which will lead to
the accumulation of assets to pay benefits when due. The investment return assumption was last
changed from 8.00 percent to 7.50 percent for the December 31, 2012, actuarial valuation.

General Wage Inflation and Payroll Growth 
A General Wage Inflation (“GWI”) assumption represents the real wage growth over time in the general
economy. It is the assumption on how much the pay scales themselves will change year to year, not
necessarily how much the pay increases received by individuals are, or even necessarily how the payroll in
total may change, which can be affected by population changes, etc. Wage inflation consists of two
components, (1) a portion due to pure price inflation (i.e., increases due to changes in the CPI), and (2)
increases in average salary levels in excess of pure price inflation (i.e., increases due to changes in
productivity levels, supply and demand in the labor market and other macroeconomic factors).
The Average Wage Index (“AWI”), formerly named the National Average Earnings (“NAE”), series
published in connection with the operation of the Social Security program is a useful proxy for measuring
general changes in wage levels in the economy. Increases in AWI typically exceed increases in the
Consumer Price Index (CPI), although there are periods where the patterns are reversed. The economic
argument for wages exceeding prices in the long run is that CPI is based on the prices of a fixed basket of
goods whereas wages reflect innovations, real productivity growth, labor supply and demand and other
factors in addition to pure price inflation.

Since 1951, for the national economy as a whole, wage inflation has been about 1.00 percent larger than
price inflation each year. For the last 10 years, for the national economy as a whole, wage inflation has
been 2.33 percent, outpacing price inflation by about 0.52 percent. However, that spread will likely be
viewed as overstated due to the historically low inflation during the past decade. Over the past 10 years,
the average salaries for LABF members have increased 2.08 percent per year while national average
wages have increased 2.33 percent per year.
As with the investment return assumption, past experience does not necessarily dictate future
expectations. Current expectations are mixed on whether price and wage inflation will remain low in the
short term, particularly due to the after effects of recent federal government spending. For a long term
view, the 2017 Annual Report from the Trustees of the Social Security Administration (SSA) assumes an
intermediate average ultimate CPI of 2.6 percent over the next 75 years and an ultimate intermediate
growth assumption for average wages in covered employment of 3.8 percent. The SSA report provides
alternate “High‐cost” assumptions of 2.0 percent CPI/2.6 percent wages and “Low‐cost” assumptions of
3.2 percent CPI/5.0 percent wages.

Recommendation 
With the ongoing pressure on the ability of states to sustain across the board increases in wages is
consistent with historical norms, we do not believe there is justification to increase the assumption for
productivity increases; in other words, to increase the assumed gap between price increases and wage
growth. In fact, we recommend maintaining the assumption for productivity increases of 0.75 percent.
Combining this recommendation with our recommendation for price inflation of 2.25 percent implies a
wage inflation assumption of 3.00 percent. These assumptions are summarized below:

The payroll growth assumption is not used directly in the actuarial valuation or projections. However, it
represents the rate at which total payroll is expected to ultimately increase in the absence of any pay
caps.

Salary Increases 
In order to project future benefits, the actuary must project future salary increases. Salaries may increase
for a variety of reasons:











Across‐the‐board increases for all employees;
Across‐the‐board increases for a given group of employees;
Increases to a minimum salary schedule;
Additional pay for additional duties;
Step or service‐related increases;
Increases for acquisition of advanced degrees or specialized training;
Promotions;
Overtime;
Bonuses, if available; or
Merit increases.

Our salary increase assumption is meant to reflect all of these kinds of increases to the extent that they
are included in the pay used to determine contributions or plan benefits.
Most actuaries recommend salary increase assumptions that include an element that depends on the
member’s age or service, especially for large, state‐wide retirement systems. They assume larger pay
increases for younger or shorter‐service employees. This is done in order to reflect pay increases that
accompany changes in job responsibility, promotions, demonstrated merit, etc. The experience shows
salaries continue to be more closely correlated to service (rather than age), as promotions and
productivity increases tend to be greater in the first few years of a career, even if the new employee is
older than the average new hire. For this reason, we will continue to use salary scales based on service.
As part of analyzing the salary increase assumption, we reviewed actual salary experience for the five‐year
period ended December 31, 2016, and the Collective Bargaining Agreement between LiUNA Local 1001
and the City of Chicago for the five‐year term July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2022.
The components that determine the total salary increase are wage inflation, merit and longevity increases
and promotion increases. Over the experience study period, actual salary increases for LABF members
averaged 3.29 percent compared to expected total increases of 4.25 percent. During the same period,
actual general inflation averaged 1.36 compared to the current assumption of 3.00 percent. This implies
that actual real increases average 1.93 percent compared to the average expected real increase of 1.25
percent. Therefore, we recommend no change to the merit and longevity and promotion increase portion
of the salary increase assumption. However, we recommend a decrease in the wage inflation portion of
the salary increase assumption resulting in a decrease to the overall rates.
Observed experience for the first three years of service shows increases that were greater than expected.
We recommend increasing rates during the first three years of service and decreasing rates for service
periods of four or more years to better reflect actual experience.
This assumption was developed using both Tier One and Tier Two data and is applicable to both Tier One
and Tier Two members.

 Analysis of Experience and Recommendations 
Demographic Assumptions 
The following pages present the analysis of the demographic assumptions. These assumptions include
assumed rates of mortality among active and retired members, retirement patterns, and turnover
patterns. These patterns generally take the form of tables of rates of incidence based on age and/or years
of service.
Absent any significant changes in benefit provisions, these assumptions generally exhibit reasonable
consistency over periods of time. As a result, each demographic assumption is normally reviewed by
relating actual experience to that assumed over the recent past.
The analysis of demographic experience is conducted for each assumption using a measure known as the
“Actual to Expected (A/E) Ratio.” The A/E Ratio is simply the ratio of the actual number of occurrences of
the event to which the assumption applies (e.g., deaths or retirements) to the number expected to occur
in accordance with the assumption. An A/E Ratio of 1.00 indicates that the assumption precisely
predicted the number of occurrences. An A/E Ratio exceeding 1.00 indicates that the assumption
underestimated actual experience. Conversely, an A/E Ratio lower than 1.00 indicates that the
assumption overestimated actual experience.
These are statistical analyses. As a result, there are several considerations we must keep in mind as we
analyze these ratios:
1. An actuarial assumption is designed to reflect average experience over long periods of time (30 ‐ 50
years). As a result:
a.

A deviation between actual experience and that expected from our assumptions for one or
two years does not necessarily mean that the assumption should be changed.

b. A change in actuarial assumption should result if the experience indicates a consistent pattern
which is different from that assumed over a period of years.
2. The larger the amount of data available, the more reliable the statistics used in the analysis. As a
result:
a. Events that occur with great frequency (e.g., general employment turnover) are more credibly
predictable than those occurring less frequently (e.g., active member death).
b. In all cases, data covering the entire study period produce more credible results than data for
a single year.
c. Year by year experience is helpful only in identifying trends and determining whether the four‐
year data is truly reflective of the entire period.
This analysis is based on the valuation data for the five‐year period from January 1, 2012, to December 31,
2016.

 Analysis of Experience and Recommendations 
Mortality 
 
Post‐retirement mortality is an important component in cost calculations and should be updated from
time to time to reflect current and expected future longevity improvements. Pre‐retirement mortality is a
relatively minor component in cost calculations. The frequency of pre‐retirement deaths is so low that
mortality assumptions based on actual experience can only be produced for very large retirement
systems.

Actuarial Standards of Practice  
Actuarial Standards of Practice (“ASOP”) No. 35 Disclosure Section 4.1.1 states, “The disclosure of the
mortality assumption should contain sufficient detail to permit another qualified actuary to understand
the provision made for future mortality improvement. If the actuary assumes zero mortality
improvement after the measurement date, the actuary should state that no provision was made for
future mortality improvement.” The current mortality rates used in the valuation include a provision for
future mortality improvement.
The New Mortality Tables and Projection Scale 
The Society of Actuaries’ (SOA’s) Retirement Plans Experience Committee (“RPEC”) released updated
mortality tables late in 2014 (the RP‐2014 tables) which reflect the improvement in longevity of the
studied group of private pension plan participants, and which also reflects projected future improvements
for current and future generations of participants. The approach we have taken to recommending a
mortality assumption for the LABF actuarial valuation is based on the RPEC 2014 model described by the
Society of Actuaries (“SOA”). In effect, we select a base mortality table from the RP‐2014 mortality tables
(consisting of blue collar, white collar and total gender‐specific base mortality tables for actives, retireds
and disabled plan members) and a mortality improvement scale based on the 2‐dimensional MP‐2017
mortality improvement scales projected from the base year of 2006 after adjusting for MP‐2014
improvements. Although it is anticipated that the SOA will release new improvement scales annually, for
purposes of LABF actuarial valuations, we recommend maintaining the MP‐2017 improvement scales until
the next experience study. The mortality improvement scale is applied to the RP‐2014 table to reflect
improvements in mortality that are expected to occur with each new generation of participants.
 
Mortality Improvement Observations at a National Level  
 
The updated mortality and mortality improvement tables show that among males age 65, overall
longevity rose 2.0 years, from age 84.6 in 2000 to 86.6 in 2014. Saying it another way, men aged 65 in the
year 2000 were expected to live to be 84.6 years old. Men aged 65 in the year 2014 were expected to live
to be 86.6 years old. For women age 65, overall longevity rose 2.4 years from age 86.4 in 2000 to age 88.8
in 2014.

 Analysis of Experience and Recommendations 
Findings 
 

The mortality experience was reviewed on a benefit weighted basis for retired members in pay status and
on a headcount basis for active members. The observed experience was compared to the current
mortality table and an updated baseline table, i.e. the RP‐2014 Blue Collar Annuitant Mortality Table for
retirees and the RP‐2014 Blue Collar Employee Mortality Table for active members.
The following table compares the actual number of benefit weighted deaths to the expected number of
benefit weighted deaths for retired members:

Although the experience has limited credibility, the experience on a benefit weighted basis shows that
more retired members died than expected.
When compared to the current mortality table, the updated mortality table is expected to produce fewer
benefit weighted deaths.
We applied credibility and “best‐fit” factors to the baseline mortality table to recognize a portion of the
observed mortality experience. The credibility factor applies more weight to the observed mortality
experience as the sample size of the group and number of deaths increases. The “best‐fit” factor
compares actual deaths during the experience period to expected deaths during the period using a
baseline mortality table. The following table shows the development of the scaling factor that is applied
to the recommended base mortality table (RP‐2014 Blue Collar Healthy Mortality) for retirees. The scaling
factor increased baseline mortality rates by 17 percent for male retirees and 2 percent for female retires.

A Note about Mortality Rates  
The recommended mortality assumptions include generational mortality improvements, which means
that the probability of a 60‐year‐old retired male dying in any particular year is lower for a 60‐year old
born in 1994 than a 60‐year‐old born in 1954.
The use of generational mortality tables is based on the assumption that life expectancy increases from
generation to generation. Simply put, this means that the life expectancy of someone born in 1994 is
greater than that of someone born in 1954.

 Analysis of Experience and Recommendations 
Retirement 
The Plan provisions establish the minimum eligibility requirements for retirement. Participants of the
plan that became members before January 1, 2011, are eligible for immediate retirement benefits under
the minimum annuity formula at the earlier of age 50 and 30 years of service, age 55 and 20 years of
service, or age 60 and 10 years of service. (Benefits under the money purchase formula are available to
members at least age 55 with 10 years of service.) Retirement cost, however, is determined not by the
minimum eligibility requirements but by the ages at which members actually retire. The actuarial
valuation does not assume that everyone retires at earliest eligibility. The assumption about timing of
retirement once eligibility has been established is a major component in cost calculations. Note that
higher rates of retirement at earlier retirement ages or years of service upon attaining retirement
eligibility generally result in higher actuarially determined contributions, and vice versa.
Experience during the last five years was considered in the analysis shown on the following pages. The
“Exposure” column shows the number of employees eligible to retire at various years of service or ages
throughout the experience period. An individual could potentially be counted up to five times if eligible
each year in the period. By tabulating employees in this fashion we are able to answer the question “For
all employees eligible at condition X, how many retired?”
Actual rates of retirement were less than expected for all ages signifying that members are retiring later
and in less numbers than expected. More specifically, for ages 55 through 64 actual retirements were
considerably lower than expected. The trend of members remaining in active service until Medicare
eligible is due in part to the uncertain future of the retiree health insurance supplement and other
subsidized retiree healthcare benefits. To account for this, we recommend using 55 percent of the
current rates for ages 55 through 64 and 70 percent of the current rates for the remaining age and service
bands.
Applying the proposed rates to historical data generates the following number of retirements by age at
retirement:

 Analysis of Experience and Recommendations 
Turnover 
Currently, turnover rates are based solely on service. Based on our analysis, no credible patterns of age‐
based terminations were present; therefore, we are recommending the service based structure.
We also examined turnover behavior between benefit groups (before and after January 1, 2011) and
found subtle difference between the tiers. Thus, we recommend one set of turnover assumptions apply
to all Tiers and will monitor Tier Two turnover as experience emerges.
It is not uncommon to have separate turnover rates for males and females. However, GRS examined LABF
experience separated by gender and did not find that it warranted a separate table.
Turnover experience during the last five years was considered in the analysis shown on the following
pages. The “Exposure” column shows the number of employees at various years of service throughout the
experience period. The number of exposures excludes members that were eligible to retire with a
minimum annuity formula benefit.
The “Turnover” column shows the number of employees at various years of service that have gone from
active status for reasons other than retirement and death. This includes members moving to inactive
status and members terminating and receiving a refund of contributions.
In this plan, there is considerable movement between active and inactive status. Typically, we would
consider a status change from active to inactive a termination in developing turnover rates. However,
because many of these participants return to active status and accrue additional benefits, we have
considered this in our analysis of turnover experience.
There were fewer terminations than expected under the current assumptions. Based on our analysis, we
recommend maintaining service‐based rates and making the following changes to the turnover rates:




Increase the rate of turnover during the first year of service and decrease rates for service of three
or more years to recognize actual experience and the impact of inactive members returning to
active status and accruing additional future benefits; and
Maintain a pattern of termination rates that grade down to an ultimate rate of 1.0 percent until a
member is eligibility for retirement.

The table and graph on the following pages show termination experience by service.

 Analysis of Experience and Recommendations 
Disability 
We recommend continuing to value disability as a term cost only. When reviewing the disability
experience, a majority of the disabilities were short‐term in nature. We feel that it is appropriate to
continue considering these members as active members and load the normal cost to reflect the near‐term
cash flow. We recommend reviewing the data periodically to ensure that the assumption remains
reasonable.
We recommend increasing the term cost assumption for disability from 2.50 to 3.00 percent of payroll.
The following table shows a history of annual disability payments as a percent of total payroll over the last
five years.

RECOMMENDED ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

Recommended Actuarial Assumptions 
Recommended Actuarial Assumptions to be adopted for the December 31, 2017, 
Valuation 
Demographic Assumptions 
Post‐Retirement Mortality  
Scaling factors of 117 percent for males, and 102 percent for females of the RP‐2014 Blue Collar Healthy
Annuitant mortality table, sex distinct, with generational mortality improvement using MP‐2017 2‐
dimensional mortality improvement scales recently released by the SOA. This assumption provides a
margin for mortality improvements. No adjustment is made for post‐disabled mortality.
Pre‐Retirement Mortality 
Scaling factors of 109 percent for males, and 103 percent for females of the RP‐2014 Blue Collar Employee
mortality table, sex distinct, with generational mortality improvement using MP‐2017 2‐dimensional
mortality improvement scales recently released by the SOA. This assumption provides a margin for
mortality improvements.
Future mortality improvements in pre‐ and post‐retirement mortality are reflected by projecting the base
mortality tables back from the year 2014 to the year 2006 using the MP‐2014 projection scale and
projecting from 2006 using the MP‐2017 projection scale.
We use what is termed “the limited fluctuation credibility procedure” to determine the appropriate
scaling factor of the base mortality tables for each gender and each member classification. We used a
benefits weighted basis for postretirement mortality and used a headcount basis for preretirement
mortality. In each case, the partial credibility factor (or “Z‐factor”) is computed based on the experience
of the specific group being studied. This Z‐factor is a measure of the credibility of the pertinent group.  
 
The Best Fit is the ratio of actual to expected deaths using the base table. The final scale is then
determined as the weighted average of the Best Fit and 100 percent based on the Z‐factor. For example,
the Z‐factor for Male Active Members is 22 percent, suggesting that the data for this group is 22 percent
credible (there were not enough deaths among active members to be completely credible). The Best Fit
for this group would be to scale the base tables by 142 percent. The final scale of 109 percent is the
credibility‐weighted average (109% = 22% x 142% + 78% x 100%). Factors for other groups are
determined similarly.

 Recommended Actuarial Assumptions 
Economic Assumptions 
Investment Return and Discount Rate: 7.00 percent per year, compounded annually, net of investment
expenses. The 7.00 percent assumption is composed of a 2.25 percent inflation assumption and a 4.75
percent real rate of return assumption.
General Inflation: 2.25 percent per year, compounded annually.
This assumption serves as the basis for the determination of annual increases in pension and the
pensionable salary cap for Tier Two and Tier Three members.
Wage Inflation and Payroll Growth: 3.00 percent per year, compounded annually.
Future Salary Increases:  The assumed base rate of individual salary increase is 3.00 percent per year
(underlying wage inflation assumption), plus a service‐based increase in the first ten years.

Asset Value:  The Actuarial Value of Assets is smoothed by using a five‐year phase‐in of each year’s
unexpected investment gains and losses.
Expenses:  Administrative expenses included in the normal cost are based on the previous years’
administrative expenses increased by 2.25 percent and discounted to the beginning of the year. Future
administrative expenses are assumed to increase at the assumed inflation assumption of 2.25 percent. 

Other Assumptions and Provisions 
Marital Status: It is assumed that 75 percent of active members have an eligible spouse. The male
spouse is assumed to be three years older than the female spouse. No assumption is made about other
dependents.
Reciprocal Service: No assumption for reciprocal service.
Benefit Service:  Exact fractional years of service are used to determine the amount of benefit payable.

 Recommended Actuarial Assumptions 
Decrement Timing:  All decrements are assumed to occur mid‐year.
Decrement Relativity: Decrement rates are used directly from the experience study, without adjustment
for multiple decrement table effects.
Decrement Operation: Turnover decrements do not operate after member reaches retirement eligibility
for a minimum annuity formula benefit.
Eligibility Testing: Eligibility for benefits is determined based upon the age nearest birthday and service
on the date the decrement is assumed to occur.
Pay Increase Timing: Middle of the (fiscal) year.

 Summary
• The recommended changes in economic
assumptions due to revised expectations for
future real investment returns and inflation have
a more significant impact on the cost of the plan
compared to the changes in demographic
assumptions
• We have made our recommendations for
assumption changes in accordance with the
Actuarial Standards of Practice, recommending
assumptions that reflect a best estimate for
future experience
