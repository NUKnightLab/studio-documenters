J. Community Health Report Project DAWN Expansion (See Enclosure.) Ms. Barrett reported the
—

goal to distribute an additional 1,300 Project Dawn kits throughout Summit County with a timeline of
February 1,2009 through April 30,2019. Barberton isa new site to provide education and distribute
kits. Mr. Karant questioned since pharmacies carry their own kits for retail sale and have a medical
director in the same building but not in ourfacility how does that affect any of the retail pharmacies
that are a part of Project DAWN? Does that affect our ability to possess kits and use them, otherwise it
would be an out ofpocket expense We do a lot ofoutpatient drug abuse recovery, with three orfour
differentfacilities. If we have an incident in ourfacility we would have to use our narcotic with no real
compensation. ifyou have access through Project Dawn, which we have, would that affect
pharmacies/retail establishments that provide that type ofservice? Is there a policy or provision
where we would not have access to the kits to replace them if used? Ms. Barrett willfollow-up and
advise.
