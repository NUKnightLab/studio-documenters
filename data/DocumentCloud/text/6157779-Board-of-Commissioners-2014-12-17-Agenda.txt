PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
ZERO-BASED BUDGETING
WHEREAS, fiscal responsibility, innovative leadership, transparency and accountability, and improved
services have been and continue to be the underlying mission of the current President and the Cook County
Board of Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, in the effort to succeed in said mission, the Performance Management Initiative was launched

Page 6 of 72

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

December 17, 2014

WHEREAS, the County faces serious financial and policy challenges in the coming year and years to come
such as stabilizing the pension fund, reforming the criminal justice system, and managing healthcare
services to name a few; and
WHEREAS, the County must continually look to ameliorate the budget process in order to deliver public
services in the most efficient manner; and
WHEREAS, focusing on outcome of services for dollars invested is crucial, this government should also
look at cost structure related to those service outputs and determine if we are expending appropriately and
efficiently as well as justifying expenses from year to year and over several years; and
WHEREAS, adding to the successful steps already taken by this Administration and Board of
Commissioners, the implementation of a formal Zero-Based Budgeting Program (ZBB) for all County
elected officials, agencies, bureaus and departments, an inherent tool of Performance Management and
Budgeting, would serve to enhance the aforementioned efforts; and
WHEREAS, zero-based budgeting helps to shed light on imperfections in performance-based budgeting
methodology, which can obscure specific programs and make it difficult for the public and legislators to
identify unnecessary or low priority programs being funded; and
WHEREAS, due to the time-consuming nature of said process, the ZBB program may be implemented as a
periodic, revolving review of County agencies’ operations and budgets;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 2
Administration, Article X, Performance Based Management Budgeting, Sec. 2-934 of the Cook County
Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 2-934. - Budget review and allocation.

County Departmental or Agency activities and the expected level of performance to ensure performance
based management and budgeting. The Budget Resource Allocation Plan shall clearly indicate which
services are statutorily mandated and to what extent services are required. If the Budget Resource
Allocation Plan requests funding for services or programs not mandated by law, justification shall be
presented to show how such services or programs enhance County services.
(d) In any given year the President's budget resource allocation plan shall include zero-based budgeting (a
budget based upon a justification of estimates of expenditures and requests for appropriations from a zero
base) for the County agencies, departments and programs as identified by the President and the Department
of Budget and Management Services with an objective of 10% of said agencies, departments and programs
per year starting with the FY2016 budget. Each agency shall be required to use zero-based budgeting at
least once every six years and shall not be required to use zero-based budgeting more often than once every
four years. The President and the Department of Budget and Management Services shall prescribe the
forms and format for zero-based budgets and serve as the entity designated for coordinating the preparation
of zero-base budgets by the executive branch.
(e) In the years in which zero-based budgeting applies, each budget unit shall include in its budget
estimate an analysis summarizing the prior two fiscal years and proposed spending plans by program,
object class, and revenue source. Information presented shall include the following:
(1) A summary of the budget unit's departmental and program purposes; program efficiency, program
effectiveness, program outcomes and cost-benefit analysis and an analysis of the customer or client base
served by the program and delivery of service alternatives and program size indicators; and
(2) A priority listing encompassing all alternative funding levels for all programs with a minimum of three
provided that at least two of these alternative funding levels shall be below the funding level for the current
fiscal year, and shall require that the baseline budget of each department or agency is assumed to be zero
and each proposed expenditure shall be justified as if it were a new expenditure.

under subsection (e) of this Code and such other relevant material as deemed appropriate by the President.
(dg) The President shall present the proposed Budget Resource Allocation Plan of each County
Department and Agency to the Board for review.
(eh) The President or his or her designee, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Administrative Officer
shall review the Quarterly Record submissions and analyze performance data with a consideration of
proposed Budget Resource Allocation Plans to determine the effectiveness of strategies, program
performance, and justification for continued, increased, or decreased funding.

Summary: The solar walls will be installed at four (4) Cook County Highway facilities (Des Plaines,
Orland Park, Schaumburg, and Riverdale). The solar walls will be built vertically and affixed to existing
building walls with southern orientations to maximize energy harvest. The solar walls will offset the
natural gas used to heat these facilities that are responsible for the maintenance of 1,474 lane miles of
pavement, 130 bridges, 332 traffic signals & 5 pumping stations within Cook County. The solar wall
systems convert solar energy to heat with up to 80% efficiency and will reduce gas fired unit heaters
natural gas usage by 2.04 therms/sqft of solar wall eliminating dependency on natural gas fired heat for
much of the heating season.
One primary goal of this installation is to help the County approach its goal of reducing greenhouse gas

PROPOSED INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT AMENDMENT
Department: Bureau of Technology
Other Part(ies): Chicago Transit Authority
Request:

Approval of Amendment

Goods or Services: Intergovernmental agreement (IGA) between Bureau of Technology (BOT) and the
Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) to provide access to and use of portions of the CTA's fiber optic cable
system.
Agreement Number: N/A
Agreement Period: 3/14/2012-3/13/2022
Fiscal Impact:

None

Accounts: 499-220
Summary: The original IGA, having a term of ten years, allowed the County to use eight (8) CTA dark
fiber strands to build the County’s broadband network (Network) from downtown Chicago to the CTA’s
Pink Line Polk Street Station and Stroger Hospital of Cook County. This IGA amendment will allow the
County to extend the Network along the CTA Pink Line and Blue Line, from the current endpoint of
CTA’s Pink Line Kostner Station to a new endpoint of Forest Park Blue Line Station. The amendment
would also add an interconnection point at the CTA’s Green Line 35th Street Station, allowing the
County to interconnect its other fiber assets. Additionally, this amendment will reduce Cook County’s
responsibility for unplanned repair/construction costs by sharing those unplanned costs with other
entities that hold IRUs in the same fiber path.
The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office has approved this IGA as to form.

PROPOSED INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT
Department: Bureau of Technology
Other Part(ies): Lake County, Illinois
Request: Intergovernmental Agreement
Goods or Services: GIS software and digital ortho-imagery products and geodatabase design
Agreement Number(s): N/A
Agreement Period: Sixteen months from the date of signing
Fiscal Impact: None
Accounts: N/A
Summary: The Cook County Department of GIS respectfully requests this Board enter into an IGA
with Lake County for GIS procurement of ground control products, aerial imagery products, analytical
aerotriangulation products, DEM products, digital ortho-imagery products, geodatabase design and
project management. Cook County acquires ortho-imagery every year as the foundation for its
geographic information system environment. The County also coordinates the regional GIS
ortho-imagery acquisition and standards review for the Federal 133 Urban Areas Program, which
supports the USGS National Map. This proposed 2014 GIS IGA will succeed and replace Cook
County’s prior, identical GIS IGAs with Lake County in 2010 and 2012.
Like the prior 2010 and 2012 GIS IGAs with Lake County, this proposed 2014 GIS IGA with Lake
County will not have a fiscal impact. Lake County will be reimbursing Cook County an amount not to
exceed $105,326.57, which is the proportional share of services procured for ground control products,
aerial imagery products, analytical aerotriangulation products, DEM products, digital ortho-imagery
products, geodatabase design and project management.
Also like the previous IGAs with Lake County, this collaboration will yield economic and operational
efficiency by eliminating the duplication of effort and expense in two separate procurements of the same
aerial imagery services, as well as ensure geospatial data standards are met by both government agencies.
The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office has approved this IGA as to form.

Summary: A contract extension and increase are requested to authorize Presence Behavioral Health to

support, drug treatment and support to persons charged with felony prostitution. The program helps low
level criminal defendants who suffer from an underlying mental health, social or substance abuse
problem from becoming repeat offenders. The hallmark of the program is intensive judicial supervision
and the delivery of treatment and services from community-based sources, such as Presence which has
provided services to the Circuit Court's Specialty/Treatment Courts Program since 2010.
