Item No. 9

AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A POWER PURCHASE AND LEASE AGREEMENT WITH VLV
DEVELOPMENT FOR THE SUPPLY OF RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY AT DEARBORN HOMES
Presenters:

Derek Messier, Chief Property Officer
Ellen M. Sargent, Director, Sustainable Initiatives and Projects

Recommendation
It is recommended that the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) Board of Commissioners approve
the attached Resolution authorizing the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or his designee to enter
into a Power Purchase and Lease Agreement (PPLA) with VLV Development for the supply of
renewable electricity at Dearborn Homes.
The requested action complies in all material respects with all applicable federal, state and local
laws, and CHA Board policies. Staff have completed all necessary due diligence to support the
submission of this initiative.
FUNDING:

Property Office Operating Fund for Utilities

BACKGROUND:
The local distributor of electricity for Chicago, Commonwealth Edison (ComEd), received a U. S.
Department of Energy SunShot grant to build a microgrid in the Bronzeville community. ComEd
then issued an RFP for Solar Developers to submit proposals to install solar electricity generation
facilities within the established boundaries of the Bronzeville microgrid.
There are multiple CHA properties within these established boundaries and two solar developers
approached the CHA to asses Dearborn Homes for a potential solar project. However, only VLV
Development asked the CHA to partner on submitting a proposal in response to ComEd’s
solicitation for the installation of an onsite distributed solar generation system at Dearborn
Homes.
ComEd choose VLV’s proposal and awarded them a contract to design, install, operate and
maintain this solar system. The next step is for the CHA to enter into a Power Purchase and Lease
Agreement (PPLA) with VLV to buy the electricity that the solar installation will generate. The
PPLA will be a sole source contract with VLV because they were the only solar developer that
chose to partner with the CHA in response to the RFP solicited by ComEd.
1

 In accordance with 2 CFR 200.319, the justification for awarding a sole source contract to VLV
Development is because these services are available only from a single source. The grant funding
to build the solar array is only available through the ComEd RFP, and the awarded solar developer
from the RFP is VLV Development; who is also the only solar developer that asked the CHA to
partner with them in submitting a proposal to ComEd’s RFP.
The current technical performance model for the solar installation anticipates that it will
generate 15% of Dearborn Homes’ annual electrical usage. The PPLA with VLV will detail the
responsibilities for operations and maintenance of all equipment and materials that collectively
generate renewable energy for a term up to 20 years. This agreement will also confirm a unit
price per kWh of electricity generated from the solar installation.
