In the matter of Marco Di Franco; Pursuant to 40 ILCS 5/5-214 and 40 ILCS 5/5-214.2 and for all

credit for the period September 16, 1996 to May 20, 1998, at which time he was employed as a
customs inspector with the United States Customs and Border Protection, as the statutory provisions
of the Act do not grant police pension service credit for such service. Di Franco's request for police

Mr. Kaczmarz informed the Trustees that the Fund has negotiated a collection agreement with the
daughter of a member that continued to receive benefit payments for two years after the death of
the Widowed Annuitant. Mr. Kaczmarz requested that the Board approve the terms of that
collection which includes an $18,000 up front payment and a monthly payment of approx. $850
per month for one year. The Trustees directed Mr. Kaczmarz and Mr. Kugler to proceed.
Mr. Kaczmarz informed the Trustees of another over payment situation involving the continued
payment of Retirement Benefits to a widow for 6 months after the member’s death. The Widow is
entitled to benefits and a one-time death benefit. She has requested that she be allowed to repay
the balance of the amount owed over a 24-month period. The Board concurred and directed Mr.
Kaczmarz and Mr. Kugler to proceed.
Staff presented the situation concerning the Death Benefit for member MacFarland. MacFarland
died having previously directed that his death benefit be paid to his former spouse as primary and
daughter as his contingent beneficiaries. Mrs. MacFarland was ill and subsequently died as well.
Her current husband filed for the Death Benefit to be paid to her estate. The question is whether
the contingent beneficiaries should be paid. After a brief discussion, the trustees agreed that
because the primary beneficiary was alive at the time the member died, her estate was rightly
entitled to the Death Benefit.
The Board directed Mr. Kaczmarz to obtain a bid to produce only 1000 of the Fund’s Code Books
for members who still desire a printed copy.
All business concluded, it was moved by Trustee Hamburger, seconded by Trustee Wright that this
meeting be adjourned
