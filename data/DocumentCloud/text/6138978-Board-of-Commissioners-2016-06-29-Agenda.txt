STANLEY MOORE, County Commissioners
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING ON CONGRESS TO REPEAL THE DICKEY AMENDMENT
WHEREAS, on October 7, 1993, a study titled “Gun Ownership as a Risk Factor for Homicide in the
Home” sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and published in the New England Journal
of Medicine (Vol. 329 No. 15) concluded that rather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are
associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance, and that
residents in homes with a gun faced a 2.7-fold greater risk of homicide and a 4.8-fold greater risk of
suicide; and
WHEREAS, this peer-reviewed published study that analyzed 1860 homicides recorded in 3 U.S.
Counties from August 23, 1987, and August 23, 1992, also concluded that although firearms are often
Page 6 of 83

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

June 29, 2016

kept in homes for personal protection, the practice is counterproductive and that efforts to increase home
security have largely focused on preventing unwanted entry, but the greatest threat to the lives of
household members appears to come from within; and
WHEREAS, as a result of the publication of this study, the National Rifle Association moved to
suppress the dissemination of the results and to block funding of future government research into the
causes of firearm injuries. Hence, in 1996, the NRA lobbied to include an amendment to an
appropriations bill that removed $2.6 million from the CDC’s budget, the amount the agency’s injury
center had spent on firearms-related research the previous year; and
WHEREAS, named after its author Jay Dickey, a Republican member of the United States House of
Representatives from Arkansas, the now known as the Dickey amendment, is a provision first inserted as
a rider into the 1996 federal government omnibus spending bill which mandated that “none of the funds
made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) may be used to advocate or promote gun control”; and
WHEREAS, the Dickey amendment has been part of the federal government spending bill ever since,
preventing U.S. scientists from answering a most basic question: “What works to prevent firearm
injuries?”; and
WHEREAS, on July 27, 2012, Jay Dickey, through a Washington Post Opinion, called to repeal the
amendment that bears his name, and to conduct scientific research into preventing firearm injuries and to
find ways to prevent firearm deaths without encroaching on the rights of legitimate gun owners; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Dickey also rationalizes that “the federal government has invested billions to
understand the causes of motor vehicle fatalities and, with that knowledge, has markedly reduced traffic
deaths in the United States. Since the mid-1970s, research has inspired such interventions as child
restraints, seat belts, frontal air bags, a minimum drinking age and motorcycle helmets. The National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that 366,000 lives were saved through such efforts
from 1975 to 2009”; and
WHEREAS, in an editorial in the April 7, 2015 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine, a team of doctors
wrote: "It does not matter whether we believe that guns kill people or that people kill people with
guns-the result is the same: a public health crisis"; and
WHEREAS, in a Mother Jones article published in April, 2015, an analysis of data from 2012 conducted
in collaboration with Ted Miller from the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, an independent
nonprofit that studies public health, education, and safety issues, found that the annual cost of
gun
violence in America exceeds $229 billion. Direct costs account for $8.6 billion-including long-term
prison costs for people who commit assault and homicide using guns, which at $5.2 billion a year is the
largest direct expense; and that the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America
is
nearly $400,000. Indirect costs amount to at least $221 billion, about $169 billion of which comes from
what researchers consider to be the impact on victims' quality of life. Victims' lost wages, which account
for $49 billion annually, are the other major factor; and

BOARD AGENDA

June 29, 2016

WHEREAS, on December 2, 2015, physicians with Doctors for America joined the National Physicians
Alliance, Doctors Council, American Medical Women’s Association, American College of Preventive
Medicine, The Committee of Interns and Residents, Physicians for the Prevention of Gun Violence,
American Medical Student Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, and Reps. David Price, Nita
Lowey, Mike Thompson, Robin Kelly and Mike Quigley to urge Congress to end the effective ban on the
ability for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) to conduct research on gun violence. Over 2,000 doctors in all 50 states plus the District of
Columbia signed a petition urging Congress to remove the barriers to common sense research that have
existed for nearly 20 years and include annual funding to identify causes and ways to prevent gun
violence.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the members of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners do hereby urge the United States Congress and the United States Senate to repeal the
Dickey Amendment and fund scientific research into preventing firearm injuries and the prevention of
firearm deaths; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners hereby directs the
Secretary of the Board to send a copy of this Resolution to Joseph R. Biden, Vice-President; Sen. Mitch
McConnell, Majority Leader; Sen. Harry Reid, Democratic Leader; Rep. Paul D. Ryan, Speaker of the
House; Rep. Kevin McCarthy, Majority Leader; and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING ON THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS TO ENACT AND
THE GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS TO SIGN A STATEWIDE BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS
WHEREAS, in July of 2014 the Cook County Board of Commissioners approved a nonbinding,
county-wide voter referendum calling on the Illinois General Assembly to enact the Illinois Public Safety
Act, Senate Bill 3659, requiring universal background checks for firearm transfers and prohibiting the
sale and transfer of assault weapons, assault weapon attachments and high capacity ammunition
magazines; and
WHEREAS, on November 4, 2014 the voters of Cook County approved the aforementioned referendum,
with 87 per cent of the votes cast in favor; and
WHEREAS, the General Assembly adjourned in 2015 without taking action on Senate Bill 3659; and
WHEREAS, in the year that followed this failure to enact meaningful firearm legislation, 2015, 2,996
people in the City of Chicago were shot, with 445 of those shooting victims killed; and
WHEREAS, in 2016 to date 1,810 people have been shot, and over 300 people killed; and
WHEREAS, in 2016 to date the Chicago Police Department has confiscated and removed from the
streets of Chicago over 2,400 guns; and
Page 8 of 83

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

June 29, 2016

WHEREAS, in 2016 to date the Cook County Sheriff has confiscated and removed from the streets of
Cook County 347 guns; and
WHEREAS, the recent massacre in an Orlando, Florida, as well as too many other similar incidents
throughout the United States of America, have shown the extraordinary damage and loss of life that can
be caused by semi-automatic assault weapons and high capacity magazines; and
WHEREAS, gun violence in Chicago and Cook County has reached a crisis point requiring swift and
meaningful legislative action; and,
WHEREAS, military-style assault weapons have no place on the streets of the City of Chicago in Cook
County, as they have no purpose other than to kill; and
WHEREAS, it is right and proper that the Cook County Board of Commissioners should express the
will of the body on the issue of gun violence generally, and on assault weapons specifically, because of
the extraordinary cost of gun violence to the Health and Hospitals System, Jail and Circuit Court of Cook
County;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners do hereby call upon the General Assembly of the State of Illinois to enact and the
Governor of Illinois to sign a statewide ban on assault weapons.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING FOR THE CREATION OF A GUN VIOLENCE RESEARCH CONSORTIUM AS A
PROJECT OF THE COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITAL SYSTEM’S
COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH UNIT
WHEREAS, every year the physicians of the Cook County Health and Hospital System’s Stroger
Hospital treat approximately 900 victims of gun violence; and
WHEREAS, the cost to Cook County taxpayers of treating victims of gun violence typically ranges
between $35,000.00 and $50,000.00 per victim; and,
WHEREAS, Chicago and Cook County are presently engulfed in a gun violence crisis, with 1,823
people in Chicago shot in 2016 to date, and 312 people killed during this same time period; and
WHEREAS, gun violence in Chicago and Cook County has strained the resources of Cook County and
stretched the limits of many of the institutions of Cook County government, including the Cook County
Medical Examiner, Cook County Jail, the Cook County Circuit Court, and the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System, among others; and

Page 9 of 83

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

June 29, 2016

WHEREAS, numerous national, regional and local public policy experts have clearly identified gun
violence as a public health issue; and,
WHEREAS, on June 14, 2016, the American Medical Association publicly proclaimed Gun Violence to
be a “Public Health Crisis,” and implored the United States Congress to lift its ban on research of gun
violence by Centers for Disease Control (CDC); and
WHEREAS, on June 21, 2016, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and Cook County
Health and Hospitals System CEO, Dr. Jay Shannon, stood with other leaders and advocates and
demanded that the gun violence epidemic in Chicago and Cook County be treated as a public health
crisis; and
WHEREAS, Dr. Shannon stated that, as a health crisis, gun violence “has to be addressed with an
equally complex, data-driven approach”; and
WHEREAS, Cook County Health and Hospitals System engages in multiple forms of research in order
to expand and improve understanding of the diseases and related conditions impacting the patients that
the system serves; and
WHEREAS, among the research projects operating under the auspices of the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System are the AIDS Malignancy Consortium, the Intimate Partner Violence Protocol, and the
Chicago Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Prevention Epicenter (CARPE); and
WHEREAS, Cook County Health and Hospitals System contains a Collaborative Research Unit which
was created in 1998 to promote research on significant problems impacting the health of the vulnerable
and diverse patient populations of Cook County; and

Commissioners do hereby call for the creation, by the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, of a
Gun Violence Research Consortium, as a project of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System’s

analyze a broad scope of activities, including but not limited to clinical care, health services research,

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
ESTABLISHING EMPLOYER PAID SICK LEAVE FOR RESIDENTS OF COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of government pursuant to the 1970 Illinois
Constitution, Article VII, Section 6 (a); and
WHEREAS, pursuant to their home rule powers, the Cook County Commissioners may exercise any
power and perform any function relating to their governments and affairs, including the power to regulate
for the protection of the public health, safety, morals, and welfare; and
WHEREAS, promoting the public health and welfare for those who work within the County’s border
plainly meets this criterion; and,
WHEREAS, employees in every industry occasionally require time away from the workplace to tend to
their own health or the health of family members: and
WHEREAS, in Cook County, XX percent of private sector workers received no paid sick leave; and,
WHEREAS, paid sick leave has a positive effect of the health of not only employees and their family
members, but also the health of fellow workers and public at large and the most comprehensive national
survey of U.S. restaurant workers found that two-thirds of restaurant wait staff and cooks have come to
work sick; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Health and Hospitals System spends between 350 and 500 million in
uncompensated care and has an interest in the health of County residents; and
WHEREAS, paid sick leave reduces health care expenditures by promoting access to primary and
preventative care and reduces reliance on emergency care; and
WHEREAS, nationally providing all workers with paid sick leave would result in 1.1 billion in annual
savings in hospital emergency department costs; and
WHEREAS, over 20 municipalities including New York City, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland and
Jersey City have passed legislation requiring employers within their jurisdictions to provide paid sick
leave; and
WHEREAS, a cost model developed by the Civic Consulting Alliance found that the paid sick leave
framework reflected in this ordinance would result in only a small, 0.7 to 1.5 increase in labor costs for
most employers.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter
42, Human Relations, Section 42-1 of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:

Summary: In September, 2015, this Board approved Contract No. 1518-14681 with Revenue Solutions,

The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: The Cook County Assessor’s Office and Cook County Clerk’s Office request authorization
for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a contract with Cook County Suburban
Publishers, Inc.
This contract will satisfy the statutory requirements for the Cook County Clerk’s Office set forth in
Article 12 of the Election Code, 10 ILCS 5/12-1 et seq. which requires the Cook County Clerk’s Office
to place notices in a minimum of two newspapers for each suburban municipality in the election
jurisdiction on the same day and for the same duration of time. If multiple vendors are involved, there
could be a scenario where some newspapers in certain municipalities have different publication dates.
This would result in a loss of coordination of the notices and possible confusion among the voters.
Therefore, it is necessary to have one source that can publish notices in all election municipalities on the
same day. Cook County Suburban Publishers, Inc. can provide the necessary geographical coverage and
guarantee that notices are placed in the correct papers on the same day.
This contract will also satisfy the statutory requirements for the Cook County Assessor’s Office set forth
in 35 ILCS 200/12-20 and 715 ILCS 10/1 which require assessments to be published at the same time for
the North and South suburban townships. Cook County Suburban Publishers can publish the North and
South suburban townships under one umbrella.
This contract is awarded as a Sole Source procurement pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County
Procurement Code.

perform services, including cleaning and disinfecting animal cages and feeding and watering of housed
animals.
Also, the CACC and the Sheriff’s Office will work in partnership with Safe Humane Chicago, an Illinois
not-for-profit focused on creating safe communities by inspiring positive relationships between people
and animals, to create a pilot program called Lifetime Bonds Re-entry in which detainees will learn how
to socialize and train shelter dogs; maintain the dogs’ basic physical and emotional health; and will be
introduced to animal-related employment opportunities which exist within the animal welfare and pet
industries.”
The CACC agrees to reimburse the Sheriff on a monthly basis in accordance with the work actually
performed by the Sheriff plus a 10.28% administrative fee. The total per annum of $339,835.00 is
estimated; however said amount may be subject to further increase following required negotiations in
November 2016 in anticipation of the second option to renew. The Amendment also modifies existing
IGA language and authorizes the Sheriff of Cook County and the CACC to execute a Second
Amendment exercising the second option to renew; said second option to renew may result in a revenue
increase.
