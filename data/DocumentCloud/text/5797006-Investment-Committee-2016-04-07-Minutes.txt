WHEREAS, in December 2015 AHC common shareholder Jim Papas (Ted Gatzaros

1. Redemption price of [$3,500,000] cash at closing

proceeds in excess of $19,800,000
3. AHC responsible for Board legal cost incurred by legal counsel in documenting the
transaction if consummated, and
WHEREAS, Papas countered the Board’s proposal at $2,500,000 and subsequently
increased the offer to $3,000,000 which Banyan Realty Advisors recommends the Board
accept pursuant to its letter of April 4, 2016 incorporating the additional items previously
approved by the Board as set forth in the letter with the amendment that the strike on
excess funds is reset to $19,300,000, therefore be it
RESOLVED, that the Board has reviewed Banyan’s letter dated April 4, 2016 and the terms
set forth therein for the sale of its preferred shares and herein approves Banyan’s
recommendation to sale the preferred shares, and be it further
RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the Atheneum Hotel Corporation,
