RE: Whether Damages Resulted From the Retroactive Contract with
Zeusmer, August Caldwell, PC 

Chairman Woronchak:

On March 22, 2018, the County Commission approved a retroactive, one-year contract with
Zausmer, August Caldwell, PC (of Pennington Hills) for the legal services in the matter of
Rouge Valley Sewage Disposal System Negotiation. The approving Resolution 2018464 directed
Corporation Counsel ?to determine if the County incurred damages as a result of premature
performance in violation of [Section 120?50 of the procurement ordinance]; and if damages were
incurred to institute a civil action pursuant to ordinance . . . and report to the Commission?
within 90 days. We are providing this correspondence in response to the Commission?s request.

For purposes of this correspondence, we are assuming as true the key facts recited in Resolution
2018-164, the term of the modi?cation is from January 20, 2018 through January 19, 2019,
and that performance on this contract was performed prior to Commission approval on March
22, 2018. Also noted is that Section 120-50(a) prohibits payment or performance on a contract
prior to Commission approval. Section 120-50(g) sets forth the penalty for violations:

To the extent provided by law, a person who violates this section shall be
personally liable for actual damages, costs, expenses and liability of any kind,
sustained, incurred or required to be paid by the county arising out of his, her, its
violation of this section. The department of corporation counsel shall institute a
civil action in the appropriate district court or in the Third Circuit Court against a
person who violates this section to recover any actual damages, costs, expenses
and liability of any kind on behalf of the county. Personal liability under this
subsection shall not exceed $5 00.00 per violation. [Emphasis added]

Here, the County did not incur any actual damage, cost, expense, or liability due" to the fact that
Zausmer, August Caldwell, PC performed on the contract prior to Commission approval of the

contract. Zausmer, August 85 Caldwell, PC delivered the required service in competent fashion.
The County accepted the service. Zausmer, August Caldwell, PC did not receive payment on
the modi?ed contract prior to its approval. In other welds, retroactivity notwithstanding, the
County received the bene?t of its bargain with Zausmer, August 35 Caldwell, PC.

As no damage was incurred, there are no grounds to pursue a civil action under Section 120-
50(g).

Ver truly yours,
