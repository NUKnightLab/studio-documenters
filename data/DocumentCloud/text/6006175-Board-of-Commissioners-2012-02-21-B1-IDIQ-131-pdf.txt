GENERAL BACKGROUND

The Chicago Housing Authority has successfully utilized Inde?nite Delivery,
Inde?nite Quantity task order contractors throughout the Plan for Transformation
(?Program?). This Program is vital to executing the numerous Capital Maintenance activities and
the Americans with Disabilities Act retro?t projects. The CHA has determined
that the IDIQ method of contracting is the most cost effective way to accomplish construction
work in the areas of Capital Maintenance, Dwelling and Non-Dwelling retro?ts,
creation of new computer labs and the Property Investment Initiative 

The IDIQ contracts will allow the CHA, under the Capital Maintenance Program, to bring its
Senior Housing into compliance with the City of Chicago Life Safety ordinance (City of Chicago
Municipal Code 13-196-203 thru 209), modi?ed in September of 2011 to extend deadlines to
January 1, 2015. The goal is to comply with the ordinance by December of 2013.
Projects will include the evaluation, repair and installation of new components, if necessary, to
2-Way communication systems, smoke detectors, elevator recall systems, ?re pumps, backup
generators, automatic transfer switches, and ?re sprinklers in trash chutes.

The Capital Maintenance Program also entails Scattered Sites maintenance projects. These
include modi?cations for code compliance, various general building and unit repairs such as
window, roo?ng, furnace, and air conditioning replacements, and kitchen and bath upgrades.

The CHA has spent signi?cant dollars to bring its Dwelling portfolio in compliance with the
more stringent requirements as negotiated under a Voluntary Compliance Agreement
between the CHA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. To further
support the VGA, Non-Dwelling properties must be brought into compliance.

Further, additional work will be required in support of the Property Investment Initiative 
which will utilize the services of general contractors to develop/rehab properties that are
acquired under the pro gram.

In determining the amount of ?nding which will be needed to cover the construction services for
this work, the Capital Construction Department the Of?ce of Development
Management and Asset Management initially started with projected
construction costs of $79,230,056.00 over the next two (2) years. This amount was reached using
industry standards to determine accuracy of construction costs for a project based on the value of
work required. The projected construction costs are broken down as follows:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Program Amount
Computer Labs 1,110,056.00
Dwelling Program $12,000,000.00
O4 Non-Dwelling $14,500,000.00
Property Investment Initiative (PII) $13,320,000.00
Capital Maintenance Program $39,300,000.00
Construction Total $79,230,056.00

The amount of the $79,230,056.00 was adjusted to the not-to-exceed amount of $80,000,000.00.

The current IDIQ task order contracts expire as of March 31, 2012. Utilizing the IDIQ pool of
contractors provides ?exibility and speed of procurement while still bene?ting from competitive
bidding for the projects offered to the pool in the form of Requests for Services It has
also proven to be an opportunity for smaller and minority/women owned businesses to get
experience bidding on, and winning, CHA projects.

To accomplish this requirement, the CHA solicited proposals from General Contractor 
?rms (?Respondents?) to provide all necessary construction services related to modernization,
capital maintenance and development activities. This includes, but is not limited to, management,
supervision, labor, transportation, facilities, materials, tools, disposal, coordination of
subcontractors, documentation and equipment, and all related activities necessary for the
performance of projects at various dwelling and non-dwelling properties at various locations.
This GC work will be delegated by the Capital Construction Department the Of?ce of
Development Management and Asset Management beginning in 2012. Task
Orders under each contract will be assigned during a base term of two (2) years, with one (1)
one-year renewal option.

PROCUREMENT HISTORY

The CHA advertised Request for Proposal No. 11-00783 on August 3, 2011 for general
contractor services to perform Inde?nite Delivery, Inde?nite Quantity Task Orders at various
CHA Development locations. It was advertised in the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago
Defender, El Dia, on the CHA website and on BuySpeed Online. The Pro-proposal meeting was
held on August 12, 2011 and included a PowerPoint presentation on all submission requirements.
Addendum No. was issued on September 1, 2011 to respond to vendor Requests for
Information. The proposals were received on September 12, 2012. Addendum No. 2 was later
issued on December 23, 2011 to distribute the ?nal General Construction Services Master
Agreement.

Twenty-one (21) ?rms submitted proposals. Two (2) ?rms were deemed non-responsive due to
insuf?cient submittal materials. The remaining nineteen (19) ?rms were evaluated by a three (3)
member Evaluation Committee drawn from CCD, ODM and AM. The Department of
Procurement and Contracts checked the ?rms for responsibility through a rigorous
questionnaire jointly developed by CCD, DPC and the Legal Department. The cutoff point was
set at a score of ?fty (50) points. One (1) vendor scored signi?cantly below ?fty (50) points
during the evaluation process, and has been eliminated from consideration. The eighteen (18)
Respondents who scored above ?fty (50) points were deemed responsive and responsible, and
CCD recommends that they be awarded contracts.

To distribute work under the contracts, the eighteen (18) GCs will receive opportunities to bid on
Task Orders via Requests for Services Bids will be judged on the submittal materials
and lump sum bid amounts. GCs that do outstanding work will be identi?ed, and consideration
will be given to increasing their maximum capacity through utilization of the reserve capacity set
aside for this purpose. On an as-needed basis, the Contracting Of?cer rnay evaluate

 

60 East Van Buren, Floor Chicago, Illinois 60605 (3l2) 913-7282 - 
5

requests from CCD to adjust the not-to-exceed values of these well performing vendors.

While each ?rm will have a guaranteed minimum of $50,000.00, great performance will impact
a firm?s ability to be awarded additional tasks beyond the $1,500,000.00 not-to-exceed amount
initially assigned to each contract. The Contracting Of?cer will evaluate requests from
CCD, ODM and AM to increase the not-to-exceed values of those GCs doing superior work.
Underperforming ?rms will not be considered for these increases. In addition, the Contracting
Of?cer will have the discretion to prohibit a vendor from participating in further Task Order
opportunities under its contract should it show a pattern of failing to bid.

Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to execute Inde?nite Delivery,
Inde?nite Quantity Task Order contracts for Construction Services at various CHA dwelling and
non-dwelling properties with All Chicago, Inc., Apex Construction Group, Blinderman
Construction Co., Inc., Brown and Momen, Incorporated, Coleman Development Corporation,
Cordos Development Associates, Done Rite Construction Services, Incorporated, Friedler
Construction Company, Gibraltar Construction Co. Inc., Koal Enterprises, Inc., Madison
Construction Company, Maxwell Services Inc., Oakk Construction Co., Inc., Oakley
Construction Co., Inc., Old Veteran Construction, Inc., Powers Sons Construction Company,
Inc., Tropic Construction Corporation and Waterside Development, LLC. Each contract will be
for an amount not-to-exceed $1,500,000.00 and a base term of two (2) years. The CHA may
extend these Contracts for one (1) one-year renewal option, subject to approval by the CHA
Board of Commissioners. Each contract will have a guaranteed minimum of $50,000.00. An
additional $53,000,000.00 will be set aside as reserve capacity from which funds can be
allocated to well performing ?rms at the discretion of the Contracting Of?cer. The total
aggregate amount of the eighteen (18) contracts and the reserve capacity fund is not-to-exceed
$80,000,000.00.

These awards are subject to each Contractor?s compliance with the 
Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
