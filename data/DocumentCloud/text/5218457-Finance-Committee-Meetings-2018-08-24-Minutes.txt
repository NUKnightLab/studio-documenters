 III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to request number 9, Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy,
provided additional information. The long-term goal is to have employed staff performing these functions, but in
the short-term, the organization has to make sure that the bills go out to keep the economic engine going. The
organization has experienced issues retaining coders because standards have not yet been negotiated. Once that is
done, it will give the organization some flexibility in meeting the competitive nature of how coding works. In
many cases, the very best coders code from home, but to do that, there has to be a standard for performance.
Mr. Jones explained that this vendor was selected through a Request for Proposals (RFP) process. Several
responses to the RFP were received; an internal committee went through the evaluation process to narrow down
and come to a consensus for the award. He noted that Supply Chain Management does not announce the award as
being complete at this point and notify the other responders to the RFP, because it is still an ongoing process until
the Board approves the contract. Following Board approval of this contract, he will send a letter to inform the six
(6) companies who did not get the contract. He stated that nThrive is the only company that provided coders for
dental billing. He did not have all of the details from the evaluation at hand, but offered to provide that
information to the Committee after the meeting. Chair Reiter requested that the information be provided prior to
the Board Meeting on August 31st. Director Richardson-Lowry requested that the information be sent to the
Committee through the Chair, so they will have an opportunity to review it before the Board Meeting.
With regard to request number 13, Mr. Jones informed the Committee that the contract not-to-exceed amount
needs to be amended to $323,538.90.
Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Chair Reiter, moved the approval of
request numbers 1 through 15, subject to completion of review by Contract
Compliance, where appropriate, and subject to the modification as noted and
receipt of information as discussed.
THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Proposed Transfers of Funds (Attachment #3)
Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, provided an overview of the proposed transfers of funds. The Committee
reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Chair Reiter, moved the approval of
the proposed transfers of funds. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
D. Proposed Resolution amending the CCHHS capital asset threshold (Attachment #4)
Mr. Akpan provided an overview of the proposed Resolution. In response to a question regarding why this is
being presented in resolution format, Jeff McCutchan, General Counsel, stated that historically, a resolution
format has been used with this Board when making changes like this. The CCHHS Board does not approve
ordinances, and the administration usually does not ask this Board to change policies, which are done at the
executive level.
Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Chair Reiter, moved the approval of
the proposed Resolution amending the CCHHS capital asset threshold. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Page 2 of 89

 III. Action Items (continued)
E. Any items listed under Section III and VI

F. Proposed request to negotiate and execute an agreement for the acquisition of property to be utilized by

Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Chair Reiter, moved to recess the
open meeting and convene into a closed meeting, pursuant to the following
exception to the Illinois Open Meetings Act: 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(5), regarding
“the purchase or lease of real property for the use of the public body, including
meetings held for the purpose of discussing whether a particular parcel should
be acquired.”
On the motion to recess the open meeting and convene into a closed meeting, a
roll call was taken, the votes of yeas and nays being as follows:

Director Munar indicated that he would like to know where the volumes will change around dental and mental
health. Mr. Akpan responded that he will provide that information.
During the discussion of slide 12, Chair Reiter indicated that the Committee should plan to discuss in the near
future the mechanics of the pension. Mr. Akpan stated that he has reached out to the County Comptroller
looking for time to have that conversation in the future.
Chair Reiter requested an update on the status of talks with employees regarding realignment of full-time
employee (FTE) positions. As he understands it, CCHHS is not losing people; rather, they are getting
redeployed. Dr. Shannon responded that the administration is still working through that. It will be a
redeployment within CCHHS and, he understands, within the County as a whole.
Director Munar stated that, for the FY2019 budget and for the Directors’ own education, it would be helpful
to understand the definition that the administration is using for charity care and how it is communicated to the
organization’s patient population.

Honorable Robert G. Reiter, Jr.
Chairman

Honorable Members

FINANCE COMMITTEE

Cook County Health Hospitals System
1900 Polk St.

2nd Floor

Chicago, IL 60612

Dear Sir/Madam:

I am president and owner of CompuBill Inc. CompuBill was incorporated on January 20,
1980 in Orland Park, IL, Cook County. Most of our employees live in Cook County.

During the more than 38 years we have been in business we have provided Revenue
Cycle Management (RCM) and Physician Billing and Coding Services to 66 separate
hOSpitals, medical centers and medical and laboratory clinics throughout the Chicago
Metropolitan area. These include medical clinics operated by City of Chicago,
Department of Health, contracted with the State of Illinois to provide these services at
University of Illinois Hospital and teaching hospitals, including University of Chicago. A
list of these facilities was presented in Table 4.1, page 27, of the Proposal submitted by
CompuBill, in response to RFP HIS-013..

On April 27, 2018, in response to RFP HIS-013, Physician Billing and Coding
Services, CompuBill submitted a detailed proposal. 1 have duly signed delivery receipts
of this submittal, including subsequent addendums. CompuBill has not received
noti?cation, or acknowledgment, from of receiving our proposal. I do not know
if our proposal, including the pricing proposal, was read, evaluated, considered,
compared with other proposals, duly rated for completeness and met all criteria
established by for due consideration.

As indicated in Section Action Items of the Agenda for today?s Finance Committee
meeting you are being requested to approve contract number H18-25-068 for nThrive,

Inc., Alpharetta, Georgia, to provided Physician Billing and Coding Services. I
am hereby requesting you to not approve this contract or authorize further negotiations,

Page 7 of 89

 Finance Committee 2 August 24, 2018

if such negotiations are being contemplated. I believe CompuBill?s detailed and
comprehensive proposal should be given due consideration. In support of this request
please consider the following:

1.

The pricing proposal submitted by CompuBill (Section 5.12 of the RF P,
Chapter 21 of CompuBill proposal, Table 5.128.0% of
the net revenue collected;

The Alpharetta, GA company nThrive, Inc. is quoting or a projected
additional expense for of 

CompuBill is located in Cook County, Illinois, pays Cook County taxes and
employs personnel living in Cook, Will and DuPage counties;

In 2007 a similar contract for physician billing and coding services was
awarded to PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP headquartered outside Cook
County, contract H10-25-113. I believe their performance was well below
expectations;

In 2011 a similar contract was awarded to McKesson Revenue Management
Solutions, Alpharetta, GA, (outside Cook County) contract #Hl 1-25-034. At
the February 20, 2015 meeting of the Finance Committee it was indicated that
McKesson was being paid a fee of $13,039,527 to collect estimated revenue
of $32,762,520. This fee amounts to 39.8% of the revenue collected. I
believe their performance was well below expectations;

Since 2007 CompuBill has been trying, to no avail, for to consider
CompuBill to manage Stroger and other Cook County Hospital?s RCM and
Physician Billing and Coding;

We were told to apply for certi?cation as a minority owned business to stand
any chance of doing business with Cook County. CompuBill applied for such
certi?cation but were rejected. The reason given was that the level of owners?
?nancial assets was ?:00 high, without specifying the ?1?00 high number;
and,

I sincerely request you, Mr. Reiter, and the members of the Finance
Committee to personally review CompuBill?s proposal, in response to RFP 
H18-013 and give CompuBill the opportunity to personally present detailed
information regarding our background, experience, past performance and the
IT and Human resources we have to offer. I believe our proposal deserves
your professional evaluation and due consideration.

In anticipation of a favorable reply, and for your time and attention, thank you very

much.

Sincerely,

G. Narender Reddy

President
