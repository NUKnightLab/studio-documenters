funds in the amount not-to-exceed $30,000.00.
Funding Source: General Fund
Jeanelle Greene, Department of Information Technology, presented. Dale Miller commented on the
importance and need for third-party assurance testing on the accounts payable module and asked why
the evaluation was not part of the original scope of services as this is a major testing area. Ms. Greene
indicated she would research and provide a response to the Board members. Nan Baker asked for

within the $25 million; and asked if the County will continue to see a decrease as we go along. Maggie

Department of Information Technology, on behalf of the Department of Law, recommending an award on
RQ45045 and enter into a contract with Everlaw, Inc. in the amount not-to-exceed $20,000.00 for cloudbased e-discovery software services for the period 3/4/2019 – 5/31/2019.
Funding Source: General Fund
Jerad Zibritosky, Nora Hurley and Jonathan McGory, Department of Law and Jeremy Mio, Department of
Information Technology, presented. Lenora Lockett indicated that the vendor has not yet completed
registration with the Inspector General’s Office and that this item will need to be approved conditionally
if the Board approves the contract.
Trevor McAleer asked for confirmation on the number of e-mails to be reviewed and for clarification on
how the software will process these e-mails; asked what the temporary attorneys will be working on once
the e-mails have been uploaded.
18

 Nan Baker asked about the period of time the software will be in use and if the County is paying additional
costs due to the urgency of this purchase; and asked if $20,000 for the 3-month period is considered
excessive.
Dale Miller asked for clarification on the correlation between the decreased number of e-mails to be
reviewed to the decreased volume of gigabytes of data to be downloaded as they did not seem to be
aligned; asked for confirmation that while the volume of e-mails declined, the content could potentially
be of substance which explains the variance between the two figures.
Trevor McAleer asked for clarification on the types of e-mails to be reviewed and whether it will only
include those flagged as attorney-client privileged or related to FMLA matters; asked for clarification that
5 of the 6 mailboxes will be reviewed based only on select search terms and asked if all non-privileged
communications will need review.
Maggie Keenan indicated that all e-mails must be reviewed to determine if privilege applies.
Mr. McAleer asked how privileged communication is determined; stated that his original understanding
would be segregating those requiring review from those that do not.
Jonathan McGory indicated search terms were not available at the time of original request and now that
those search terms have been provided, a more refined search will be conducted on the 5 mailboxes for
privileged or HIPPA-related matters; said that the Department of Information Technology was instructed
to not segregate the 5 mailboxes since all will need to be reviewed, which should expedite the process.
Nan Baker asked for clarification as to whether this software purchase had been requested in the original
contract for temporary attorney services or did the department expect to come back to request this
software purchase.
Maggie Keenan indicated that the prior request to contract for temporary attorney services did not
include the cost of software, which is why the cost of that service was relatively inexpensive and that the
procurement of software began after that approval.
Ms. Baker asked if this software will provide any efficiencies that would expedite the process and reduce
the amount of services required of the attorneys; asked if the deadline remains March 18 and is the
department prepared to request an extension of time, in the event that is needed; recommended to
proactively request a time extension and asked for clarification on the number of extensions already
requested.
Mr. McAleer asked if we are paying more for the software by purchasing separately from attorney
services.
Maggie Keenan motioned to approve the item; Michael Dever seconded. Item BC2019-162 was
conditionally approved by unanimous vote.

19

 BC2019-163
Fiscal Office/Board of Revision, recommending an award on RQ44430 and enter into a contract with GPI

3/1/2019 – 6/30/2019.

Shelley Davis, Board of Revision, presented. Dale Miller commented on a prior amendment to the Charter
that provides the benefit of greater operational flexibility and opportunities for temporary employment,
so the Board of Revision may operate more efficiently. Maggie Keenan motioned to approve the item;
Dale Miller seconded. Item BC2019-163 was unanimously approved.
BC2019-164
Department of Human Resources, submitting an amendment to Contract No. CE1700057 for the Wellness
Program for County employees for the period 4/1/2017 – 12/31/2019, to change the name of the provider
from Viverae, Inc. to Simplywell, Inc., effective 3/4/2019 and for additional funds in the amount not-toexceed $2,000.00.
Funding Source: Self-Insurance Fund – Wellness
Holly Woods, Department of Human Resources, presented. Dale Miller asked if Simplywell, Inc. will be
undergoing another name change. Nan Baker asked why the rates did not remain the same as under the
original contract and asked whether the rates would have remained the same if Viverae, Inc. had not been
bought out; recommended that consideration be given, that the vendor increased rates in the middle of
the contract term which expires at the end of the year, when contracting for the next Wellness Program.
Dale Miller asked if biometric screenings for employees have been scheduled for this year. Maggie Keenan
asked if there are plans to issue a Request for Proposals at the end of this contract term. Maggie Keenan
motioned to approve the item; Dale Miller seconded. Item BC2019-164 was unanimously approved.
BC2019-165
Department of Human Resources,
a) Submitting an RFP exemption on RQ44582, which will result in an award recommendation to W.B.
Mason Co., Inc. in the amount not-to-exceed $1,670.92 for the purchase of supplies for Worker’s

12/10/2018.
Funding Source: Workers’ Compensation
Holly Woods, Department of Human Resources, presented. Nan Baker asked why invoices from August,
2018 are just being presented for approval and asked if additional invoices are still outstanding. Maggie
Keenan asked if these items were purchased without appropriate authorization, as existing policy states
that these items could not be paid by office voucher. Lenora Lockett clarified that the W.B. Mason contract
is strictly for the purchase of office supplies, which these items were not; stated that in preparation for
the Enterprise Resource Planning Project, the County is basically preparing departments for all items that
may have been processed but not in the preferred method; said that office vouchers are for purchases
$500 and below for the year, per vendor. Angie Rich concurred with Ms. Lockett and said these invoices
20

 should not have been held but rather quotes should have been sought through an informal bid and
presented to the Board for approval prior to purchase. Maggie Keenan commented that there seems to
be a reoccurring issue of purchases being made using public dollars without legal authority and said that
procurement processes and controls are in place for a reason. Maggie Keenan motioned to approve the
item; Trevor McAleer seconded. Item BC2019-165 was unanimously approved.
BC2019-166
Department of Public Safety and Justice Services, recommending an award on RQ43705 and enter into a
contract with Cleveland Rape Crisis Center in the amount not-to-exceed $82,345.56 for implementation

BC2019-167

 The following item was amended to include the procurement method as an RFP Exemption.
BC2019-169
Cuyahoga County Sheriff’s Department,
a) Submitting an RFP exemption on RQ44792, which will result in an award recommendation to Alliance
Healthcare Solutions, LLC in the amount not-to-exceed $500,000.00 for temporary Nursing services for
all County Jail medical facilities for the period 3/4/2019 – 12/31/2019.

Funding Source: General Fund
Donna Kaleal, Sheriff’s Department, presented. Trevor McAleer asked if this contract will provide
sufficient staffing until the transition of services to MetroHealth is complete; and asked how the pricing
compares to the current temporary nursing services contract; Ms. Kaleal indicated that she will research
and provide a response to the Board members. Mr. McAleer asked if we have utilized Educare staffing
services to capacity.
Nan Baker asked if communications between MetroHealth and the County can be improved upon to
anticipate future staffing needs.
Maggie Keenan commented that maintaining staffing is dependent upon the number of nurses on staff,
as it is anticipated that County nurses will be leaving their jobs that will need to be backfilled by contracted
workers, as the transition gets closer and as County employees continue to attrition out; said that it is
difficult to determine how many staff will call off at any time, as well as covering vacation time of workers,
which creates the on-going issue of predicting staffing needs; said that staffing levels will continue to be
monitored weekly but it’s difficult to forecast the staffing needs months from now.
Nan Baker asked if additional temporary services will be needed at the end of the year due to contract
negotiations with the nurses’ 5-year contract that will be ending.
Ms. Keenan stated that the department should have a sense as to their needs by 4th quarter and if the
need is unclear by July, the department will proceed with an amendment for additional funding.
Trevor McAleer said there is an effort to incentivize the existing County nurses to stay through the
transition but it is best to have a contract in place, if necessary; said that the agreement should be crafted
and presented in the next 4-6 weeks which should give a clearer picture on future nursing needs.
Maggie Keenan motioned to approve the item; Trevor McAleer seconded. Item BC2019-169 was
unanimously approved, as amended.

Scope of Work Summary
Department of Public Works is requesting confirmation of the settlement reached for Parcel 2T in the
appropriation lawsuits filed in Cuyahoga County Probate Court in connection with the Stearns Road
Separator Project in the City of North Olmsted and Olmsted Township. The property information is as
follows:
Parcel Nos.: 2 WD (Warranty Deed)
Owner: HPCP I, LLC
Probate Court Case Number: 2014ADV 201433;
Settlement Amount: $1,487,500.00
Resolution No. 2014-0196 approved the appropriation of Parcel 2. An appropriation action was filed and
a check in the amount of $850,500.00 was deposited with the Clerk of Courts for Parcel 2.
The original value analysis provided a Fair Market Value Estimate of $850,500, which included a property
value of $766,900 and damages of $83,650. The original value analysis considered damages to the residue
for Permanent Parcels Nos. 264-21-011 and 264-21-012 but did not consider potential damage to an
adjacent property owned by the same landowner, Permanent Parcel No. 264-21-022, because there was
a home on that property. A second analysis was completed by the County that considered the potential
damages of Parcel No. 264-21-022. The damages were valued at $398,100. The Property Owner’s expert,
Roger Ritley, valued the damages at $1,000,000.
After mediation and several days of negotiation after, the parties arrived at a settlement amount for the
case of $1,487,500.00. The settlement amount represents an increase of $637,000.00 and is considered
reasonable and far less costly than pursuing any further negotiations with this owner or allowing this case
to proceed to a jury trial.
The primary goal is confirmation of the additional settlement to construct the Stearns Road Project.
The Project is located in City of North Olmsted and Olmsted Township

Scope of Work Summary
The Department of Public Works is requesting an RFP Exemption for the Road & Bridge Division for the
attached various vendors in said amounts (see list below) for routine building & supply purchases, and
other misc. business needs for the period of January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019. This request is
to comply with a recent audit per the Fiscal Office. The resulting approval will result in the establishment
of individual encumbrance documents set up to cover routine expenses up to $1,000 per individual
purchase – the grand total of all purchases during this timeline are not to exceed the stated amounts on
the attached document. Public Works will monitor the encumbrance balances in cooperation with Fiscal
Office. Total for this request is $226,500.00, with Part 1 and Part 2 combined.
The primary goal is to obtain daily building and supply purchases that were previously purchased via the
county voucher process. The Fiscal Office has requested that these vendors be set up via an encumbrance
document. Public Works is working with OPD on advertising RFP’s for master contracts that will replace
many of these encumbrances. The master contracts should be awarded by April 1, 2019. Any amounts
not needed after the master contacts are awarded will be decertified.
Procurement
An RFP exemption is needed as the County is continuing to use vendors that were previously used via
the voucher process. The Fiscal Office has requested that these vendors be put under an encumbered
in advance.

 BC2019-187
The Cuyahoga HOME Consortium, on October 17, 2018, recommended a 0% interest, forgivable loan in
an amount not to exceed $450,000 to Emerald Alliance XI, a supportive housing project, to provide not
less than four affordable housing units in Cuyahoga County.
Emerald Alliance XI will be located at 3873 - 3881 West 25th Street in the Brooklyn Centre neighborhood
of Cleveland, Ohio. The site was selected because of its proximity to community amenities, nearby
services, and excellent access to public transportation. Emerald Alliance XI will be the eleventh Permanent
Supportive Housing building developed through the partnership of CHN Housing Partners (CHN) and
Emerald Development and Economic Network (EDEN) under Cuyahoga County's Housing First Initiative.
EDEN is committed to operating and maintaining the new building for the purpose housing formerly
homeless and low-to-moderate-income households for thirty years. The building will provide seventy-one
(71) one-bedroom apartments for individuals who have experienced homelessness with onsite supportive
services available exclusively for residents. FrontLine Service will provide and coordinate the onsite
supportive services and also link residents to services and amenities in the community. Onsite supportive
services include mental health counseling, behavioral health counseling, life skills training, and job search
assistance. All residential suites will have one bedroom, one full bathroom, a kitchen, storage, and will be
fully furnished.
BC2019-188
The Cuyahoga HOME Consortium recommended on October 17, 2018 a zero interest, forgivable loan in
the amount not to exceed $450,000 based on a 20-year affordability period for four units.
Medina Creative Housing plans to develop a sixteen-unit apartment complex in Middleburg Heights on
the site of a long vacant YWCA. MCH will construct four clusters of three apartments and two clusters of
two apartments. The apartments each will have 550 square feet with a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen,
living room, patio, vaulted ceilings. The demand for MCH housing will keep growing as aging parent of
adults with developmental disabilities can no longer care for their children and as the ever-increasing

Knickerbocker Executive Summary
Bay Inter‐Faith Housing, LSC Service Corporation and PIRHL Developers have partnered to rehabilitate
and recapitalize Knickerbocker Apartments. This 8‐story, former HUD 236 building is located at the heart
of Bay Village in western Cuyahoga County. It was originally developed and is still owned by Bay Inter‐
Faith Housing, which is a consortium of 4 Bay Village churches that organized in the late 1960’s to
address the growing need for senior housing and services in the area. Constructed in 1974, the property
is restricted to seniors over age 62. The property has a 20-year HAP contract providing operating subsidy
for 67 of the apartments.
While the building has been well maintained and benefitted from high continual occupancy, there are
several objectives to be achieved through the proposed rehabilitation. Currently the building contains
169 units, of which 98 are 341 SF studios, 70 are one‐bedroom, and the remaining unit is a two bedroom
employee apartment. The building will be reconfigured from 169 to 148 units. In the process
the number of studios will be reduced to 56, while the one‐bedroom apartments will be increased to 91.
Currently there are no accessible units in the building. This reconfiguration will create 8 fully accessible
42

 apartments. Step‐in showers will improve compliance with universal design in remaining apartments.
Major building systems will be upgraded to increase energy efficiency and improve service to tenants
including HVAC system upgrades to eliminate through‐window AC units and a new roof. The building’s
open air court is being enclosed to create a usable naturally lit common area. This space creates more
area for tenant activities without adding on to the building.
Tenant activities and services are plentiful at Knickerbocker. Residents enjoy an offering of differing
activities every day of the week coordinated by the onsite Service Coordinator and Activities
Coordinator. Eliza Jennings staffs an onsite Wellness Clinic five days a week providing tenants with
access to home‐based health care services

In August, the Corrections Planning Board (CPB) replied to the ADAMHS Board RFI for 2019 funding. CPD
submitted 5 proposals - two were previously operating and three pilot programs. The two ongoing
programs were funded through a pooled funding fee for service basis which is a change for the Adult
Treatment Drug Court Grant but the same for the Treatment Capacity Expansion Grant. One of the three
proposed pilot programs was awarded at half of the proposed funding amount. The ADAMHS Board
evaluated the proposals and announced their award in December 2018 and sent out the contracts on
January 16, 2019. The grants all begin on January 1, 2019 and run through December 31, 2019.

The Corrections Planning Board is requesting to reduce the contract amount for CE1800116 with Passages
Connecting Fathers and Sons. This contract supports services provided by passages for a specialized
probation population. The target population is men who have fallen behind on child support payments
to a degree that CESA has referred them to the County Prosecutor to have them charged as delinquent
on child support payments. Once adjudicated, such offenders are placed on Probation for up to a fiveyear period, or until they become current with their ordered child support payment. These probationers
are placed on Probation in a specialized Probation Unit. Utilizing Community Corrections Act funding that
specifically targets such parents, the Corrections planning Board has entered into an agreement with
Passages for a Cognitive Behavioral based intervention model designed to change the thought processes
of the Probationers and assist in helping them realize their responsibility to their child(ren). Because of
a decrease in referrals to the program, it is estimated that $12,000 of these funds will not be expended in
the current grant cycle.
