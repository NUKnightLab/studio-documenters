Submitting a request from
RICCARDO F. GINEX, Village Manager, Village of Brookfield
Re:

No Cash Bid Request for the Village of Brookfield

The Village of Brookfield, Illinois (the ―Village‖), would like to apply to make an over-the-counter nocash bid for the following parcel:
VILLAGE OF BROOKFIELD
VOLUME
176

PROPERTY INDEX NUMBER
15-34-221-006-0000

This Request Package contains one (1) Property Index Number (PIN). The Property is located at 3415
Maple Avenue, Brookfield, Illinois 60513. The Property is improved with a single-story commercial
structure which formerly housed a bowling alley and tavern. In 2011, the Village initiated a demolition
action against the Property for numerous building code violations and safety concerns. The Property has
been vacant and unoccupied since approximately August 17, 2011. The Village seeks to acquire the
Property and hold the Property for redevelopment pending a future proposal by a commercial developer.
By allowing the Village to obtain this parcel through the Cook County No-Cash Bid Program, the Village
will benefit from the removal of a dangerous structure and the improvement of its tax base by future
commercial development of the property. If the Village is successful in acquiring the Property through the
No-Cash Bid Program, it will file for tax exempt status and will maintain the property as tax exempt until
such time as it is conveyed to a third party for development. The Village represents that there currently
exists no Third Party Request by a developer, organization, or other private party which would result in

the Village‘s conveyance of a certificate of purchase for, or perfected tax deed to, the Property to such

This Request Package contains thirteen (13) Property Index Numbers (PINs). The property is a vacant
parking lot that was used for the "Old Barn Restaurant." The City of Burbank is submitting two additional
"No Cash Bid Packages" in conjunction with this request in order to acquire the contiguous parcels
containing structures, including the abandoned Old Barn Restaurant. The City will file for tax exempt
status once the property has been acquired. Once tax exempt status is obtained, the City intends to
establish a TIF District to attract commercial development by offering incentives subsidized by property
tax revenue generated by the increased valuation. The development will generate property tax revenue,
sales tax revenue, and create construction and retail jobs. The City will retain the property until it can be
conveyed to a developer pursuant to a redevelopment plan. There has been no request by a third-party for
the City to acquire the property or to convey the certificate of purchase or the perfected tax deed(s)to said
third-party purchaser.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31, 2013
This Request Package contains ten (10) Property Index Numbers (PINs). The property was previously
used for the "Old Barn Restaurant," but has been vacant and abandoned for years. The City of Burbank is
submitting two additional "No Cash Bid Packages" in conjunction with this request in order to acquire the
contiguous parcels of land. The City will file for tax exempt status once the property has been acquired.
Once tax exempt status is obtained, the City intends to establish a TIF District to attract commercial
development by offering incentives subsidized by property tax revenue generated by the increased
valuation. The development will generate property tax revenue, sales tax revenue, and create construction
and retail jobs. The City will retain the property until it can be conveyed to a developer pursuant to a
redevelopment plan. There has been no request by a third-party for the City to acquire the property or to
convey the certificate of purchase or the perfected tax deed(s) to said third-party purchaser.

The Forest Preserve District of Cook County (the ―District‖) has identified two (2) tax delinquent parcels
of vacant land in Unincorporated Cook County (the ―Parcels‖) that would be suitable for forest preserve
purposes. As a result, the District wishes to participate in the Cook County No Cash Bid Program for the

This request package contains two (2) Property Index Numbers (PINs). The District intends to use the
Parcels for Forest Preserve purposes. PIN 06-17-404-025-0000, consisting of approximately 7 acres of
vacant land in unincorporated Cook County, would provide a linkage between the Poplar Creek Preserve
and the recently acquired Rolling Knolls Country Club. PIN 31-05-100-018-0000, consisting of
approximately 1.5 acres of vacant land in unincorporated Cook County, is an in-holding parcel,
surrounded by forest Preserve on three (3) sides, and would bolster, as well as provide a buffer to, the
District‘s adjacent land holdings. The District will file for tax exempt status on the Parcels as the District
intends on utilizing the properties for forest preserve purposes. There is no Third Party Request associated
with the Parcels.

PROPERTY INDEX NUMBER

This Request Package contains one (1) Property Index Number (PIN). The PIN that is the subject of this
application (Volume 188: 19-07-201-025-0000) is an unimproved triangular lot located in a
manufacturing zoning district at 6800 West 51st Street in the southeast section of the Village. The parcel
is located just south of the Glenn Yard railroad tracks. There are no structures on the property. Because of
its unique shape and location, there has been little or no interest in private development of the lot. It is the
Village's desire to obtain title to this property through the County's No Cash Bid Program for future
expansion of municipal services to serve the southeast section of the Village. The municipal services
would include the construction of a police and fire station and a water pump for the reservoir serving the
Village. In the event this application is approved it is the Village's intent to file the necessary documents
required to obtain a tax-exempt status for the property. It is the Village's intention to retain the PIN for
municipal use. Please be advised that the Village does not have any agreement to convey the perfected tax
deed for the property to any developer, organization or other private party. The Village also has not
entered into any negotiations with any developer, organization, or other entity pertaining to this property.
The Village is not acting on behalf of any third party requestor.

The total number of Property Index Numbers (PINs) requested in this package is six (6). These PINs are
adjacent to each other and were formerly occupied by a single multi-family residential building. The
building was burnt down and the property is currently vacant, except for remaining parking in the rear.
The properties are surrounded to the north and south by multi-family residential buildings grouped into
similar lot configurations. Such buildings are densely occupied and in need of revitalization. Properties to
the east are single-family residential and to the west are multi-family residential. These properties have
been identified by the Village as ones that could provide benefit to the surrounding properties through
shared parking, a play lot, community garden, or community building. It is found that a public use will
provide more benefit than an additional multi-family structure at this location. Consolidation of the
parcels and ownership of the property will also help to ensure unified redevelopment of the site. Such use
may work cooperatively with that of the Hanover Township Astor Avenue Community Center, located
several properties north on Astor Avenue. The Village will file for tax exempt status as the Village will
hold the property and maintain the status until either the Village develops the property or it is conveyed to
another party for development and operation. The Village does not have a Third Party Request for this
property.

Document No. 97241272 with the Cook County Recorder of Deeds on April 7, 1997. This request
package contains one (1) PIN. This property is a narrow strip of vacant land that sits on the eastern side of
the Bridlewood development and extends generally north and south between the rear of the homes facing
west and the Canadian National Railway Company‘s right-of-way and tracks. The requested parcel is
presently unused except that the Village of Hoffman Estates has recorded permanent and temporary
Grants of Easement for water and sanitary sewer (Document Nos. 92963380 and 91363571,
respectively). It is the Park District‘s intention that this parcel will be developed as a multi-purpose path
in cooperation with the Village of Hoffman Estates and the Forest Preserve District of Cook County
pursuant to the funding Grant awarded to the Village of Hoffman Estates under the 2012 Illinois
Transportation Enhancement Program. At the present time the Village of Hoffman Estates does maintain
a gravel pathway over the parcel, as well as the water and sanitary sewer lines below ground. Importantly,
on May29, 2013, the Cook County Board of Commissioners approved an Intergovernmental Agreement
with the Village of Hoffman Estates for a Noise Abatement Program that provides funding
(reimbursement) through the Canadian National Railway for affected residences that abut the Canadian
National Railway for noise mitigation improvements that are needed due to the increased rail traffic. This
Agreement includes the Bridlewood subdivision that is under the jurisdiction of Cook County, although
not within the corporate limits of the Village of Hoffman Estates. At the direction of the Hoffman Estates
Park District, the PIN will be retained for use as the multi-purpose path by the Requestor, the Village of
Hoffman Estates and the Forest Preserve District of Cook County. Legal counsel will be retained to file
for tax exempt status.

These two (2) parcels are within the Deer Crossing Subdivision and within the corporate limits of the
Village of Hoffman Estates. This request package contains two (2) Property Index Numbers (PINs).
These adjacent properties together form a narrow strip of vacant land that sits on the eastern side of the
Deer Crossing development and extends generally northeasterly and southwesterly between the rear of the
homes facing northwest and the Canadian National Railway Company‘s right-of-way and tracks. The
requested parcels are presently unused except that the Village of Hoffman Estates maintains its sanitary
sewer there and the existing drainage ditch. It is also the Village‘s intention and its ownership will better
enable the Village to accomplish potential drainage improvements on those parcels as well as enhance the
buffer between the single family homes and the Canadian National Railway Company‘s right-of-way and
tracks. Importantly, the Village of Hoffman Estates administers the Canadian National Noise Mitigation
Reimbursement Program that provides funding for residences affected by the increased rail traffic. This
Program includes homes in the Deer Crossing subdivision that is under the jurisdiction of Cook County,
and within the corporate limits of the Village of Hoffman Estates. These parcels will be retained for use
by the Village of Hoffman Estates so that it may perform the required maintenance of the sanitary sewer
and existing drainage ditch and to accomplish potential drainage improvements. As owner, the Village of
Hoffman Estates will also be better able to maintain the grass, shrubs and general plantings now
overgrown on those parcels.

This Request Package contains one (1) Property Index Number (PIN). The property is in the rear lot of
117 Ashland Avenue, River Forest, Illinois, abutting the property of 116 Lathrop, both of which are
residential properties. The property is unimproved and has four large trees which are not being properly
maintained and present a hazard to nearby power lines. Through the No Cash Bid Program, the Village
intends to vacate the property to the adjacent property owner who will be responsible for maintenance of
the trees. The Village may file for and maintain tax exempt status until such time that the deed is
conveyed. The adjoining landowners to the Property, Ronald E. Toupin, Jr. and Elizabeth A. Toupin, have
proposed that if the Village takes title to the Property, and if the real estate taxes on the Property are
eliminated, that the Property be transferred from the Village to them by way of vacation. The Village does
not have an agreement to convey the Property to Ronald E. Toupin, Jr. and Elizabeth A. Toupin at this
time, but the Village is considering doing so if the No Cash Bid process and any related tax deed
proceedings are successful.

HONORING THE 2013 STANLEY CUP CHAMPION
CHICAGO BLACKHAWKS FOR THEIR FIFTH CHAMPIONSHIP
IN FRANCHISE HISTORY AND SECOND IN FOUR SEASONS

62

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31, 2013
WHEREAS, Cook County is the capital of the hockey world for the second time in four (4) seasons as
the Chicago Blackhawks are, once again Stanley Cup Champions; and
WHEREAS, all of Chicago, Cook County, Illinois and Blackhawks fans around the world are joining in
the celebration the 2013 Stanley Cup Champions; and
WHEREAS, the Blackhawks, one of the National Hockey League‘s ―Original Six‖ teams, were able to
add the team‘s fifth Stanley Cup to the Blackhawks trophy case after wins in 1934, 1938, 1961, 2010 and
2013; and
WHEREAS, although they faced a challenge in a shortened season, the high energy, speed and focus of
the Stanley Cup Champions more than compensated and at times over the course of their season, they
could even make the game look easy; and
WHEREAS, led by Coach Joel Quenneville each player dug deep to give his best performance, as they
approached the limits of their capabilities; and
WHEREAS, working together as a team, the Blackhawks set an all-time National Hockey League record
with a 23 game unbeaten streak in regulation to start this season; and
WHEREAS, in the Stanley Cup Western Conference Playoffs, the Blackhawks embodied ferocity and a
―never say die‖ attitude through three (3) tough and challenging best-of-seven playoff series; defeating
the Minnesota Wild four (4) games to one (1); coming back from a three (3) games to one (1) deficit to
stick it to the hated Detroit Red Wings in seven (7) games; and taking only five (5) games to retire the
defending Stanley Cup Champion Los Angeles Kings; and
WHEREAS, the talent and toughness of the Stanley Cup Champions was brought to bear in an ―instant
classic‖ six (6) game Stanley Cup Final against the Boston Bruins, the first time two (2) ―Original Six‖
teams would meet in the Finals since 1979; and

WHEREAS, in Game One, the Bruins early 2-0 lead would not hold as the Blackhawks kept coming.
Brandon Saad grabbed one (1) goal back in the 2nd Period, and two (2) dramatic goals from Dave
Bolland and Johnny Oduya erased the 3-1 Boston lead, sending both teams into overtime. After a
grueling two (2) overtime periods, Andrew Shaw would score the game winning goal 12 minutes into the
third overtime period making Game One the fifth longest Stanley Cup Finals game in history; and
WHEREAS, in Game Two, it was the Blackhawks who would jump out front first on Patrick Sharp‘s
first period goal; Boston would answer and the teams would go to yet another overtime which ended in a
closely fought 2-1 Bruins win; and
WHEREAS, while Boston kept momentum on their side with a Game Three shutout, it was not unusual
for the Blackhawks to fight their way out of a corner and back into a series. Game Four was a high
powered affair, with the Blackhawks prevailing 6-5 in another overtime win. Michal Handzus opened the
scoring in the first period, followed by second period goals from Jonathan Toews, Patrick Kane and
Marcus Kruger. Patrick Sharp would get a power play goal in the third. After Boston tied the game in
regulation, Bryan Bickell would save the day in overtime, sending the series back to Chicago; and
WHEREAS, in Game Five, the Blackhawks led by Patrick Kane‘s two (2) goals would jump out in front
early and dominate the contest from beginning to end. Dave Bolland would put the cherry on the sundae

63

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31, 2013
with a late goal to give the Blackhawks a 3-1 win and command of the series heading back to Boston;
and
WHEREAS, as they did in 2010, the Blackhawks would get the opportunity to win the Stanley Cup on
their opponents‘ home ice. The Bruins, however, would not go down without a fight. Jonathan Toews
answered the Bruins early goal in the first period, and the two (2) teams would trade what seemed like
endless scoring chances for the rest of the game. With the Bruins leading 2-1, and the only one (1)
minute and 15 seconds remaining, it looked as though the Finals would head back to Chicago for Game
Seven. But the Blackhawks would not be denied as Bryan Bickell would score a game-tying goal
seemingly sending another game to overtime. Instead, the ―fastest‖ 17 seconds in Chicago sports history
saw Dave Bolland wrist the game winning goal past the Bruins goalie securing Chicago‘s fifth Stanley
Cup Championship; and
WHEREAS, as the Bruins and their fans stood silent in stunned confusion, a length-of-the-ice
celebration ensued as the return of Lord Stanley‘s Cup would echo all the way back to the streets of
Chicago; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners salutes Patrick Kane, winner of the Conn
Smythe as the Stanley Cup Finals Most Valuable Player; and
WHEREAS, Blackhawks goalie, Corey Crawford had a phenomenal post-season, especially for having
limited experience in an National Hockey League (NHL) playoff series; and
WHEREAS, all the members of the 2013 roster deserve recognition for their talents throughout the
season and the playoffs including Brandon Bollig, Sheldon Brookbank, Daniel Carcillo, Ray Emery,
Michael Frolik, Marian Hossa, Niklas Hjalmarsson, Carter Hutton, Duncan Keith, Shawn Lalonde, Drew
LeBlanc, Nick Leddy, Jamaal Mayers, Jeremy Morin, Brandon Pirri, Michal Rozsival, Brent Seabrook,
Ben Smith, Viktor Stalberg and Ryan Stanton; and
WHEREAS, we salute the Blackhawks‘ Chairman Rocky Wirtz, team President and Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) John McDonough, Vice President/General Manager Stan Bowman, Executive Vice
President Jay Blunk and the entire Blackhawks organization for their efforts to build a Stanley Cup
Champion in Chicago; and
WHEREAS, these games and these plays will live on in the memories of fans for years to come, as will
the sound of ―Chelsea Dagger‖ when the lamp is lit; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners was proud once again to have the victory parade
route pass through the campus of downtown County Buildings allowing Cook County to join the
celebration.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Members of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners do hereby congratulate the Chicago Blackhawks on their 2013 Stanley Cup
Championship, express our pride and joy upon this auspicious occasion and look forward to the a repeat
of this year‘s championship in 2014 which will bring Chicago its sixth Stanley‘s Cup!

Restaurant and Biergarten; and

WHEREAS, the Palmer family believes strongly in service to the community, they have remained very
active in the LaGrange Business Association, West Suburban Chamber of Commerce, the Illinois

Under this proposed extension, the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) will
continue to operate a toll-free housing counseling helpline service and manage and administer
housing counseling services to residents in foreclosure. IHDA‘s helpline provides critical
information to families facing foreclosure, assigns families to a HUD-certified housing
counseling agency, and schedules housing counseling workshops and appointments for the
families. Housing counseling services are provided county-wide by IHDA‘s 12 HUDcertified subcontractors. Selected after a rigorous application process, these agencies conduct
housing counseling workshops and provide families with housing counseling on a one-on-one
basis. They help families facing foreclosure apply for loan modifications or develop other
options to avoid foreclosure whenever possible. Over the past year ended March 31, 2013, the
IHDA contract assisted more than 32,000 families through the helpline, provided 5,000
families with free one-on-one housing counseling sessions, and provided more than 3,000

workshops throughout Cook County. Each family receives an average of four, one-on-one
counseling sessions. As of March 31, 2013, there were 75,533 mortgage foreclosures pending
in the Circuit Court of Cook County.
IHDA was originally selected to provide the program‘s housing counseling and helpline
services in March 2010 with the initiation of the program. A request for proposals (RFP)
process was conducted that year, but due to on-going and significant program enhancements
and developments, the RFP did not yield satisfactory results. A new RFP is now in review
with the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer. This extension will provide services while
the RFP is completed.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $951,750.00 $423,000.00 (FY 2013: $389,500.00; and FY 2014: $562,250.00).

Under this proposed extension, the Chicago Bar Foundation (CBF) will continue to manage
and administer legal aid and mediation services to homeowners in foreclosure. The services
are provided by the CBF‘s three (3) subcontractors: Chicago Legal Clinic for pro bono legal
aid, Chicago Volunteer Legal Services for pro bono legal representation at mediation
sessions, and the Center for Conflict Resolution for mediator services. All services are
provided at no cost to the litigants and help them to understand their legal rights and
responsibilities, and provide defenses to the foreclosure. Over the past year ended March 31,
2013, the CBF contract provided 29,000 families with free legal advice and 1,148 families
with legal representation at mediation. More than 2,500 mediation sessions were conducted
during the year. As of March 31, 2013, there were 75,533 mortgage foreclosures pending in
the Circuit Court of Cook County.
The Chicago Bar Foundation and its three (3) subcontractors were originally selected to
provide the program‘s legal aid and mediation services in March 2010 with the initiation of
the program. A request for proposals (RFP) process was conducted that year, but due to ongoing and significant program enhancements and developments, the RFP did not yield
satisfactory results. A new RFP is now in review with the Office of the Chief Procurement
Officer. This extension will provide services while the RFP is completed.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1,150,250.00 $511,222.00 (FY 2013: $497,831.00; and FY 2014:
$652,419.00). Contract extension: August 1, 2013 through April 30, 2014 November 30, 2013. (310-260
Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2014 funds.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.

WHEREAS, human trafficking is defined by the United States Department of State as
―activities involved when one person obtains or holds another person in compelled service‖;
and
WHEREAS, an estimated 2.5 million people, 80 percent of whom are women and girls,
worldwide are victims of this modern day form of slavery; and
WHEREAS, in the city of Chicago and suburban Cook County someone is reported
missing every 30 minutes, many of those are girls as young as twelve years old who are held
against their will and fall victim to Human Trafficking; and
WHEREAS, recent statistics have named Human Trafficking the second largest most

profitable criminal enterprise among members of organized crime and violent street gangs;
and
WHEREAS, modern technology allows traffickers to operate virtually undetected by the
use of social media where many victims are forced to pose for humiliating and degrading
pictures that are then posted on the internet and available to be viewed by individuals
seeking to engage in sexual acts in exchange for money further contributing to the sexual
exploitation; and
WHEREAS, one of the most valuable resources available to traffickers to continue to
remain undetected while maintaining constant communication with victims of Human
Trafficking, their associates, and potential customers is the use of cellular phones; and
WHEREAS, no contract prepaid cell phones are referred to on the street as burners or drop
phones and are impossible to track because phone carriers do not require a contact, photo
identification or a minimum age; and
WHEREAS, in instances where law enforcement‘s only lead in rescuing a kidnapped
victim is being able to determine who a cell phone number is registered to, can be the
difference between life and death.
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners urges the United States Congress and the Illinois General Assembly to pass
legislation that would require all cell phone carriers to secure and keep on file photo
identification which includes a physical address from any person wishing to obtain a
cellular phone whether or not a contract is involved.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this resolution be presented to the President of the
United States, the legislative leaders of Congress from both political parties, the Governor
of the State of Illinois, the legislative leaders of the General Assembly from both political
parties and all Members of Congress who represent Cook County and all Members of the

CONTRACT ADDENDUM

DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to extend on a month-to-month basis, not to

DDW & Associates/REB Storage Systems International was selected from two (2) vendor
bids received through the open market bid process. The contract for the rental of shelving was
approved by the County Board on February 4, 2009. The vendor designed, installed and
anchored the shelving to the 89th Street warehouse floor. The temporary storage shelving
system was needed by the Clerk of the Circuit Court to maintain a total of 3,072 pallets of
court documents until space was made available at the new Cicero Record Center.
The extension period and increase is needed to allow adequate time for any construction
delays, the relocation of all court documents, supplies and equipment from 1120 East 89th
Street to the new warehouse location. Additionally, so that the contract can be properly
terminated time is needed for the break-down and removal of the shelving from the warehouse
premises. Until the construction of the new warehouse is completed and relocation of the
records, we believe that it is more cost effective and efficient to retain the expertise and
services of the current vendor. This extension period is not to exceed six months (with a

include one-on-one visits, neighborhood meetings, and the distribution of informational
brochures in those Cook County communities hardest hit by the mortgage foreclosure crisis.
CCT does not receive an administration fee for their services. Over the past 12 months ended
February 28, 2013, CCT‘s representatives visited more than 19,000 homes and participated in
164 community meetings and events throughout Cook County. As of March 31, 2013, there
were 75,533 mortgage foreclosures pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County.
The Chicago Community Trust was originally selected to manage the program‘s community
outreach services in March 2010 with the initiation of the program. A request for proposals

JUVENILE PROBATION AND COURT SERVICES DEPARTMENT
PROPOSED CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 17, 2013 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
and
SHANNON E. ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a contract with Aunt
Martha's Youth Service Center, Inc. (Aunt Martha‘s), Olympia Fields, Illinois, for the Juvenile Probation
and Court Services Department‘s Evening Reporting Centers Program and pre-trial services.
Reason:

Aunt Martha's is recommended based upon a Request for Proposal (RFP) No.13-23001. Aunt Martha's was the only vendor to respond to the RFP.
The Evening Reporting Centers Program combines community-based alternative detention
sites with electronic monitoring. Judges order selected, nonviolent minors, both male and
female, who would otherwise qualify for detention in the Cook County Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center (JTDC) to one of six Centers. Approximately 40 percent of the minors
subject to probation pretrial supervision are ordered to the program for up to 21 days. The
Centers provide minors with highly structured and well supervised group activities during
high risk periods. The program's goal is to reduce the likelihood of re-arrest and to allow
minors to continue to attend school and remain at home. Juveniles are supervised five days
per week from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. in five Chicago locations and one suburban location. Staff
members offer minors educational activities, recreational programming and life
development workshops. Center staff also teach social/life skills to reinforce pro-social
behaviors and provide tutoring support for school work. The centers provide transportation
for the minors to and from home. In calendar 2012, more than 1,850 minors were admitted,
for a total of more than 15,100 center service days.

354

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31, 2013
In addition to the Evening Reporting Centers Program, the contract provides for pretrial
services for youth, ages 10-18, who have pending juvenile charges. Directed by judicial
order, pretrial services are provided seven days a week and include group therapy, home
visitation, curfew and school attendance monitoring, and referrals to services in the
community. Services are coordinated by two full-time Aunt Martha‘s case managers, who
conduct thorough assessments of the adolescent and family situations and develop
responsive case plans. On average, approximately 60 juveniles every day participate in the
program from 21 to 30 days.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $5,192,166.00 (FY 2013: $574,776.00; FY 2014: $1,724,320.00; FY 2015:
$1,730,720.00; and FY 2016: $1,162,350.00). Contract period: August 1, 2013 through July 31, 2016.
(326-298 Account).
Approval of this item would commit funds for Fiscal Years 2014, 2015 and 2016.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.

(c)
The members of this committee shall attend meetings to be held at the Medical
Examiner‘s Office on a quarterly basis, beginning with the third quarter of the fiscal year in which this
Ordinance is enacted.
(d)
The committee shall prepare an annual report. The report shall be distributed to the

year. The report shall include minutes of meetings of the Advisory Committee over the past year,

(4)

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31, 2013
(5)

Return fee. The Return Fee is charged to funeral homes that pick up bodies from the
Medical Examiner‘s Office and then request to return them to the Office after
determining that the family has no funds for burial. This cost would include the cost of
the burial shell and the burial cost.

(6)

Death certificate amendment fee. Fee is charged if the amendment is made later than one
year of the person‘s death (due to a return by Funeral Home). The Office of the Medical
Examiner is charged by the Illinois Department of Vital Records for amendments made
to a death certificate after one year of the death.

(7)

Storage fee. This fee covers the bodies returned (by the Ffuneral Hhomes) to the Office
of the Medical Examiner for storage while families secure funds for burial services and
bodies brought to the Medical Examiner‘s Office from hospice, nursing homes, and
hospitals for cases not falling under Medical Examiner jurisdiction as defined in Sec, 38118. This "storage fee" would replace the "return fee" if a funeral home returns a body
and picks it up again within ten days. If the body is not picked up within ten days, the
body will be held and buried by the County according to the standard operating
procedures of the Medical Examiner. This "storage fee" discourages the use of the Office
of the Medical Examiner as a storage location by funeral homes and also encourages the
funeral directors to verify that families have funds for burial prior to removing a body
from the Office of the Medical Examiner. The ability to accept cases for storage will be
at the discretion of the Medical Examiner and will depend on the current and anticipated
morgue census. This ―storage fee‖ discourages the use of the Office of the Medical
Examiner as a storage location for non-Medical Examiner cases or cases that have been
discharged from the Medical Examiner‘s Office to funeral homes and encourages funeral
directors to verify that families have funds for burial prior to removing a body from the
Office of the Medical Examiner. In the cases of funeral homes, this ―storage fee" would
replace the "return fee" if a funeral home returns a body and picks it up again within ten
days. If the body is not picked up within ten days, the body will be held and buried by the
County according to the standard operating procedures of the Medical Examiner.

(8)

Photographs, radiographs, and histology slides.

(9)

Charge to non-county owned hospitals for the acceptance of fetal remains not falling
under the jurisdiction of the Medical Examiner.

(10)

Confirmation of death letter.

(11)

Tissue procurement morgue use fee. Fee charged to a certified facility or program
seeking to procure tissue from bodies located at the Medical Examiner's Office. The fee
covers tissue procurement per body by a tissue procurement facility or program
authorized by the Medical Examiner.

(12)

Student rotation fee. Fee charged to institutions providing student rotations at the
Medical Examiner's Office to offset the County's costs for disposable supplies as well as
the staff time supervising the student rotation.

(13)

Staff supervision of external experts. Fee charged to individuals requesting to review
slides, images and/or records at the Medical Examiner's Office to offset staff costs for
supervising such review.

364

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31, 2013
(14)

Toxicology send out fees. Fee charged for processing, packaging and shipping
specimens to reference labs at the request of the decedent's next of kin for testing.

(15)

Lab use fee. Fee charged to institutions authorized by the Medical Examiner and County
Board to use the Medical Examiner‘s Office and supplies for teaching purposes.

(16)

Expert witness fees. Fees will be charged to attorneys for expert consultation and
trial/deposition time for the Chief Medical Examiner, Assistant Chief Medical Examiner
Assistant Medical Examiners, and Toxicologists as well as their travel time and case
review time for Medical Examiner cases leading to civil litigation. Such fees will not
apply to criminal proceedings related to Medical Examiner cases.

Sec. 38-136. Debt due County.
All fees and expense reimbursements shall constitute a debt due the County of Cook and be paid
to the Medical Examiner who shall deposit the same with the County Treasurer on the last day of every
month.
Sec. 38-137. Impersonation unlawful.
It shall be unlawful for any individual to impersonate the Medical Examiner and/or any Medical
Examiner investigator.
Sec. 38-138. Penalty for violation.
Any person who knowingly violates any provision of this ordinance shall be fined not more than
$1,000.00 and imprisoned not more than six months.
Sec. 38-139. Annual report.
The Medical Examiner shall prepare and submit to the Cook County Board of Commissioners an
annual report of the activities of his/her office.
Sec. 38-140. Medical Examiner fees.
Effective December 1, 2012, the Medical Examiner Fees Fund established on March 1, 2011 is
hereby eliminated and all fees in the Medical Examiner Fee Fund on or before November 30, 2012and all
of the various fees of the Office of the Medical Examiner received on or after December 1, 2012 shall be
transferred or deposited into the County‘s general fund and placed into an account designated for use by
the Office of the Medical Examiner as noted by the Budget Director. All of the various fees collected by
the Office of the Medical Examiner will continue to be used solely for the purchase of electronic and
forensic identification equipment or other related supplies and operating expenses of the Medical
Examiner's Office.
Sec. 38-141. Notice of possession of an identified body.
(a)
Whenever the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office takes possession of an identified
body or the remains of a body the Medical Examiner's Office is hereby required to obtain request

365

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31, 2013
and time of notification, the name and contact information of the next-of-kin, and the date and time of the
receipt of the body. In the event that the appropriate law enforcement authority is unable to locate the next
of kin within 48 72 hours of the body arriving at the Medical Examiner's Office, the Medical Examiner's
Office shall obtain verification that the next of kin cannot be initially located but shall continue to work
with the investigating agency to verify notification of next-of-kin and shall log these efforts. The Medical
Examiner's Office shall retain such records in the case file for a period of at least two years. As described
in Section 38-125 all personal possessions of the decedent shall be recorded.
(b)
In the event the Medical Examiner's Office cannot obtain verification that next of kin has
been notified that the decedent's body is in the possession of the Medical Examiner's Office, the Medical
Examiner's Office may seek the assistance of the Chicago Police Department, Cook County Sheriff's
Office., Public Administrator, or any other relevant agency and will keep a log of identification efforts.
Sec. 38-142. Retention of an identified decedent.
(a)
Where the Medical Examiner has no legal reason for retaining a body and no person(s)
can or will take responsibility for the final disposition of the decedent, the Medical Examiner shall have
the authority to properly dispose of a body through burial or cremation within 60 days of notifying the
next of kin (if known), unless there is reason to believe that the deceased may be a veteran of the U.S.
Armed Forces. Where the Medical Examiner's Office has reason to believe that the decedent may be a
veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces, the Medical Examiner's Office shall have up to 90 days to properly
dispose of the body.
(b)
The Medical Examiner's Office is hereby authorized to seek certification from the
decedent‘s next of kin (if known) that the decedent is not a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces. In the event
that such certification is obtained and the next of kin cannot or will not assume responsibility for final
disposition, the Medical Examiner's Office shall properly dispose of the body within 60days.
(c)
Notwithstanding other provisions in this section, if the Medical Examiner determines that
an identified body needs to be retained longer than permitted then the Medical Examiner shall provide a
written report to the Advisory Committee and to the Board of Commissioners stating the reason for
retention. The Medical Examiner shall report to the Cook County Board on this matter quarterly.
(d)
An identified body will be considered potentially ―indigent‖ (either unclaimed or
disclaimed) if, after fourteen days, there are no apparent funds for burial. At that point the body will be
eligible for donation or educational purposes in accordance with the Illinois Compiled Statutes 410 ILCS
510 Cadaver Act. Prior to releasing the body for donation or educational purposes, an additional three
days will be spent notifying the next-of-kin (if known), attempting to verify and locate next-of-kin (if not
known) and confirming that the decedent is not eligible for a non-County funded burial or VA benefits.
(e)
Indigent remains will be buried or cremated at County expense as soon as practical
provided that there are no funds for burial, the next-of-kin has refused to take responsibility for final
disposition of the remains, and that the decedent is not entitled to burial through non-County funds or VA
benefits.

Unidentified remains will be buried once all reasonable investigative and scientific
efforts have been made to identify the body. Unidentified remains will not be cremated.

requesting authorization to renew a grant in the amount of $28,065.00 from the Illinois
Department of Human Services to provide court-ordered counseling services to domestic
violence offenders who have been found guilty of misdemeanor domestic violence offenses
against an intimate partner and are under the supervision of the Social Service Department,
Circuit Court of Cook County.
The Social Service Department's Domestic Violence Program complies with the standards for
abuser treatment as set forth in the Illinois Protocol for Domestic Abuse Batterers Programs.
Established in 1979, the program operates in Chicago and all five (5) suburban municipal
districts. Specially trained probation staff provide supervision, group intervention, and requisite
abuser treatment to offenders. By integrating the authority and sanctions of the court with stateof-the-art abuser treatment intervention in a court-based setting, the department attends to victim
safety, maximizes the impact of treatment, and works within the judicial process to hold
offenders accountable for their abusive behavior.
The authorization to accept the previous grant was given on September 10, 2012 by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners in the amount of $5,796.00. On May 29, 2013, the County
Board approved a supplemental award increasing the overall grant amount to $34,776.00.

DEPARTMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATION OPERATIONS
CONTRACT ADDENDUM
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 12, 2013 from
LYDIA MURRAY, Chief Information Officer
and
SHANNON E. ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to increase by $1,228,020.00 and extend for
one (1) year, Contract No. 09-41-276 with Sentinel Technologies, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, for services
related to the staffing and management of Cook County's Wide Area Network (WAN).
Brian/Catrice:
The 7/31 contains the previously discussed issue with the contract for Sentinel Technologies (page 386).
The following language in the item as it currently reads was incorrectly amended via the errata:
Board approved amount 09-01-10 07-21-09:
Previous increase approved 11-04-09:
Previous increase approved 09-01-10:
Previous increase approved 09-20-11
Previous increase approved by the Chief Procurement Officer:

990,808.22
1,228,020.00
$4,489,636.44 6,620,444.66

If approved, this request will extend the Sentinel contract by one (1) year, during which time
the County will complete its joint City-County Request for Proposal (RFP) for replacement
services. Currently, the City-County RFP evaluation committee is deliberating upon
submitted proposals; and it aims to have a replacement vendor selected by early Fall 2013.

381

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31, 2013

Extending this contract for one (1) year will give the County sufficient time to: (a) select a
replacement vendor, (b) negotiate a contract with the vendor, and (c) transition services
between Sentinel and the replacement vendor. During such time, the contract extension will
allow the County to maintain Wide Area Network (WAN) on-going administration and
trouble-shooting services, project staffing and management, tier one help desk and tier two
escalation services, network performance and security analyses, and firewall administration.
This one-year extension also specifically requires the vendor to deliver transition-out services
and documentation in order to minimize disruption to County Information Technology (IT)
services.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1,228,020.00 (FY 2013: $307,005.00; and FY 2014: $921,015.00). Contract
period: September 1, 2013 through August 31, 2014. (490-441 Account).

CONTRACT AMENDMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 27, 2013 from
LYDIA MURRAY, Chief Information Officer
and
SHANNON E. ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to amend Contract No. 12-90-022 with
Phoenix Business Solutions, LLC, Alsip, Illinois, for County-wide telephone equipment and supplies.
This amendment request would: (1) correct the contract term previously submitted to this Board to
properly be a two-year term, (2) increase the contract from $263,598.00 to $563,598.00, an amount
appropriate for a two-year term, and (3) amend the contract to properly include items meeting County
needs.
Reason:

In mid-2012 and after a competitive procurement, the County awarded this contract for the
County's purchase of telephone equipment and other telecommunication supplies. While the
Invitation to Bid advertised a two-year term and the contract term was two years, the item
submitted to this Board incorrectly stated that the contract term was one year. The estimates
used to determine the contract amount also improperly used this one-year-term assumption.
Bureau of Technology (BOT) now seeks approval to correct the contract term and amount to

382

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31, 2013
properly reflect the County's needs over two (2) years. Further, BOT seeks to add a small
number of telecommunication devices that are available to purchase under the contract to also
meet the County's needs.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $300,000.00 (FY 2013: $93,000.00; andFY 2014: $207,000.00). Contract
period: August 1, 2012 through July 31, 2014. (490-333 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2014 funds.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.

Information Officer be approved. The motion carried.
