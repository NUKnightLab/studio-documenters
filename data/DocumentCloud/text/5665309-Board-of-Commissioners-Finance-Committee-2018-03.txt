PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT

Section 74?71 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:

Sec. 74-71. - Laws regulating the payment of wages.

 Living wage requirement.

(1) Unless expressly waived by the County Board, any Employer occupying a property that receives
a property tax incentive for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9
multifamily residential property shall pay not less than the Living Wage, as de?ned in the Cook
County Procurement Code (Cook County, 111., Code, Ch. 34, Art. IV, Div. 1 34-l 21), to each
of its onsite Employees, unless such Employees' Wages are governed by Federal or State
prevailing wage law. For purpose of this Section, the term ?Employee" shall mean an Employee
who performs duties or services for an Employer on average at least 30 hours per week in any
two-week period for which the Employee is paid; "hours per week" shall mean hours for which
an Employee is paid or entitled to payment by the Employer for a period of time during which no
duties are performed by the Employee due to vacation, holiday, illness, incapacity, jury duty,
military duty or approved leave of absence.

(2) On and after July 1, 2020, the owner of any property that receives a property tax incentive shall
notify all Employers who occupy such property as lessees of the requirements of this Section.
Upon commencement of a lease, on or after July 1, 2020, of a pr0perty that receives a property
tax incentive, any new lessee shall be required to submit to the municipality or the Cook County
Board, as the case may be, an affidavit stating that such lessee is paying a Living Wage to its
Employees in compliance with this Section. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
requirements of this Section shall not apply to an Employer who was a lessee and not an
owner?occupant of a property that receives a property tax incentive prior to July 1, 2020.

(3) This Section shall not apply to Employers that are not-for-pro?t organizations or funded by
Federal grants or Federal loans or Employers who are lessees but are not owners of a property
that receives a property tax incentive prior to adoption of this amended Ordinance. Further, this
Section shall not apply to Employers who can demonstrate to the County Board that compliance
with the requirements of this Section would cause such Employer to be in violation of the terms
of a collective bargaining agreement between the Employer and a labor union.

(4) Every Employer required to pay the Living Wage shall notify its Employees of the Living Wage
requirements and shall notify all of its Employees annually of any adjustment to the Living Wage.
In addition, the Employer shall notify its Employees that if any Employee contends that the
Employer is not paying a Living Wage or has otherwise violated this section, that Employee may
?le a complaint with the Cook County Commissioner on Human Rights ("Commission"). The
Commissioner shall investigate alleged violations of the Living Wage Ordinance and is authorized
to adopt regulations for the proper administration and enforcement of its provisions. If at the
conclusion of the Commission's investigation, the Commission finds that the Employer has
violated this section, it shall in the case of an Employer receiving a property tax incentive,
notify the Assessor; or (ii) in the case of a Contractor or a subcontractor required to pay the
Living Wage, notify the CPO, who shall exercise such remedies as are in the best interest of the
County, including ordering the Employer to pay back pay and penalties, as provided in this
section.

(5) If an Employer is found to be in violation of this section, such Employer may be required to pay
back pay to each affected Employee, and may also be ?ned by the County up to $100.00 for
each affected Employee for each day paid at less than the Living Wage. Such penalties will not
be imposed on any Person except after a hearing (Cook County, Code, Ch. 2, Art. IX).
Further, if an Employer is found to be in violation of this section, the property tax incentive for
this property is subject to revocation.

(6) If an Employer is found to have retaliated against an affected Employee, the Employer?s property
tax incentive may be terminated unless such Employer appropriately reinstates or compensates
such Employee.

Property tax incentive means a reduction in the assessment level as set forth in Division 2 of this
Article for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9 multifamily residential
property. "PrOperty tax incentive" shall not include a Class 9 designation granted to supportive living
facilities, which establish an alternative to nursing home care for low income older persons and persons
with disabilities under Medicaid and which are certi?ed by the State Department of Public Aid pursuant to
Division 2 ofthis Article; and

industrial property or a Class 8 industrial property tax incentive shall maintain in its files and

Wage Af?davit submitted by the owner or lessee of such property stating that such owner or
lessee is paying a Living Wage to its Employees in compliance with this Section. Further, an

PROPERTY TAX INCENTIVE PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENT

BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 74 TAXATION, Section
74-71 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:

Sec. 74-71. - Laws regulating the payment of wages.
Living wage requirement.

(1) Unless expressly waived by the County Board, any Employer occupying a property that receives
a property tax incentive for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9
multifamily residential property shall pay not less than the Living Wage, as de?ned in the Cook
County Procurement Code (Cook County, 111., Code, Ch. 34, Art. 1V, Div. 1 34?121), to each of
its onsite Employees, unless such Employees' Wages are governed by Federal or State prevailing
wage law. For purpose of this Section, the term ?Employee" shall mean an Employee who
performs duties or services for an Employer on average at least 30 hours per week in any two-
week period for which the Employee is paid; "hours per week" shall mean hours for which an
Employee is paid or entitled to payment by the Employer for a period of time during which no
duties are performed by the Employee due to vacation, holiday, illness, incapacity, jury duty,
military duty or approved leave of absence.

(2) On and after July 1, 2020, the owner of any property that receives a property tax incentive shall
notify all Employers who occupy such property as lessees of the requirements of this Section.
Upon commencement of a lease, on or after July 1, 2020, of a property that receives a property
tax incentive, any new lessee shall be required to submit to the municipality or the Cook County
Board, as the case may be, an affidavit stating that such lessee is paying a Living Wage to its
Employees in compliance with this Section. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
requirements of this Section shall not apply to an Employer who was a lessee and not an owner-
occupant of a property that receives a property tax incentive prior to July 1, 2020.

(3) This Section shall not apply to Employers that are not-for-pro?t organizations or funded by Federal
grants or Federal loans or Employers who are lessees but are not owners of a property that receives
a property tax incentive prior to adoption of this amended Ordinance. Further, this Section shall
not apply to Employers who can demonstrate to the County Board that compliance with the
requirements of this Section would cause such Employer to be in violation of the terms of a
collective bargaining agreement between the Employer and a labor union.

(4) Every Employer required to pay the Living Wage shall notify its Employees of the Living Wage
requirements and shall notify all of its Employees annually of any adjustment to the Living Wage.
In addition, the Employer shall notify its Employees that if any Employee contends that the
Employer is not paying a Living Wage or has otherwise violated this section, that Employee may
?le a complaint with the Cook County Commissioner on Human Rights ("Commission"). The

Page 13 of18

Commissioner shall investigate alleged violations of the Living Wage Ordinance and is authorized
to adopt regulations for the prOper administration and enforcement of its provisions. If at the
conclusion of the Commission's investigation, the Commission ?nds that the Employer has
violated this section, it shall in the case of an Employer receiving a property tax incentive,
notify the Assessor; or (ii) in the case of a Contractor or a subcontractor required to pay the Living
Wage, notify the CPO, who shall exercise such remedies as are in the best interest of the County,
including ordering the Employer to pay back pay and penalties, as provided in this section.

(5) If an Employer is found to be in violation of this section, such Employer may be required to pay
back pay to each affected Employee, and may also be fined by the County up to $100.00 for each
affected Employee for each day paid at less than the Living Wage. Such penalties will not be
imposed on any Person except after a hearing (Cook County, 111., Code, Ch. 2, Art. IX). Further,
if an Employer is found to be in violation of this section, the property tax incentive for this property
is subject to revocation.

(6) If an Employer is found to have retaliated against an affected Employee, the Employer?s property
tax incentive may be terminated unless such Employer apprOpriately reinstates or compensates
such Employee.

(7) For the purposes of this Section:

Property tax incentive means a reduction in the assessment level as set forth in Division 2 of this
Article for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9 multifamily residential
property. ?Property tax incentive" shall not include a Class 9 designation granted to supportive living
facilities, which establish an alternative to nursing home care for low income older persons and persons
with disabilities under Medicaid and which are certi?ed by the State Department of Public Aid pursuant to
Division 2 ofthis Article; and

Sales tax means the Retailer's Occupation Tax, the Service Occupation Tax and/or the Use Tax.

(8) Living Wage Af?davit. Every municipality or the Cook County Board that provides a Resolution
or Ordinance or authorized of?cer letter, as the case may be, to an applicant for a Class 6b
industrial property or a Class 8 industrial property tax incentive shall maintain in its ?les and
records documentation that such municipality or the County Board received and ?led the Living
Wage Af?davit submitted by the owner or lessee of such property stating that such owner or lessee
is paying a Living Wage to its Employees in compliance with this Section. Further, an applicant
or lessee of a Class 9 multifamily residential property tax incentive shall provide the municipality
or the Cook County Board, as the case may be, a Living Wage Af?davit which shall be maintained
by such municipality or the Cook County Board in its ?les and records.
