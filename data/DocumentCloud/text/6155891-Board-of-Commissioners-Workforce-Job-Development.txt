WHEREAS, statistics show that long term unemployment individuals are more
likely to turn to crime and with unemployment rates in Cook County above the
national average it is paramount that P.O.E.T. along with the Workforce
Investment Board utilize the 15.5 million dollars from the Federal Economic
Stimulus Package dollars effectively.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that this Board conduct a public
hearing to discuss the allocation of 15.5 million dollars for Cook County’s
unemployed adults, dislocated workers and youth.
*REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE 05/05/09.
Mr. Charles Jenrich, Chairman of the Cook County Workforce Investment Board, stated it is an
honor to have been chosen for the task at hand. The role of the Board is to oversee those
dollars that come to us for the South and West of Cook County. The Board is approximately
54% private enterprise. The Board looks for directions from the President’s Office of
Employment Training. The monies are mandated through the Federal and State. A percentage
of the dollars must go to dislocated workers, as well as to adult and youth funding programs.
The Board has set up an oversight committee that’s constantly evaluating the activities of the
vendors and providers for their services and if they are meeting performance expectation. The
Board has a unique opportunity this year; it is receiving 15 million dollars which is being given to
us during the stimulus period of time for activities over and above our normal yearly plan.
These dollars are provided for the dislocated workers, adult and youth population.
Ms. Karen S. Crawford, Director, President’s Office of Employment Training (P.O.E.T.), stated
on February 17, 2009, that President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and ReInvestment Act. The President’s Office and Employment Training (P.O.E.T.) received 15.5
million dollars in American Recovery and Re-Investment Act funding to be spent in a 120 days
and which has to be spent by June 30, 2010. The Workforce Board met last month to
determine how the funding should be utilized. Stimulus funding of 2.5 million dollars came to
P.O.E.T for adult services. The Workforce Investment Board, as a function of their work last
month, determined that the entire 2.5 million dollars of adult funding should be spent on
apprenticeship opportunities for adults in South and West suburban Cook County. P.O.E.T. will
put out a Request for Proposal (RFP) for agencies, service providers and companies that can
facilitate apprenticeship programs, so the adult population being served can “earn as they
learn”.
Ms. Crawford continued to state that with the youth funding, the Workforce Invest Board voted
to reactivate the President Stroger’s Summer Youth Program. They elected to spend 100% of
funding on summer jobs this year. P.O.E.T. put out a Request for Proposal (RFP) and in the
process of gearing up for over a thousand young people to work across Cook County in the
summer jobs program. The dislocated worker program is the largest pool of funding at 7.2
million. The Board’s decision for dislocated workers’ money was to use that to focus on
apprenticeships, on job training opportunities, incumbent worker opportunities and traditional
services for dislocated workers.
Chairman Collins asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers,
in accordance with Cook County Code, Sec. 2-108(dd):
