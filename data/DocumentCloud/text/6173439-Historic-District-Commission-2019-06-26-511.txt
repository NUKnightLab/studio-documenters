PROPOSAL
The building at 511 Woodward is a 5-story office building with mirrored bronze glazing and brown brick accents
constructed in the early 1970s. A narrow linear plaza and several tree planters, also executed in brown brick in a
style typical of the era, provides a narrow public space along the front of the building. Rooftop mechanical
enclosures are unusually large with respect to the small size of the building and appear to be shaped in an attempt to
unify the composition of the building. The building occupies a prominent location on Woodward, mediating between
Detroit’s primary boulevard and the landmark Guardian Building immediately adjacent to the west.
The applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval for the following scope:


•
•
•
•

Removal of the existing curtain wall and replacing with a new curtain wall system with Low E butt
glass.
Addition of a 1’-6” deep screen wall over most of the building facade.

STAFF OBSERVATIONS
511 Woodward (also known as 501 Woodward) has been vacant for some time, including a period of public
ownership. The building is specifically called out in the district’s Elements of Design as a “non-contributing
building,” suggesting that the Commission should focus primarily on the appropriateness of the proposed exterior
alterations with respect to the surrounding context, rather than the impact on the existing building.
The current building was erected in 1971-1972 for Detroit Federal Savings and Loan on a narrow parcel created after
Woodward was widened in the 1960s. Ted Rosvoy Associates was the architect. The building has a suburbanthemed, highly-reflective bronze glass curtain wall system which has suffered damage in several areas. Perhaps the
site’s most architecturally distinguished feature is the brick plaza, which is a fairly well developed execution of this
Nixon-era typology, featuring a unified brown brick that extends down from the building walls, forms a horizontal
surface, and then curves back up to form the walls of the planters, with special coping-sized bricks forming the top
course absent a sill or cap. Despite being continuously open and accessible, the plaza sees little use. Large trees do
survive in most of the planters, providing some shade and beauty to the streetscape.

There is an existing State of Michigan historic marker awkwardly incorporated into the plaza. The marker was
installed in 1972 at the same time as the plaza, and marks the installation of the first service by what later became
Michigan Bell. The marker reads:
“On September 22, 1877, a Bell telephone was installed on this site in the drugstore operated by Frederick
Stearns. An iron wire strung along rooftops connected the store with the Stearns laboratory a half-mile
away at the foot of Fifth Street. This service, only eighteen months after Alexander Graham Bell patented
his invention, was the first to be offered by the organization which eventually developed into the Michigan
Bell Telephone Company. A placard in the store window invited the public to drop in every hour on the
hour to speak over the amazing new devise. Other private lines followed, but it was a year before the first
telephone exchange was constructed with fifteen or twenty subscribers on each party line.”
The applicant states that the marker will be integrated within the new plaza. The building occupied by Stearns is
obviously no longer extant on the site.

Per the appended drawings and presentation, the applicant proposes to dramatically refashion the exterior envelope
with a glass curtain wall system combined with a draped “parametric façade screen”, also referred to as a “shade
wall” or a “screen wall,” taking cues from some of the mid-century context in the historic district. The material is
described as “metallic toned panels” and would be selected from a small palette of neutral colors. In response to staff
inquiry concerning several aspects of the proposed detailing, the applicant provided some additional detail regarding
the strut connections between the screen wall and the glass curtain wall, which is also appended to this report. The
applicant also described the screen wall as such:
“The updated building façade will complement the many design styles in the Detroit Financial District. The current
glass curtain wall will be upgraded with patterned screen wall attached to the existing building structure. The

 screen wall is being developed as a space frame structural component with elegant tubular components which will
penetrate the new curtain wall at spandrel glass with attachment to the existing structural steel and concrete
framing system. Screen wall, with chevron shaped, aluminum or FRP material elements will be attached to the space
frame grid in a regular pattern. The overall system will allow light penetration into the build interior as well as
vision out from the building interior. Select areas will allow unobstructed views from the building interior to Spirit
Plaza and Campus Martius. In addition, the exterior wall system is being designed to allow for curtain wall
maintenance and cleaning between the glass and screen. The wall system will be highlighted with dimmable exterior
lighting for provide a soft elegant building evening experience.”
It is staff’s opinion that the detailing of the screen wall or parametric drapery has not been fully presented and/or
developed and thus would require later follow-up at the staff level (minimally) if approved in concept, with some
guidance on expectations from HDC. Particularly of interest would be the edge conditions and the size, nature,
materiality, and inter-connections of the screen’s constituent elements. The potential choice of fiber-reinforced
plastic (FRP) per applicant’s statement above is questioned for both appropriateness within the district and long-term
viability and durability. The incorporation of lighting into the exterior envelope is also unclear, but could be tracked
by staff should the Commission reach a conceptual understanding with the applicant.
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1) Height. The thirty-six (36) buildings in the district range in height from two (2) to forty-seven (47) stories
tall; the average being twelve (12) stories tall. The row of four (4) to five (5) story Victorian buildings on the
east side of Woodward Avenue is sandwiched between single, taller buildings on each of its two (2) corners. The
prominent skyline-defining buildings on Griswold Street range in height from eighteen (18) to forty-seven (47)
stories tall; buildings in the blocks between Shelby Street and Washington Boulevard are ten (10) or fewer
stories, with the exception of the Detroit Bank and Trust Tower at 211 West Fort Street, which is twenty-eight
(28) stories. In general, there is little uniformity of building heights within the district.
(2) Proportion of building's front façade. The proportions of individual front façades vary greatly within the
district. Buildings over ten (10) stories tall are significantly taller than wide, and are usually located on corners
of blocks or occupy their entire block. Most other buildings in the district are also taller than wide, with notable
exceptions of several buildings facing Fort Street, the Detroit Fire Department Headquarters at 250 East Larned
Avenue, and a few smaller buildings on Shelby Street, which are wider than tall or proportionally neutral. The
non-contributing building at 501 Woodward Avenue and the building at 611 Woodward Avenue are significantly
wider than tall. Buildings with front-facing light courts, such as the Dime Building at 719 Griswold Street,
appear to have two tall tower projecting upward from a single, multi-story base. The façades of the neoclassical
style First National Building at 660 Woodward Avenue follow the irregular footprint of its site, and because of
its substantial height, provide a backdrop to the small-scaled buildings adjacent to it on Woodward Avenue.
Skyscraper buildings of the Art Deco style have multiple setbacks in their wall surfaces as the buildings rise,
with faceted and decorative results. The Detroit Free Press Building at 321 West Lafayette Boulevard is
composed of a center tower with two lower wings, neutralizing its proportions. Tall buildings of the
International style tend to rise as a single slab. Where buildings that are individually taller than wide either share
a party wall or abut each other, they may collectively form a row that is wider than tall, particularly on the east
side of Woodward Avenue.
(3) Proportion of openings within the façades. The buildings within the Historic Detroit Financial District are
each composed of approximately thirty-five (35) percent o sixty (60) percent openings in their front façades.
Shapes and sizes of openings generally depend on the style and age of the buildings. Entrances are often
centered prominently on the front façades, with revolving doors set back in an arched, covered area of portico.
Large openings above the entrance openings, ground floors, and mezzanine levels in the base of the buildings
frequently contain subdivided windows rising up through multiple stories. Plate glass storefront and display
windows on the ground floors of commercial buildings are commonplace. Above the ornate bases of
Neoclassical and Art Deco buildings and simpler Victorian buildings are rows of doublehung sash windows that

 are twice as tall as wide and are often arranged in pairs or triples, sometimes divided vertically by spandrels.
Subdivided glazing is often situated within large, ornate arched, square or rectangular openings in the attic
stories. Replacement windows that are fitted to existing openings are common in the district. Some International
style buildings with curtain wall construction feature undivided faces of fixed pane glass, or individualized
treatments, such as hexagonal shaped window glass in precast concrete frames of One Woodward Avenue.
(4) Rhythm of solids to voids in the front façades. Most buildings in the district are of steel-frame construction,
which creates a structure for which windows are inserted in a regular arrangement of columns and rows between
the base floor and the attic. The regular rhythm of windows arranged one over the other in a grid pattern prevails
throughout the district. The base and attic stories of buildings are varied in architectural treatment, but may
feature regular rhythms of arched, square or rectangular openings on first and attic stories. The Detroit Fire
Department Headquarters at 250 West Larned Street features double firehouse doors within arcaded openings on
its Washington Boulevard and West Larned Street Façades. The International style building at 611 Woodward
Avenue features a checkerboard pattern of window placement, while the Federal Reserve Bank Annex at 160
West Fort Street features alternating horizontal bands of glass and marble panels supported by a stainless steel
grid above its all-glass tall first story. In general, the district displays a variety of regularly arranged fenestration
patterns.
(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. Rhythm of spacing on streets is generally determined by setbacks
from the side lot lines. Buildings consistently abut each other throughout the district; public rights-of-ways
separates stretches of adjacent buildings when they occupy partial or entire blocks. Where there are parking lots
as a result of building demolition, the original rhythm is broken.
(6) Rhythm of entrances and/or porch projections. Most primary entrances are prominently centered on their
front façades, especially on the classically derived buildings, and are commonly recessed within single or
multiple ornamental openings. Some buildings have colonnades or monumental porticos, with their entrances set
behind. international style buildings often have entire base stories recessed behind a colonnade of piers. The
Guardian Building at 500 Griswold Street has its main entrance at its northwest corner, and Victorian
commercial buildings along Woodward tend to have entrances to the sides of storefronts. Some corner buildings
have corner entrances. Most entrances are at grade, with the exceptions of the buildings at 611 Woodward
Avenue and the west elevation of 211 West Fort Street, which each feature a set of steps that rise with the slope
of their sites, and United States District Count at 231 West Lafayette Boulevard, which sits on a high basement
and has steps leading to its main entrance.
(7) Relationship of materials. A great variety of building materials exist throughout the district, with
concentrations of finished, pressed or glazed brick, limestone, Mankato stone, terra cotta, marble; cast and
porcelain enamel and glass facing primary façades. Base stories are commonly faced or partially faced in
granite,. Materials utilized for window surrounds and frames are cast concrete, steel, aluminum, bronze and
wood. Architectural embellishments tend to be in cast and carved stone, glazed terra cotta, Pewabic tile, and red
sandstone. Common brick appears on side elevations that were not intended to be visible. Bronze grills, metal
fire escapes, and aluminum and steel framing elements are also visible. In general, the district is rich in its
varieties and relationships of materials.
(8) Relationship of textures. The smooth surfaces of glazed or painted brick, glazed terra cotta, polished marble,
polished granite, and large expanses of glass contrast with the matte finishes of limestone and unpainted brick
with mortar joints. Where the basis of buildings are rusticated, they contrast with the smoother wall surfaces
above. Repetitive pilasters and ornamental detail in masonry, terra cotta or metal, primarily on belt courses and
cornices, and the fluting of columns, contribute significantly to textural interest. Subdivided window sashes and
treatments also contribute to textural interest, as do receding windows and wall planes, resulting in textural
effects created by light and shade. Where those International style buildings have glass basis, a smooth,
transparent textural effect results. In general, the district is extremely rich in textural relationships.

 (9) Relationship of colors. Major materials or light colors, such as beige, white, and cream, dominate the district.
The natural brick colors of red, orange, and buff are also contrasted with beige or light gray trim elements and
details. Painted brick, where it exists on the east side of Woodward Avenue, is in dark red and cream. Granite
bases, where they exist, are black, red or gray. Window surrounds and sashes are shades of green, black, cream
or white. Window and curtain wall glass is either colorless or tinted in shades of light green, black or gray.
Stainless steel and aluminum are silver in tone; grills and grates are green or black. The Guardian Building at
501 Griswold Street is a historic landmark featuring orange brick and colored tile light poles tend to be deep
green, black or gray. Fire escapes, where they exist, are generally painted black. The original colors of any
building;, as determined by professional analysis, are always acceptable for that building and may provide
guidance for similar buildings.
(10) Relationship of architectural details. The styles of the buildings compromising the Historic Detroit
Financial District range from Victorian commercial to International style; their architectural elements and details
relate to their styles. Entrance bays, architraves, base stories, window frames, spandrels and cornices or attics are
areas of the façades where architectural detail is concentrated. The small scale Victorian commercial buildings,
concentrated on the east side of Woodward, have modified storefronts on their first floors and have lost their
cornices and window hoods, greatly simplifying their original appearance. Approximately half of the buildings
in the district are derived from classical styles, with an abundance of Neoclassical style buildings, a style well
suited to judicial and financial institutions. Those classically inspired buildings are articulated as a base
(bottom), shaft (midsection) and attic (top). The base, often multi-storied, is heavily ornamented around the main
entrance with columns, arches, and architectural sculpture. Several buildings have rusticated stone bases, and
some display colossal porticos. The shafts contain regular fenestration with ornamented spandrels, and their
attics, including their cornices, are heavily ornamented. Art Deco commercial buildings are concentrated on
Griswold Street, and in addition to their embellished entrances, feature setbacks at upper floor levels that are
embellished, resulting in dramatic silhouettes that are part of their design. These Art Deco buildings also exhibit
decorative tile work, mosaics, and large-scale architectural sculpture. International style buildings of the 1950s
and early 1960s are concentrated on the east side of Woodward Avenue through to Griswold Street, and
intermingled with classically inspired buildings on West Fort Street. They feature transparent first stories of
glass that are visible to the interior, and are set in back of piers supporting the upper stories. Flagpole basis,
lighting, and street names integrated with the larger buildings are treated decoratively. In general, the
architectural detail on buildings in the district is very rich.
(11) Relationship of roof shapes. All of the buildings have flat roofs that cannot be seen from the ground. Utility
penthouses and/or equipment enclosures are sometimes visible above the roofline, and are sometimes
ornamentally treated.
(12) Walls of continuity. Walls of continuity within the district are primarily created by the adjacent buildings
with uniform elements, such as setbacks, materials, and styles. Except where broken by vacant lots, the district
has a very high degree of continuity. Secondary wall of continuity are created by evenly spaced lighting fixtures,
sidewalks and rows of trees along the sidewalks.
(13) Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. Throughout the district, sidewalks
are concrete and roadbeds are asphalt, with the primary exception of brick-paved areas around Campus Martius
at the northeast corner of the district. Street furniture is abundant throughout the district; planter boxes for trees
are positioned along the public sidewalk on the west side of Woodward Avenue and the north side of West Fort
Street, and in-ground trees line the east side of Griswold Street within stylized metal grates reflecting the
geometric designs of the Guardian Building at 500 Griswold Street. Wall-mounted lighting fixtures are often
integrated with the designs of the buildings and are situated at the tops of first story pilasters to illuminate the
pedestrian way. Also sometimes integrated with the taller buildings is lighting at the upper extremities that
identify the buildings from afar, such as the flashing red globe of the Penobscot Building at 645 Griswold Street,
the reproduction street lighting along Woodward Avenue consists of a tall steel ornamental, fluted pole carrying
a double pendent and lanterns. On Griswold Street, the lighting consists of old metal fluted poles with more

 recent lanterns. Old ornamental poles exist along Washington Boulevard south of Michigan Avenue; the modern
steel pole mounted variety is seen elsewhere. Some buildings have modern spotlights attached to light posts
directed at their façade. Slender black, metal kiosks with directional information and a map are strategically
placed at some prominent corners. Surface parking lots are few and provide intrusions to the otherwise dense
concentration of buildings where they exist. Concrete columns supporting the Detroit People Mover are situated
in the public rights-of-way on West Larned Street as well as Cass Avenue. A bronze sculpture is positioned at
the plaza in front of 1 Woodward Avenue; another is positioned at the extreme southeast boundary of the district
at Woodward Avenue and Jefferson Avenue; another is positioned in the space between 211 and 201 West Fort
Street. A plaza with raised planting beds exists in front of the Annex of the Federal Reserve Bank at 160 West
Fort Street. The curbed, landscaped median on Woodward Avenue identifies the roadway as Detroit's major
thoroughfare.
(14) Relationship of open space to structures. In general, the financial district is densely built-up; open space
results from interruptions by public streets and alleys, and by a few intrusive surface parking lots. Awnings and
canopies commonly extend into the public rights of way throughout the district. Signage bearing the name of the
businesses of the Victorian buildings on the east side of Woodward Avenue is situated in a frieze above the first
story. Elsewhere in the district the historic name of the building is commonly integrated with its original design
while the names of current occupants are displayed on vertically oriented signs hanging at the corners of the
buildings above the first story. The building at 611 Woodward Avenue bears its name of the roof penthouse
screen. Skywalks connect buildings when their ownership is or was related, connecting One Woodward Avenue
with 500 Woodward Avenue, commonly known as the Guardian Building; 151 West Fort Street, commonly
known as the State Savings Bank Building, with 607 West Shelby Street; and 201 West Fort Street with 211
West Fort Street. Wheelchair ramps provide access to an entrance on the Larned Street elevation of the Detroit
Fire Department Headquarters at 250 West Larned Street and to an entrance on the Lafayette Boulevard
elevation of the Federal Courthouse at 231 West Lafayette Boulevard.
(15) Scale of façades and façade elements. The façades range from small in scale to monumental. Small-andmedium scaled buildings that contribute to the continuous streetscapes contrast with the large scale of
skyscrapers that define Detroit's skyline. Elements and details are often monumental, such as porticos,
colonnades, architectural sculpture, and large openings, and are meant to provide a grand presence when seen
from upfront and afar.
(16) Directional expression of front elevation. The directional expression of individual front façades varies
throughout the district, but generally, the expression of buildings on Woodward Avenue tends to be horizontal,
with the exception of One Woodward Avenue and the First National Bank Building at 660 Woodward Avenue,
which are vertical. On Griswold Street, where several prominent Art Deco skyscrapers exist, the overall
directional expression is vertical. However, where buildings share party walls or one another, or are separated by
narrow alleyways, the horizontal, or pedestrian, nature of the streetscapes is emphasized.
(17) Rhythm of Building Setbacks. Most buildings occupy their entire building parcels, resulting in uniformity of
building setbacks. On the west side of Woodward Avenue, the building are set back, allowing for a generous
public sidewalk with amenities. The Detroit Fire Department Headquarters at 250 West Larned Street is set back
slightly on its two visible elevation to allow the fire trucks space to exit. Wherever a newer building is connected
to an older building, particularly on West Fort Street, the newer International style buildings are set back and
landscaped plazas are created.
(18) Relationship of lot coverages. Lot coverage by the buildings in the district is generally one hundred (100)
percent), as the vast majority of buildings occupy their entire lots. In the cases where a public outdoor amenity
exists, its features are integrated with the design of the building.

 (19) Degree of complexity within the facades. The district contains façades with various degrees of complexity,
depending on style. The Victorian commercial and Neoclassical buildings are straightforward in their massing,
fenestration, and architectural detail. The Art Deco skyscrapers appear more complex in their details and
ornamentation, but especially in their massing as the setbacks of the upper stories display different massing and
heightened detail. Modern buildings may appear straightforward in their design but are complex in their
geometric forms, use of materials, and subtle detail.
(20) Orientation, vistas, overviews. The Historic Detroit Financial District is a densely built up district of
commercial and governmental buildings in Detroit's Central Business District on lower Woodward Avenue and
west of Woodward Avenue. Its proximity to Detroit's Civic Center, the Detroit River, the Washington Boulevard
and Capitol Park Historic Districts, Cadillac Square, and Campus Martius provide dramatic views and vistas.
Detroit's skyline is composed of the silhouettes of the tallest buildings in the district, while West Congress Street
provides a cavernous quality to a relatively narrow street.
(21) Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. While individual buildings display a high degree of symmetry in
their major façades, the district on the whole is diverse in its array of quality building designs.
(22) General environmental character. The Historic Detroit Financial District consists of a dense cluster of
major, architect-designed commercial buildings in an eight-block, grid-plan section of downtown Detroit just
north of Hart Plaza and the Detroit River. its historical importance is emphasized by its number of iconic
buildings that make up Detroit's skyline, and its smaller buildings that result in a walkable downtown. The
Detroit Department of Transportation-operated bus system and the People Mover provide transportation in and
around the district providing ease of access to major sporting events, conventions, and restaurants, in addition to
the historic buildings that are destination in and of themselves.

Project:

511 Woodward Building Renovation
511 Woodward Ave.
Detroit, MI

Proposal:
The 511 Woodward Building is an existing 4 story, 30,000 sf, glass and brick structure built in 1972 located
at Congress and Woodward. The building is adjacent to Spirit Plaza and the main departure node of the Q
Line. The building will be renovated to make a dramatic statement in downtown Detroit while providing
exciting new lease space within the Financial District of Detroit.
511 Woodward is an existing building with screened mechanical units that serve both the 511 Woodward
building and the adjacent Guardian Building. The existing screening and mechanical units are to remain
on the building. Building designs in the district are of many different design styles and rhythms. The
renovated 511 Woodward building will build upon rhythm and allow curtain wall glass elements to project
through on the facade.
The updated building façade will complement the many design styles in the Detroit Financial District. The
current glass curtain wall will be upgraded with patterned screen wall attached to the existing building
structure. The screen wall is being developed as a space frame structural component with elegant tubular
components which will penetrate the new curtain wall at spandrel glass with attachment to the existing
structural steel and concrete framing system. Screen wall, with chevron shaped, aluminum or FRP
material elements will be attached to the space frame grid in a regular pattern. The overall system will
allow light penetration into the build interior as well as vision out from the building interior. Select areas
will allow unobstructed views from the building interior to Spirit Plaza and Campus Martius. In addition,
the exterior wall system is being designed to allow for curtain wall maintenance and cleaning between the
glass and screen. The wall system will be highlighted with dimmable exterior lighting for provide a soft
elegant building evening experience.
The adjacent Guardian Building and 511 Woodward building will maintain the gated alley for service use.
No other update is planned for this area except fresh paint on the 511 Woodward Building concrete block
wall.
511 Woodward is planning to provide an exciting active site plaza where the interior of the building can
flow out onto the slightly elevated plaza area around the building. Moreover, allowing the public space to
flow into the activated tenant areas on the first floor of the building. 2 large NANA walls are proposed to
provide 16’ – 18’ clear opening on the Woodward Ave 1st floor façade. The updated plaza area around the
building will receive paving tiles, seating walls, accent lighting, new planter with trees and planting at the
sidewalk edge retaining walls. Entry to this space and the main building entrance will be accessible and
clearly delineated. The exterior screen wall will not project below the 2nd floor level and its bottom cord
will project up at the building entry. By treating the façade in this fashion, the pedestrian experience on
3011 WEST GRAND BOULEVARD ∙ SUITE 222 · DETROIT ∙ MICHIGAN ∙ 48202 ∙ T 877 547.0885 ∙ F
877 547.8494

 approach to the building will be enhanced by the updated glass facade and landscaped plaza area. The
continuation of the Spirit Plaza experience and termination of the Q line make 511 Woodward an
identifiable destination and meeting point in Detroit.

Our proposed renovation scope of work plan will include:
•
•
•
•
•
