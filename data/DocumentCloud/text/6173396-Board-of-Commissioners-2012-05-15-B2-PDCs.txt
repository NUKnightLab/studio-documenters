COMPLIANCE

Participation and Section 3:
Compliance af?davits are on file for Harley Ellis Devereaux and Holabird Root, LLC. These

are task order contracts.

GENERAL BACKGROUND

In February of 2009 the Chicago Housing Authority solicited Architectural and
Engineering ?rms to provide Prime Design Consulting services for CHA facilities. The
PDC services include assessments, design, engineering, construction documents, construction
administration and close-out services. These design services were based on a construction value
of approximately $100,000,000.00 to support improvements over a ?ve (5) year period relating
to capital maintenance, unit rehabilitation, and retro?ts to common areas and non-dwellings
needed to comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 

On June 14, 2009 the Board of Commissioners approved funding in an aggregate amount not-to-
exceed $6,000,000.00 to Harley Ellis Devereaux Holabird Root, LLC
and Globetrotters Engineering Corporation The NTE amount was distributed
based on the ?nal evaluation scores of the awardees as follows: 35% to HED, 33% to and
32% to GEC. Each PDC was also assigned a region based on their evaluation results as follows:
I-IED - north region; central region; and GEC - south region. Each contract has a base
term of three (3) years plus the option to execute up to two (2) one-year options. The base
contract term was July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2012. Each option year is subject to approval by
the Board of Commissioners.

These contracts proved extremely helpful, providing a means to quickly pick up projects
originally planned to go to an out-of-state ?rm who had been awarded a contract in 2008 in the
amount of $4,750,000.00. That earlier contract was for the performance of the same types of
PDC services but had been designed as a single source for design services in order to promote
consistency of design. Over the next year this CHA strategy evolved from a single source PDC
?rm to a multiple PDC strategy in order to provide adequate capacity and foster greater
competition. This proved to be a sound strategy because in September of 2009 the out-of-state
?rm ceased its operations in Chicago. The Capital Construction Department resolved all open
items under the closed contract, then re?assigned uncompleted work to HED, and GEC,
and re-allocated the funding of $3,545,693.56 remaining on the closed contract to the three (3)
?rms. This funding was distributed in the same percentages used for their base contracts. These
changes were approved by the Board of Commissioners on July 20, 2010.

CONTRACTUAL CONSIDERATIONS

In order to meet the federally mandated deadline requirement for comply in a cost
effective manner with the Life Safety and High Rise ordinance, and have design services
available to meet the needs of the critical capital maintenance projects (such as facade repairs
and plumbing riser upgrades), the Capital Construction Department determined exercising
Option Year One of the PDC contracts is in the best interest of the CHA. The increase in the
funding for the PDCs is essential if the CHA is to successfully complete the Major Capital
Projects Plan for 2012 and 2013. Without an increase in funding, the CHA will be in jeopardy of
missing critical construction deadlines due to insuf?cient PDC capacity for design services.

The design fees necessary to meet the goals for the above are identi?ed below:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Value of Construction Dgign Fee Needs
Senior Housing Life Safety I
Capital Maintenance $30,500,000.00 $3,202,500.00
Federal requirements $11,000,000.00 $1,155,000.00
Scattered Sites $35,175,000.00 $4,992,750.00
Unit Acquisitions $9,240,000.00 $1,386,000.00
Aggregate increase to NTE value for all three (3) Contracts $10,736,250.00

 

 

 

The ?rst two (2) Design Fees are based on the industry standard of 10.5% of the value of
construction, as recommended by the Illinois Capital Development Board. The Scattered Sites
and Unit Acquisitions design fees were increased to 15% primarily due to the distinctive
elements of the wide variety of properties included in this program.

The $10,736,250.00 will be distributed among the PDCs using the original base contract
percentages, which were developed based on the anticipated amount of work to be performed in

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each region.

PDC Primary Region Secondary R3gi_on Percentage Design Fees
HED North South 35% $3,757,690.00
Central North 33% $3,578,750.00
GEC South Central 32% $3,339,810.00
TOTAL FEES $10,736,250.00

 

 

 

 

Two (2) major options to address the design fees necessary for 2012 and 2013 received extensive
consideration 

Option A 

Exercise Option Year No. 1 and Increase Funding of Current Firms

Advantages

A construction deadline of December 31, 2013 had already been put in place to
complete various projects plarmed in order to make the CI-IA fully compliant with
Federal regulations, and not only meet but achieve early compliance with
local Life Safety requirements. The lead times needed to design this work in order to
allow a suf?cient period to bid out the resultant construction work and complete it
necessitated that design services be in place by June 2012. By utilizing the current
PDCs, the CHA avoids the considerable loss of time, measured in months, that would
be needed to create and process a new procurement for PDCs and bring it before the
Board of Commissioners for approval.

The CHA will realize additional ef?ciencies in time and cost by using PDCs who
have built up a strong familiarity with the building portfolios, and already
have experienced teams in place, ready to begin work immediately.

The CHA will have the best chance to meet the Capital Maintenance deadlines

outlined in the 2012-13 Major Capital Projects Plan.
Disadvantages
- In this instance, it does not allow for the participation of new design ?rms.

Option New Procurement for Design Services
Advantages
0 Increased participation of ?new? design ?rms working with the CHA.
Disadvantages
Seriously jeopardizes the ability to meet the December 2013 construction
deadlines.
0 Past experience with new PDCs has demonstrated that an extended learning curve
will be necessary for them to understand the portfolio and design
requirements, losing additional valuable time.

The Capital Construction Department recommends Option A.
0 Exercise the ?rst option year of the PDC contracts and increase their design capacity to
support the Capital Construction Programs for 2012 and 2013.
The increased design capacity will support the goals presented in the Annual Plan for
Capital Improvement. These goals include Life Safety, compliance, Scattered
Sites, and Unit Acquisition requirements.

Based on the foregoing, the Capital Construction Department believes that it is in the best
interest for the Board of Commissioners to authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee
to execute Amendment No. 04 to Contract No. 9048 with Harley Ellis Devereaux and Contract
No. 9049 with Holabird Root, LLC, and Amendment No. 2 with Globetrotters Engineering
Corporation to increase the not-to-exceed contract amount for additional Prime Design
Consultant services at various properties and exercise Option Year No. for each contract.

Amendment No. 04 to Contract No. 9048 with Harley Ellis Devereaux will add ftmding in the
amount of $3,757,690.00 for a new total contract value not-to-exceed $7,098,682.75.
Amendment No. 04 to Contract No. 9049 with Holabird Root, LLC will add funding in the
amount of $3,578,750.00 for a new total contract value not-to-exceed $6,760,647.85.
Amendment No. 2 to Contract No. 9050 with Globetrotters Engineering Corporation will add
funding in the amount of $3,339,810.00 for a new total contract value not-to-exceed
$6,362,612.96. The aggregate increase to these contracts is the not-to-exceed amount of
$10,736,250.

The exercise of Option Year No. 1 will extend each contract end date from June 30, 2012 to June
30, 2013. The new term of each contract will be July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2013.

Each Amendment is subject to the Contractor?s continued compliance with the 
Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
