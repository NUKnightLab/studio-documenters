WHEREAS, the Alternate Payee VERSHONN J. CLARK IS entitled to claim a fifty percent
(50%) portion of the Participant’s Component I Retirement Allowance as set forth in the EDRO,

Therefore, no Component I Retirement Allowance is available as of May 12, 2014 to either the
Participant or the Alternate Payee, and whereas consistent with paragraph 10 of the EDRO, the
Police and Fire Retirement System is not required to pay any benefit not available under the
terms of the Combined Plan.
WHEREAS, the EDRO awards the Alternate Payee VERSHONN J. CLARK a fifty percent
(50%) portion of the Participant’s Component II Pension, including a pro-rata share of any
guaranteed automatic pension increases, which has accrued as of the division date of May 12,
2014, and
WHEREAS, the Alternate Payee VERSHONN J. CLARK IS entitled to claim a fifty percent
(50%) portion of the Participant’s Component II Pension as set forth in the EDRO and
SUBJECT TO ALTERNATE PAYEE FILING AN APPLICATION FOR SAME, and
WHEREAS, the court order provides for the parties to share the cost of the actuary’s fees, and
WHEREAS, the Board has been advised by General Counsel that the applicable terms of said
court order are consistent with the provisions of the Retirement System and applicable law,
including Public Act 46 of 1991, MCL 38.1701, et seq., and Public Act 100 of 2002, MCL
38.1681, et seq., as applicable,
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board acknowledges receipt of said court order and
shall pay pension benefits consistent with said court order and this resolution SUBJECT TO
APPLICATION BEING FILED BY THE PARTY SEEKING PAYMENT, and be it further
RESOLVED, that this file be forwarded to the Board’s actuary for calculation of the benefits to
be paid to the former spouse, and be it further
RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution be added to the Participant’s pension file, and other
appropriate records be kept for the Retirement System relative to this matter, and be it further
