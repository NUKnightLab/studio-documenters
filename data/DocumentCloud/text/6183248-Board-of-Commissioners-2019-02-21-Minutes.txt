COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
CONDEMNING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S TREATMENT OF
TRANSGENDER, GENDER NON-CONFORMING, AND INTERSEX INDIVIDUALS
WHEREAS, the Trump administration and the Department of Health and Human Services is considering
narrowly defining gender as a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth; and
51

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

February 21, 2019

WHEREAS, the Trump administration has banned transgender and gender non-conforming individuals
from serving in the United States military; and
WHEREAS, the Departments of Justice and Education withdrew landmark 2016 guidance explaining how
schools must protect transgender students under the federal Title IX law; and
WHEREAS, various other federal departments and agencies took direct action to weaken protections
against transgender individuals that has been documented by the National Center for Transgender Equality;
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has been informed of this by Commissioner Kevin
B. Morrison and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning (LGBTQ) advocates; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Kevin B. Morrison and LGBTQ advocates see this effort as a hateful attempt
to roll back recognition and protections of transgender, gender non-conforming, and intersex people; and
WHEREAS, this proposed definition by the Department of Health and Human Services would essentially
eradicate federal recognition of the estimated 1.4 million Americans who identify as a gender other than
the one they were assigned at birth; and
WHEREAS, this proposed definition would erase children who are born with intersex conditions, which
is about 1.7 percent of the population, having been born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn't
fit the typical definitions of female or male; and
WHEREAS, this position makes irrelevant and discounts what transgender, gender non-conforming and
intersex people understand about themselves and discounts what medical providers know and understand
about their transgender, gender non-conforming, and intersex patients; and
WHEREAS, this redefining would force genetic testing to resolve any dispute, denying transgender and
gender non-conforming individuals their autonomy and humanity; and
WHEREAS, children born with intersex traits are often subjected to harmful, non-consensual surgeries, in
Chicago and around the United States, in an attempt to, make their natural sex characteristics conform to
false binary notions of 'male' or 'female' bodies, which the Trump Administration's restrictive view of sex
and gender would purport to validate; and
WHEREAS, the Trump administration’s ban on military service by transgender and gender nonconforming individuals does not recognize the incredible sacrifice and service of as many as 15,000
transgender and gender non-conforming troops that are already serving and would be forced to either
conceal their gender identity or face discharge; and
WHEREAS, the Trump administration’s ban on military service by transgender and gender nonconforming individuals keeps talented and willing individuals out of the military based on a discriminatory
policy; and
WHEREAS, all action necessary should be taken to make school a place where all students are affirmed
and empowered and are provided with a safe environment to learn; and
52

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

February 21, 2019

WHEREAS, Cook County is affirming and welcoming of all individuals to self-identify; and
WHEREAS, Cook County stands with the transgender, gender non-conforming, and intersex community
and affirms that intersex, gender non-conforming, and transgender people #WontBeErased.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the Cook County Board President and Cook County
Board of Commissioners do hereby honor the identities of transgender, gender non-conforming and intersex
people, celebrate them, affirm their lives and call on President Trump and the Department of Health and
Human Services to stop any attempt to narrowly define gender as biological; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution are presented to President Donald
J. Trump, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M. Azar II, Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick
M. Shanahan, and Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.
Approved and adopted this 21st of February 2019.

THE HONORABLE TONI PRECKWINKLE,
PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
COOK COUNTY CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS PROGRAM
WHEREAS, since the mid 1960’s, it has been the policy of Cook County to establish and maintain an
internal working committee known as the “Charitable Contributions Committee,” which is intended to give
Cook County (“County”) employees the opportunity to contribute a portion of their employment
remuneration to various charitable organizations, including those associated with social, health, and welfare
services; and
WHEREAS, through Cook County Board Resolutions 73-R-238 and 13-R-348, the Board of
Commissioners (“Board”) continued the work of the Charitable Contributions Committee (“Committee”);
and
110

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

February 21, 2019

WHEREAS, the Committee has historically identified charities that operate in Cook County and reflect
the diverse interests and concerns of Employees, for participation in the Cook County Charitable Giving
Program, pursuant to a transparent and fair selection process; and
WHEREAS, in January of 2017, the Board authorized an agreement between United Way of Metropolitan
Chicago (UWMC) and Cook County as a third-party administrator to facilitate the provision of voluntary
charitable payroll deductions from employees to selected charities identified by Cook County and supported
by UWMC through voluntary payroll deductions from such individuals’ employee paychecks; and
WHEREAS, UWMC will continue as the County’s third-party administrator in accordance with the
January 2017 agreement or until otherwise amended or terminated in accordance with the terms of the
agreement; and

REQUESTING A HEARING OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION COMMITTEE TO
DISCUSS THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF VOLUNTARY REMOTE COURT
APPEARANCES
WHEREAS, audio and video appearances in courtrooms offer an enormous potential for savings, revenue
generation, environmental benefits, improved safety and remote access to justice which promotes the
administration of justice and equity in the courtroom; and
127

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

February 21, 2019

WHEREAS, remote court appearances allow attorneys and the public to appear in court for routine matters
involving Civil, Criminal, Family, Probate, Mental Health, Traffic, Juvenile, Bankruptcy and other
proceedings without leaving their homes or offices; and
WHEREAS, in 2016, In its Call to Action: Achieving Civil Justice for All, the Conference of Chief Justices’
Civil Justice Improvement Committee set forth a convincing series of findings and recommendations,
which among them was the promotion of remote audio and video services for court hearings and
management; and
WHEREAS, the Center for Legal and Court Technology, a non-profit research organization that improves
the administration of Justice through the use of technology, progressively encourages the utilization of
remote and video court appearances throughout the United States to enhance the efficiency of judicial
administration and court proceedings for both attorney’s and the public; and
WHEREAS, in 1992, the Supreme Court of Illinois adopted rule 185 to allow for telephonic appearances
in certain civil proceedings; and in 2017, the Supreme Court of Illinois amended its rules to also allow for
remote video conferences; and
WHEREAS, in Los Angeles Superior Court a system with approximately 494 judicial officers and
comparable to the Cook County Circuit Court, over 200 of those judicial officers allow for remote court
appearances with a volume of over 83,000 appearances in 2018; moreover, approximately $4.6 million in
revenue over a three-year period attributable to remote court appearances in Los Angeles was generated;
and
WHEREAS, in Illinois, approximately 20 counties spread over 12 Judicial Circuits utilize some form of
audio and video remote appearances with approximately 4,516 remote appearance being completed in 2018;
more particularly, the following “Collar” county courts use remote court appearance technology: the 16 th

WHEREAS, Cook County has been and continues to be a leader in technology through strategic
Countywide initiatives and collaboration with elected offices; thus, our existing applications and resources
will allow for a seamless integration of our existing technology platforms with audio and video remote
appearances; and
WHEREAS, the use of video and audio remote court appearances has the potential to offer key benefits to
the public, such as cost savings on attorney fees for lower-income citizens, increasing pro bono assistance,
availability of court interpreters, travel costs and work absences associated with attending a court hearing
can deter self-represented litigants from effectively pursuing or defending their legal rights, thereby further
promoting access to justice in courts.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby
request a hearing of the Technology and Innovation Committee be convened to review and discuss the
potential feasibility, application, and access to justice that remote court appearances may have in Cook
County courtrooms; and

MORRISON, Cook County Board of Commissioners
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
URGING THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO SUPPORT ASSESSMENT REFORM
WHEREAS, analyses revealed that Cook County's unique property tax system created an inaccurate
system that lacks transparency; and
WHEREAS, analyses have revealed that the hardest hit by said system were people of color and owners
of lower-priced properties such as those located in the South Suburbs; and
WHEREAS, property tax reform, including as it relates to accurate assessment of property is vital to
creating a fair and transparent system as well as fostering economic development throughout Cook County;
and
WHEREAS, using improved data will help eliminate uncertainty and hidden costs in the current system,
which deter institutional investment and hurt our economy; and
WHEREAS, utilizing transparent assessment methodology and better data will make it easier for
institutions to invest in less familiar asset classes and neighborhoods, giving a stimulus to places that need
it most; and
WHEREAS, international assessment standards recommend assessors employs the traditional three
approaches to value, which are cost, market/sales comparison and income, and while each approach has its
own unique characteristics, their goal is to utilize the most appropriate approach for the specific property
to arrive at its most accurate true cash value or usual selling price on an annual basis; and
WHEREAS, by collecting income and expense data up front on an anonymized and bulk basis the Cook
County Assessor’s modeling and valuations teams will be able to take current market rents, vacancy rates,
and trends into account, to deliver fair, accurate and transparent assessments; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois General Assembly is currently considering legislation (HB2217) sponsored by
Representative William Davis and (SB1379) sponsored by Senator Toi Hutchinson to enable Assessors
including the Cook County Assessor to collect relevant data to properly determine said values; and
129

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

February 21, 2019

WHEREAS, in Cook County, HB2217/SB1379 provides that taxpayers of income producing property shall
submit income and expense data related to the property annually to the chief county assessment officer,
further it provides that when determining the value of property for assessment purposes, the assessor may
consider all relevant information pertaining to the fair cash value of the property, including, but not limited
to, income and expense data, sales data, property characteristics data, construction cost data, appraisals, and
other valuation information; and
WHEREAS, it is imperative to have the proper tools in place to achieve assessment accuracy, fairness and
transparency; and
WHEREAS, the income and expense data contemplated in HB2217/SB1379 are consistent with
information the Cook County Board of Review requires via Rule 21, which is already in place; and
WHEREAS, it is in the best interest of this Honorable Body to support efforts to create a fair and
transparent property tax assessment system; and
WHEREAS, HB 2217/SB1379, is an important first step in the process of reforming our assessment
system, by requiring the submittal of income and expense data to enable the Assessor to more accurately
assess income producing properties and be in alignment with the standards of the International Association
of Assessing Officers; and
WHEREAS, this is a best practice, used in peer metro areas like New York, Boston, Washington D.C.
area, and Seattle, as well as in states like Florida and Virginia;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby
urge the Illinois General Assembly to pass HB 2217/SB1379, as amended by the Illinois General Assembly,
to give the Cook County Assessor the data needed to more accurately assess properties in Cook County

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to the Speaker of the
Illinois House of Representatives, the President of the Illinois Senate and the Governor of Illinois.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AN AMENDMENT TO CHAPTER 74, ARTICLE II, REAL PROPERTY TAXATION
WHEREAS, vacant properties can devastate a neighborhood and block, undermine neighbors’ quality of
life, and diminish the value of nearby properties; and
WHEREAS, they also cause severe fiscal damage to local governments, reducing local tax revenues while
costing cities millions for policing, cleaning vacant lots, and demolishing derelict buildings; and
WHEREAS, most vacant buildings and houses are well maintained, but many are not and thousands can
sit empty for years, abandoned by their owners, deteriorating to the point where they cannot be reused
without major rehabilitation with many ultimately demolished, leaving vacant lots in their place; and
WHEREAS, besides their impact on social and economic conditions, vacant, abandoned properties have a
devastating effect on the fiscal condition of their cities, towns, and counties; and
WHEREAS, not only do they pay little in property taxes and generate little revenue for the city or county
when sold at tax sales, but they further reduce property tax collections by millions of dollars by devaluing
neighboring properties; and
WHEREAS, among the County’s tools to assist in jumpstarting economic development and turning
communities around are tax incentives; however, owners of vacant property, who receive said incentives
should not be able to indefinitely benefit from them without developing and re-purposing such properties;
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter
74 - Taxation, Article II - Real Property Taxation, Division 2 - Classification System for Assessment,
Section 74-73, of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 74-73. - Revocation or cancellation of incentive classification.
(a) The following Incentive Classifications are subject to revocation herein: Class 6b (special
circumstances); Class 6b TEERM; Class 6b SER; Class 7a; Class 7b; Class 7c; Class 8; and Class 8
TEERM.
(b) The incentive may be revoked under the following circumstances:
(1) By rule, as provided by the Assessor; or
(2) By the County Board by Resolution or Ordinance, which is based on a report from the Bureau of
Economic Development that has been approved by the Economic Development Advisory
Committee of the County; or
(3) By the County Board by Resolution or Ordinance at the request of the Municipality by submission
of a Municipal Resolution or Ordinance; and or
143

Journal of Proceedings

February 21, 2019

(4) By request of the taxpayer to cancel; or
(5) Beginning in the 2019 assessment year and subsequent assessment years, absent an affidavit
documenting the stage of leasing, development or sale and by finding of the Bureau of Economic
Development or by the Assessor that Abandoned or Vacant property as defined in this code that
have received property tax incentives as classified in Sec. 74-73 (a) for two consecutive tax years
and title holder(s) have failed to lease, develop or sell said property in such time period or is found
to be in noncompliance with The Cook County Vacant Building Ordinance for more than sixty
calendar days, a one year suspension of the incentive will be incurred followed by full revocation
in the second year if not remedied.
(c) A basis for revocation pursuant to Section 74-73(b)(2) or (b)(3) above includes, but is not limited
to, the following:
(1) Failure to comply with the requirements of Section 74-71 or 74-72;
(2) Delinquency in the payment of any property taxes administered by Cook County or by a local
municipality; or
(3) Inaccuracies or omissions in documents submitted by the taxpayer, including, but not limited to,
the application and the Economic Disclosure Statement.
In case of revocation, or cancellation, or suspension the Incentive Classification shall be deemed null
and void for the tax year in which the incentive was revoked, or cancelled, or suspended as to the subject
property. In such an instance, the taxpayer shall be liable for and shall reimburse to the County Collector
an amount equal to the difference in the amount of taxes that would have been collected had the subject
property been assessed as a Class 5 property and the amount of taxes collected under the Incentive
Classification as determined by the Assessor.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

February 21, 2019

WHEREAS, the separation of children from their parents is a violation of the human rights; and
WHEREAS, the rights of children should be protected so that they stay with their families; this is a core
value of the democratic ideals of this country; and
WHEREAS, the current situation is forcing many U.S. citizen children to leave their communities and
struggle to begin anew in their parents’ countries of origin. Often, they are placed in situations in which
their rights as U.S. citizens are denied as well as their universal rights as children; and
WHEREAS, the five million U.S. citizen children and two million children brought to this nation as infants,
and raised here among U.S. citizens, should not be deprived of the sacred right to family and parental
guidance and support upon unnecessary separation; and
WHEREAS, President Obama issued executive orders which provided the deferral of deportation and the
provision of work authorization for undocumented individuals brought to this country as minors and further
established the practice of prosecutorial discretion to defer deportations until the Congress could arrive at
a permanent solution; and
WHEREAS, in spite of the continuing threat of injustice to children, the current administration has
cancelled those practices without Congress having established any alternative; and
WHEREAS, these provisions represented a just and much needed temporary relief and should be
maintained by act of Congress; and
WHEREAS, the children of those undocumented individuals are being forced every day to endure the
unimaginable pain and damage of family separation or deportation; and
WHEREAS, parents with U.S. citizen children who were given protected status through prosecutorial
discretion and who reported regularly to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as they were
required were among the first to be deported under this administration; and
WHEREAS, there has been a 250% increase over the last year in deportations of those with no criminal
records, most of which have families and children, with the likelihood that these numbers will continue to
increase; and
WHEREAS, at least 325,000 Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, Hondurans, and Haitians have lived in this
country for many years and have established families with 273,000 U.S. born citizen children, as well as
other children brought here at an early age who have known no other country, now face the cancellation of
TPS and are being deported; and
WHEREAS, the psychological, educational, health, and economic effects of separation from their parents
have long-term effects on a child’s quality-of-life.
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, the Cook County Board President and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners resolve this day that Congress should pass legislation that provides the right to visas for
the undocumented parents of U.S. citizen children or DACA eligible children, and of TPS-recipient parents
with U.S. citizen children or DACA-eligible children; and
