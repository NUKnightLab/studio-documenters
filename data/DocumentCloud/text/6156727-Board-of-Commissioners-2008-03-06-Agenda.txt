Transmitting a Communication, dated February 25, 2008 from
MIKE QUIGLEY, County Commissioner
this request formally invites the Assessor’s Office to give a presentation highlighting the newest website
features available on the Assessor’s website. We appreciate all of the efforts the Assessor’s office has
made to comply with the amended Cook County Ethics Ordinance. The amendments to the Ethics
Ordinance sought to bring a greater level of transparency to the property tax appeal process, and the
changes made to the Assessor’s website have facilitated this goal of increased transparency. The recent
advancements to the Assessor’s website, making all property tax appeals data available and easily
accessible to the public, demonstrate the office’s willingness to go above and beyond our expectations of
transparency and equality in the tax appeal process.
In an effort to share the Assessor’s latest achievement with all Cook County Board members, county
employees, the press, and anyone who might utilize this new feature, we hope they will be available to
present the new website features at a Cook County Board meeting.

Reason:

On November 6, 2007, the Bureau issued a Request for Proposal for Revenue Cycle Services

referred to as Revenue Cycle Services at the Bureau and provide a proposal to the Bureau to
assess and analyze the Bureau’s revenue cycle process’ as well as re-engineer and implement
new process’ for the Bureau’s revenue cycle operations.
Following extensive review by the Bureau’s Evaluation Committee, ACS HCS was selected
by the Bureau because of ACS HCS’ depth of experience in performing revenue cycle
services, Best Practice knowledge and their understanding of the Bureau operations. ACS
HCS would provide revenue cycle services to the Bureau which will include but not be
limited to an assessment and analysis of the Bureau’s revenue cycle process for inpatient and

recommendations to reengineer the process to maximize revenues; conduct training for
Bureau personnel; assist Bureau management in the implementation of the reengineered and
current revenue processes; identify changes to Bureau processes in order to increase

for the Bureau during the three-year term of the contract.
