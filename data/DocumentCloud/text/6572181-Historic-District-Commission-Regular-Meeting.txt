SCOPE: REPLACE PORCH AT REAR ELEVATION
EXISTING CONDITIONS
Erected ca. 1916, the property at 1155 Clark is a 2 ½-story apartment building. Exterior walls are brick
with stone detailing. An historic-age, one-story, central, gabled and hipped-roof porch is located at the
building’s primary elevation. The rear elevation features a full-width, flat-roof porch wood porch. A onestory, wood-frame enclosed stair is centrally-located within the rear porch. The stair enclosure is currently
clad with vinyl and metal siding. The rear porch, included the central stair enclosure, is in poor condition.
Windows are non-historic vinyl units.
1155 Clark, current conditions

 PROPOSAL
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to replace the existing rear
two-story porch and central stair enclosure with a new porch and stair enclosure. Specifically, the new
porch shall be erected according the following description:
•
•
•
•
•

The porch footprint will extend the length of the rear elevation and will rise two stories in height.
The deck’s footprint will measure 12’x48’-9 ½” (6’ deeper than the existing porch footprint)
The railing, decking, and columns will be wood (finish color not specified)
A new one-story, concrete-block, central stair enclosure will be erected. The exterior walls will be
clad with brick (sample not provided). Two new metal doors will be located at the enclosure’s rear
elevation (finish color not specified)
The roof will be flat/slightly sloping. Aluminum 4” gutters and downspouts (color not specified)
will be installed at the roof.

STAFF OBSERVATIONS AND RESEARCH
• The porch proposed for removal is historic age. However, it appears to be in poor conditions and
appears to have been significantly modified over time. It is staff’s opinion that the structure is not a
character defining feature of this historic house.
• The submitted drawings indicate that the small deck which leads to the elevated door at the
proposed new central stair enclosure does not have a railing. Building code will require that a
railing be installed at this location
• A review of the property file revealed that original windows were removed, opening were partially
infilled with plywood, and new vinyl windows were added without HDC approval and or permit in
2006. Please see the below scanned pictures of the 2006 violation:

It appears that the vinyl windows that were installed in 2006 were recently replaced with new vinyl
windows with grilles between the glass.
It is unclear if the current owner was responsible for either window replacement violation

ISSUES
None
RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the prposed new porch not destroy historic materials that characterize the property
and that the new work is compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the
historic integrity of the property and its environment. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission
issue a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) for the proposal because it meets the Secretary of the
Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, especially Standard #9) New additions, exterior alterations, or
related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work
shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural
features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. However, staff does
recommend that the Commission issue the COA with the following conditions:
•
•
•

The new steel doors, gutters and downspouts shall be finished a color which complements the color
of the home
Regarding the new stair enclosure cladding, the applicant shall furnish a brick sample to HDC staff
for review and approval. If staff determines that the cladding is appropriate to the building’s
historic character, the item will be forwarded to the commission for review at a future meeting
On or before December 11, 2020, all wood components/elements of the porch shall be stained or
painted a color which complements a color of the home.

masonry piers.

Description of Existing Condition

The existing deck spans the entire rear of the building (48.5’), is two stories and has a flat roof above, in the same roof plane
as the main building. There is a central stair column (12.5’ wide x 12’ feet off the rear wall), with a flight up to the second
story of the deck, and a separate flight to a basement access. The Central stair column is stick framed, uninsulated, and has
board and batten siding on the exterior, with some portions having been covered by vinyl siding at some point. The framing
is 2x8 running parallel to the rear wall of the building, with 4”x4” columns 9’ O.C. either side of the stair column. From each
column is a 2-ply 2x8 beam that runs perpendicular back to the rear wall, supporting the joists. The decking is 5/4 decking
boards running perpendicular to the main building, where it hasn't been covered by O.S.B. Columns are 4x4 coming off a ~3’
above grade brick pier (photo D10), with some 2 x blocking to hold everything together.
The design, in contrast to the front porch, appears to be a standard deck design, without ornamentation. The 5/4” Deck
Boards and T&G roof decking will be carried into the new design.
There is significant damage from a tree fall on the center stair column (the area is tarped at the moment, for a temporary
weather barrier) Photos D7, D8 and D9 show the afflicted areas. The framing has been affected, and the foundation wall is
delaminating as a result.
There is also significant water damage to the existing structure. Most of the upper deck boards have either rotted away, or
will be unstable soon, resulting in covering with O.S.B. (photos D1, D3, D6), and the column to joist connections have begun
to fail (Photo D6)
Based upon the damage to the existing structure, I am proposing the existing structure be removed and replaced with new
construction.

 1155 Clark Avenue, Detroit, MI 48209. Record #: BLD2019-04790
Description of Project
The Project as proposed will include there phases.
First Phase: Selective Removal
After approved permitting and occupant notices, sequential removal of existing deck structure, and separation and sealing of
the main buildings roof deck from the porch structures.
- Once braced, the roof structure will be cut and removed in pieces, while simultaneously installing a new rim joist and sealing
the Main Building’s roof.
- Once the roof has been removed, porch sections will be removed from the existing structure, while the existing doorways
have safety railings installed.
- Porch to be removed to foundation / Brick piers.
Second Phase: Foundation Work
- Existing foundation to be removed, and replaced. New column piers to be placed at new distance from building (12’ from
the original 6’)
Third Phase: Rebuild
- Build two new decks, with roof above, set below bottom lip of main roof dripline. New stair column to existing layout,
where code permits. Final grading and walkways.

New Build Vs. Repair:
The Structure of the porch has been compromised by both water, and a tree strike. The wood is rotten throughout much of
the deck, and does not appear to be in a condition where restoration would result in a safe end product. The foundation in
the stair column was damaged in the tree strike, and is also delaminating on the opposite side of the structure. The brick
piers supporting the columns are leaning at a significant angle, and the mortar has failed / bricks are missing in most. The
decking itself has also failed, with visible pieces missing, and is covered by O.S.B. in many parts. Lastly, the owner would like
to extend the extents of the porch, from 6’ to 12’, to provide the residents more outside space.

While there is significant detailing on the front face of the structure, and the front porch / basement entry, the sides of the
building, and the rear face where the porch in question is, are common brick, and compared to the front porch, it appears
that the rear porch was constructed with a utilitarian purpose in mind. As such, we propose to remove and rebuild the rear
porch, matching the existing design, to the larger depth requested by the owner.
