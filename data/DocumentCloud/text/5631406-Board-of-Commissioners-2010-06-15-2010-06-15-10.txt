EXPLANATION
On September 29, 2009, the CHA received official written notice that the City of Chicago was
awarded $27,648,800 in Energy Efficiency Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) funds from the
U.S. Department of Energy. These EECBG funds are provided through the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act (“ARRA”). At that time, the Chicago Housing Authority was notified that
it would receive $1,000,000 from the City’s EECBG funds through the Chicago Department of
Environment for residential energy audits and the installation of energy efficient equipment at
scattered sites properties. The project will comply with all of the ARRA requirements.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the Chicago Housing Authority to authorize
the Chief Executive Officer, or his designee, to accept a grant award and execute an intergovernmental agreement with the City of Chicago’s Department of Environment in the amount
of $1,000,000, and increase the FY 2010 comprehensive budget by $1,000,000.
