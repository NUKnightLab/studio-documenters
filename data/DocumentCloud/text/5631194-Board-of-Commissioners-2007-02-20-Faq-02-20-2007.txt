What type(s) of rent does the CHA offer to residents?
The CHA offers residents the choice between income-based rent and flat rent.
What is income-based rent?
Income-based rent is the greater of 30% of the family’s monthly adjusted income or ten
percent of the family’s gross income.
Income-based rent can never fall below the CHA’s minimum rent of $50 per month. In
accordance with HUD regulations, families facing extreme financial hardship may be
exempt from the minimum rent payment.
What is flat rent?
Flat rent was established as part of the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act
(QHWRA) of 1998. HUD requires that public housing authorities establish a flat rent that
is based on the market-rate rent for comparable units in the private market. There are
several factors that determine flat rent rates including:

Flat rent was established to encourage self-sufficiency and to avoid creating
disincentives for continued occupancy of families that are self-sufficient or becoming
self-sufficient. As these families experienced an increase in their incomes, their incomebased rents were exceeding the market-rate rents for their neighborhoods. Thus, flat
rent alleviated the rent burden for these self-sufficient families.
When do residents select their rental payment choice?
Residents may choose their rental payment at initial admission and each year during
recertification. At any time, a resident may choose to switch from flat rent to incomebased rent if their financial situation changes. Flat rent can be chosen only during
recertification, however.
What was ceiling rent?
Ceiling rent was the rent that the CHA previously offered that was last adjusted in 1998
and below the current area market rate prices. In October 2002, HUD mandated that all
ceiling rents be adjusted to the level of flat rents. Therefore, the CHA no longer offers
ceiling rents. The rent choices are income-based rent or flat rent.
Why were ceiling rents removed?
HUD previously approved the ceiling rents offered by the CHA based on the conditions
of much of the CHA’s housing stock. Through the implementation of the QHWRA,
federal regulations required the CHA and the other housing authorities across the nation
to bring ceiling rents to the level of market rent or Flat Rent.

Who is affected by the implementation of flat rent?

 The introduction of flat rents affects less than two percent of the CHA’s public housing
population (approximately 73 families). Of those, 38 selected the flat rent option, meaning
that their income was high enough to make the flat rent a better option than incomebased rent.
Of the CHA’s public housing residents, 89% pay income-based rent, ten percent pay the
minimum of $50 and just less than one percent pay flat rent. The majority of the CHA’s
public housing residents make less than $20,000 a year, making many of their rent
payments less than most ceiling rents.
Other information
In determining a resident’s rent payment (total tenant payment or TTP), there are certain
categories of income that are excluded from the calculation. In addition, there are a
number of deductions taken from the rent calculation, including utility allowances for
resident paid utilities.
For a full list of excluded income and deductions, see Section XI of the CHA’s FY2005
Admissions and Continued Occupancy Policy.
