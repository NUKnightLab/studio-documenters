Systems-wide
Financials, Observations, and Revenue Cycle Me

 

Observations on Financials
Revenues
§  Net Patient Service Revenues - $562M, 6% unfavorable to target due to increasing and unsustainable
growth in charity care, some lower clinical activity and lower revenue cycle activity
•  System-wide uninsured numbers
•  Captured by Visits, held at 45%
•  Captured by Charges, held at 40%
§  CountyCare Capitation Revenues - $1.4B, 5% unfavorable to target due to lower than budgeted
enrollment as a result of lower State/County MCO enrollment. There is a corresponding reduction in
expenses as a result.
§  Other Revenues - $13M , trending to exceed FY2019 target

Expenses
§  Cost of Pharma - $69M, unfavorable by 3% compared to budget and closely monitored/managed to get to
target
