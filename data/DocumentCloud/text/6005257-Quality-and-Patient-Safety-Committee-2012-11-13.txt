Updates
A. Joint Commission Survey (Attachment #1)
Dr. Krishna Das, System Interim Director of Quality and Patient Safety, provided an overview of the
information on the recent survey conducted by The Joint Commission at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook
County. Subjects covered in the report included the following: Survey Summary; Direct Impact Citations;
Indirect Impact; and Response Plan. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
The responses for the citations are due to The Joint Commission on December 17th; it is hoped that a
preliminary draft response can be received by the end of this week to see how the responses are going to be
framed out by those staff members involved. Some of the responses will require data collection, but as long as a
plan is set by next month, the System has four (4) months to collect data. Dr. Das noted that those citations
whose plans require additional staff are expected to be challenging to address.
Chairman Michael inquired further regarding the citation relating to nursing assessments/reassessments of
patients in a defined time frame. Dr. Das stated that currently, approximately 1-3% of patients wait more than
twenty-four (24) hours in the Emergency Room before they are assessed; this tends to happen when there are
particularly heavy admission caseloads, and amounts to roughly thirty (30) patients per month. Often, these
cases relate to special needs for rooms, like for those patients who require isolation beds. When that happens,

Updates
A. Joint Commission Survey (continued)
the Emergency Room (ER) personnel watch these patients very closely and assess the patients frequently; there
are nursing vital signs taken every hour or two, depending on the acuity of the patient. She added that the
inpatient teams go down and evaluate the patients, so the patient is still receiving care - in many ways, they are
receiving an inpatient level of care; however, both System policy and industry standards require that a full
nursing assessment be done within twenty-four (24) hours after admission.
Dr. Das provided further information on the tools used by staff to track those patients requiring a nursing
assessment. She stated that the ER uses FirstNet, which has a tracking board that lists all patients waiting for
admission and the length of time they have been waiting. There is also a bed control mechanism called
TeleTracking; this measures in real time and provides a report that tells staff how long the patient has been
waiting.
Chairman Michael inquired regarding the additional nursing personnel that may be needed to address this
citation. Tanda Russell, System Interim Chief Nursing Officer, responded that she has discussed the subject
with the Chief Nursing Officer of Stroger Hospital, and there are a couple of options that have been discussed.
She stated that, in the short term, there will be a need to bring approximately three (3) nursing staff on board for
this purpose, and to handle ongoing floor issues. In the longer term, if a dedicated admissions team is needed to
handle all nursing admissions in-house, this option will need to be further reviewed. Chairman Michael
inquired whether this is something that will be done for all patients within a certain timeframe. Ms. Russell
responded that this has been discussed, as well; she noted that there are currently 45-60 admissions per day that
come in through the ER or in-house.
Chairman Michael inquired further regarding the citation relating to auditing medical records. Dr. Das
responded that when a medical record is delinquent, it has surpassed its threshold of usually thirty (30) days
after discharge without a signature. Part of the reason for this is that the medical records staff has been limited
in their ability to send extremely delinquent records. Some of the delinquencies go back several years; it is a
combination of very old charts that will need to be manually abstracted and manually sent to the physicians for
signature - that number has built up over time. She added that there are not as many delinquencies with recent
charts, as there has been a focus on the need to sign charts and its necessity for billing purposes.
With regard to the citations whose plans contain training elements, Chairman Michael inquired whether there is
a training department or specific individual that will be responsible for this. Dr. Das responded that the System
does not have a robust training department. Within the Quality Department, there is one (1) person who has half
of his time dedicated to training; this person spends half of his time in the clinics training for the new processes,
and the other half of the time is spent in the training room located on the Stroger Hospital campus. Dr. Terry
Mason, System Chief Medical Officer, provided additional information on the subject. He stated that this is
also an authentication issue; they are signing and dating the records, and there needs to be a reminder that they
also need to put the time in. He noted that the electronic medical record provides a legible authenticated record
with the date and time stamp; the citation relates to those manual records for which the consent is manually
obtained.
Following the discussion, Chairman Michael requested that the Committee receive updates on the preparation
for the response to The Joint Commission1.

Updates (continued)
B. Nursing Dashboard
Ms. Russell indicated that the information regarding the nursing dashboard will be forwarded to the Committee
following the meeting2.

C. Update on Disclosure Policy
Mindy Malecki, System Director of Risk Management, provided an update regarding activities relating to the
drafting of the Disclosure Policy. The disclosure policy has been drafted, and consensus on the policy has been
received from several people, including Dr. Mason, Dr. Das and staff from the Risk Management Department.
Ms. Malecki plans to have staff from the Legal Department and Dr. Raju review the policy before it is
disseminated; once this has occurred, it is expected that the policy will be brought forward to the Committee,
possibly at the Committee Meeting in December.

D. Update on Stroger Hospital Medical Staff Bylaws
Dr. David Goldberg, President of the EMS of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, provided an update
on potential revisions to the Stroger Hospital Medical Staff Bylaws. It was noted that, although this matter was
not included in the information on the Joint Commission Survey, there were a couple of issues that arose. One
issue is related to how the bylaws are amended - it is recommended that a series of protections for the larger
organized voting members of the medical staff be included; this would allow for amendments to come to the
Board even if the EMS has voted against them. He noted that there are a couple of other proposed revisions that
are written within the elements of performance, in terms of removing members, for example.
Dr. Goldberg stated that a meeting of the EMS is scheduled for this evening; three (3) sets of changes will be
presented. One change is in terms of the whole amendment process; the second change relates to some specific
language around histories and physicals that has to be included in the Bylaws; and the third change relates to
other small changes that are in the same spirit. The Bylaws state that ten (10) days are needed before they can
be voted upon; it is hoped that they will be voted on in December, and presented to the Board at its December
meeting.

B. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees
i. Provident Hospital of Cook County
ii. John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
Dr. Pierre Wakim, President of the Executive Medical Staff (EMS) of Provident Hospital of Cook County,
provided a report on the following subjects that have been discussed at a recent EMS meeting: Gastro
Intestinal (GI) initiatives for Provident; and the Chest Clinic at Provident.
With regard to the GI initiatives, Dr. Wakim stated that the purpose is to decompress the outpatient GI
procedures at Provident; he noted that they are waiting for a fund to create a GI suite at Provident Hospital
in a section of the old intensive care unit. With regard to the Chest Clinic, he stated that this relates to an
arrangement made between the City of Chicago and Cook County to direct their tuberculosis patients to
Provident Hospital; he noted that staff is working with the administration at Stroger Hospital to provide
more staffing for this purpose.
Dr. Wakim added that some questions were discussed at the EMS meeting that he plans to further discuss
with Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive Officer these questions were regarding the status of the Strategic Plan
approved in 2010, as it relates to plans for Provident Hospital, and regarding the fate of Provident Hospital
as it relates to the implementation of the Section 1115 Waiver.
Dr. Goldberg indicated that his report was presented earlier in the meeting, during the update on the Stroger
Hospital Medical Staff Bylaws.

C. Updates on the following topics:
 Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
Follow up from October meeting – suggestions on what type of training resources and level of
appropriation increase may be needed to enhance or improve the EHR training
Dr. Bala Hota, System Interim Chief Information Officer, presented an update on EHRs and training
resources. He stated that the Cerner contract is coming up for renewal; staff is currently engaged in the
process of reviewing needs with Supply Chain - included in those needs are some hours for training
personnel. The idea is to create a framework under which there is ongoing training for users of the EHR.
One approach that has been suggested is to have a group that goes out to the clinics and demonstrates
functionality. Prior to looking further for internal resources that can be leveraged for this purpose, it is
recommended that the resources that can be obtained through the contract be first determined; this is
expected to be determined within the next couple of months.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
C. Updates on the following topics (continued):
 Developing a Quality Dashboard
Follow up from October meeting – recommendation for the plan to move forward, specifically regarding
the patient safety indicators that the Committee should review on a monthly basis
A short video was presented, that addressed the subject of quality dashboards; this video was received at
a recent National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems (NAPH) conference.
Following the video, the Committee discussed the subject further. It had been previously determined that
the Committee’s review and discussion of the strategic quality dashboard and revised overall Quality
Plan for 2013 would be postponed until the survey by The Joint Commission had been completed; as the
survey has now been completed, Chairman Michael indicated that the Committee should resume its
deliberations on the dashboard and plan.
Director Muñoz stated that he believes that the Committee and Board should revisit the subject of the
System’s mission in general, in order to review the following: what are the services that the System is
trying to deliver, and at what level? Director Velasquez stated that a couple of issues that should be
included in that discussion are those relating to quality and regarding who is delivering the services. She
noted that, at this meeting, the Committee received information that indicates that additional training
resources are needed. Chairman Michael stated that the Committee needs to prioritize what it wants to
focus on for 2013; he noted that this is an ongoing incremental process of improvement - every year, the
System will strive to tackle more and more problems and improve the quality of care that is provided to
the patients that are served. He asked the Committee to work towards selecting one or two items for the
coming year that are considered to be the most important matters upon which this organization should
focus. Dr. Mason stated that he will work with Dr. Das and Dr. Claudia Fegan, Chief Medical Officer
for the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, to provide suggestions; he noted that there are a
number of areas that are focused upon on from time to time, and perhaps a good way to start would be
with one of those focus areas. The subject of hospital-acquired conditions was also discussed.
Additional information on factors that impact that issue was provided; some of those factors include
those that occur outside of the System, once the patient is discharged.
Dr. Das suggested that patient satisfaction and readmission rates are a couple of good areas upon which
to focus. She stated that patient satisfaction is going to be one of the key factors in the System’s attempts
to enroll patients for the Medicaid Waiver, as well as being a factor going forward to keep patients in the
System. She noted that one of the pay-for-performance measures relates to readmission rates - in terms
of how much the System would lose financially, it would not be that large; however, she believes that it
is a good marker for System performance. It not only tests the System’s discharge process, by looking at
areas such as medication reconciliation and patient safety items, as well as communication items, such as
patient education, but it also looks at access to care in terms of obtaining primary care appointments and
availability of primary care appointments, as well as the System’s ability to manage care.
Chairman Michael stated that there have been three subjects suggested for further conversation: hospitalacquired conditions, readmission rates, and patient satisfaction. At the December Committee Meeting,
he requested that information be provided so that the Committee can review the System’s measurement
on those subjects against other health care providers/institutions in Cook County; he stated that the
Committee should see how the System is performing in those areas, and take that information into
account in terms of coming up with what the goal for improvement should be in each of those areas3.
