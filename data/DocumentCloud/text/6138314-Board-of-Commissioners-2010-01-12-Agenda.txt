WHEREAS, it is estimated that more than $2 billion is spent on the treatment of cervical cancer each

92%; the overall (all stages combined) five-year survival rate for cervical cancer is approximately 71%;
and
WHEREAS, in the past 40 years, the number of cases of cervical cancer and the number of deaths from
cervical cancer have decreased significantly; this decline is the result of many women getting regular Pap

annual Pap test cannot be stressed enough in the prevention of cervical cancer; and
WHEREAS, cervical cancer tends to occur in midlife; most cases are found in women younger than age

cervical cancer are diagnosed when they are over age 65; and

contraction of these viruses is the cause of almost all cervical cancers; there now exists a vaccine that can
immunize young women from the two cervical cancer causing strains of HPV; and

there is still much progress to be made; to honor Cervical Cancer Awareness Month support those
