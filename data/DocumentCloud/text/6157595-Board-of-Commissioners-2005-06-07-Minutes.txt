 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 7, 2005

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

RESOLUTION AFFIRMING NATIONAL POLICY AGAINST TORTURE
WHEREAS, as elected officials of Cook County, Illinois, we have an obligation to uphold the laws that
govern Cook County, the State of Illinois, the Constitution of the United States of America and all
international treaties to which the United States is party, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention Against Torture and other Cruel,
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and related standards of international human rights; and
WHEREAS, the use of torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment upon any person under
the physical control of and inflicted by any federal authority, including civilian contractors, constitutes a
violation of the law of nations in that customary international law prohibits torture as reflected, expressed,
and defined in multilateral treaties and other international instruments, international and domestic judicial
decisions, and other authorities; and
WHEREAS, the use of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment upon any person under
the physical control of and inflicted by any federal authority, including civilian contractors, constitutes a
violation of the United States Constitution. The acts of mistreatment aforementioned constitute a
violation of the Fifth Amendment and of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual
punishment; and
WHEREAS, the use of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment upon any person under
the physical control of and inflicted by any federal authority, including civilian contractors, constitutes a
violation of specific protections afforded by the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions, including but not
limited to, Article 3 common to all four Geneva Conventions. Violations of Common Article 3 of the
Geneva Conventions are treaty violations as well as violations of customary international law; and
WHEREAS, the use of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment upon any person under
the physical control of and inflicted by any federal authority, including civilian contractors, constitutes a
violation of Articles 7 and 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (lCCPR).
Violations of these provisions are treaty violations as well as violations of customary international law;
and
WHEREAS, the use of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment upon any person under
the physical control of and inflicted by any federal authority, including civilian contractors, constitutes a
violation of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment (CAT), and where applicable also of the federal anti-torture statute, 18 U .S .C. Section 23402340A, which Congress enacted to fulfill U.S. obligations under CAT. Violations of CAT are treaty
violations as well as violations of customary international law; and
WHEREAS, the use of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment as a method of extracting
intelligence infonnation may lead to inaccurate and misleading infonnation. The Army Field Manual on
Intelligence Interrogation states: "the use of torture and other illegal methods is a poor technique that
yields unreliable results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can induce the source to say what
he thinks the interrogator wants to hear"; and
\VHEREAS, the use of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment upon a foreign national
in U.S. custody may have the effect of radicalizing the victim's own moderate political, social or religious
ideologies. The aforementioned acts of mistreatment may also have the effect of radicalizing the
ideologies of the society from where the victim originates. Radicalized ideologies may increase the threat
of terrorism against Americans; and

1719

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 7, 2005

WHEREAS, the use of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment upon a foreign national
in U.S. custody may increase the likelihood that kidnapped or captured American citizens and military
personnel will be subjected to similar acts of mistreatment. The U.S. Anny Field Manual on Intelligence
and Interrogation states: "the use of torture and other illegal methods] may also place U.S. and allied
personnel in enemy hands at great risk of abuse by their captors"; and
WHEREAS, the use of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment undennines the rule of
law and delegitimizes the United States government as an advocate for democracy. The U.S. Anny Field
Manual on Intelligence Interrogation states: " Revelation of use of torture by U.S. personnel will bring
discredit upon the U.S. and its anned forces while undermining domestic and international support for the
war effort"; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Anny Field Manual on Intelligence and Interrogation states that binding
international treaties and U.S. policy "expressly prohibit acts of violence or intimidation, including
physical or mental torture, threats, insults, or exposure to inhuman treatment as a means of or aid to
interrogation. Such illegal acts are not authorized and will not be condoned by the U.S. Army." The
Manual specifically defines "physical torture" to include " infliction of pain through chem icals or
bondage", " forcing an individual to stand, sit or kneel in abnormal positions for prolong periods of time",
"food deprivation" and "any form of beating".
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that We, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County,
condemn the use of torture and all cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment upon any person under the
physical control of any federal authority, including civilian contractors; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that We, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, call on the
President and Congress to affirm the domestic and international obligations of the United States of
America to the rule of law and end the use of torture and all other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
as a matter of policy and to condemn the aforementioned acts of mistreatment; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be sent to President George W.
Bush and the Members of the Illinois Congressional delegation representing Cook County and let it also
be spread upon the official proceedings of this Honorable Body.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, moved that the Resolution be approved
and adopted.
Commissioner Silvestri asked leave to add the full name of the President to the final resolved clause.
Leave was granted.
Commissioner Peraica, second by Commissioner Hansen, moved to delete "and end the use of to11ure and
all other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment as a matter of policy" from the resolved clause. The
motion was withdrawn.
Following discussion, Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the
Proposed Resolution, as amended be referred to the Committee on Human Relations. The motion was
withdrawn.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the Proposed Resolution, as
amended be referred to the Committee on Finance. (Comm. No. 27 1498). The motion carried

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

COOK COUNTY EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY PLAN
WHEREAS, the President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners has instituted the "Cook County
Equal Employment Opportun ity Plan" for offices under the President, and has appointed an Equal
Employment Opportunity Officer (EEOP officer) to promote equal employment opportunity principles
throughout the Cook County workforce; and
WHEREAS, in order to give such policy and procedure the full force of the County's lawmaking powers
and to ensure equal employment opportunities for persons from all segments of the County community
without regard to race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or any other protected category established by
law, statute or ordinance, it is essential to codify the affirmative action policy and procedure of the
County; and
WHEREAS, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Coord inating Council 's Policy Statement
on Affinnative Action, 41 C.F.R. § 60-3. 17, the first step in the establishment of an affirmative action
plan is an analysis of the employer's work force to detennine whether the percentages of persons within
race, ethnic, gender, or sexual orientation groups in individual job c lassifications are substantially similar
to the percentages of persons within those groups who are available in the relevant job market and who
possess the basic job-related qualifications; and
WHEREAS, if substantial disparities are found, the next step in the establishment of an affirmative
action program is to examine each element of the overall selection process to determine which elements
operate to exclude persons on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation, and also to
detennine the validity of the element in predicting job perfonnance; and
WHEREAS, a prel iminary statistical analysis known as the "Cook County Employee Diversity

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 7, 2005

Chainnan Steele delivered the following statement: There has been a new development in the Emmett
Till case and action has already been taken. However, the Board will appreciate any updated infonnation
that can be provided. The United States Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
and the State of Mississippi are involved in the investigation of this case. Emmett Till 's mother labored
and protested over forty years to get this case re-opened. Recently, Congressman Bobby Rush intervened
and requested that the United States Department of Justice pursue this investigation. Congressman Rush
was unable to be here today, but he wanted the Board to move forward to inform the public of the
ongoing investigation. The intent of this hearing is to respond to some of the questions that have been
brought to Chairman Steele's attention regarding both the exhumation process which commenced today,
and the other procedures which will take place subsequently.
Vice Chairman Hansen inquired whether the Board has any jurisdiction to direct the courts or to review
requests from the United States Department of Justice. He further stated that it was his understanding that
the Board has no jurisdiction over any court order.
Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State's Attorney, Chief of the Civil Actions Bureau of the State's
Attorney's Office, responded that the County of the crime's occurrence has jurisdiction over this case.
Mr. Driscoll further stated the following: The FBI is involved in this case. Exhumation was perfonned
pursuant to court order. As a legislative body, the Committee may request infonnation from any source,
however, it is questionable whether the recipient of that request is required to answer. The FBI is paying
the cost of exhumation; the cost of both interment and delivery of the body is being paid by the Federal
Government.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Stroger and Cermak Hospitals Subcommittee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met
pursuant to notice on Thursday, May 26, 2005 at the hour of I :30 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569,
County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Subcommittee has considered the following item:
1.

To hear a presentation by the Bureau of Health Services on the severely long waiting time many
patients of the community health care clinics experience to receive their prescription medications.

Chainnan Maldonado stated that the purpose of this meeting is to hear a presentation by the Bureau of
Health Services on the severely long waiting periods that many patients experience to receive their
prescription medications. Chairman Maldonado further stated this meeting is for informational purposes
only.
Commissioner Murphy noted that Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County is doing a remarkable job filling
prescriptions. She asked whether it would be possible to fax prescriptions from Stroger Hospital of Cook
County to be filled at Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County.
Chairman Maldonado replied that the mail order prescription drugs program was reinstated in March and
the Bureau of Health Services is filling fifteen thousand prescriptions each day.
Daniel H. Winship, M.D., Chief of the Bureau of Health Services, commented that during 2004 the
Bureau of Health Services filled 2.9 million prescriptions and at its current pace will fill over 3.8 million
prescriptions in 2005. The prescriptions could be filled in a more timely manner if ample space and
personnel were available. The Bureau of Health Services fills ten thousand prescriptions per day and the
largest request come from Stroger Hospital of Cook County and the Fantus Clinic. The national bench
mark for productivity in filling prescriptions is about 250 per eight hour shift with a phannacist and two
phannacist technicians. The Bureau of Health Services averages about 400 per eight hour shift per
pharmacist and two pharmacist technicians.

1860

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 7, 2005

Dr. Winship noted that the Bureau of Health Services has included twelve new positions in the 2005
budget and there are vacancies throughout the phannacy department. The Bureau of Health Services is in
the process of recruiting pharmacists and phannacist technicians. The Bureau of Health Services,
Department of Personnel has taken several steps to improve the financial support of the phannacy
department, the wages for phannacists and pharmacist technicians have again fallen behind at the Bureau
of Health Services. The Bureau of Health Services has advertised for pharmacists, however, the starting
salary for graduating phannacists who apply at Walgreen's, CVS or other hospitals salaries would be
higher than the Bureau of Health Services would pay. The Bureau of Health Service' s starting salary is
not competitive for recruiting ofphannacists or phannacist technicians.
Vice Chairman Silvestri asked how many such vacancies are in the Bureau of Health Services.
Dr. Winship replied there are twenty-four vacant pharmacist positions. There are sixteen staff pharmacists
and eight supervisor management positions for a total of twenty-four positions.
Johnny Brown, Chief Operating Officer, Stroger Hospital of Cook County, stated that the patients have an
option to fill their prescription at either any local drug store or at the Bureau of Health Services facilities.
The Medicaid patients will pay out of pocket expense for prescriptions filled off-site.
Dan Martin, Deputy Chief, Bureau of Health Services, stated that the Bureau of Health Services
purchases drugs for the outpatients from the 340B program. There are strict regulations regarding the
purchase of drugs. The restrictions are that drugs can only be purchased and used at the sites that are
designated as disproportionately shared hospitals and federally qualified health care clinics such as: Ryan
White Grantees, Federal Health Care Centers, and look-a-like facilities that are pre-approved by the
Federal Government. The regulations that currently exist are governed by the National Association of
Public Hospitals and Pharmacies Coalition.
Mr. Martin continued to reiterate that all out-patient phannacy purchases are purchased through the 340B
program. However, Medicaid patients can purchase phannaceuticals at any pharmacy that accepts
Medicaid. The Bureau of Health Services was able to negotiate with the State of Illinois to receive
enhanced reimbursement under the Intergovernmental Transfer Agreement for phannacy services and has
started billing for phannacy services. The Bureau of Health Services would like to keep the Public Aid
and Medicaid/Medicare patients in the system to assist with offsetting the cost.
Chainnan Maldonado asked about the amount of overtime for the phannacy department last year.
Mr. Brown stated about ten million dollars ($10,000,000) was spent for overtime last year.
Chainnan Maldonado asked how the Bureau of Health Services solicits the patients to use the mail order
prescription fonns.
Mr. Martin stated that the patients fill their prescriptions at the Bureau of Health Services and mail order
prescription pamphlets are inserted in their bags. The Bureau of Health Services has sixteen employees
traveling throughout the County's thirty-one clinics. The representatives meet with the administration to
coordinate a convenient time frame in which to infonn patients about the mail order prescription program.
Commissioner Murphy inquired about the number of employees at the phamrncies.
Bernard Scavella, Deputy Director of Support Services, replied that the Bureau of Health Services
employs four out-patient phannacists, and is staffed by two pharmacy managers and one supervisor.

186 1

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 7, 2005

Commissioner Daley asked the Bureau of Health Services how many pharmacists are needed to solve the
problem of the long wait for prescription drugs.
Mr. Scavella stated that if the Bureau of Health Services were to hire more pharmacists, there would not
be adequate space to accommodate the additional staff.
Commissioner Daley asked the Bureau of Health Services whether there is a tracking system in place to
log the waiting period to fill patient's prescriptions.
Mr. Scavella stated that the Bureau of Health Services has a tracking system at Stroger Hospital of Cook
County and the Fantus Clinic. The system has various categories of prescriptions that are filled.
Approximately sixty-eight percent (68%) of the prescriptions are new, twenty-six percent (26%) of the
prescriptions are refills and four and one half percent (4.5%) of the prescriptions are from discharged
patients. The Bureau of Health Services prioritizes the emergency room prescriptions and guarantees an
eight hour turn around time. Discharged patient's prescriptions are guaranteed a two to three hour turn
around time. The emergency prescriptions from the other Bureau of Health Services clinics have a turn
around time of eight hours.
Commissioner Steele asked whether in the hiring of pharmacy personnel, they could begin at a higher
level rate of pay, as was done at the Veterans Administration.
·
Mr. Martin stated that the current salary structure only allows the Bureau of Health Services to go up to
Step 5 positions within the phannacy category and does not allow the Bureau of Health Services to go
beyond that step.
Mark Kilgallon, Director, Bureau of Human Resources stated that an increase of ten million dollars
($10,000,000) was given to the pharmacy staff to bring the Bureau of Health Service' s salaries in line
with other institutions. The County is not competitive with the current market; however, the Bureau of
Health Services is presently negotiating with the phannacy unions. In regards to hiring staff at the
advance step levels, the increase in salary has to be included in the budget and all open salaries are
budgeted at the Step 1 level.
Commissioner Peraica asked what could be done to reduce patients ' waiting periods for prescription
drugs.
Dr. Winship noted that the Bureau of Health Services is implementing a provider order entry program in
the Cemer System. This program will have speed, safety and correctness in the interpretation of the
written prescriptions from the staff and the speed to get it to the phannacy department.
Chainnan Maldonado reiterated the question of whether the waiting periods for prescription drugs would
decrease due to the installing of the Cerner System.
Mr. Martin noted that the patient would have the option of traveling to any pharmacy at the Bureau of
Health Services and the patient would get an electronic print-out of his or her prescription. The
pharmacist and phannacist technician will be able to understand the electronic print-out prescription
forms from the physicians.
Dr. Winship stated that the program has been installed at Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County and is
perfonning beautifully. The program will arrive at Stroger Hospital of Cook County in the summer and
will be installed throughout the Bureau.

1862

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 7, 2005

Chairman Maldonado asked about the recruiting of Latino phannacists and pharmacist technicians.
Dr. Winship replied that there are Latino pharmacists at the Bureau of Health Services. We will be
delighted to recruit bi-lingual phannacists and pharmacist technicians.
Chainnan Maldonado stated that he has never seen advertisement for bi-lingual and Latino pharmacists or
pharmacist technicians.
Dr. Winship stated that the Bureau of Health Services advertises in the newspapers.
