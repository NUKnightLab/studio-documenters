PROJECTS
640 Temple Brownfield Redevelopment Plan
Mr. Vosburg presented the 640 Temple Brownfield Plan. PowerPoint slides provided maps and
renderings of the project. The development team provided additional information regarding the
project’s intended use and the history of the project site.
Ms. Lee asked in relation to the project how close in proximity is it to the local schools? Mr.
McCallion responded and advised that there should be no concerns for environmental because
the site is not heavily contaminated and most of the environmental are dealing with fill.
Dr. Regina Randall asked the developer to reiterate the total percentage as it relates to complying
with the City of Detroit Executive Orders. Mr. McCallion advised that they would be complying
with the 51% utilization of Detroit residents on publicly funded construction projects and will also
be complying with the 31% utilization of Detroit headquarter businesses and Detroit based
businesses.
Mr. Cheeks asked about the amenities including the proposed night club. Mr. Moisides advised
that the entertainment space would be located off the alley way. Mr. Moisides advised that he was
interested in bringing back venues that have life music and because the entertainment space is
located in the sub-basement there will be no noise disturbance to the surrounding area.
Ms. Stahl asked about the OPRA and the interest and wanted to know which tax did the OPRA
abate. Ms. Kanalos advised that it’s our policy not to let interest accrue until after the expiration
of the abatement. Ms. Kanalos advised that it’s not typical to request interest on the unreimbursed
unless its needed to make the project financing viable. Mr. Vosburg explained that the taxes that
receive abatement are the school taxes, local taxes are frozen at 50% for 12 years. Mr. Vosburg
advised that if the project was not in the DDA zone than there would be more mileages to capture.
Mr. Cheeks asked if the residential units would be market rate. Mr. Moisides advised that there
will be the required 20% affordable AMI.

 Ms. Lee asked if this development would put more pressure on the traffic flow, Mr. Moisides
advised that he doesn’t see any additional traffic congestion being created.
Project Introduction
Temple Group Holdings, LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the Plan which entails
the redevelopment of the current 169,337-square foot commercial building located at 640 Temple
Street and the adjacent vacant lot. The redevelopment encompasses several components
including 100-room key boutique hotel and hotel auxiliary facilities, a restaurant and banquet
facility, 70 residential apartments and a lounge/night club.
The Property is located in Detroit’s Cass Park Historic District, on the west side of Detroit, on the
block bounded by Charlotte Street to the north, Second Avenue to the east, Temple Street to the
south and Third Avenue to the west.
The total investment is estimated to be $65 million. The Developer is requesting $6,455,496.00
in TIF reimbursement, however only $5,100,380 in TIF Reimbursement is projected to be
captured for the life of the Plan.
There will be 158 Temporary construction jobs and 80 FTE jobs. The 80 FTE are expected to be
created over a 3 year period, once construction begins. The FTE jobs will include managerial
positions, housekeeping and janitorial staff, wait staff and desk attendants.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of four (4) parcels located at 640,650,660 and 674
Temple Street bounded by Charlotte Street to the north, Second Avenue to the east, Temple
Street to the south and Third Avenue to the west in Detroit’s Cass Park Historic District.
Basis of Eligibility

property was previously utilized for a commercial purpose; (b) it is located within the City of Detroit,
a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and (c) the Property is determined to be a
facility as defined by Act 381.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered “eligible
activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include department specific activities, site
preparation, infrastructure improvements, demolition, lead and asbestos abatement and
development of a brownfield plan and work plan. The eligible activities and budgeted costs are
intended as part of the development of the Property and will be financed solely by the Developer.
The Authority is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and will incur no debt. The
eligible activities are estimated to begin in the spring/summer of 2018 and be completed within
eighteen (18) months.

The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment revenue
generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse the cost of the
