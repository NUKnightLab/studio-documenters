GENERAL BACKGROUND

As the only agency funded by the State of Illinois to administer the Child Care Assistance
Program for Cook County, IAFC manages and maintains an extensive database of childcare and
early education programs. Therefore, CHA has contracted with IAFC since 2007 to provide a
childcare referral program speci?cally for CHA residents with the primary focus to establish a
program to provide enhanced childcare resources and referral services for CHA families. As the
Admissions and Continued Occupancy Policy?s work-requirement increased to 20
hours per week in FY2010, accessibility to childcare became an increased need for these
families. In December 2010, the Board authorized CHA to enter into a one-year year contract,
with two one-year options, for the continuation of the enhanced referral program to assist CHA
families in accessing the most effective childcare resource. The base term Contract No. 1100
was ?om January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. In December 2011, Resident Services
extended the Contract, without additional cost, from January 1, 2012 through February 29, 2011.
Resident Services is requesting the Board?s authorization to exercise the ?rst one-year option of
the contract.

In 2007, IAFC initiated a support program for CHA residents with young children. The program
includes making enhanced referrals for CHA families to childcare and/or early childhood
education programs based on their speci?c needs and eligibility for various programs. Enhanced
referrals include an initial consultation to identify key indicators and needs. Families are then
contacted within two (2) days and receive substantial information on available resources.
Additional follow-up by IAFC staff is made within a week to track child placement and
determine if additional follow-up is needed. IAFC has a designated phone line exclusively for
CHA residents to expedite requests. In 2011 IAFC completed 412 enhanced referrals and over
2,030 families have been provided information on available services. In addition to continuing
the enhanced resource and referral program, in 2011 IAFC initiated a parent development
program for CHA residents. Participating parents engaged in a series of ten (10) sessions
focused on topics including, but not limited to, child development, parent-child relationship
building, effective communication with children, and cultural learning opportunities for children.
As of December 2011, 15 cohorts had been established with 232 parents completing training.

In 2012, IAFC will continue to provide enhanced child care referral services and parent
development programs. Resident Services will likely modify this agreement in the future as
CHA continues to rede?ne future plans.

Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Of?cer, or his designee, to exercise the ?rst one-year option of Contract No. 1100 with Illinois
Action for Children for the period of March 1, 2012 through February 28, 2013 in an amount
not-to-exceed $330,000 to provide enhanced children resources and referral services for CHA
families.
