Page 36 of 41

 (1) Take-home assignment. A County vehicle other than a passenger vehicle may be assigned to
employees in a service, management or supervisory position on call 24 hours a day, responsible for
providing or supporting emergency services. A county passenger vehicle may be assigned to an
employee as a take-home vehicle only where the employee travels frequently after-hours on behalf of
the County, and it is less expensive to assign a take-home vehicle rather than reimburse the employee
for use of a personal vehicle. There is a strong presumption against any take-home passenger vehicle
assignments. A vehicle disclosure form shall be used and remain on file in the Department for all
"take-home" vehicles.
(2) Approval of take-home passenger vehicle assignments. All current passenger vehicle assignments are
subject to the review and approval of the Vehicle Steering Committee. All future take home vehicle
assignments require the prior approval of the Vehicle Steering Committee.

work assignment requires a vehicle in order to properly conduct County business. A vehicle
disclosure form and daily log shall be used and remain on file in the Department for all pool vehicles
which are taken home overnight. Those employees authorized for overnight use of County vehicles
shall, when away from work for an extended period of time, for vacation, sick leave, compensatory
time off, travel, etc., return the assigned County vehicle to the custody of his/her department head
during the period of absence.
a. No person shall be authorized to drive a County vehicle unless he/she:
1. Possesses a current, valid driver's license with the correct class for the vehicle driven.
2. Is the age of 18 or older.
3. Meets rental requirements as specified by rental/leasing agencies.
4. Is free of any prior convictions for driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or
of reckless driving within the previous year. Employees operating a commercial vehicle must
comply with all of the requirements of the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986.
5. Any employee performing work which requires the operation of a County-owned vehicle or
a private vehicle at County expense shall notify his/her immediate supervisor immediately
of any current restrictions or changes in driving privileges, including, but not limited to,
revocation, suspension, cancellation, denial, Restricted Driving Permit, Judicial Driving
Permit, Probationary License, Family Financial Responsibility Driving Permit, leaving the
scene of an accident, refusal or neglect to report a traffic accident, traffic violations, unpaid
traffic citations, failure of vehicle titled in the employee's name to pass the vehicle emissions
testing, or unpaid parking citations for a vehicle titled in the employee's name. Any
restrictions or changes to driving privileges shall be reported by the employee to the
employee's Bureau Chief or Elected Official immediately and a record maintained in the
department. Any employee who fails to report, and/or continues to operate a vehicle in the
performance of County duties, is subject to disciplinary action up to and including
termination from County employment.

Page 37 of 41

 b. Use of private vehicles for County business:
1. County employees, with the prior permission of their Department Head, may use their private
vehicle to conduct official County business. Department Heads shall only approve the use of
private vehicles for County business when it is in the best interest of the County to do so.
2. A valid proof of insurance is required to operate a private vehicle, which includes coverage
of passengers and a copy must be kept in the vehicle and must be filed with the Department's
Vehicle Coordinator.
3. Employees authorized to use their personal vehicles for County business shall comply with
the following insurance requirements:
(i) County employees who drive a private vehicle for official County business shall have at
least the minimum auto insurance for private vehicles as required by the State of Illinois.
(ii) The employee's vehicle insurance policy must be issued by a company that is licensed
by the department of insurance for the issuing state.
(iii) In the event a County employee is involved in an accident while driving his/her own
vehicle, the employee's personal insurance provides the primary coverage.
(iv) Mileage reimbursement rates will be based on the Cook County Travel and Expense
Reimbursement Policy.
Sec. 2-674. - Miscellaneous rules.
(a) Traffic laws and regulations. Drivers of County vehicles shall observe all traffic laws and regulations.
Drivers and passengers in County vehicles shall wear seat belts at all times and shall observe safe driving
practices. All drivers of a County vehicle involved in accidents and those who have been fined for or charged
with a traffic violation may be required to attend a driving safety training class.
(b) Use of tobacco products. Use of tobacco products and electronic vapor cigarettes is prohibited in
County vehicles.
(c) Engine idling. Except for purposes of law enforcement including, but not limited to, surveillance and
radar gun use activities, the driver of a County vehicle must turn off the engine upon stopping at a destination
and must not cause or allow an engine to idle at any location for more than five consecutive minutes or a period
or periods aggregating more than five minutes in any one-hour period, except when idling is absolutely
necessary for the conduct of County business, for personal safety, or to comply with traffic laws and law
enforcement personnel.
(d) Liability for damages. The County shall not be liable for injuries or damages arising from activities
outside the scope of employment including, but not limited to, personal use of rented vehicles by employees
during a County-authorized business trip. Any damages arising from these circumstances are the responsibility
of the employee. To the extent that the County incurs financial liability for the acts of employees which occur
outside the scope of employment, Cook County reserves the right to seek reimbursement from the responsible
person.
Page 38 of 41

 (e) Insurance. The State of Illinois requires that all vehicles have an Illinois Insurance Card at all times.
The County Self-Insurance Program is administered by the Department of Risk Management General Liability
Division, which will issue a proof of insurance card for each County-owned vehicle. Only vehicles which are
included in the County (owned) vehicle inventory shall be registered with the Department of Risk Management
for insurance purposes.
(f) Traffic violations. Employees shall be held personally responsible for all parking and/or traffic
violations incurred while operating a county owned or leased vehicle. The applicable employing Department
shall seek reimbursement on behalf of Cook County for County paid parking or traffic violations from the
employee responsible for the County paid parking or traffic violation. Failure of an employee to reimburse the
County for such offense shall be deemed a major cause infraction and result in discipline up to and including
termination. At no time will County funds be used directly or indirectly to pay or reimburse an employee for
parking or traffic violations.
(g) Article not intended to enlarge current County liability, etc., to employees. Nothing in this article is
intended or shall be construed to extend or enlarge the obligations, liability, or responsibilities that the County
currently has to employees, or third parties, by law or contract, if any, in regard to the operation of motor
vehicles.

WHEREAS, Cook County and its taxpayers have benefited from Tax Increment Financing Districts (TIFs) by
having the increment generated during the life of the TIFs invest in the specific area generating the increment;

Page 39 of 41

 WHEREAS, within the County of Cook, certain real-estate parcels, or a portion of the assessed valuation of
certain real-estate parcels, are from time to time identified on the County real-estate tax rolls as deriving from
new property, insofar as they were developed or substantially improved or are the subject of tax incentives that
expired since the most recent assessment of real-estate taxes, the value of which has not heretofore been
recaptured; and
WHEREAS, the interests of County taxpayers and the County itself are better served if the taxes on the
additional value of said new property is captured.
THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED AND ORDERED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF
COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS, that pursuant to its home rule powers, $720,483,542.00 as a base levy amount,
plus a TIF value recapture sum of $17,022,794, an expiring incentives sum of $982,238, and a new-property
value capture sum of $18,808,848, which aggregate amount of these sums is to be collected from the Annual
Tax Levy for the Fiscal Year A.D. 2017 of the County of Cook for the Corporate Fund purposes of said County,
and for the Public Safety Fund purposes of said County, and for the Health Enterprise Fund purposes of said
County, and for the payment of principal and interest on general obligation bonds of said County as represented

revenues separately allocated to the Public Safety Fund, Corporate Fund, Health Fund, and Election Fund are
to be made available to each Fund for purposes of covering the loss and cost of collecting taxes levied for said
Funds, for the amounts of taxes for which the nonpayment will result in forfeiture of real estate, and for
abatements in the amounts of such taxes as extended upon the collectors’ books. To ensure the County meets
its obligations for indebtedness as represented by the Bond and Interest Fund, and that the actual collections of
property taxes received by the Annuity and Benefit Fund are commensurate with the amounts so levied, the
County Clerk is authorized, in consultation with the County’s Chief Financial Officer, to extend loss and
collections for these funds in a manner that is sufficient for these purposes.
The specific amounts herein levied for the various purposes heretofore named are stated in this Ordinance and
Tax Levy, by being listed and itemized by Fund in the Revenue Estimate of the Annual Appropriation Bill,
including a column captioned: “ANNUAL TAX LEVY”. The tax hereby levied for said Fiscal Year 2017 for
