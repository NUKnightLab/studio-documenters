Preliminarily find that the subject building, a 2-story frame house constructed in 1907
contributes to the character of the Villa District, which includes excellent examples of the
architectural styles that were popular in Chicago’s residential neighborhoods during the early
part of the twentieth century; and (C) Preliminarily find that the demolition of a contributing
building or structure within a landmark district is a per se adverse effect on the significant
historical and architectural features, pursuant to Article III, Section G.3.b., of the Rules and

preliminarily find that the demolition of the subject property will adversely affect and destroy
significant historical and architectural features of the property and the district; and (E) Issue a
preliminary decision disapproving the demolition application.
