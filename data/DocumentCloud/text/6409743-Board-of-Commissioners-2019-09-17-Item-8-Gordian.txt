Item No. 8

AUTHORIZATION TO EXTEND AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION FOR THE SERVICE
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY AND THE GORDIAN GROUP TO
MANAGE SECTION 3 JOB ORDER CONTRACTING (JOC) MENTORING PROGRAM, THROUGH CHA’S
PARTICIPATION IN THE NEW YORK CITY HOUSING AUTHORITY’S AGREEMENT WITH THE
GORDIAN GROUP
Presenters:

Eric Garrett, Chief Property Officer
Leonard Langston, Deputy Chief Property Officer

RECOMMENDATION
The Chief Executive Officer recommends that the Board of Commissioners (“Board”) of the Chicago
Housing Authority (“CHA”) authorize the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or his designee to extend
the Service Agreement between the CHA and The Gordian Group for one year, through September
28, 2020, through CHA’s participation in the New York City Housing Authority’s (“NYCHA”) contract
with The Gordian Group, and further recommends that the Board authorize additional
compensation for The Gordian Group in an amount not-to-exceed $2,060,000 for the extension
term.
The requested action in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable Federal, State,
and Local laws, and Chicago Housing Authority Board policies. Staff have completed all necessary
due diligence to support the submission of this initiative.
FUNDING:
Property Office Budget
BACKGROUND
The scope of services of the competitively procured NYCHA agreement substantially fulfills CHA’s
need to develop a Job Order Contracting program for Section 3 Business interests. As a result, in
March of 2016, the CHA obtained Board approval to reference NYCHA’s contract with The Gordian
Group. The scope of services includes: working to develop the program; providing customized
documents; developing a unit price book and technical specifications; support during procurement
of the construction contracts; providing an internet-based database; initial and ongoing training;
and post-implementation program administration and facilitation support.
When CHA initially contracted with The Gordian Group to facilitate the Section 3 JOC program the
goal was to execute $30,000,000 of construction task orders over the 2 ½ year base contract
period. The CHA obtained additional Board approval to amend the Service Agreement with the
Gordian Group to increase The Gordian Group’s compensation for the 2 ½ year base contract

 period, plus the option year available under the Contract, to the current contract value of
$10,240,000. The plan is to continue to support the program over the next year to meet the needs
of the CHA. The requested not-to-exceed compensation amount of $2,060,000 for the extension
term is intended to facilitate an additional projected job order value of up to $40,000,000 through
September 2020.
