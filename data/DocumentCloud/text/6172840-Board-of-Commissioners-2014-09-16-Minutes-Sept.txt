Commissioners is physically present at any meeting, a majority of the quorum may allow a

After Motion made by Commissioner Markowski and seconded by Commissioner Reidy the Minutes
for the Regular and Closed meetings of August 13, 2014 were unanimously approved as submitted.
Commissioner Mildred Harris then presented the report of the Tenant Services committee. Per

(Item 1)
The resolution for Item 1 approves the second one-year option of Contract No. 11155 with Illinois
Action for Children (IAFC) in an amount not-to-exceed $222,298.00 to provide a fitness and wellness
program for CHA youth. This action will increase the aggregate not-to-exceed contract value to
$914,322. To encourage youth fitness and wellness, CHA has contracted with IAFC since 2012 to
provide the ReCharge program for youth ages 6 to 13, which utilizes a fitness and wellness curriculum
designed to work with the National Institutes of Health We Can! Curriculum. The Curriculum focuses
on positive messaging for youth and families by utilizing a variety of teaching methods including, but
not limited to art, literacy, and physical activity. CHA proposes to continue this program for 2015 at
ten CHA sites that operate the Summer Food program so that youth who come for meals can be
engaged in a positive, healthy experience throughout the day. The ReCharge program engages more
than 350 youth during the summer months.
RESOLUTION NO. 2014-CHA-90
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated September 10, 2014
entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO EXERCISE THE SECOND ONE YEAR OPTION
WITH ILLINOIS ACTION FOR CHILDREN TO PROVIDE YOUTH WITH
FITNESS AND WELLNESS OPPORTUNITIES”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
exercise the second one-year option of Contract No. 11155 with Illinois Action for
Children (“IAFC”) in an amount not-to-exceed $222,298 to provide a fitness and

 This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE,
Section 3, and insurance requirements.
(Item 2)
The resolution for Item 2 approves a contract with EverFi, Inc. to provide a cloud based financial
education platform for CHA residents for a two-year base term in the firm fixed fee amount of
$150,000.00, with three one-year options exercisable at the discretion of the CEO or his designee,
subject to funding availability and satisfactory contract performance, in the firm fixed fee amount of
$75,000.00 per each one-year option, for an aggregate contract value of $375,000.00. CHA’s Resident
Services Division is charged with supporting adults on the path to self-sufficiency, which includes
making financial education available to adults and seniors. Financial education is a crucial skill set for
all adults. Minimizing financial risk and exposure and maximizing sound financial decisions help to
provide stability to households and empowers families to take ownership over their personal finances.
Depending on where residents are in terms of their goals, financial education can help individuals
maintain lease compliance, reduce their dependence on subsidies and increase self-sufficiency. EverFi
offers cloud based financial education tools to communities across the nation and is the established
provider of financial education programs for youth participating in many programs associated with the
Mayor’s Summer of Learning initiatives that CHA also partners in, such as the Summer Youth
Employment Program. The turnkey curriculums to be provided by EverFi will be available to up to
10,000 CHA users (youth, adults and seniors) per year and will provide a digital badge to all
successful completers. Additionally, EverFi’s program tracking will provide measurable impacts of
participants’ knowledge gains by using pre- and post-assessments, completion statistics and attitudes
and behavior around specific personal finance topics.
RESOLUTION NO. 2014-CHA-91
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated September 10, 2014

the firm fixed fee amount of $75,000.00 per each one-year option, for an aggregate

There being no questions or discussion, Chairwoman Scott thereupon declared said Motion carried and

Commissioner Bridget Reidy then presented the report for the Joint Operations and Real Estate
Development Committee. Per Commissioner Reidy, a joint meeting of the Operations and Real
Estate Development Committee was held on September 10, 2014 at approximately 1:30 p.m. at the
CHA’s Corporate Offices, 12th Floor Loft. Commissioner Reidy chaired the meeting and there was a

For the Real Estate Development

agenda.
On behalf of the joint Operations and Real Estate Development committees, Commissioner Reidy
presented an Omnibus Motion for the approval of Items 3 and 4.
(Item 3)
The wait list registration lottery is the primary tool the CHA uses to identify low-income families in
need of housing assistance. The wait list resolution that the Board of Commissioners approved in July
2014 included authority to: “amend contracts and increase the compensation amounts with existing
vendors, as deemed necessary, to provide additional services, including a call center, development and
hosting of an online registration form…and other goods and services that may be necessary or
appropriate.” The CHA initially anticipated that it would utilize an existing vendor to perform these
services, but in subsequent conversations, that vendor indicated that it would not be able to do so. The
CHA also explored using other existing CHA contracts for this project, but could not identify any
existing contracts that included a similar scope of work. As a result, the CHA issued a small-order bid
for the website design and configuration services in August 2014. The CHA’s initial independent cost
estimate for these services was $86,000, based on the costs for similar services in 2010. As such, the
CHA did not anticipate needing Board authority to enter into a contract. Of the two bids received,
NTT Centerstance, Inc. was deemed to be the lowest responsive bidder. The wait list registration is
planned to open in October 2014. To ensure adequate time to design, develop, and test the web-based
registration form, the CHA must enter into a contract with NTT Centerstance, Inc. as soon as possible.
Accordingly, the resolution for Item 3 approves award of contract with NTT Centerstance, Inc. for
website design and configuration services for the 2014 wait list lottery registration. The value of the
contract is $151,370.
RESOLUTION NO. 2014-CHA-92
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated September 16, 2014
entitled “WEBSITE DESIGN AND CONFIGURATION SERVICES CONTRACT
FOR 2014 WAIT LIST LOTTERY REGISTRATION”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

 THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) or his
designee to enter into a contract with NTT Centerstance, Inc. in the amount of $151,370
for website design and configuration services for the 2014 wait list lottery registration.

(Item 4)
The resolution for Item 4 approves three Demonstration Programs/Special Initiatives in order to clearly
articulate current initiatives and to establish the new process through which all such future
demonstration programs and special initiatives will be approved. Moving On is a demonstration
program which targets persons living in permanent supportive housing who are ready to move into
affordable housing options in the community. The CHA provides a tenant-based voucher to assist with
their housing transition. The Housing Choice Voucher Deinstitutionalization Initiative is a
demonstration program that targets Colbert or Williams class members to assist in their transition from
living in an institution to living in the community. The initiative is a partnership with the State of
Illinois. Applicants who are referred to the CHA by the State of Illinois or by an agency approved by
the State may receive a voucher to assist in their transition from institutional living.
The Access
Living Family (ALF) Voucher Initiative is a special initiative that targets families with one or more
disabled members and disabled individuals who are working with Access Living to secure permanent
affordable housing. Families and individuals referred to CHA by Access Living may receive a tenantbased voucher.
RESOLUTION NO. 2014-CHA-93
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated September 10, 2014
