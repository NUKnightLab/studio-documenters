Board and Committee Reports
A. Minutes of the Board of Directors Meeting, July 26, 2013
Director Butler, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of the Minutes of the
Board of Directors Meeting of July 26, 2013.
THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

B. Minutes of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting, August 14, 2013
 Medical Staff Appointments/Reappointments/Changes
 Proposed Revisions to the Bylaws of the Medical Staff of Provident Hospital of Cook County
During the presentation of the Minutes, Chairman Carvalho stated that at a prior meeting, a discussion was
held regarding the long wait times in the Emergency Department (ED). The System’s numbers are quite high
compared to national norms; however, part of the explanation for this is that there are a lot more people in the
System’s ED who are there for non-ED reasons - because those patients also figure into the numbers, they
significantly raise the averages. Also discussed was the wait time for ED patients who were admitted;
presumably those patients were there for some reason that required an admission - that number was also double
or triple the national average. Chairman Carvalho suggested that perhaps a discussion can be held at a future
meeting regarding why that number is double or triple the national average1. Director Collens responded that
this is a subject of continuing focus for the Quality and Patient Safety Committee and Dr. Krishna Das, System
Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation.
Director Collens, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved the approval of the Minutes of the
Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting of August 14, 2013. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, August 16, 2013
 Contracts and Procurement Items (detail was provided as attachment to Board Agenda)
During the presentation of the Minutes, Chairman Carvalho provided a summary of a discussion held at the
Finance Committee Meeting, regarding the request to renew the Supplemental Nutrition for Women, Infants
and Children (WIC) grants. An issue arose a couple of years ago regarding non-mandated grants received that,
over time, have ended up costing the System more than it was receiving to provide the services; this is because
the grant funding remained flat, and the System’s costs go up for a variety of reasons each year. At that time,
the Board decided to continue receiving those grants and providing those services.

Board and Committee Reports
C. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, August 16, 2013 (continued)
After the issue arose, the Board decided that, in the future, the Board should be apprised as soon as possible if
the administration is proposing to stop applying for grant funding under scenarios such as this; normally the
Board is aware of activity for a grant when permission is being requested to approve the receipt of the grant,
but would not be aware if a decision was made to not re-apply for a grant. Additionally, the Board requested
that when the administration is proposing to continue to provide grant-funded, non-mandated services at a loss,
the Board should be alerted to that as well. At the time the Board is alerted to this, the administration can
describe the programmatic reasons for continuing to provide these services. The example of the WIC grant
was one that was viewed as synchronous with the System’s mission, and was important to creating traffic of
persons for the other services provided; it was synergistic with the activity of the System’s outpatient areas and
Public Health clinics.
At the Finance Committee Meeting, Board Chairman Carvalho had asked for further information regarding the
WIC grants. Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief of Clinical Integration, stated that, with regard to the WIC grants,
the System receives two pieces of a grant – the larger portion goes to Public Health and its venues, and the
smaller portion goes to the Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County (ACHN). The
Public Health portion of the grant is fully funded for all of the activities and full-time equivalent employees
(FTEs) associated with the grant. The ACHN portion is currently staffed by five FTEs, but the funding of the
grant only provides for coverage of the salaries and benefits of three of those FTEs. Despite the fact that the
System has seen decreasing numbers of cases in the WIC Program at the ACHN sites, it is believed that this
activity is aligned with the mission and vision of the System. There are efficiencies and increases in
productivity that should be seen; Dr. Shannon will be working on strategies to improve the productivity under
the grant with the System’s new Chief Operating Officer for Outpatient Services, Debra Carey.
Dr. Shannon stated that the grant dollars under the WIC grant, which come from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, provide funding for what the administration believes are very critical services for the pregnant
women, infant and children patients served with regard to nutrition, diet, and other health habits, including
substance abuse and smoking cessation counseling. The administration supports continued acceptance of these
grants, with the understanding that there is a need to improve the efficiencies of the services.
Director Butler, seconded by Vice Chairman Ramirez, moved the approval of the Minutes
of the Finance Committee Meeting of August 16, 2013. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Chairman Carvalho abstained and voted PRESENT on request numbers 3, 5, 6 and 7, under
the Contracts and Procurement Items contained within the Minutes.

D. Minutes of the Human Resources Committee Meeting, August 16, 2013
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Velasquez, moved the approval of the Minutes of the
Human Resources Committee Meeting of August 16, 2013. THE MOTION CARRIED

C. Approval of proposed CCHHS FY2014 Preliminary Budget (Attachment #3)
If, following consideration of this item, the Board determines that additional time is needed for deliberations
prior to approval of this item, a Special Meeting of the Board may be scheduled for this purpose.
Chairman Carvalho stated that this item has been reviewed and discussed by the Finance Committee, and
three public hearings have been held. All Directors have had an opportunity to meet with Dr. Ram Raju,
Chief Executive Officer, and his staff. He stated that he placed it on the agenda for approval today if the
Board Members feel they are ready to approve it; however, if the Board feels that the period of time is
insufficient or if there are further questions, a special meeting of the Board can be called at a later date for
the purpose of further consideration and approval. He noted that September 11th is the target to submit the
proposed CCHHS FY2014 Preliminary Budget to the Cook County Board.

Action Items
C. Approval of proposed CCHHS FY2014 Preliminary Budget (continued)
Aaron Galeener, System Director of Budget, addressed some of the questions that had been asked over the
last week. One of the questions that came up was regarding the projection of this year’s FY2013 numbers;
he noted that there is information within the meeting materials that reflects that breakdown. On the revenue
side, there are basically two areas into which the revenues are segregated: regular patient fee revenue and
CountyCare-related revenue. With regard to the regular patient fee revenue, the System continues to exceed
the budget targets for this year. With regard to the CountyCare piece of the revenue, it is expected that the
System will be somewhat short on it this year, due to the challenges experienced with the delay of the State’s
processing of the applications. The System is expecting to eventually collect all of the revenue for the
CountyCare Program, but the timing of when that revenue will be collected may flow over into next year.
With regard to FY2013 expenditures, Mr. Galeener stated that it is projected to be close to the appropriation
this year. This is being monitored very closely; he noted that part of this is also going to be dependent on
State processing time as well, because as they continue to approve more applications, the System will also
receive additional claims or costs for those new members.
Chairman Carvalho stated that the County adopts the operating budget independent of the capital budget;
oftentimes, assumptions need to be made that there will be access to certain new or replacement equipment
during that year. He asked for further information regarding capital assumptions that are embedded in the
budget. Mr. Galeener stated that there is uncertainty around the County’s willingness to issue bonds to
receive the additional money used for capital expenditures; because of that uncertainty, the administration
has tried to limit any kind of dependency on that stream in terms of making operating budget assumptions.
The System maintains a Bank of America lease facility within its operating budget, which can be used for
some capital items. In general, the administration has tried to limit any significant changes to the operating
budget based on the assumption that it will receive a large amount of capital funding over the course of the
next year; for example, there was not an assumption that the System will have all new equipment in certain
areas next year, so there was not a significant reduction in repair and maintenance costs.
In response to a question from Director Collens regarding whether the System Board will receive an actual
capital budget, Chairman Carvalho stated that the County’s administration surveys the units of government
to determine their needs, and determines what they are going to do in terms of bonds and allocation of funds.
He could not recall whether the System’s submission for that process is shared with the Board either before
or after it is allocated; he inquired whether Director Collens would like to see the information before it is
submitted. Director Collens responded affirmatively. He noted that, as part of that presentation, it would be
helpful to see a presentation on capital needs, whether the capital budget exists or not, and to receive a status
report in terms of meeting the System’s needs and what the System administration would like to receive on
the capital side. Chairman Carvalho stated that, in the past, the Board has seen that from time to time,
especially as a part of the strategic planning process; he recommended that the Finance Committee take a
first look at that information and then share it up through the Committee to the Board2.
Director Hammock stated that, as the System increases its capability to serve those patients under
CountyCare, although some of the new members may already be current patients, there is also a hope that
there will be new patients. Part of this budget anticipates an increase in census; he indicated that, starting in
January or as soon thereafter as practicable, the Board should see some metrics on a regular basis on the
utilization under CountyCare. He suspected that other expenses will increase as the demand for services
increases. He asked that staff provide the Board with the appropriate metrics so the Board can monitor the
growth in CountyCare in the hopes that it exceeds the goals. Chairman Carvalho stated that this would be a
good report for the Finance Committee to review and discuss. He suggested that the assumptions regarding
utilization be incorporated to track the progress in a dashboard sort of way; this would be responsive to
Director Hammock’s request3.

Action Items
C. Approval of proposed CCHHS FY2014 Preliminary Budget (continued)
Chairman Carvalho stated that, upon approval, this budget will be submitted to the County Board for their
approval and subsequent inclusion in the President’s FY2014 Budget Recommendation. Following that, the
County Board will be meeting as a Finance Committee and as a full Board, and will hold public hearings on
the subject. In the past, the System Board Chair and Finance Committee Chair have attended those
meetings; he and Commissioner Butler plan to attend those meetings. He urged the Directors to attend one
or more of these meetings, if possible, as a measure of support of the Board behind Dr. Raju and the budget.
The Secretary will apprise the Directors of those meetings when they are scheduled.

Director Velasquez, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the approval of the proposed
CCHHS FY2014 Preliminary Budget. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Report from Chairman of the Board (continued)
Chairman Carvalho noted that the following Standing Committee and Work Group assignments have been
made since the last Board Meeting:
Audit and Compliance Committee
Chair:
Muñoz
Members: Morris
Velasquez
Carvalho (ex-officio)

Quality and Patient Safety Committee
Chair:
Collens
Members: Lerner
Muñoz
Carvalho (ex-officio)

Finance Committee

Butler
Members: Gugenheim
Hammock
Ramirez
Wiese
Carvalho (ex-officio)

Work Group on Affiliations

Members: Collens
Morris
Work Group on Strategic Planning
Chair:
Lerner
Members: Butler
Gugenheim

Human Resources Committee
Chair:
Wiese
Members: Ramirez
Velasquez
Carvalho (ex-officio)

Chairman Carvalho stated that each of the Committees began a discussion regarding the schedule for next
year; he noted that, technically, the Board does not need to adopt the schedule until near the end of the year.
At the last Board Meeting, he asked the Committees to have a discussion about the Board Meetings, with
regard to both time and congruence, and in terms of the dates of the Board Meetings and the Committees. The
intent was to have some discussion at the level of the Committees to prepare the Directors for a discussion at
the Board level on the same topic. He noted that, according to the minutes of the meetings of the Committees,
each of the Committees actually took a sense of the Committee on the topic, with differing results.
Chairman Carvalho stated that one of the principal proponents and describers of the concept of a common date
for all meetings of the Committees and Boards is Director Lerner, who was unfortunately not present at that
time (Director Lerner concluded his participation in the meeting by conference call a short time earlier).
Chairman Carvalho noted that the Quality and Patient Safety Committee’s consensus was that the members
thought it would be a good idea to have the Committees meet on the same day as the Board. Chairman
Carvalho stated that he tried to envision how that concept would work; there are four Standing Committees,
and each of them has either three or five members, while the Board has eleven members. Would the Directors
step out when their Committee concludes, and return for the start of the Board Meeting, or would the Directors
plan to be present for all of the meetings regardless of whether or not they are a member of the Committees?
Director Collens stated that the Quality and Patient Safety Committee deferred to Dr. Raju on this subject as to
what is practical from a staff standpoint. Chairman Carvalho noted that one of Director Lerner’s concerns
about having the Committees meet on multiple days was that this means Dr. Raju and his staff are tied up on
multiple days – it could be one day instead of multiple days per month. Dr. Raju stated that he and his staff
will explore this possibility and provide a response regarding the staff’s perspective on the subject4. Chairman
Carvalho added that if Directors have strong thoughts one way or another, they can share them with Dr. Raju
so that he and his staff can process that, too.

V.

Report from Chairman of the Board (continued)
With regard to the remaining 2013 Meeting dates, Director Collens noted that one change was made - the
September 18th Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting date and time was recently changed; the
Committee will instead be meeting on Monday, September 23rd at 11:00 A.M.
Director Hammock stated that, as the Board considers this, he believes that this is not just about convenient
timing, it is also about how to have effective meetings where Board Members have the opportunity to review,
discuss and absorb the materials. He noted that, with regard to the other boards on which he serves, it is
challenging to sit in on a series of meetings that are six or seven hours long during the day and do an effective
job of managing the information, especially if there are large quantities of materials. He added that he thinks
the Board wants to be concerned about the quality of the discussion, as well as the quantity of time. Chairman
Carvalho concurred; he noted that one of the other considerations to also think about is the public audience.
The System is different from a non-public body - the System does not hold its meetings in public just because
the State statute tells it to do so; because this is not an elected board, it is important that the public have an
opportunity to see this Board’s actions, so the Directors should think of it from that perspective as well.
Chairman Carvalho stated that the other subject mentioned by Director Lerner was regarding the start time of
the Board Meetings. The Committees can decide their own times; some of them have chosen times earlier or
later in the morning. He inquired whether 8:00 A.M. remains a good time for Directors. Director Collens
responded that 8:00 A.M. is fine with him; as a personal matter, he prefers 8:30 A.M. Chairman Carvalho
inquired whether any Directors were interested in meeting at 7:30 A.M. or at 10:00 A.M. or later, or even in
the evening; the responses were in the negative.

VI.

Revenue Budget
• Revenue increase of $238.6M to a total $950.7M
• Revenue estimates based on current experience and trends
• Increase reflects CountyCare impact of 100% FMAP and full
year membership of 56,131 patients
• CountyCare membership of 56,131 reflects a conservative
estimate for budgeting purposes due to uncertainty in transition
to Medicaid expansion, patient retention, and transition to new
state eligibility system

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM

REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
August 23, 2013

 

FY2014 PRELIMINARY BUDGET

lam pleased to provide you with a brief summary of our 2014 Preliminary Budget. The FY2014
Preliminary Budget focuses on several key principles as we continue our transformation:

0 No service reductions or layoffs

0 Improving the patient experience to retain patients post Medicaid expansion
0 Retaining all positions/vacancies to improve services and frontline staffing
0 Expanding the CountyCare network to increase access .
0 Continuing implementation of the patient centered medical home

0 Improving and developing the infrastructure
0 Improving information systems to give us the data needed to make informed
strategic decisions
0 Expanding and supporting our Human Resources capacity

0 Meeting the requirements of the Cermak Department ofJustice Consent Decree

0 Developing the budget based on achievable revenue assumptions

0 Reducing taxpayer burden and dependency on Cook County funding.
CountyCare has been an enormous success so far. With more members as of August and
increased reimbursements next year, we expect to increase CountyCare revenue by $271
million. We are well on our way toward meeting our goal of 115,000 by the end of 2013. This

success allows us to reduce our subsidy from Cook County by $76 million, down to $175million -
a 30% decrease from last year.

It should be noted that the budget is'subject to approval by the Board of Directors and
then the Cook County Board of Commissioners. That process will occur over the course of the
next several months.

I want to take a moment and thank each of you for your efforts as we continue the
transformation of the Cook County Health Hospitals System into a quality, integrated patient-
centered health network that is financially responsible and for your continued service to our
patients.

COUNTYCARE UPDATE

We continue to generate applications for eligible adults in CountyCare, our program designed
to expand coverage under the Affordable Care Act. I am happy to report that our hard work,
dedication to our patients and the larger community is paying off.

We have initiated more than 90,000 applications and we continue to work closely with the
State of Illinois on getting people enrolled into the program.

CountyCare is a critical step in the massive transformation of our system. We must adapt to the
new way of providing care to ensure that the public health system, a critical player in the health
of our communities, remains a viable and valued partner.

COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH UPDATE

September marks National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month. Obesity now affects 17
percent of all children and adolescents in the United States?triple the rate from just one
generation ago. Childhood obesity puts America?s children at early risk for type 2 diabetes, high
blood pressure, heart disease, and even stroke?conditions usually associated with adulthood.
Physical activity and proper nutrition are key to preventing childhood obesity.

Throughout the month of September, will release recent data findings associated with
body mass index (BMI), physical activity and school meals in suburban Cook County. We can all
help by promoting the following:
Encouraging children and adolescents to get 60 minutes or more of physical activity
each day;
0 Improving children?s access to healthy food?at home, at school, and at local events and
venues;
0 Providing plenty of fruits and vegetables, limiting foods high in fat and sugar, and
preparing healthier foods at family meals.

Additional information is available at and

RECOGNITION

Today we recognize individuals who have helped shape the System as well as those who lead by
example and will serve us well as we transform.

Ruth M. Rothstein (1923?2013)

This past month, our County family lost a true advocate, leader, and friend. Ruth M.
Rothstein served as the first Chief of the Cook County Bureau of Health Services
overseeing a number of initiatives including the building of a new hospital. Ruth?s story
is one of perseverance and utter commitment. Every path she paved was guided by her
belief that access to quality healthcare was a fundamental human right. She had a
larger than life personality, a stellar national reputation and yet her compassion, loyalty
and friendship were all very personal.

Alma Leagogo-Jaromahum, APRN, CCRN, RNC

Alma is 3 Neonatal Nurse Clinician in the Neonatal Intensive care Unit at Stroger,
received a very prestigious 2013 National PNAA Nurse of the Year Award in Education
from the Philippine Nurses Association of America (PNAA) during its 34th National
Convention in Cleveland, Ohio. Alma was recognized by her peers and colleagues and
was bestowed this honor for her outstanding contributions and quality of her work as an
exemplary nursing professional in the field of Nursing Education. Alma also currently
serves as President-Elect and Chairperson ofthe By-Laws Committee of the Philippine
Nurses Association of Illinois (PNAI)

HIPAA Heroes: Valerie Borders and Roberta Mason

A few weeks ago a man approached Valarie Borders and Roberta Mason individually and
requested patient information. The individual claimed to work for Cook County in the
Finance Department. Ms. Borders and Ms. Mason knew not to release this information
without the proper authorizations'and they refused his request, even after he pressured
them. We?ve since learned this person does not work at Cook County, rather he works
for a home care provider. By refusing the request, our employees safeguarded our
patients? privacy and prevented healthcare fraud.
