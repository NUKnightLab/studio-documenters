RE: Proposed Contract and Procurement Contract 6002059 Avima Design, LLC for
$100,000.00 Printing and Graphic Design Contract Contract Period: Upon City Council Approval
through April 22, 2021.

Council Members of the Public Health and Safety Steering Committee:

Three weeks ago, the above proposed contract was submitted to the Detroit City Council for
consideration and approval. The proposed contract was held for three weeks pending responses to
committee member concerns. At that time, members of the committee noted that the contract was
incorrectly assigned to the Detroit Police Department as opposed to the intended Detroit Board of
Police Commissioners. In the hearing, it was our understanding that this submission error was corrected.
Additionally, the committee was concerned with the past performance with Avima Design, LLC. The
Board of Police Commissioners submitted a response to the performance concerns indicating "Based on
past experience and deliverables, along with its responses to the open procurement, Avima can deliver
again.? The response was transmitted to the Office of Contracting procurement on May 24, 2019
whereupon we were assured that this information was responsive to the expressed concerns and would
be forwarded to the appropriate parties including the Detroit City Council. See attached e-mail(s)
Attachment 

Additionally, today (6/3/2019) the above proposed contract was held for an additional two weeks. The
Board received questions from Council member McCalister drafted May 29, 2019 and received by the
BOPC June 3,2019. Please note the responses to the questions from Council member McCalister,

(1)

(2)

(3)

Will you please detail the types of printing request you are seeking to have completed?
Response: Attached please see the scope of service of the proposed contract that details the
printing and design request (Attachment #2 Scope of Work).

Will you also describe the specific types of graphics you are expecting to have produced?
Response: Attached please see the scope of service of the proposed contract that details the
printing and design request (Attachment #2 item Scope of Work).

Are you aware that the City of Detroit Media Services Department is available to your
Honorable body to request and produce your expected projects?

Response: Yes, we are aware of the services provided by Media Services. In several
conversations with Media Services we have been reminded of the restrictions related to
requested products. For example, the BOPC request on 3/6/2018, a reprint of 50 copies of our
Annual Report. We were told that ?Yourjob is to large for our copier. Please contact an outside
vendor.? (See Attachment The printing of newsletters, annual reports and other items
require offset printing or other commercial printing process. Aside from volume, Media Services
cannot handle folds, special cuts and other printing requests that are commercial in nature. It is
our opinion, that the work contained in the proposed contract should be produced by
commercial printing entities. Media Service basic reproduction abilities are based on small job
copy machine technology.

Good day Shde
I think your question is whether the BOPC worked with Avima in the past

Avima has completed work since roughly mid-2017 for the BOPC, with major projects including the 2016 Annual Report,
a fall 2017 newsletter with household mailing, the 2017 Annual Report, a 2018 community newsletter with a per?District
household mailing, and a 2018 special publication on civilian oversight in The Michigan Chronicle These were the major
projects with complexity for copy and photo layout, along with creative design for covers for the Annual Reports and
Chronicle insert, and had significant deadlines attached

Let me know if this answers your query

Good day Pat.

We are out of copies of our 2016 Annual Report so I want to get 50 copies in booklet
format, which means it would print 8 1/2 11 and get folded in half with a staple in the
middle.

This is not urgent, just something I plan to send over to you within the next week for a
April 2 due date. But I want to make sure I fill out the form correctly, since technically the
document has 36 pages, but only 18 when booklet format is selected. The booklet format

also is half the size of original document, but I do not think I would put 50% on the form.

Please advise. Thanks

May 10, 2019
Dear Mr. Brundidge,

The Recycling Partnership would like to present the City of Detroit with this letter of commitment to provide
grant funding and technical assistance in support of the city's recycling program. This letter provides a
summary the grant funding being offered, and this commitment has been developed as a result of discussions
with city staff following the earlier offer of grant funding that we put before you in my letter dated April 23,
2019. This commitment of grant funding is intended to complement the City's application to Michigan
Department of Environmental Quality (MI DEB.) for a Recycling Infrastructure Grant, and The Recycling
Partnership is prepared to work with the City of Detroit to develop and execute a grant contract agreement
built around this commitment and the conditions set forth in our earlier offer that will combine to become the
foundation of our work together.

Our grant will be in support of the City's efforts to advance and expand your curbside and multifamily recycling
programs, and the total cash grant available to the city of up to $325,308 represents a combination of funding
for recycling infrastructure (carts, bins and collection equipment) as well as funding for recycling education and
outreach. The amounts set forward in the table below are intended to re?ect the total amount of cash grant
funding that the Recycling Partnership will make available to the City of Detroit. The actual amount of funding
provided will depend on the city's implemented work, and the funding will be paid on a reimbursement basis.

planning and implementation of the recycling outreach campaigns. We are thrilled to be able to provide the
City of Detroit this commitment for grant funding with the goal of working towards the execution of a mutually

communities. The Recycling Partnership looks forward to supporting The City of Detroit as you grow your
public recycling efforts.
