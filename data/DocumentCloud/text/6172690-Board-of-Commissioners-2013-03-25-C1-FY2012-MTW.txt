To the Honorable Board of Commissioners,

It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve the attached FY2012 Moving to
Work Annual Report and grant authorization to submit the document to the United States
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for approval.

 

The Executive Vice President (EVP) and the Of?ce of the General Counsel have completed all
necessary due diligence to support the submission of this initiative and recommend the approval
of this item accordingly.

CORPORATE GOAL
1. Provide more housing options for families
2. Assist residents in achieving self-suf?ciency
3. Increase the cost-effectiveness of public housing and HCV program administration.

EXPLANATION

The Plan for Transformation was approved by HUD and incorporated into a Moving to Work
(MTW) Agreement that was executed on February 6, 2000. On June 26, 2008, CHA executed an
Amended and Restated MTW Agreement (Restated Agreement) between itself and HUD, which
supersedes the original MTW Agreement and extends participation in the MTW program
until 2018. The Restated Agreement instituted new reporting requirements and subsequently
HUD issued revised reporting requirements in Form 50900 for public housing authorities
participating in the MTW Demonstration Program.

Under the MTW Agreement, CHA is required to produce and submit an Annual Report to HUD
outlining the progress toward commitments made in the original Plan for Transformation and
each Annual Plan. HUD requires this report to be submitted annually, along with a Board of
Commissioners? resolution approving this report, no later than 90 days after the end of 
?scal year. CHA must submit the FY2012 MTW Annual Report to HUD on March 29, 2013.
The FY2012 MTW Annual Report provides information necessary for HUD to assess 
performance in 2012 regarding both day-to-day operations and activities authorized by the MTW
Demonstration Program. The FY2012 MTW Annual Report is included with this resolution for
the Board of Commissioners? review and approval.

Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of CHA to approve the FY2012 MTW Annual
Report and grant authorization to the Chief Executive Of?cer, the Board Chairperson, or their
designee to approve any ?nal changes as deemed necessary to submit the FY2012 MTW Annual
Report to HUD on the March 29, 2013 deadline.
