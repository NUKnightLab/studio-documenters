 GENERAL BACKGROUND
The Chicago Housing Authority is the third largest HCV Program in the country, serving over 38,000
participants and over 14,000 property owners. The HCV Program is currently administered by two
contractors operating in three regional offices located across the City of Chicago. These contracts are overseen
and administered by CHA’s HCV Department. The current extension for Contract No. 1080 with Nan

McKay and Associates (“NMA”) and Contract No. 1081 with CVR Associates, Inc. (“CVR”), which
was authorized by the Board on June 20, 2012, expires on June 30, 2013. This extension is imperative to
provide continuation of the HCV Program as it issues a new Request for Proposal for services which is in
alignment with the new corporate strategies
During the initial extension period, the CHA evaluated current policies to coordinate and align with the new
corporate strategy. The HCV Program developed a new request for proposal which is more closely aligned to the
corporate vision and proposed new policies. This additional extension will allow the CHA sufficient time to
concurrently release the RFP to solicit qualified contractors to administrate and operate CHA’s HCV Programs
and to properly evaluate proposals, interview, conduct discussions and contract negotiations with qualified
respondents and obtain Board authorization to award (a) contract(s) with the selected respondent(s) and transition
services by April 1, 2014. Without the extension, the CHA will not be able to operate and administrate its HCV
Programs.

The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable Chicago
Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.
The Chief Housing Officer concurs with the recommendation to extend Contract No. 1080 with Nan
McKay Associates and Contract No. 1081 with CVR Associates, Inc.
The CEO/President recommends the approval to amend and extend Contract No. 1080 with Nan McKay
and Associates and Contract No. 1081 with CVR Associates, Inc. for a nine (9) months period from July
1, 2013 through March 31, 2014 to administrate and operate CHA’s Housing Choice Voucher Programs
for an aggregate amount not-to-exceed $21,749,704.00.
