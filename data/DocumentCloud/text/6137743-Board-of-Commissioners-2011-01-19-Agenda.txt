PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Cook County is facing an oral health care crisis; and
WHEREAS, with one of the lowest reimbursement rates in the country, Illinois is leaving thousands of
hard working Cook County families caught in a painful, degrading and sometimes life threatening oral
health care gap; and
WHEREAS, one third of Illinois’ underserved population resides in Cook County and 1.4 million county

WHEREAS, the number of children and adults enrolled in public aid programs continue to increase,
while critical oral health care programs remain unfunded; and
WHEREAS, in Cook County, 64 percent of third graders have had cavities and 39 percent have untreated
cavities; and
WHEREAS, there is often a 3 to 12 month wait for specialty dental treatment, which in many cases,
results in more expensive emergency care; and
WHEREAS, there is a medically proven link between overall health and oral heath, with studies showing
that poor oral health may be linked to heart disease, stroke, pre-term child birth and oral cancer.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Department of Public Health shall
collect a complete inventory of county dental services including clinic location, hours of operation, a list
of staff at each location, salary/hourly compensation of each employee, number of patients served,
