CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: We would like to call
the meeting to order. It's 1:09 p.m.

The first order of business is the
Board introduction and the approval of the Board
expansion resolution.

What I would like to do first, if we
can just have the Board Members present here
introduce themselves and give a quick background on
them and why they're interested in this role.

MS. CAFARO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Debra Cafaro.
I'm the Chairman and CEO of Ventas which is a
Chicago based 500 public company with about
$35 billion in real estate assets focused in
healthcare and senior living in the U.S., Canada and
the UK.

I'm very delighted to serve on the
Chicago Infrastructure Trust Board and serve the
citizens of Chicago and try to use my 30 plus years
experience in real estate and finance to assist the
City in improving its infrastructure, and it's an
honor to be here. Thank you.

MS. HUBBARD: I'm Hubbard. I'm the

Chief Investment Officer for Ernst Young. I am

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

312-346-0911

 

Page 3

happy to be a member of this Board and have the
opportunity to serve the Mayor and the citizens of
Chicago on infrastructure projects that we know we
are in need of and look forward to some exciting
opportunities and seeing things happen.

MR. LINGENFELTER: I'm Carl Lingenfelter,
Senior Vice President at Northern Trust here in
Chicago. I have had a number of different roles
serving our clients through large institutional
investors and asset managers.

In prior lives, like our Chairman, I
spent time in and out of the public sector and look
forward to bringing the two together here in the
Infrastructure Trust. It's critical to the future
health of our Trust.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Kurt Summers. I'm the
City Treasurer. I'm excited to join this Board and
with our colleagues here bring our expertise to help
invest in the public assets and public good for the
City of Chicago.

ALDERMAN Good afternoon. My
name is Matthew O'Shea. I serve as alderman of the
19th Ward representing the communities of Beverly,

Morgan Park and Mount Greenwood on the far southwest

side. I am the only member of this Board without an
expertise in finance, but what I do have an
expertise is in the crumbling infrastructure we have
in this great city.

I live it every day in my community.
I've got water mains and sewer mains well over
120 years old. I've got streetlight outages blocks
and blocks at a time in high crime areas in my ward.
Those type of things, they keep me up at night.

I think this Trust moving forward can
be extremely successful, and I'm excited and honored
to be a part of this Board, and to be frank, we're
going to get things done. I'm excited to be a part
of it. Thank you.

MR. ZARATE: Miguel Zarate, managing
partner at Marquette Associates, investment
consulting here in Chicago. I'm excited to serve on
the Board, excited about the prospect of
understanding some of the projects that have
happened up to this point and moving those forward
and also looking for some new projects in hopes of
again building the infrastructure of Chicago.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Great. Thank you. We

will be happy to entertain a motion for the

 



McGuire?s Reporting Service A Veritext Company

 

312-346-0911

Page 5

resolution.

MR. LINGENFELTER: So moved.

MS. HUBBARD: Second.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: All in favor?

(A chorus of ayes.)
Those opposed?
(No response.)
Great.
Next we have an approval of the new
Executive Director resolution which should have been
provided to everyone. That person is Leslie
Darling.
Leslie, if you want to say a few
words.

MS. DARLING: Sure. I'm Leslie Darling,
and I am thrilled to have been asked to tackle this
challenge of becoming the Executive Director of the
Chicago Infrastructure Trust and to do that with all
of you.

I think the Mayor has assembled a
second to none team of Board members, and I'm
thrilled to be able to work with all of you as we
move forward and continue the great work that Steve

Beitler and the Infrastructure Trust has done so far

 

 

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

312-346-091 1

 

Page 6

and to move forward and work to bring a lot of new
projects to the table, and as Alderman O'Shea said,
to get a lot of things done.
I look forward to working with you.
I'm honored to have this appointment and look
forward to getting started in September.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Thank you. Is there a
motion on the resolution?
MS. CAFARO: I will move it.
ALDERMAN Second.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: All in favor?
(A chorus of ayes.)
Any opposed?
(No response.)
Congratulations.
Next we have the minutes of the
October 16th meeting which the only person who would
have been here for that is Jorge Ramirez who
unfortunately is absent today, but as a matter of
procedure, we have all had an opportunity to review
the minutes.
Are there any questions on the
minutes themselves?

(No response.)

 



McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

 

312-346-0911

Page 7

None. Is there a motion to approve?

ALDERMAN So moved.

MR. ZARATE: Seconded.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Moved and seconded
O'Shea and Zarate. All in favor?

(A chorus of ayes.)

Any opposed?

(No response.)

MS. HUBBARD: I'll go on the record as
present. I haven't had a complete opportunity to
review the minutes.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Thank you.

Next is the meeting schedule for the
next two meetings. Just to be clear with all the
folks on the Board and others in the room, the next
meeting will be September 23rd. I thought it was
the 30th.

MS. DARLING: I think those are the
prescheduled meetings.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: My fault.

MS. DARLING: I think those were the
prescheduling meetings that were carried over from
the previous board. We'll be sending around

information to all of you to figure out what we're

 

 

 

 

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company
312-346-0911

Page 8

looking at, the 29th or 30th, for the next day, and
we will have that to you very, very shortly.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: So there will be a
late September meeting and then likely another
meeting by the end of the year?

MS. DARLING: Yes.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: We will work with all
the calendars to get those scheduled and those done.

Next we are going to have an
overview of existing programs and projects by Steve
Beitler.

MR. BEITLER: Thank you. So this is the
challenge that the Mayor posed to the Infrastructure
Trust. Everyone here is familiar with this when the
Board first mentioned the meeting, the reasons why
you're here.

So the Trust has been acknowledged
recently. We were acknowledged by the U.S. Clean
Tech Leadership which credited the Trust for helping
the City to accomplish its top ten metro area
ranking.

We were recognized by the Council of
Development Finance Agencies for the Retrofit One

project and recently were mentioned in Rosabeth Moss

 



McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

 

312-346-0911

Page 9

Kanter's book Move which singles out the Trust as a
leading innovator in infrastructure.

So the mission of the Trust, as you
all know, is to provide alternative, innovative
financing and project delivery options for
transformative infrastructure projects and up to now
has been focused in the four areas at the bottom of
the chart, energy, transportation, development and
telecommunications.

The Trust has its own contracting
manual. The contracting manual has generally been
updated every time the Board has met because it's
sort of a living document, and one of the
methodologies that the contracting manual allows for
is unsolicited proposals which has been very helpful
in getting additional proposals through the door in
terms of potential projects.

This is further explanation of the
unsolicited proposal process Stage 1 which you can
review on your own and in depth.

So there have been five goals to our
approach so far in terms of the projects that we've
been working on. The first is to transfer risk to

the private sector. The second is to attempt to do

 

 

 

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

?AV?Lver?extconl 312-346-0911

Page 10

these projects off credit, off balance sheet. The
third is to attempt to do them in a budget neutral
basis so they are essentially self-funding projects,
and we attempt to use underappreciated assets of the
City as we go forward with these projects.

From a timeline standpoint, I was
appointed in February of 2013. Vivian Funches came
aboard almost immediately as our accountant and acts
as, in essence, the CFO of the Trust, and then two
independent contractors came aboard, Claire Tramm,
who we'll be hearing from shortly. Claire, are you
on the phone?

MS. TRAMM: Yes, I am, Steve.

MR. BEITLER: All right. And Nick
Epstein who's in the audience who worked with the
Trust on two projects in particular.

Anyhow, then the next year of the
Trust we were able to close the Retrofit One deal
and the CTA 4G deal. We were additionally joined by
the individuals that you see on the chart here who
were working on various projects in the areas that
you see stated.

So from a financial perspective, the

two projects that we have completed so far, the

 



McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

 

312-346-0911

_l-J

Page 11

total project size has been 45.5 million. The total
savings that will be generated over ten years were
$63 million. The number of jobs that were created
is 193, plus revenue will be generated of

7.22 million for an IRR of 499 percent for those two
projects.

So in terms of in?process projects or
completed, I'm sorry, completed projects, the first
project that we'll talk about is the municipal
buildings retrofit, and we'll be joined by Claire
Tramm and George Marquisos from the PBC to discuss
this.

Claire, would you begin, please?

MS. TRAMM: Yes. Absolutely. Can
everyone hear me all right?

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Yes.

MS. TRAMM: Hi, my name is Claire Tramm.
I've been energy director here at the Trust, as
Steve mentioned, for a little over two years, and I
helped close the very first project of the Trust
which was municipal buildings retrofit of over
$14 million of 60 City buildings.

This involved over a hundred projects

of energy conservation measure installations with

 

 

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

 

312?346-091 1

Page 12

our three SO partners, Schneider Electric, Ameresco
and Noresco, who not only made the upgrades to the
City buildings, including City Hall, but guaranteed
their savings to the Trust.

We worked, as you can see on Page 21,
across a variety of public building partners. On
the left including, as I mentioned, City Hall, 2FM
has been a partner in this project, and we have also
retrofitted the libraries, police facilities, fire
departments, et cetera, and the projects were funded
at less than five percent interest by Bank of
America.

If you look at Page 22, this shows
the structure that was used for Retrofit One. It's
called an Energy Efficiency Services Agreement known
in the industry as an ESA. As I mentioned before,
you can see the guarantees flow from the ESCO in the
lower left, Noresco, Ameresco and Schneider, back to
the Chicago Infrastructure Trust and then Bank of
America over on the right, our tax exempt lender,
they put in the project capital up front, and then
the City, as the building owner, simply pays per
unit of energy saved. If they save nothing, they

pay nothing.

 

 

 

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

312-346?091 1

 

Page 13

1 This agreement will last for

2 14 years. It will reduce their utility bill over

3 time and again exposes taxpayers to zero risk in
4 terms of the energy savings, so we're able to have a
5 private tax exempt lender, loan the Trust money and

6 then essentially pay back that loan with both the

7 ESA that's signed between us and the City as well as

8 the guarantee of savings, so the two are perfect
9 complements to one another. As one annuity falls,
10 the other rises, and we're always into make the

11 lender whole.

12 It's an innovative structure. We are
13 the second tax exempt ESA to be performed in the

14 United Statesperiod for this as you will see on Page 23.

16 George Marquisos will be shortly

l7 updating you on the installations; however, I can

18 say it's been a great long process in 2014 when this
19 project was closed until midsummer when all of the
20 projects have actually finished installation,

21 substantial completion and final acceptance.

22 We are now focused mostly on the

23 operations and maintenance and monitoring phase

24[ which is very important to any Energy Efficient

 

 

 

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company
?AN?Lver?extconl 312?346-0911

Page 14

Service Agreement like this, so the ongoing work now
is one, to make sure we have a process of
reconciling our payments and our savings
calculations that works for all three ESCOs as well
as the Trust and our partners at 2FM on an ongoing
basis for the next 14 years of actual performance
period.

Second, we're working on fitting out
and building out our CMMS work order management
system that was included as part of this deal to be
provided to 2PM. We're using that to facilitate and
foster communications to ESCOs and from the three
ESCOS starting, as you can see here, alterations
back to the energy savings baseline calculation, any
equipment performance issues that 2FM may identify
in the operation of some these efficiency measures
that have been installed in buildings by the ESCOs,
and then also preventive maintenance and any other
issues that might affect savings deviations.

And then we're finally aligning on
with what a master monitoring verification
spreadsheet will look like and the annual reports
that we'll be expecting as part of our

reconciliation and billing process every April on a

 

 

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

312?346-091 1

 

Page 15

go forward basis.

So I will turn it over to George
Marquisos who will give a little bit more about the
project status and the great achievements that have
happened as a result of the Retrofit One project.

MR. MARQUISOS: Thank you, Claire. I
think you summarized it really, really 
well.

Just to explain my role, I am a
project manager for the Public Building Commission,
and 2FM and CIT decided that it would be very useful
to have a program manager to oversee the three ESCOs
and act essentially as an owner's representative to
make sure the terms of the contract were carried
out. That was my primary responsibility.

So the goal here, as Claire said, is
somewhat groundbreaking in the sense that
performance contracts have been done for 30 years.
We know that works in university settings. We know
it works in large federal institutions, but does it
work across an entire city in a bunch of different
size buildings with different occupancies. That's
the question that Chicago is trying to answer.

So if you move to the next slide, how

 

 

 

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

?AN?Lver?echon1 312-346-0911

Page 16

do you save $1,400,000 a year? What does it take to
do that across the City? Our example across 60
buildings is well, you have to visit the sites close
to 2,000 times. That's not including the auditing.
You have to install 1,500 occupancy sensors. You
change out 28,000 light bulbs and you install a lot
of brand new building automation systems that allow
these buildings to respond to their context, and
that's really where the deeper retrofits occur.

We now have technologies that say the
building is unoccupied, if the weather is inclement,
and you can change the way the building operates.
That is what this is all about. We're trying to
bring the City into the new age of automating their
systems.

It is a culture shift. It's a
difficult one. And I want to commend 2FM for taking
the leap of faith to try this out. I think we are
gradually seeing that the operating engineers are
recognizing there is utility in being able to look
at a building via the Internet and seeing how it's
operating instead of just driving there to respond
to calls.

And so this is all very positive

 

 

 

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

312-346-091 1

Page 17

stuff. I think we're proving out it's a difficult
thing to do. It's a complicated thing relationship with three companies for
the next 14 years, and we're trying very hard to set
up the terms of that relationship so we all have
clear expectations on who is responsible for what,
especially when other people leave and new people
enter, so that's our goal right now and so far so
good. I'm very pleased with the outcome.

MR. BEITLER: Do you want to take us
through the photos?

MR. MARQUISOS: Sure. This is a pure
energy only project, and we took a very, very
conservative approach. We're not assuming that the
cost of energy is going to escalate at all over the
next 14 years so we're assuming 2012 energy costs
for these savings.

So in all likelihood I would venture
to speculate that energy costs are going to rise and
you're going to save even more than that, but there
are other consequences, unintended, some intended,
that the City reaps benefit from this kind of
adventure and these pictures demonstrate some of

them.

 

 



McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

Page 18

Harold Washington Library is the most
visible one. When we went into retrofit 6,000 light
fixtures there, we came to discover that over the
last 30 years the power supplying the light fixtures
had degraded over time, and so with a relatively
simple fix to the ballast system, we were able to
get not only more efficient lighting but very much
brighter lighting, whiter lighting so that over time
people didn't really notice that the library had
turned gray and dark and now they see it as it was
originally intended, and it's a marked difference,
and people are really excited about it. Those are
kind of unintended outcomes.

What you're looking at the bottom
slide is a metal panel wall on the side of a
building that stores snow plows. Over the years
those plows had backed into that wall repeatedly and
giant gaping holes occurred in the wall, and there
was really no incentive to fix the wall because it's
extensive and we only put snowplows in there so why
touch it.

The reason to touch it is because
you're wasting a lot of energy trying to heat this

thing that has a lot of holes in it, so we were able

 

 

 

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

312-346-0911

Page 19

to actually construct a masonry wall and bring the
building back in shape purely from the energy that's
being saved.

80 those are the kinds of things that
you can get done if you reallocate your utilities.

I guess that's the point. This isn't a solve
everything kind of initiative, but the reality is
for the next 14 years instead of paying Peoples Gas
or Commonwealth Edison $116,000 a month and burning
it up and creating greenhouse gases, that money is
going to the buildings, and that's really the
ultimate goal here, so I think that really kind of
speaks for itself.

The other thing is we're getting a
lot of new technology and we're training operating
engineers on how to use it, and that's also creating
a kind of culture shift within 2PM.

MR. BEITLER: Thank you, George.

With that, we'll go to the next
project which is the CTA 4G project and turn to Mike
Mirretti.

MR. MIRRETTI: Good afternoon, everyone.
Mike Mirretti, Chicago Infrastructure Trust. We've

got several slides and we're going to go through

 

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

 

312-346-0911

Page 20

these briefly with everybody.

Now, the Trust was engaged by the CTA
in 2013 to study alternative -- arrange alternative
financing for the 4G communication system in the
subway and the tunnel.

When this is all completed, we will
be the City of Chicago will be the largest city
in North America that actually has a fully
functioning 4G system that's going to allow people
to work, improve communication capabilities as well
as just general service to the customers.

As a result of the study and the
negotiations, the wireless carriers, the four major

wireless carriers will be financing this 32 and a

half million dollars. It does not include the cost
of capital. It doesn't include the licensing
revenue. That's an ongoing revenue stream back to

the CTA and the City of Chicago. Nor does it
include the ongoing maintenance expense for the
system that would be carried by the carriers. So
that $32 million is actually a much smaller number
than the total cost savings to the City. It's much
larger.

So this is very much similar to the

 

 

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

?AN?Lver?echonl 312-346-0911

 

Page 21

slide that Claire went over, gives you a general
idea of the people who were involved in the project
on the City's side as well as the industry
stakeholders.

Nick and 1 lead this project, but I
do want to say, you know, from the perspective that
Nick was really managing the day-to?day, you know,
hand holding over the last -- since the beginning of
2013 and the end of 2014. That's a critical piece
of that.

Again, very similar, this shows the
flow of the transaction, who were the individuals,
who were the corporations that were involved and how
the money was, in essence, exchanged.

Development timeline is real high
level. We identified the major milestones for the
project over the 29?month time period. You'll see
it started in December of 2013, and the Board just
approved, and the CTA Board approved that license
agreement. We are targeted to have this solution up
and running by April of 2016.

MR. BEITLER: All right. Thank you,
Mike.

Mr. Chairman, we next plan to show

 

 

 

 

McGuire's Reporting Service - A Veritext Company

?AN?Lver?echonl 312-346-0911

Page 22

one in?process project which is the smart
streetlights project, and for that we'll turn back
to Claire Tramm.

MS. TRAMM: Hi, everyone. Okay. So if
you just turn to Page 34. I just wanted to
introduce this by saying we are very proud to have
been allowed to work across ten city sister agencies
to construct a request for information on smart
streetlights.

We look forward to presenting this
RFI very soon to the public as an indication of our
as well as the City and the Park District's very
serious interest in replacing as many of their
streetlights as possible with smart LED
streetlights.

The inventory is around 350,000 lamps
across the City; however, we'll be making it clear
in our RFI that what we are trying to do is make
this project cost effective, so investing in lights
that will pay for themselves over a period of time,
much like in Retrofit One.

So that means that we don't know

 

until we get a clear understanding of the economics

how large this project will actually be able to be

 

 

McGuire?s Reporting Service A Veritext Company

312-346-091 1

Page 23

on a self?financing basis.

So the other thing I should mention
is in addition to the energy savings that we are
hoping to leverage, we are looking to also
incorporate potential revenue drivers and additional
forms of cost savings from the smart lights as well
as other technologies and services which use
streetlights as their platform.

So we are looking at information
about things like, for instance, video cameras that
can be hung off of streetlights and can function off
of the same electricity and/or same connectivity
back end that a smart streetlight network would
function on.

So this will be coming out very
shortly. We look forward to presenting this
opportunity and to listen to the private sector,
learn what is possible for City of Chicago in terms
of a more efficient smarter and stable streetlight
system.

I think if this project moves to an
RFP phase after the current RFI phase, I think it
has immense opportunity to improve neighborhoods and

our communities across the City.

 

 

 

 

 

McGuire?s Reporting Service A Veritext Company

?AN?Lver?extconl 312-346-0911

Page 24

Page 35 just talks a little bit about
who we have had involved on the City and partner
side in the left column. We have a number of
grantors and funders that we expect to be involved
in financing the project and then industry partners.

Again the RFI is very broad in asking
for responses from anyone who may have any
information that is relevant to this project,
although we expect to be concentrated around the
types of industry partners you would see in the
right column, lighting manufacturer,
telecommunication carriers, platform services and
technology companies as well as other lighting
infrastructure companies.

So Page 36 just gives a quick screen
shot of the draft copy of this RFI, and we look
forward to releasing it in its final version
shortly. So I'm going to hand it back over to Steve
here to present the resolution for the Board.

MR. BEITLER: Mr. Chairman, a resolution
is required to adopt this project and also to
present to move forward with the RFI, so this is
the resolution.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Any questions on the

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

312?346-0911

 

Page 25

resolution or on the presentation of the lighting
project?

MS. HUBBARD: No.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: I'd be happy to
entertain a motion.

ALDERMAN I have one quick
question. These 350,000, this is streetlights,
alley lights?

MR. BEITLER: And other types of lighting
that may be in stadiums or related to the Park
District, yes.

ALDERMAN All right.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Any other questions?

MR. LINGENFELTER: Again what is the
magnitude? What do we think the cost is just from
an energy standpoint, just to put those 

MR. BEITLER: How much does it cost to
actually light all of these?

MR. LINGENFELTER: Yes.

MR. BEITLER: I don't remember. Claire,
do you have the 

MS. TRAMM: It's on the order of tens of
million of dollars a year that we are currently

spending to light the lights, and so, you know, a

 



McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

 

312-346-0911

Page 26

ten?year pay back project would be, you know, about
a hundred million dollar upfront investment, jobs,
and the project could be larger or smaller
completely depending upon again what is cost
effective.

We're approaching it in much the same

way as Retrofit One in that no taxpayer dollars will

 

I need to be leveraged for this kind of a project. It

will be entirely self-financing. That's why we're

I taking as broad an approach as possible to

understanding where other revenue drivers and other
cost savings can occur besides just the energy
savings.

MS. CAFARO: Mr. Chairman, all we're
being asked to resolve at the moment is to pursue
the project further?

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Pursue a request for
information.

MS. CAFARO: Okay. Thank you. Other
questions?

ALDERMAN Motion.

MR. ZARATE: Second.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Seconded by Miguel.

All in favor?

(A chorus of ayes.)
Any opposed?

(No response.)
Great.

MR. BETTLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

We would like next to move to the financial review,
and with that I would like to introduce Jeff Dowd
and Kate Ernst who are our auditors with CohnReznick
who will be making the audit presentation.

MR. DOWD: Good afternoon, everyone. My
name is Jeff Dowd. I'm the audit engagement partner
at CohnReznick. To my right is Kate Ernst. Kate is
the audit manager on the job. We've performed the
audit here for the last two years.

So just to give you an idea,
CohnReznick is the tenth largest accounting firm in
the nation just to give you an idea as far as size
and what we do. We have a decent size
not?for?profit practice here in the City, as far as
nationwide also performing audits of any large
not?for?profits. This is on a very smaller scale of
things as far as audits go. This is probably one of
the easiest audits you're ever going to see.

So our responsibilities are to

 

MeGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

 

312-346-0911

Page 28

express an opinion on the financial statements, to
plan and perform the audit, obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are
free from any material misstatement and assess any
risk of a material misstatement.

Materiality is determined based upon
the size of the balance sheet and the amount of
revenues that come through.

Management's responsibility here is
to prepare the financial statements in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, selection utilization of appropriate
accounting policies, design and implement and
maintain internal controls. They are also charged
with oversight of the strategic direction and
accountability of obligations.

Management is responsible for the
selection and use of appropriate account policies,

the significant account policies that are used by

the City.

We haven't included the financial
statements in the financial statements as a
whole; We just got some segmented information in
here.

Management in any financial

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

312-346-0911

 

 

Page 29

statements makes estimates and judgments in here so
not everything is exact. Anything you have to do in
a financial statement, there are estimates made.

This is to let you know we had no

difficulties encountered in performing the audit.
We had no disagreements with management also. We
had no uncorrected misstatements. So in any audit,
typically we would present audit adjustments that
would come through, and management would typically
make those adjustments as they happen. We have no
other audit findings or issues with our statements.

With the audit, at the end of the
audit, we do request representations from management
that they have given us all the information, they're
not lying to us in any way, shape or form, they
haven't hidden something. We ask that they give
that to us in writing.

This is just There's some changes
in the accounting world. I won't really bore you.
This is the standards that are going to be made in
the future here as far as revenue recognition. I
think it will allow some latitude, more flexibility
as we flex over to a change into international

accounting standards.

Page 30

Next, there's some big overhauls
coming up in the not?for?profit industry which we'll
be briefing management on as they get a little bit
closer.

So here is some segment information.
This is what the balance sheet looks like of the
Trust as of right now. As you can see, we have a
whopping balance sheet of $271,000. Like I said,
this is you're not going to get an audit any
easier than that.

There's grants receivable to the tune
of $213,000. That's all coming from the City. And
we have some bills that we'll be paying with that
grant money as it comes in.

Next slide. Here is the operating
information, so all of our money coming in is grant.
As you can see, I think the big thing here to note
would be the fact that the Trust at this point in
time is not self?sufficient. The majority is money
coming in from grant from the City. 150,000 is
service fee income which is a self?sustaining aspect
of it.

I think the goal here of management

 

is to have this thing become self?sustaining. At

 

 

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

312?346-091 

Page 31

this point it's not, but the long?term goal is that
it would. Listed below is a category of expenses.
At the end of the day, we're pushing a little bit of
a positive number.

That's it as a whole. Any questions,
comments, concerns?

The one thing that typically we do as
an audit firm is we do kind of ask management to
excuse themselves and go into a private session with
the Board to discuss any matters that they may have
as a concern or we would have as a concern. I don't
know if it's an appropriate time to do that or at
some later point in time.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: 1 think we have
executive session on the schedule later so we can go
through it at that point.

MR. DOWD: Okay.

MR. BEITLER: Mr. Chairman, the next page
is two resolutions, one to accept the audit report
and the second to allow us to prepare the annual
report which is a cover letter to the audit report.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Sorry. So the annual
report is provided as a cover to the audit report?

MR. BEITLER: Yes. It's one page. It's

 



McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

 

312-346-0911

Page 32

provided to you on the table there and was provided
in the packet that you received prior to the
meeting. So this is the one page that you have is
the cover page of the annual report.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Any questions about
the annual report?
(No response.)

What I would like to do is to go
through the rest of the financial reviews, then have
public comment and then we can go into executive
session about the audit and come back for the
resolutions, okay?

MR. BEITLER: Okay.

So then just to that point,

Mr. Chairman, the next resolution was to approve the
Forms 990 which are the tax filings for the Trust so

that I presume you would like to address in the same

manner?

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Yes.

MR. BEITLER: Okay. That completes the
staff portion of the presentation. I am aware that

there is at least one individual in the audience who
would like to make a public comment which is the

next item on the agenda.

 

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

Page 33

1 CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Okay. Great. So I

2 think it's my understanding that there haven't been

3 rules sort of governing the public comment period in
4 terms of amount of time for speakers in the past; is
5 that correct?

6 (Enter Jorge Ramirez.)

7 MR. BEITLER: That is correct. We have

8 never experienced somebody speaking so long that 

9 perhaps this is a good time to begin it.

10 CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: I was going to say I
11 guess Tom just saved that for me. Why don't we do
12 that? We'll sort of take that up, but if everyone
13 can just use their judgment and not spend more than,
14 you know, a few minutes providing your comment and
15 we'll go from there.

16 MR. MELLIS: I have copies of my

17 statement which will be brief for the court

18 reporter.

19 Good afternoon. My name,

20 Mr. Chairman and Members of the Chicago

 

21 Infrastructure Trust, is Allan Mellis. I have been
22 a Lincoln Park community leader for over 40 years.
23 I am currently retired.

and Development for the Forest Preserve District of
Cook County and 30 year IBM employee. Also, I was
the former president of the Friends of the Fullerton
Elevated and a member of the CTA Brown Line Task
Force.

For a long time I've had the idea of
a monorail that would connect the Roosevelt CTA
Superstation (Red, Green and Orange lines) with the
lakefront amenities of the Field Museum, Shedd
Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, Northerly Island and
Soldier Field.

I was the first nongovernment person
to submit a proposal to this Committee. Since it
appears that the Committee is being reconstituted, I
would like to submit my attached monorail proposal
which is attached to your handout.

In closing, I hope that the lakefront
monorail will provide an environmentally friendly
transit, nonautomobile access for our lakefront
attractions. It is clear that there needs to be an
alternative to the significant automobile congestion
that occurs today.

Thank you for your consideration.

Hope that was brief enough.

 

 

 

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

Page 35

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Thank you.

MS. CAFARO: Thank you.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Clearly I'm used to
the Council and the County Board folks that go for
quite a while.

Any other public comment?

(No response.)

No? Okay. So I think, Counsel, if
you can help give us some guidance on Executive
Session.

MR. FALK: Sure, Mr. Chairman. Under
Section of the Open Meetings Act, you are
authorized to close the session to the public should
you need to discuss certain topics that are exempt
from the Open Meetings Act as requiring public
involvement.

That would include a discussion of
compensation and financial matters as well as issues

relating to the contracts being proposed to be

'negotiated or pursued by the Trust as well as the

setting of pricing for any such matters.
Given the financial issues that
you've identified as being necessary to discuss in

closed session, I believe that meets with the

 

 

 

 



McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

312-346-0911

Page 36

requirements of Section 2(c) of the Open Meetings
Act, and if you determine to close the session to
the public, you can then convene a discussion on
those confidential matters.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Okay. Great. Does
the closing of the session require a vote or no?

MR. FALK: No, it doesn't. You can do
that from your authority.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: So I would like to go
into executive session now for us to discuss the
financial matters, the audit and contracts.

(Whereupon, the meeting was
closed to the public and
management and proceedings were
had which are transcribed under
separate cover.)

(Whereupon, the meeting was open
to the public.)

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: So there were three
motions that we were still contemplating, three
resolutions I think we're still contemplating which
were the audit annual report and the 990. I would
like to take up the audited annual report together.

Can we do that?

 

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

312-346-091 1

 

 

Page 37

1 MR. BEITLER: Mr. Chairman, may I

2 interject for one moment?

3 CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Sure.

4 MR. BEITLER: Would you prefer to do that
5 in executive session or would you prefer to come out
6 of executive session and go into public session and

7 then do the 

8 CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: I apologize. I would
9 like to come out of executive session. I thought we
10 had just done that. We're here out of executive

11 session.

12 MS. LESLIE: There's no more public.

13 CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: So I am happy to

14 entertain a motion for that resolution, for those
15 two resolutions.

16 MS. HUBBARD: So moved.

17 ALDERMAN Second.

18 CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Moved by Hubbard,

19 seconded by O'Shea. All in favor?

20 (A chorus of ayes.)

21 Any opposed?

22 (No response.)

23 Great.

24  And then the matter of the 990, we

 

 

 

 

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company
312?346-091 1

Page 38

would like to table that for the next meeting so
everyone has an ability to View it.

MS. DARLING: Can I ask you to circulate
that? I know you said you did, but can you
circulate it again?

MR. BEITLER: We will circulate it again.
There is a requirement, if I remember correctly,
that each Board member actually read the 990 and be
able to stipulate that they have done so.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Okay. Great.

MR. FALK: The only thing I would
admonish is that there's no magic to those 990s for
you to be uncomfortable with when you see them, but
they do contain some compensation information, so
there are privacy issues with it, so if you could be
cognizant of really carefully monitoring the
protection of those documents. Some of you have
hard copies.

MR. BEITLER: I will collect up
everything you leave on the desk anyway.

MS. FUNCHES: I was going to suggest
that, Steve, because the 990 actually needs some
corrections for some of the questionnaire items.

There's some nos that should be yes, so we want to

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

 

312-346-0911

Page 39

make sure you get the most accurate 990.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Even better. So are
there any other items or any thoughts 

MR. FALK: In executive session we had a
correction to the resolution to say that
compensation of benefits will be further determined
in negotiations with the Chairman and subject to the
ratification by the full Board.

MS. DARLING: Okay.

MR. LINGENFELTER: I would move the
amendment of that resolution.

MR. RAMIREZ: Seconded.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: A11 in favor?

(A chorus of ayes.)

Any opposed?

I (No response.)

Great.
MR. LINGENFELTER: It's amended.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: We're amended so
someone has to move to adopt the amended resolution.
MR. RAMIREZ: I move to adopt.

MS. HUBBARD: Second.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: All in favor?

(A chorus of ayes.)

 

 

 

McGuire's Reporting Service A Veritext Company

?AN?Lver?echonl 312-346-0911

Page 40

Any opposed?
(No response.)
Great.
If there's no other business, I would
be happy to entertain a motion to adjourn.
MS. CAFARO: I'll move it.
MR. RAMIREZ: That was like lightning.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: Before we do that, I
think just on the record I would like to say thank
you to Steve for your service for the last two and a
half years and what you've done here with the team
and with the Trust and putting us in a tremendous
position of laying the foundation for Leslie and for
all of us to follow in your vision that you and the
Mayor have had here. We really want to thank you
for your service and appreciate your fantastic
approach to helping get Leslie and all the rest of
us up to speed as we try to carry the baton. Thank
you.
MR. BEITLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
(Applause.)
ALDERMAN Can I say one more
thing? I would like to thank you for your service

to our country.

MS. CAFARO: I will still move it,
Mr. Chairman.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS: And seconded. All in
favor?
(A chorus of ayes.)
No one is opposed. Thank you all.

had in the above?entitled

cause.)
