HONORING THE REDEDICATION OF EBENEZER PRIMM TOWERS IN EVANSTON, AND
HONORING THE LEGACY OF REVEREND JACOB S. BLAKE
WHEREAS, Ebenezer Primm Towers was the first church sponsored federally funded housing project in
a major suburban area. It was rededicated on Sunday, July 30, 2017. At its rededication, the community
honored the Reverend Jacob S. Blake’s pivotal role in making Ebenezer Primm Towers a reality and the
powerful legacy of Reverend Blake and Ebenezer African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church; and
WHEREAS, for decades, prior to arriving in Evanston, Reverend Blake was a leader and a major force for
good in the region battling profound injustices, such as redlining, housing discrimination, education
inequity and busing. In Evanston, in addition to so many other issues, he worked tirelessly to establish
affordable housing for the senior citizens in Evanston, where rents were rising rapidly. The result was the
establishment of Ebenezer Primm Towers, which has a proud history that is a reflection of Reverend Blake
and his intense determination and strong leadership; and
WHEREAS, Ebenezer Primm Towers came about in an unprecedented real estate deal with Northwestern
University. Reverend Blake and Ebenezer AME Church purchased land owned by the university at 25%
below market value for $75,000.00 According to university officials, Northwestern sold the land to the
church to foster good community relations and to dispel the notion that the university only expanded in
black communities. The Northwestern Black Student Union, the Black Ensemble of Northwestern and the
African American Community in Evanston put pressure on the University to sell the land. But there was a
catch to the deal, if construction didn’t start within 24 months of the sale, Northwestern University could
buy the property back. With the clock ticking, funds were raised via several sources. The church got a loan
to buy the land and received a grant from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development
to help finance the $500,000.00 construction project. The rest was raised by the community that pulled
together to make the dream a reality; and

ensure that housing for the elderly remained a priority in Evanston, John Young, Urban Planner of Evanston
at the time worked with a committee to create a special zoning district for that purpose. Ebenezer Primm
Towers was dedicated July 1973 and residents moved in soon after; and
WHEREAS, Reverend Blake’s widow Patricia G. Blake and sons Justin S. Blake and Jacob S. Blake Jr.
were in attendance at the rededication of Ebenezer Primm Towers along with members of Ebenezer AME
