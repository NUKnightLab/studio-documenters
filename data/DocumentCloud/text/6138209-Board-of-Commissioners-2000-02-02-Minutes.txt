AGREEMENT

Transmitting a Communication, dated January 26, 2000 from
RUTH M. ROTHSTEIN, Chief, Bureau of Health Services:
This is to request authorization for Cook County to join with Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical
Center and the University of Illinois in the execution of a professional services agreement with the Lewin
Group, Falls Church, Virginia. Pursuant to the agreement, the Lewin Group will work with the County,
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center and the University of Illinois at Chicago Medical Center to
assess the advisability of a strategic alliance among the three medical institutions. The cost of this
agreement would be divided equally among the three institutions. Rush would act as paymaster to the
Lewin Group under the agreement and the County would reimburse Rush for the County's one-third share
of the total cost.
Under the terms of their engagement, the Lewin Group would work with each medical institution
separately to develop an assessment of the policy and market conditions likely to prevail over the
foreseeable future in the local health care market and to consider opportunities that might be possible by
strategic alliances. Only if a compelling case for a strategic alliance among the three institutions is
developed will further action be taken. The engagement will be structured in such a way that confidential
information regarding each institution will not be shared with the other institutions.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $55,000.00. (543-260 Account).

RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the Illinois Medical District is home to three of the nation's leading tertiary healthcare
institutions, namely Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center (founded 1837), Cook County Hospital
(founded 1847) and the University of Illinois at Chicago Medical Center (founded 1925), and
WHEREAS, these three institutions each have long, distinguished, and often intertwining histories that
have demonstrated cooperation in patient care, education, research and community service initiatives, and
WHEREAS, currently Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center and Cook County Hospital have a
Master Affiliation Agreement, for the purpose of teaching medical students, residents and fellows in
select cooperative programs, and
WHEREAS, as part of that affiliation, Rush and Cook County Hospital are collaborating on a number of
clinical services, and
WHEREAS, Rush's predecessor institution, Presbyterian-St. Luke's Hospital, and the University of
Illinois at Chicago Medical Center shared faculty and programs in an academic affiliation that endured for
nearly thirty years, from 1942 to 1969, and
WHEREAS, Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Cook County Hospital and the University of
Illinois at Chicago Medical Center have continued to individually support strong traditions of excellence
in academic medicine, and

581

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 2, 2000
WHEREAS, the current climate of health care reimbursement favors those institutions that demonstrate
clinical excellence combined with cost effective programs and services, and this climate presents a
tremendous opportunity for the effective combining of resources to create a truly world-class academic
health center on Chicago's West Side, and
WHEREAS, the physical proximity of Rush, Cook County Hospital and the University of Illinois at
Chicago Medical Center makes cost-effective collaboration both logical and feasible, and
WHEREAS, over the past several months, discussions have been underway between Cook County, the
University of Illinois at Chicago and Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center regarding improved
collaboration, and
WHEREAS, there are two primary reasons for Cook County to remain involved in these discussions:
first, to protect the critical elements of the academic and clinical partnerships currently in place between
Cook County Hospital and Rush in any reconfiguration of the medical schools, and second, to ensure that
Cook County is a beneficiary of any cost savings that may result from operati?nal consolidations, and
WHEREAS, as a full partner in the negotiations, Cook County maximizes its ability to influence an
outcome that is in the best interests of all three institutions.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of the County of Cook
endorses the active exploration of increased collaboration between these three institutions, in order to
strengthen the patient care, education, research and community service missions of these three
distinguished institutions, for the improved health of the citizens of Cook County and the State of Illinois.

Pursuant to the Illinois Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Act (ILCS 1994 ch. 710, sec. 20/1 et

for disbursement to the Dispute Resolution Centers which qualify under said Act and General Order 19 of
the Circuit Court of Cook County. Fees available for disbursement from this Fund for the year 1999 total
$211,679.00.
Upon review of applications received for funds collected in 1999, the sole qualifying applicant

County was found to be Center for Conflict Resolution. It is eligible for the maximum amount allowable
for disbursement to any Dispute Resolution Center in a given year of $200,000.00.
Pursuant to the Illinois Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Act (ILCS 1994 ch. 710, sec. 20/4) any
funds collected but not disbursed in a given year shall be paid in single county judicial circuits to the
County Treasurer for the administration of justice in the judicial circuit. An amount of $11,679.00
remains collected for the year 1999 but no Dispute Resolution Center is qualified to receive disbursement
of these funds.

Therefore, it is hereby ordered that the amount of $200,000.00, representing the maximum

to Center for Conflict Resolution.
Further, it is hereby ordered that the amount of $11,679.00 representing funds collected under

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 2, 2000
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Wednesday, January 26, 2000 at the hour of 1:00 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building,
118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
233473

OFFICE OF THE COUNTY ASSESSOR, by Terry A. Steczo, Deputy Assessor for
Administration & Intergovernmental Relations, transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with THE
BOWMARK CONSUL TING GROUP, Springfield, Illinois, for informing, monitoring and
formulating strategies and changes on legislative and executive issues.
Reason:

The Bowmark Consulting Group will monitor and review initiatives in the
Illinois Legislature that relate to the Assessor's Office and report on the potential
impact to the Assessor's Office of other legislation introduced. They will
interact with legislators and recommend strategies in areas where proposed
legislation would impact on the operations. They will also advise and assist in
intergovernmental activities/projects.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $42,000.00. Contract period: February 18, 2000 through February
17, 2001. (040-260 Account). Requisition No. 00400014.
Commissioner Hansen asked Terry Steczo, Deputy Assessor for Administration & Intergovernmental
Relations, to provide information regarding the Bowmark Consulting Group.
Mr. Steczo stated the Bowmark Consulting Group is comprised of legislative consultants and lobbyists
based in Springfield, Illinois.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the Board has been concerned about the number of lobbyists from
different constitutional offices that lobby in Springfield without the Board having knowledge of their
efforts regarding legislation. He asked Mr. Steczo for his thoughts on this scenario.
Mr. Steczo responded that communication has been received requesting all legislative agendas be
forwarded to the President's Office for review. He continued by saying this is an attempt to let other
elected officials in Cook County know exactly what the Assessor's Office intends to pursue in
Springfield. He suggested that the lobbyists representing the County Board, and those lobbyists
representing other County officials meet here or in Springfield periodically to review bills and other
activities that may be taking place that could impact the County as a whole.
Commissioner Hansen stated that Mr. Steczo had some good thoughts. He stated that any legislative
agenda that the Assessor's Office has, should be forwarded to the Cook County Board so that it could be
reviewed in the Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations Committee.
Chairman Daley commented that Commissioner Hansen has regular meetings of the Legislation and
Intergovernmental Relations Committee and the lobbyists present their reports at these meetings.
Moreover, the lobbyists present a year-end report to the Committee on Legislation and Intergovernmental
Relations outlining the status of legislation of interest to Cook County and assessing its impact.

616

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 2, 2000
Commissioner Collins stated there should be more communication between the lobbyists and the various
departments to ensure lobbying efforts are more effective.
Commissioner Silvestri suggested an office be created to better coordinate legislative agendas to foster
more communication.
Commissioner Quigley indicated that the Commissioners need to be better informed by the lobbyists.
The Commissioners would like to know more. This could be in the form of a report like "Capitol Fax"
that could be distributed to all Commissioners.
Commissioner Sutker indicated this is a very serious problem and should be addressed comprehensively.
Commissioner Sutker stated there is too much duplication of effort and lack of controls. The coordination
is critical with the President and the Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations Committee. He stated
there should be a clearinghouse of information that comes to the Commissioners, because ultimately the
Board has to vote on these matters. Commissioner Sutker concluded by saying his intention is to protect
the integrity of the County Board and the President's Administration.
Commissioner Goslin stated his support and concern about too many lobbyists from the County, and that
the message gets marginalized and is not effective. He noted the need to review the lobbyist's policy at
the County.
Commissioner Butler moved approval of Item No. 233473. Seconded by Commissioner Sutker, the
motion carried.

233474

CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT, Aurelia Pucinski, transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with LEE J.
SCHWARTZ, Chicago, Illinois, for professional services.
Reason:

Attorney Lee J. Schwartz has in his previous experience and expertise
considerable knowledge of Illinois Constitutional issues and the rights and
responsibilities of state officers. He also is familiar with the issues regarding
electronic filing and related concerns and the statutory and constitutional
requirements of the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $60,000.00. Contract period: February 1, 2000 through November
30, 2000. (360-260 Account). Requisition No. 03600701.
Commissioner Maldonado stated he looked at previous contracts dating back to 1998 for Mr. Schwartz
that was for $25,000 for the same scope of work. He noted the current request is for $60,000 and the
scope of work is the same. Commissioner Maldonado asked George Rada, Associate Clerk for Public
Policy of the Clerk of the Circuit Court's Office, if the increase in the amount is justified and if the scope
of work has changed?
Mr. Rada indicated that the scope of work has not changed, but in 1998 the contract was for less than half
a year.
Commissioner Maldonado asked what is the hourly fee?
Mr. Rada responded the hourly fee is $175.00.

617

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 2, 2000
Commissioner Maldonado stated that on October 20, 1999, the Clerk of the Circuit Court went to court
and asked for the court to appoint Mr. Schwartz as a Special State's Attorney to represent her on litigation
against the County.
Chairman Daley asked Mr. Patrick Driscoll, Deputy State's Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, to
respond.
Mr. Driscoll stated that litigation wherein Mr. Schwartz was appointed by the court to represent Clerk
Pucinski in her suit against the County of Cook (Pucinski v. County of Cook) is pending in the Illinois
Supreme Court. That is a separate matter whereby Mr. Schwartz is compensated by the County of Cook
through a court order. Any compensation in that case would be independent of any contractual
compensation in this item. It is a separate funding matter.
Commissioner Moreno noted there appears to be a conflict in this matter. He asked Mr. Rada to respond.
Mr. Rada responded that he could not speak to the issue regarding the Special State's Attorney.
Commissioner Moreno asked if the electronic filing process has been approved by the Office of the Chief
Judge or the judicial system?
Mr. Rada stated this has been an issue before the Supreme Court's Electronic Records Committee, on
which the Clerk serves. The Clerk relies on Mr. Schwartz for advice in matters that would affect
electronic filing.
Commissioner Steele asked what is the process of selecting a consultant in the Clerk's Office?
Mr. Rada stated that the Clerk was aware of Mr. Schwartz's constitutional knowledge and legal expertise
in this field.
Commissioner Moreno asked if there is a conflict of interest between Mr. Schwartz's role in the litigation
and his role as a consultant.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that professional services contracts require greater scrutiny. He further
stated that the reasons provided for professional services should be more specific as to the scope of
services.
Commissioner Silvestri asked the State's Attorney's Office to provide a statement as to whether there is a
conflict of interest.
Mr. Driscoll stated that he would like to review the last contract before rendering a legal opinion.
Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Moran, moved to approve Item No. 233474.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, move to amend the motion to approve
Item No. 233474 contingent upon an opinion being tendered by the State's Attorney's Office
regarding a potential conflict of interest. The motion carried.

DUPLICATE TAX BILL FEE ORDINANCE (PROPOSED ORDINANCE). Submitting a
Proposed Ordinance sponsored by John H. Stroger, Jr., President, Cook County Board of
Commissioners; Co-Sponsored by John P. Daley, County Commissioner:
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance:
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
Duplicate Tax Bill Fee
Whereas, the Governor signed into law Public Act 91-551 on August 14, 1999 amending the
Property Tax Code, 35 ILCS 200/20-12, authorizing a fee for duplicate copies of tax bills;
and

620

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 2, 2000
Whereas, Public Act 91-551 provides that the County Collector, upon approval by the County
Board, shall assess a fee of up to $5 for each duplicate tax bill provided to any mortgage
lender who is not the property owner of record; and
Whereas, said Public Act 91-551 provides that all amounts collected as payment for a
duplicate tax bill by the County Collector shall be deposited into the Tax Sale Automation
Fund; and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED, by the Board of Cook County Con;imissioners as
follows:
Section 1. "Mortgage Lender" shall be defined as any institution, association, partnership,
corporation, or person that is engaged in the business of making loans of money, or that
regularly makes loans of money, or that services loans, including the collections of loans
directly secured by mortgages, trust deeds in the nature of mortgages or other instruments in
the nature of mortgages, which constitutes a lien upon property.
Section 2. The County Collector shall charge and collect from all Mortgage Lenders, a fee
of $5.00 for each duplicate real estate tax bill provided to any Mortgage Lender who is not
the record owner of the subject property. The fee of $5.00 shall be charged and collected at
the time that each duplicate tax bill is ordered.
Section 3. The County Collector shall deposit all fees collected under this ordinance into the
Tax Sale Automation Fund.
Section 4.

This ordinance shall take effect immediately upon its passage and approval.

Commissioner Hansen asked if the issue has been resolved regarding someone evading this proposed
ordinance in order to obtain duplicate tax bills.
Peter Karahalios, Legal Counsel/First Deputy Treasurer, answered that administrative rules will be
created to address safeguards to collect the money necessary from mortgage lenders. This will help to
avoid the problem of fee evasion.
Commissioner Maldonado's concern is that mortgage companies might pass the $5.00 fee to their
borrowers. He asked if there will be any precautions in place to avoid this and if the County can make
certain the fee is not passed to the borrower.
Mr. Karahalios responded to Commissioner Maldonado's question stating the Treasurer's electronic
filling program has no fee.
Commissioner Maldonado asked why was this Ordinance necessary?
Mr. Karahalios responded that the Treasurer's Office received a large number ofrequests from mortgage
lenders seeking duplicate tax bills, and the costs became burdensome for the Office.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired if a copy of the tax bill is sent to the mortgage lender and a duplicate
copy sent to the customer?
Mr. Karahalios replied that the tax bill is sent to the address directed by the taxpayer, whether it is to
themselves or to the mortgage lender.

621

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 2, 2000
Commissioner Sutker stated often the mortgage company does not get the tax bill from the residential
property owner. He said the mortgage companies frequently have trouble getting the tax bill from the
mortgagee.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the estimated annual revenue?
Mr. Karahalios responded the estimated annual revenue is $1,000,000.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the mortgage lender would be asked to certify that they are the lender of
record?
Mr. Karahalios responded in the affirmative to Commissioner Hansen's inquiry.
Commissioner Hansen suggested all property owners should receive a tax bill.
Mr. Karahalios responded that the bill goes to either the mortgage lender or the owner.
Commissioner Hansen stated that perhaps a study of the fiscal impact of sending a tax bill to every
property owner should be done.
Chairman Daley stated that the Treasurer's Office would study the request and report back to the Finance
Committee Chairman.
Commissioner Butler stated the importance of the duplicate tax bill is to make certain the taxes are paid in
order to avoid possible sale of the taxes.
Chairman Daley stated that the State's Attorney's Office has reviewed this ordinance along with Patricia
Shymanski, from the President's Office. He noted the ordinance is permitted under Illinois Statutes.
Commissioner Maldonado moved approval of Item No. 233484.
Moreno. The motion carried.

annual and scavenger tax sales.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED, by the Board of Cook County Commissioners as follows:

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a communication, dated January 10, 2000:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for the Purchasing Agent to advertise for
bids for the removal of waste soil at the Robbins Clinic site. It is respectfully requested that
this Honorable Body approve this request.
Approximately 6000 cubic yards of waste soil was taken from the excavation at the Robbins
site and stockpiled. This soil must be removed and the site restored. This work was not part
of the general construction contract.
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.
*Referred to the Construction Committee on 1-20-00.

Commissioner Silvestri asked ifthe land in Robbins was owned by the County?
Michael LaMont stated that the land was purchased for one dollar from the Village of Robbins.
Commissioner Silvestri asked ifthe County knew there was debris on the land before it was purchased?

676

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 2, 2000
Commissioner Collins stated that she understood Commissioner Silvestri's concern because there is a lot
of land available that may have debris which is very expensive to clean up.
Michael LaMont stated that a subsurface investigation was conducted on the property prior to construction.
The investigation was done to determine if there were any environmental conditions underground. The
report indicated there was nothing out of the ordinary except a lot of debris, concrete and tires. He further
stated the best way to remove the debris is to bid to receive the best competitive price.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if there is any liability on the company that reviewed the land?
Michael LaMont stated that he did not think so because the company based their findings on samples that
came up from the drill rig and this type of debris was not encountered in the testing program.
Commissioner Silvestri asked the size of the land?
Michael LaMont responded approximately 30,000 square feet.

Commissioner Butler moved approval of Item 233478. Seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, the
motion carried.
Commissioner Silvestri voted present on the above item.
233479

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a communication, dated January 7, 2000:

Project. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
This contract will provide for general systems administration/coordination, data center

Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

*Referred to the Construction Committee on 1-20-00.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if this request is part of the original budget?
Michael LaMont responded that the request is part of the original budget.
Commissioner Hansen asked ifthe request is part of the $301 million construction budget?
Michael LaMont stated that this contract is a consulting service contract and not part of the construction
contract.

677

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 2, 2000
Commissioner Hansen asked where does the request fit into the table provided at the last Construction
committee meeting?
Michael LaMont stated that the request is part of the budget that was approved by the Board in June, 1994
for $642 million.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the amount of $642 million was turned down by the State, so it is not
valid.
Michael LaMont stated that the result of these consulting services will be contracts to purchase a LAN
System, design a data center and an audiovisual system.
Commissioner Hansen stated that he doesn't see where the item was approved by the Board as part of the
·
budget.
Michael LaMont responded that the consulting services fall within the line item for architectural and
engineering fees included in the $589 million budget approved by the State of Illinois and the County
Board.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the Commissioners received a copy of the RFP?
Michael LaMont said the County Board did not receive a copy of the RFP because the request was made
much earlier.
Commissioner Hansen asked if any of the consulting work would impact any completed construction?
Michael LaMont responded the consulting work would not impact completed construction.
Commissioner Sutker asked where did the $589 million figure emanate?
Michael LaMont stated the amount originally submitted to the State Planning Board was $589 million and
what was approved was $551 million, the difference being the major medical equipment not approved at
that time. The County was told to come back later when the project was further along and when the
County was ready to purchase the equipment to receive approval for additional funding.
Commissioner Sutker requested that Mr. LaMont submit a document regarding the budget figures for the
construction of the New Cook County Hospital.
Michael LaMont responded that he will provide the information to the Commissioners.
Commissioner Hansen stated that he would like exact budgetary figures and dates the County Board
approved budget items.

be placed in the Daley Center which will increase traffic by about 5,000 people daily.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the Public Building Commission will be able to handle the traffic increase?
Pat Hurley responded the Public Building Commission has been working very closely with Facilities
Management to handle the increased traffic. Mr. Hurley also indicated that additional security is necessary.
Commissioner Hansen asked how much traffic currently goes through the pedway?
Pat Hurley responded that approximately 35,000 to 40,000 people come through on a rainy day and about

OLD BUSINESS
I. Skokie Garage Project, August Mauro, Joint Venture, Program Manager, gave the Commissioners an
overview of the Skokie garage project.

Commissioner Hansen asked if it is possible to hold original contractor liable?
Patricia Shymanski stated that this matter was heavily litigated back in the early 1980s. The County was
represented by an outside counsel, a lawsuit was filed and it was the subject of a very protracted litigation
that was ultimately settled and approved by the County Board. She further stated that the County has
attempted to retrieve from the warehouse the files of that litigation from the County warehouse but the
files were disposed of some years ago. The file closed in 1983 or 1984 and the County is attempting to
obtain records from other sources.
Ms. Shymanski concluded by saying she will discuss the matter with State's Attorney Driscoll and
provide a report to the Commissioners at the next Construction meeting.
Commissioner Hansen stated this raises the question of the need for long-term liability regarding any
structures, to be incorporated as part of any contracts as well as the need to cover the County.
Michael LaMont stated that once the examination is completed at the Skokie garage, the Committee will
receive a report, and based on that report, the County will have to proceed with repair of the garage. Mr.
LaMont informed the committee the repair of the garage is beyond what was in the scope of the current
construction contract.
Commissioner Sutker asked if the County should close the garage?
August Mauro stated that he would like Peter Kolfto respond to the question.
Peter Kolf, Senior Structural Engineer, Construction Technology Laboratories, Inc., stated that prior to
submitting the proposaf to do the work, Constructional Technology Laboratories, Inc., did a visual
inspection of the garage. He stated that as a licensed professional, if he saw a condition that appeared
hazardous, he would bring it to the attention of County Boards attention. Mr. Kolf indicated that at this
point, nothing has been seen that appears hazardous. He said as the inspection progresses, and if
something does come to light, the Board will be immediately notified.

680

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 2, 2000
Commissioner Sutker asked when was the garage investigated?
Peter Kolf stated that the garage is currently being investigated.
Commissioner Hansen said it is very reassuring to hear from the structural engineer that if they find
anything hazardous they will immediately inform the project director and who in turn will inform through
Mr. LaMont, President Stroger and immediate action will be taken to correct the problems.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the Committee was to receive a report on the square footage of storage
at the various locations.
Michael LaMont responded he will provide the information by the next meeting.
Chairman Carr stated the next Construction Committee meeting will be held on February 23, 2000 at the
New Cook County Hospital trailer.
PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT- JANUARY 18, 2000
Commissioner Hansen asked a question in regard to the new UPS system and possible water table
pressure.
Michael LaMont stated that the UPS for the telephone switch gear is made in two components, the UPS
itself that goes on when the power goes out, and is located next to the telephone switch gear on the eleventh
floor. He said the only part of the project the first basement is actually the wiring that goes down to the
emergency generator. Mr. LaMont further said the hook up from the UPS is merely wiring to connect into
the generator switch gear down in the basement. He reiterated that the UPS will not be in the basement.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the basement is a good place for the generator?
Michael LaMont stated that there are three sub-basements in the County Building. He said there are
major sump pumps below that level so that whenever there is water infiltration into the building, it goes to
the sump pumps and pumped out. He further stated that he does not believe the County currently has a
problem with where the generator is located.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the floor to ceiling distance in the first basement?
Michael LaMont stated that he is not sure of the distance but said it might be between ten and fourteen
feet.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the intended use for buildings two and five on the South Campus,
Phase IIB?
Michael LaMont stated that the Day Reporting Center needs an expansion, and electronic monitoring is
going to move from its current location and classrooms will be added.
Commissioner Hansen requested a memorandum on the projected usage of the buildings at the South
Campus.
Michael LaMont suggested that Dave Devane of the Sheriffs Office attend a Construction Committee
meeting to provide the committee a report.

681

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 2, 2000
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the estimated completion date of the escalator at the Second District
Courthouse?
Michael LaMont responded that the contract completion date should be within sixty days or less.
Commissioner Hansen asked what pressure levels does the County have to be concerned within the
second and third basements? The Commissioner requested a memo from Soodan and Associates in
regard to this matter.
Michael LaMont stated that he will contact Soodan and Associates to provide a response to the
Commissioner's concern.
Commissioner Hansen asked for a report on the MIS applications that are going to run on the Structured
Wiring System.
Michael LaMont responded he will provide the report.
