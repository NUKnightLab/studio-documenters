Action Items
A.

Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #4)

Jeff McCutchan, Interim General Counsel, provided an overview of the request presented for the Board’s consideration.
He stated that this is an agreement for CCHHS to take part in a nationwide program that allows for the sharing of research
data among hospitals and research institutions around the country. There is no cost associated with the agreement; it is
being presented to the Board for consideration because the agreement contains an indemnification provision, which
requires approval by the Board. Every participant in the agreement is going to indemnify all of the other participants in
case a party is responsible for some type of breach. He stated that, as a condition of CCHHS’ participation in this
agreement, Corporate Compliance and the Office of the General Counsel are going to establish a policy to ensure that
there will be no such breach before any data leaves this System that could possibly contain Protected Health Information
(PHI).
Director Richardson-Lowry stated that the concept associated with this initiative is very solid; however, in terms of the
indemnification aspect, her approval would be conditioned on exactly what Mr. McCutchan has articulated, which is
putting together a policy to minimize the exposure. Mr. McCutchan added that anytime PHI is shared with any person or
entity, there is a very specific data use agreement that has to be signed-off on by Corporate Compliance; that will
absolutely be an integral part of the policy that will be put in place.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Lerner, moved the approval of request number 1
under the Contracts and Procurement Items, which is a request to negotiate and execute an
agreement to join PCORnet with Duke University Clinical Research Institute and Harvard
Pilgrim Health Care Institute, with the condition that no Protected Health Information be
transmitted pursuant to this agreement until a policy is in place governing the institution for the
use. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B.

Appointment of Stroger Hospital Department Chair(s) and Division Chair(s) (Attachment #5)
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Velasquez, moved the approval of the proposed
Stroger Hospital Division Chair appointments. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Report from Chairman of the Board
A.

Quarterly report on Board and Committee meeting attendance by Directors and members of Committees

VI.

Report from Chairman of the Board (continued)
Director Estrada stated that he and Directors Richardson-Lowry and Gugenheim visited the Cermak facility a couple of
weeks ago. In light of this Board’s work and in terms of the Strategic Plan, moving forward, he thinks it is important
for every Board Member to visit one of the facilities, whether it is a hospital or clinic, perhaps every quarter. He stated
that visits like this can be eye-opening, and provides a different perspective. He noted that the Board has received
testimony recently from the Pediatric Emergency Room nurses; he would like to suggest, at least for himself, that a visit
be scheduled for that area. Chairman Hammock responded that it is an excellent suggestion; he added that perhaps a
tentative quarterly schedule for such visits can be set in the upcoming months.
Director Gugenheim stated that, as metrics on Board attendance are currently presented, she would like to visit the idea
of perhaps self-evaluating how this governing body operates as a Board. Chairman Hammock responded that he thinks
that is an idea well worth considering.

VII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (Attachment #7)
Dr. Shannon provided an update on several subjects; detail is included in Attachment #7.

VIII. Recommendations, Discussion / Information Item
A.

Strategic planning discussion

Topic: Strategic Plan Overview 2017-2019, presented by Dr. Shannon (Attachment #8)

draft of the strategic plan, and input and comments from Directors have been received to date. A special meeting of the
Board has been scheduled for July 11th for further discussion and input from Directors, and the draft strategic plan is
expected to be released to the public on July 15th seeking comments; following that, the plan is to approve the final
strategic plan on July 29th. Dr. Shannon stated that all input and recommendations received to date from Directors,
including that from communications with Directors and what is discussed at today’s meeting and the meeting scheduled
for July 11th, will be considered and incorporated into the draft that is expected to be released on July 15th.

RE: Request to negotiate and execute an Agreement between Duke University
Clinical Research Institute and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute

Respectfully requesting approval by the Board of Directors ofthe Cook County Health and Hospitals
System to negotiate and execute an Agreement beginning july 1, 2016 between 
Duke University Clinical Research Institute and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute.

Execution of this Agreement will allow to join the National Patient Centered
Clinical Research Network initiative ofthe Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute 
includes over 80 healthcare institutions at 13 geographic locations throughout the US.
The initiative was undertaken to efficiently evaluate patient outcomes across different approaches
to treatment without the need for clinical trials, to recruit patients for clinical trials, and to assess
outcomes for common and rare conditions across diverse patient populations throughout the US.

Earlier this year, joined all the major academic medical centers in the Chicago region, the
Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, and Alliance of Chicago to form the network. Initial
projects were to evaluate patients who had asthma, sickle cell anemia, a recurrent intestinal
infection seen primarily in hospital patients (C. di??icile infection), and low blood counts. These first
projects were observational studies that focused on patient reported outcomes, such as quality of
life. This agreement to join is the next phase of the project.

JOHN JAY SHANNON, MD

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

COOK COUNTY HEALTH HOSPITALS SYSTEM
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

June 24, 2016

 

Recognition

The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Illinois Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC) program
honored Dr. Stathis Poulakidas, the Chair of Burn and Wound Services at John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital, with a special
pediatric care Clinical Excellence Award for his contributions to childhood care. The Ron W. Lee, MD. Excellence in
Pediatric Care Awards are given annually by IDPH and EMSC to recognize those dedicated to pediatric emergency care
and childhood injury prevention initiatives.

"Dr. Poulakidas? medical research, training programs, care for burn victims, and his work to raise awareness about burn
prevention show his dedication to children?s health,? said IDPH Director Nirav D. Shah, M.D., 1.0. in a recent press
release, am honored to award Dr. Poulakidas the Ron W. Lee, MD. Excellence in Pediatric Care Clinical Excellence
Award.?

The Ron W. Lee, MD. Excellence in Pediatric Care awards are presented each May. Dr. Lee was the medical director for
the Division of Emergency Medical Services and Highway Safety at IDPH, as well as the director of emergency medicine
at Loyola University Medical Center and was instrumental in establishing and fostering the EMSC program in Illinois. He
passed away in 1998.

Patient Experience Recognition
The following story illustrates the impact care management is having on our patients.

Recently, a 58 year old CountyCare member who resides with his daughter on southwest side was referred to the care
management team. Due to physical limitations, he has not been able to work and receives public financial assistance. He
was ?hopeless? regarding employment and housing. He was awaiting a court date for disability; was told he would not
qualify to have his broken eyeglasses replaced for a year and that his dental repair request was denied.

Our team assisted the individual with resources to research the process for applying for disability and reassured him that
all was being done appropriately to assist him. He was given vision and dental contact information to make an
appointment for services; as a result, he now has eyeglasses on order and has had his tooth repaired. Recently, he was
contacted by a Community Health Worker for assistance with housing. He is now receiving care for
depression and reports being compliant with his medications at this time. He contacts his RN Care Coordinator to assist
him as needed and expresses how appreciative he is during each contact.

On June 21, 2016, CountyCare hosted its FY16 Quarter CountyCare Enrollee Advisory Committee Meeting at
the offices of C4 (Community Counseling Centers of Chicago) in Chicago?s Uptown neighborhood. Fifteen
CountyCare members attended the event reflecting the multicultural nature of the Uptown Community. Most
of the CountyCare members in attendance receive their primary care through Heartland Health Outreach. A
couple of members utilize the Stroger and Fantus facilities while others reported getting their specialty
care at Swedish Covenant Hospital. All members reported being quite happy with the plan and its offerings.
These events provide staff with an opportunity to address individual concerns around things like transportation
and accessing services but also signal common themes that can be addressed in member mass communications.

Effective July 10th, the Immediate Care Center at Oak Forest Health Center will be open from 7:OOam 
10:30pm. The system is planning to offer pediatric services at the ICC later this year and is contemplating the

Legislative Update

State
0

Federal

The General Assembly adjourned on May 31 without passing a comprehensive state budget for FY17. The House
and Senate do not currently have session days scheduled in the summer, but may be called back to Springfield
by legislative leaders at any time.

Prior to adjourning, the House and Senate passed 582038 with bipartisan support. $32038 provides $700 million
in "stopgap" funding to human and social services agencies for work that they have already delivered in the
current state fiscal year, which ends on June 30. Services include home visiting programs, homeless youth
services, supportive housing, substance use treatment, and mental health. The legislation awaits action by the
Governor.

Earlier this month, a status hearing was held on the Beeks and Memisovski consent decrees, which require
Illinois to continue to pay Medicaid providers and health plans even in absence of a state budget. At the hearing,
the Attorney General?s office indicated that if a budget for FY17 is not enacted by July 1, 2016, the State would
agree to a new court order to continue making payments to Medicaid providers in FY17. The next status hearing
is scheduled for July 6, 2016.

On June 13, 2016 and Cook County participated in a Data-Driven Justice Initiative sponsored by the
White House?s Office of Science, Technology and Policy (OSTP). The workshop brought together leaders from
local jurisdictions, healthcare, law enforcement, social service providers, private foundations and tech
companies to discuss innovative ways to reduce incarceration of super utilizers, many with mental illness, and
improve outcomes using data.

The House and Senate are currently working on their annual appropriations bills. The House has not released an
HHS Appropriations bill, but the Senate has introduced 5. 3040. This bill was reported by the Senate Committee
on Appropriations in a bi-partisan vote and now goes to the full Senate. The Senate bills contains $261 million
to fight opioid abuse which is an $126 million increase from FY 2016. 5.3040 also contains funding for cancer
prevention, immunizations, polio eradication and mental health programs.

This month House speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), and other House Republicans, are expected to introduce a new
health care plan that will include a per capita cap for Medicaid. Details have not yet been released on this
proposal, and it is unclear what, if any actions will be taken on this bill this year. The issue of concern with the
legislation is that it could be introduced again next year with a new Congress.

The House and Senate Joint Conference Committee addressing emergency Zika funding began negotiations this
week. Senator Mark Kirk is a member of the Joint Conference. The President had requested $1.98 in
emergency funding, but neither the House nor the Senate passed bills with that amount of funding. The Senate
passed a bill with $1.18 in funding and the House passed a bill containing The President has announced
that he would veto the House passed legislation as it only one third of the money requested and, unlike the
Senate bill, this money would be reallocated from existing public health funding including efforts to fight Ebola.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for at both the State and Federal level.
