MINUTES OF THE REGULAR MEETING
OF THE
COMMISSIONERS OF THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
March 20, 2012
The Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority held its Regular Meeting of the Board of
Commissioners on Tuesday, March 20, 2012 at approximately 8:40 a.m. at the CHA Corporate
Offices, 60 East Van Buren, 12th Floor Loft in Chicago, IL.
Chairwoman Z. Scott called the meeting to order and upon roll call, those present and absent
were as follows:
Present:
Deverra Beverly
Dr. Mildred Harris
Myra King
Carlos Ponce
Z. Scott
Sandra Young
Absent:

Adela Cepeda
Mark Cozzi
Bridget Reidy

Also present were Charles Woodyard, Chief Executive Officer; Kris Warren, Chief of Staff;
Scott Ammarell, General Counsel; Chicago Housing Authority Staff Members and the General
Public.
There being a quorum present, the meeting duly convened and business was transacted as
follows:
Upon Motion made and properly seconded, the Commissioners adjourned to Executive Session.
Chairwoman Scott, announced that pursuant to the Open Meetings Act, 5 ILCS 120/2, the Board
would adjourn for approximately one hour to possibly discuss pending, probable or imminent
litigation, personnel related matters, collective negotiating matters, purchase sale and lease of
real estate property; establishment of reserves and settlement of claims.
The Commissioners subsequently reconvened in Open Session and Chairwoman Scott thereupon
convened the Business and Public portion of the meeting.
Chairwoman Scott announced that Board members are aware of the letter from HUD dated
January 5, 2012 on Section 3 findings. Per Chairwoman Scott, CHA is reviewing and
developing a formal response from the Board and the CHA.
Upon Motion made by Commissioner Ponce and properly seconded by Commissioner Harris, the
Executive Session Minutes February 21, 2012 were unanimously approved.
According to Chairwoman Scott, on Wednesday, March 14th, the day of the regularly scheduled
Committee Meetings, several Commissioners were either scheduled to be out of town, had last
minute changes on their schedule or were under the weather. Committee Meetings were
therefore cancelled due to quorum issues. Commissioner Scott continued by saying that items,
scheduled to come before the Board for consideration, will therefore be introduced separately
and staff will provide the Board with a brief description of the recommended action. After
Commissioners have had an opportunity to ask questions, the general public will be given an
opportunity to ask questions on the specific item being presented. General comments by the
public will be entertained later in the Public Session portion of the Agenda.
(Item No. 1)
The resolution for Item No. 1 approves award of contracts to First Specialty Insurance, Illinois
Union and Allied World Assurance Company, for the Private Managers Insurance Program’s
(PMIP) General Liability, Excess Liability, and Umbrella Liability coverages. PMIP is a CHA

 controlled insurance program that ensures that the Authority has the necessary insurance
protection for general liabilities associated with the management of its housing portfolio. This
program provides the most cost effective insurance solution for the portfolio, while maintaining
coverage standards that are difficult for property management firms to procure individually. All
costs associated with the program (i.e. insurance premiums, claim and broker administration
fees), are deducted from the participating Private Property Management Firm’s operating
budgets. In recent years, both AON, the HUD approved Broker of Record, and CHA Risk
Management has made concerted efforts to increase the marketability of the Authority’s PMIP
program to insurers. Property tours were conducted with underwriters; portfolio composition
information was presented in formats previously unavailable; and, internal claims information
and analysis were provided to the insurers. As the Plan For Transformation matures, along with
improving claims experience, implementation and focus on risk control programs, the CHA
should benefit in future renewals as insurers become more comfortable with CHA exposures.
Aon directly and indirectly (through one wholesaler) solicited requests for insurance premium
quotes from 18 insurance carriers in January 2012. The incumbent general liability carrier, First
Specialty, was the only insurance company to submit a premium quote for the general liability
primary coverage layer, but also expanded coverage for certain pollution perils with a slight
decrease in pricing for the contract year about to expire. All other insurers declined to provide
premium quotes for CHA’s PMIP due to the class of business (multi-family and public housing),
inability to meet expiring pricing or non-competitive retention levels. The incumbent carrier for
the excess liability layer, Illinois Union, offered to renew at the same premium amount and was
also the only insurer to provide a quote for this layer of coverage. CHA received two quotes for
the Umbrella Liability layers. The recommended awardee AWAC offered the existing coverage
at a $10,000 savings. The aggregate total premium is $1,203,832, representing an overall
decrease of 1.4% in premium costs for the PMIP program from the previous contract year.
Commissioner Young then presented a Motion for the approval of the resolution for Item A1:
RESOLUTION NO. 2012-CHA-17

(Item No. 2)
The resolution for Item No. 2 approves the submittal of the FY2011 Moving To Work Annual
Report to HUD. Under the MTW Agreement, CHA is required to produce and submit an Annual
Report to HUD outlining the progress toward commitments made in the original Plan for
Transformation and each Annual Plan. HUD requires this report to be submitted annually, along
with a Board of Commissioners’ resolution approving this report, no later than 90 days after the

 end of CHA’s fiscal year. CHA must submit the FY2011 MTW Annual Report to HUD on
March 30, 2012. The FY2011 MTW Annual Report provides information necessary for HUD to
assess CHA’s performance in 2011 regarding both day-to-day operations and activities
authorized by the MTW Demonstration Program. The FY2011 MTW Annual Report is included
with this resolution for the Board of Commissioners’ review and approval.

(Item No. 3)
In December 2011 the CHA advertised a Request for Proposal (RFP) to solicit consultants and/or
firms to implement CHA’s Learn and Earn summer youth program, a six-week academic
enrichment and career exploration program for CHA youth, ages 13-15. The RFP was advertised
in area newspapers, the CHA website, and BuySpeed. The CHA also directly solicited 159
firms, including 23 MBE/WBE/DBE firms. The CHA received and evaluated the five proposals
received. After the Evaluation Committee completed its analysis of the proposals, a competitive
range was set and approved by the Contracting Officer, and 4 firms were found to be within the
competitive range, and oral presentations were scheduled. During these meetings, negotiations
were held and best and final offers were submitted by each firm. Based upon the evaluations of
the written proposals, oral presentations and best and final offers, it was determined that Catholic
Charities, SER, Summer Advantage and UCAN will provide the best overall service and value to
CHA. The average cost per participant of the program will be approximately $2,000. Based on
experience, it is necessary to maintain a ratio of 1:10 (instructors to youth) in the Program, with
62% of the per participant cost being dedicated to wages for teachers and support staff. The
impetus for the Program arose in 2008 when several CHA Commissioners raised concerns that
youth in this age group lacked opportunities during the summer because they are too old for
Chicago Park District summer camps and too young for summer employment. The Program was
piloted in 2008 for 140 CHA youth. In 2009, the Program was expanded to accommodate 310
participants. Learn and Earn was increased to the current 700 slots in 2010 and 2011 (721 youth
enrolled in 2011). The four selected Contractors have a unique combination of experience with
the Program. Catholic Charities will operate the Program at Malcolm X College and Kennedy
King College for 200 CHA youth. In 2011, DFSS also selected Catholic Charities as a new
Learn and Earn provider and they were satisfied with their performance. UCAN will operate the
Program at Olive Harvey College for 180 CHA youth. UCAN has been a Learn and Earn
provider since the program’s inception in 2008. DFSS and CHA have been satisfied their

 performance. SER will operate the Program at Dawson Tech and Harold Washington College
for 200 CHA youth. SER has also been a Learn and Earn provider since the program’s inception
and DFSS and CHA have been satisfied with their performance. Summer Advantage will
operate the Program at Truman College and West Side Tech for 120 CHA youth. Summer
Advantage has received national recognition for a similar summer enrichment program
implemented across the country, including within several charter schools in Chicago. In 2011,
DFSS selected Summer Advantage to implement the curriculum for all Program sites. CHA will
also be utilizing Summer Advantage to implement the curriculum and conduct pre- and post-tests
at all Program sites.
Commissioner Young then introduced a Motion for the approval of the following resolution for
Item No. 3.
RESOLUTION NO. 2012-CHA-19
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated March 14, 2012, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER

ADVANTAGE NETWORK TO IMPLEMENT THE LEARN AND EARN
SUMMER YOUTH PROGRAM”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into cost reimbursement contracts for a one year term, with 3 1year options, with: (1) Catholic Charities in an amount not-to-exceed $386,920
for the initial term; (2) SER in an amount not to exceed $400,000 for the initial
term; (3) Summer Advantage in an amount not to exceed $283,772 for the initial
term; and (4) UCAN in an amount not to exceed $350,709 for the initial term, to

(Item No. 4)
In June 2011, the Board of Commissioners authorized the CHA to acquire 515 West Oak Street,
Chicago, Illinois as part of ongoing redevelopment and revitalization efforts on and around the
former Cabrini-Green public housing sites. The 0.225-acre site includes an abandoned and
deteriorating church building that has sat vacant for approximately ten years. The site lies
directly to the north of the Cabrini Row Houses. The CHA has worked with the City’s Building
Department to work out a schedule for demolition. Demolition must commence by May 31,
2012 or the City’s Building Department could start to assess fines. Accordingly, in December
2011, CHA advertised an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for demolition services to raze the building.
The IFB was advertised in area newspapers, on the CHA website and on BuySpeed Online. Of
the three bids received, staff held a pre-award survey/clarification meeting with the apparent low
bidder, N.F. Demolition, Inc. and has determined that N.F. Demolition is the lowest responsive
and responsible bidder at $220,535.00.
Commissioner Ponce then introduced a Motion for the approval of Item No. 4.
RESOLUTION NO. 2012-CHA-20
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 14,
2012, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH
N.F. DEMOLITION, INC. FOR DEMOLITION AT 515 W. OAK STREET”;

 THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a contract with N.F. Demolition, Inc. in the amount of
$220,535.00 for demolition services at 515 W. Oak Street in Chicago, IL. Work is
to be completed by no later than ninety (90) calendar days from the date set forth
in the Notice to Proceed.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance
requirements.

The Motion to approve Item No. 4 was seconded by Commissioner Young and the voting was as

(Item No. 5)
The CHA advertised an Invitation for Bid (IFB) on December 5, 2011 for Envelope
Improvements for Water Infiltration at Daniel H. Burnham Apartments (1930 W. Loyola). The
IFB was advertised in area newspapers, on the CHA website and on BuySpeed Online. Of the
four bids received and opened, the apparent low bidder was Friedler Construction Co. Staff has
completed its own review of the bid materials and determined that Friedler Construction Co. is
the lowest responsive and responsible bidder at $1,703,800.00. Daniel Hudson Burnham
Apartments is a 181-unit senior housing building located at 1930 West Loyola in Chicago,
Illinois. The building was constructed in 1984. Shortly after construction, the building began to
experience water infiltration issues, and those issues have persisted over the course of the
building’s life. The CHA has contracted with a number of design and construction firms over
the years to eliminate the problems. While the problem has been mitigated by these efforts,
water infiltration has not been completely eliminated. In 2011, the CHA engaged the
architectural firm of Holabird & Root to investigate the infiltration issues. Through exploratory
demolition of several exterior wall assemblies, including window assemblies, the parties
discovered areas around the window assemblies that lack sufficient flashing, a waterimpermeable barrier that prevents moisture from entering the interior of the building. Prior
investigations had not uncovered this issue. Holabird & Root, under the supervision of the CHA,
designed a solution that includes additional flashing at the intersection of the window assembly
and brick façade. The parties then conducted extensive water spray testing to assess the
solution’s effectiveness. The results indicate the solution will eliminate any remaining water
infiltration. The existing windows are at the end of their useful life. So, rather than removing
the existing window assemblies, implementing the solution, then reinstalling the current
windows, CHA staff believes the process should include the installation of new windows.
The construction duration will be eight months. It will involve phasing but no relocation of the
residents. The General Contractor will coordinate construction activities with the Private
Property Manager on a tier-by-tier basis to keep the residents aware of the work performed in
their units.
Commissioner Young then introduced a Motion for the approval of Item No. 5.
RESOLUTION NO. 2012-CHA-21
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 14, 2012

 THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a contract with Friedler Construction Co. in the amount of
