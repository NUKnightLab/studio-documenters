WITH THE MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT FOR THE
COOK COUNTY JUVENILE TEMPORARY DETENTION CENTER
WHEREAS, in 1999, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the MacArthur Justice Center
sued Cook County for civil rights violations, because of the conditions at the Cook County Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center (JTDC), citing that the children at the center live in "an atmosphere of
violence and fear"; and
WHEREAS, that lawsuit led to a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between Cook County and the
plaintiffs and the court's appointment of independent monitors to oversee implementation of the MOA;
and
WHEREAS, in October 2005, our two independent, court-appointed monitors issued reports citing
continuing dangerous conditions at the JTDC; and
WHEREAS, the court-appointed monitors reported persistent and ongoing problems at the JTDC,
including staff members' inappropriate use of force against the children, vacant positions, and an overall
inability of Cook County to fulfill the obligations of the Memorandum of Agreement; and
WHEREAS, the exposure of our youth to this type of environment creates a generation of future inmates
at the Cook County Jail; and
WHEREAS, recognizing this, the ACLU has petitioned the court to declare Cook County in violation of
the decree and order Cook County's compliance with the decree in six months.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that to avoid further delay in remedying the deplorable
conditions of the JTDC and to avoid protracted and expensive litigation, the Cook County Board shall
voluntarily comply with all terms of the Memorandum of Agreement; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners calls upon the
President, in cooperation with the plaintiffs, our court-appointed monitors of the JTDC, and subject to the
approval of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, to appoint a blue ribbon panel of recognized
experts in juvenile corrections within 30 days of the passage of this Resolution; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the panel shall, within 60 days of the passage of this Resolution,
conduct and complete a national search for a capable and independent manager, with expertise in juvenile
correctional planning and administration, to devise an Implementation Plan to correct the deficiencies at
the JTDC, per the Memorandum of Agreement; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President shall consider and accept the recommendation of the
blue-ribbon panel and shall appoint him or her to serve as the independent manager, subject to the
approval of the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and

CITY OF HARVEY
NO CASH BID REQUEST
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 8, 2005 from
DEBORAH SIMS, Chainnan, Tax Delinquency Subcommittee
Submitting a request from
ERIC J. KELLOGG, Mayor, City of Harvey
The City of Harvey is hereby submitting a No Cash Bid application for scavenger sale bids. There are no
third party requesters. Redevelopment will benefit the City with new tax revenue, new construction, and
new economic activity. The City will retain legal counsel, obtain tax deeds and pay all acquisition costs.
The City will report as required to the Cook County Office of Economic Development annually from the
date of sale on each parcel for five years or until the development is completed, whichever occurs last.
Project Summary:
This no cash bid request is the first step of a citywide effort for redevelopment of abandoned taxdelinquent parcels. Most parcels are residential vacant lot suitable for new residual construction primarily
for single-family homes. Some are vacant commercial lots. Some have abandoned houses, garages or
commercial buildings. There is one vacant industrial lot and three lots that lie within a city street.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDfNGS FOR NOVEMBER 15, 2005

This request is the result of the City' s comprehensive block by block survey of every parcel in Harvey to
identify tax delinquent forfeited parcels for future redevelopment. The no cash bids at the upcoming
scavenger sale give the City an efficient, cost effecti ve way to acquire these long abandoned properties
for redevelopment. The current status of these tax delinquent parcels is a serious hindrance to
redevelopment. The many years of taxes due are often more than the market values. Owners may be
deceased, may have moved away or refuse to take responsibility for the property. Speculators from
previous scavenger sales with minimal b ids as low as $250.00 control the selling of parcels, but do not
take ownership, pay taxes or maintain the properties. With this program, the City can avoid these
problems, obtain the parcels and present clear deeds to developers and, when needed, help them assemble
adjacent parcels for a complete project.
The City has been a significant increase in developer investment and interest in Harvey in the past two
years and is confident that by using this program we can facilitate new construction in coming years. We
will issue requests for proposals in 2006 and expect to break ground on the first projects, likely new
single-family homes. The City is committed to pay for costs to obtain deeds through 2006 and 2007.
Under redevelopment agreements, the City will obtain reimbursement of our costs. In many cases the
value of the land sold to developers will exceed our costs, providing revenue.
Although the resolution has 15 16 parcels, the City of Harvey w ill only be requesting 457 parcels at this
time due to the increased amount of liens and other legal issues associated with the additional parcels.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Audit Committee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Wednesday, November 9, 2005 at the hour of I :00 P.M. in the Conference Room on Floor 3M, County
Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:

3670

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 15, 2005

272861

BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVICES, by Daniel H. Winship, M.D., Chief, transmitting a
Communication, dated July 21, 2005.
This letter is to fonnally request that the Bureau of Health Services Audited Financial
Statements, related Management Letter and request for Bad Debt write-off for fiscal year
2003 be referred to the Audit Committee of the Board of Commissioners for discussion.

*Referred to the Audit Committee on 09/08/05.
Chairman Daley informed the Committee that he had submitted a letter to Daniel H. Winship, M.D.,
Chief, Bureau of Health Services, regarding the item for the Bureau of Health Services. (The referenced
document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Commissioner Hansen asked what the recovery is on the bad debt items.
Alvin Holley, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Health Services, replied that typically the recovery rate
is 2% on the receivables. The bad debt before the Committee is for services rendered in the year 2000
and prior.
Vice Chairman Goslin inquired at what point the Bureau of Health Services declares a bad debt.
Mr. Holley replied that this declaration is made after three years of no collection activity; at this point the
items are written off as bad debt and are no longer carried on the balance sheet.
Vice Chainnan Goslin inquired what the Bureau of Health Services has done to move people onto Public
Assistance or insurance.
Mr. Holley replied that first, all efforts are made to identify a third party, however, in the event that the
Bureau of Health Services cannot obtain third party involvement, in-house collection is undertaken. If the
Bureau 's in-house collection effort is unsuccessful, then skip tracing and an employment check are
performed. If the patient begins payment and ceases making payments within 90 days, the collection
agency files a law suit against the patient. If the patient has not paid anything on the account after three
years, the Bureau of Health Services recommends to the County Board that the debt be written off the
Bureau of Health Services' balance sheet.
Chairman Daley asked whether the Bureau of Health Services asks patients for their social security
numbers.
Mr. Holley replied that the Bureau of Health Services does request the patient' s social security number;
the automated registration system does not require it. The Bureau of Health Services must, however,
attempt to obtain the patient's social security number in order to be eligible for SSI and Public Aid
reimbursement. Further, the social security number helps the collection agency locate the patient. The
collection agency also utilizes the social security number when performing a skip trace.
Chairman Daley asked whether the representative from Ernst & Young had any comments.
Kenneth R. Herlin, Partner, Ernst & Young, replied that the audit for Fiscal Year 2003 has been
completed and issued an unqualified opinion.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Vice Chairman Goslin, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 272861. The motion carried.

3671

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 15, 2005

273631

BUREAU OF FINANCE, by Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, transmitting a
Communication, dated October 6, 2005:
Submitted is a copy of Cook County' s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR)
for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2003, prepared by Deloitte & Touche, LLP, as
well as their Memorandum on Internal Control at the same date. I am hereby requesting
the opportunity to discuss these reports with the Audit Committee of the Board of
Commissioners.

*Referred to the Audit Committee on 10/18/05.
Chairman Daley inquired why the County was not able to issue its Comprehensive Annual Financial
Report (CAFR) for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2003 within the industry standard timeframe.
Walter K. Knorr, Cook County Comptroller, replied that the delay was caused by a back-up due to
compliance with GASB 34. GASB 34 was a completely new reporting model for financial statements; it
entailed a profound change from previous reporting models used for municipal accounting. The financial
statements reflected the net assets of the County as opposed to the balanced sheet presentations utilized
previously. The CAFR also included recordings of the County' s infrastructure as part of the complete
requirement for a management discussion, and an analysis of the operations of the County. Both the 2002
and 2003 audits were essentially caught up in the transition. At this time the County is in technical
review with 2004, and for the 2005 audit the County would like to return to the industry standard of six
months from the end of any given fiscal year.
Commissioner Goslin inquired as to the industry standard.

Mr. Knorr replied that it is 180 days.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the deferral of creating a dedicated Director of
Financial Reporting position and related additional staffing and training, Thomas J. Glaser, Chief
Financial Officer, stated that an individual has been identified w ithin the Comptroller's Office to lead the
project of the development of the annual CAFR and, wh ile they don 't occupy a position with the title of
Director of Financial Reporting, a single point person does exist who is serving as the project manager.
Commissioner Hansen asked what percentage of time the project manager will devote on the project.
Mr. Glaser replied one hundred percent of the time between November 30th and issuance of the report.
Chairman Daley asked Catherine Maras O' Leary, Chief Information Officer, whether she had any
comments regarding the Disaster Recovery Plan.
Ms. O ' Leary stated that on Novem ber I 0, 2005, the Countywide Disaster Committee will be finalizi ng a
recommendation to be presented to President Stroger.
Commissioner Hansen requested that someone address the Committee regarding the NSF checks received
by the Department of Environmental Control.
Kevin N. Givens, Director, Cook County Department of Environmental Control , replied that to date I%
of all checks that are received within the department have NSF. The Department is working on
improving the process by which NSF checks are tracked. Currently the County is directly collecting over
90% of the NSF checks.

3672

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 15, 2005

Commissioner Hansen asked what the amounts of the checks are.
Mr. Givens stated that the checks range from $25 to $100.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether Mr. Givens has any recommendations as to whether to convert to
cashier checks or money orders.
Mr. Givens replied that he needs to review the departmental operational issues involved.
Commissioner Hansen inquired as to how much money the Department has lost in the past year.
Mr. Givens replied approximately $800, but that some of the check deposits are still pending, and some of
the NSF checks are still being pursued.
Vice Chairman Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 273631. The motion carried.
273632

BUREAU OF FINANCE, by Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, transmitting a
Communication, dated October 6, 2005
Submitting a copy of Cook County' s S ing le Audit Report for fi scal year ending
November 30, 2003, as prepared by Washington, Pittman & McKeever, LLC.
respectfully request that the report be referred to the Audit Committee for further
discussion.
*Referred to the Audit Committee on 10/18/05.

Commissioner Hansen inquired whether Cook County issues money for school lunch programs.
Dorothy A. McLemore, CPA, Principal, Washington, Pittman & McKeever, LLC, replied that the County
receives federal funds for a school lunch program; these funds must be reported in the Single Audit. The
funds are received by the County via the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center; the funds are awarded as
a result of providing meals to children in the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center Program.
Vice Chairman Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 273632. The motion carried.
Vice Chairman Goslin moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Hansen. T he
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

Transmitting a Communication, dated October 3, 2005:
Re: Stroger Hospital of Cook County
Campus Master Plan
Transmitted herewith for review and approval is the study and recommendation of the
clinical and administrative space needs at the Stroger Hospital of Cook County Campus
which were prepared by our planning consultant U.S. Equities Development, LLC. It is
respectfully requested that this item be send to the Construction Committee for a
presentation and discussion.
*Referred to the Committee on Health and Hospitals on 10/05/05.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 15, 2005

Chairman Butler began by stating that the Committee would hear a presentation from Robert A. Winslow,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Equities Realty, and that Daniel H. Winship, M.D., Chief,
Bureau of Health Services would also address the Committee.
Mr. Winslow thanked the Commissioners for allowing U.S. Equities Realty to conduct the study of the
clinical and administrative space needs at the Stroger Hospital of Cook County Campus.
Mr. Winslow stated that he would give the Commissioners an executive overview of their study findings
and that Dr. Daniel Winship would address the Commissioners regarding the hospital's needs. This
would be followed by a power point presentation detailing the study.
Mr. Winslow introduced the following team members involved in the study: Perkins Will, Premier
Alliance; U.S. Equities Realty; Bauer Latoza Studios (historic preservation); Soodan & Associates
(fai;:ade rehabilitation); Environmental Design International (environmental); Environmental Systems
Design (mechanical, electrical and plumbing); W. E. O'Neal (cost); David Mason & Associates
(structural analysis); and K.L.O.A. (traffic and parking).
Mr. Winslow stated the study began in March 2004 and included five months of intense study of hospitalrelated and medical-related requirements for the Stroger Hospital Campus. U.S. Equities Realty's study
had a specific scope that included the following: I) the economic reuse of Cook County Hospital, 1900
Polk, Hektoen Institute and the Durand Building; 2) the replacement of the primary care facilities and
Fantus Clinic; 3) options for added medical surgical beds; 4) the replacement of the Administrative
Office; and 5) the expansion of campus parking.
Mr. Winslow explained the process of the study to the Committee.
Mr. Winslow asked Dr. Winship to address issues relating to the studies of bed usage and the additional
need for beds.
Dr. Winship began by introducing the individuals who have been involved in the Stroger Hospital
Campus in the planning effort: Johnny C. Brown, Chief Operating Officer, Stroger Hospital of Cook
County; Yogi Mahendra, Deputy Director, Professional Affairs, Stroger Hospital of Cook County; Jeffrey
Schaider, Chairman, Department of Emergency Medicine, Stroger Hospital of Cook County; Richard
Keen, Associate Chainnan, Department of Surgery, Stroger Hospital of Cook County; Sidney Thomas,
Acting Chief Operating Officer, Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County; Robert
Kohl, Director of Ambulatory Development (ACHN); and Rendy Jones, Associate
Administrator/Director of Community Affairs, Stroger Hospital of Cook County.
Dr. Winship continued that the consulting team organized a steering committee consisting of county staff,
bureau, hospital, ambulatory leadership and other key staff. A series of meetings were held to document
current and projected volumes, department size and plan elements; the consulting team applied the
various planning standards to determine the future space needs for the campus.
Dr. Winship stated that he would like to address the Committee specifically about the need fo r inpatient
beds, Emergency Department expansion, and the Ambulatory Program location and programming. The
lack of sufficient adult medical and surgical inpatient beds is causing patients to be held in inappropriate
environments, including the already over-crowded Emergency Department, Recovery Room and
Intensive Care Units. The extended waiting time for patients is leading to lower patient satisfaction and
to patients leaving without being seen.

3675

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 15, 2005

Dr. Winship continued that during 2004 a daily average of 48 patients were waiting for beds. A review of
2004-2005 data indicates that medical surgical beds averaged 122% occupancy; the current planning
standard for target occupancy, as well as the accepted standard for target occupancy in hospitals, is 85%.
Based on existing conditions, there appears to be a need for approximately 100 additional medical
surgical beds; this increase would accommodate the current average daily census of 279 at 85%
occupancy in the major areas of medicine and surgery.
Dr. Winship further stated that the Surgery Department is postponing elective procedures due to lack of
beds. The Post-Anesthesia Care Unit holds patients longer than necessary, and the Intensive Care Units
(I CUs) cannot transfer patients who no longer need ICU care because of lack of beds. Additional growth
and expected admissions in the Emergency Department as outlined in the master plan are expected to
require 76 additional medical surgical beds for a total need of 176 additional medical surgical beds for the
year 2015.
Dr. Winship continued stating that the Emergency Department expansion is crucial. Stroger Hospital of
Cook County has experienced continued growth in patient volume since it opened. The Emergency
Department was planned for 91,000 patient visits per year, but once Stroger Hospital of Cook County
opened it had already reached that number. The Emergency Department saw approximately 127 ,000
adult patients in 2003 and 130,000 adult patients in 2004. An additional 32 treatment stations are needed
to handle the current and projected volume of emergency patients; insufficient triage space and the
inability to assign patients to available beds lead to extended wait times and a general backup of patient
flow. There is lack of storage space which leads to overcrowded work areas and corridors; this is an area
of concern with regard to compliance with regulatory standards. Both the ambulance and walk-in
entrances are problematic. The entry drive to Stroger Hospital of Cook County from Ogden Avenue
passes the Emergency Department entries; this encourages non-emergency patients use of the Emergency
Department entry as a main entrance.
Dr. Winship continued that the contamination area is undersized, poorly serviced, and its location poses
the risk of contaminating the entry; in the current post-911 security-conscious environment, such issues
are critical. Fantus Clinic's layout and conditions negatively impact the efficient and effective delivery of
contemporary ambulatory care. This translates into a high level of patient dissatisfaction. A related issue
is the lack of patient privacy within exam rooms; such a lack of privacy violates the Health Information
Portability and Accountability or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
Fantus Clinic is old, outdated and a difficult building to alter. The new plan slightly increases the amount
of treatment space. More emphasis is needed, however, to increase and standardize exam room sizes, and
to provide adequate area for staff support, teaching, patient consultation, waiting and storage supply.
Dr. Winship further stated that the Bureau believes that the north option provides the following
advantages: it is the best location for the consolidation of the primary care clinics and specialty care
clinics; it provides the best location for additional medical surgical beds within the existing envelope of
the new Stroger Hospital; it provides the ability to separate the Emergency Department traffic, hospital
traffic and clinic traffic; it allows for distinctive identities and locations of each of the mentioned
functions; it also provides early deli very of the use components where many of the critical needs are now;
it further reserves both the Fantus Clinic and the Administration Building sites for future expansion.
Integration is integral to the evolution of the Bureau. Stroger Hospital of Cook County is a tertiary
hospital , meaning it is a high-end hospital, possessing the most sophisticated kind of approach to
healthcare.
Mr. Winslow asked Paul Clinch, Associate Principal, Perkins Will, and John Becker, Senior Development
Manager, U.S. Equities Realty, to walk the Commissioners through the summary of the study.

3676

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 15, 2005

Commissioner Daley inquired whether Fantus Clinic has passed the various certifications such as Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and through the Illinois Department
of Public Health.
Sidney Thomas, Acting Chief Operating Officer, Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook
County, responded in the affirmative, noting that it has been a struggle.
Commissioner Daley inquired whether it was possible to determine what community of patients utilizes
Fantus Clinic.
Dr. Winship replied that information exists regarding in which communities the patients reside.
Analyzing communities individually would, however, be difficult.
Mr. Thomas stated that there is zip-code data for patients who use Fantus Clinic; this information is
captured primarily when the patients register. Patients come through the Adult Screening Clinic (ASC)
because it is impossible to admit them into the other county clinics, because these clinics are at capacity.
Commissioner Daley asked what the wait period is at Stroger Hospital of Cook County, compared to
those of other hospitals.
Dr. Jeffrey Schaider, Chairman, Department of Emergency Medicine, Stroger Hospital of Cook County
replied that currently, the wait time for entering patients, once the decision is made to admit them, is as
follows: approximately 40% wait more than six hours; approximately 20% wait longer than 12 hours;
and a significant percentage wait between 24 and 48 hours. Compared to other hospitals in the region,
Stroger Hospital of Cook County has above-average wait times.
Commissioner Daley inquired whether the Core Center had been included in the site plan.
Dr. Winship replied that the Core Center is not part of the present effort.
Dr. Winship asked Dr. Schaider to comment on the process by which Stroger Hospital of Cook County
attempts to route patients to the appropriate site of care.
Dr. Schaider replied that on a daily basis a list is created of persons in the Emergency Department at
Stroger Hospital of Cook County who are waiting for admission. This list is reviewed first thing each
morning to detennine what needs the patients have regarding surgical care, neuro-surgical care, cardiac
care, interventional cardiology care, and interventional radiology care. If any of this care is needed the
patient cannot be transferred to any other County facility because those other facilities do not have these
services. Next, the doctor determines whether each stable patient would like to be transferred to one of
the other County facilities. Dr. Schaider stated that it is his understanding that it would be a violation to
transfer a patient against his will; a patient has to sign a consent that states that he agrees to be transferred
to another hospital.
Commissioner Peraica requested copies of the cost analysis from O'Neil Construction.
Mr. Winslow replied that he would supply Commissioner Peraica with copies.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether the fayade could be saved with a new building constructed on it.

3677

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 15, 2005

Mr. Winslow replied that the issue of saving the fayade has not yet been studied; what has been studied,
however, is using the building in an adaptive reuse and not trying to do a veneer of the fayade. Portions
of the building could be used for veneer of the fayade; the cost, however, would escalate dramatically.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the additional 176 beds should have been included when Stroger
Hospital was built.
Chainnan Butler stated that the Bureau put as many beds into the new hospital as the State would allow.
President Stroger stated that he attended a meeting with then-President Richard Phelan and Ruth
Rothstein, regarding the number of beds to be included at Stroger Hospital. After discussion and analysis,
the Bureau of Health Services tendered a recommendation to the State. The State, however, approved
fewer beds than requested by the Bureau.
Commissioner Suffredin asked whether the Commissioners could receive a brief overview as to why Mr.
Winslow walked away from the south option.
Mr. Winslow asked Cassandra J. Francis, Vice President, U.S. Equities Realty, to respond to
Commissioner Suffredin 's question.
Ms. Francis replied that the main issue with the south option was that the largest concentration of new
construction would be located south of the existing Stroger Hospital. There would be a combined
specialty care and a bed tower on the site upon which the Administration Building resides. This
construction would be connected to Stroger Hospital. As a result, a high density of construction would
exist at the Stroger Hospital location. Another issue with the south option was that U.S. Equities Realty
was having a difficult time meeting the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) limitation.
Commissioner Suffredin inquired whether, under the north option, the existing Planned Unit
Development (PUD) needs to be modified.
Mr. Winslow replied that discussions will be held with the City of Chicago regarding the existing PUD;
changes are being made within the PUD as to where buildings are located. U.S. Equities Realty will
provide for the open space requirement in the PUD in other locations.
Commissioner Sims inquired as to the anticipated, yearly, construction-cost increase.
Mr. Winslow replied that construction cost increases in the Midwest have been the highest in the nation;
the Chicago area has been the highest in the Midwest.
Chainnan Butler stated that the City owns and leases land to the Core Foundation; the Core Foundation
owns the building and leases it back to the County.
Chainnan Butler inquired why it costs $29,000 per month to keep the Old Cook County Hospital from
being tom down.
Michael E. LaMont, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy, replied that the $29,000 is
comprised of several components: minimal utilities, elevator maintenance, security and various fayade
inspections. $29,000 is an estimate. As of August of 2005 the County has spend about$ I 0.1 million ; and
$600,000 to temporarily stabilize the fayade.
Chainnan Butler asked how much it will cost to demolish the Old Cook County Hospital.

3678

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 15, 2005

Mr. LaMont stated that the County put out bids for demolition and abatement for the children's hospital,
the power plant and the old main hospital.
Chairman Butler inquired as to how much money the County has spent to keep the Old Cook County
Hospital open for the period during which the County ceased talking about demolition.
Mr. LaMont replied approximately $10. 1 million as of August of2005 .

Committee had detailed consultant reports on the Stroger Hospital of Cook County Campus Master Plan
which includes a lot of material and there are also issues for which the County Board needs to give
serious consideration. Further, Commissioner Suffredin stated that it has been his primary goal to
maintain the Old Cook County Hospital and put it into reuse. But for today's purposes there are some
immediate needs for which the County has available funds. Commissioner Suffredin made the following
motion.

Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved to allow the Office of Capital
Planning and Policy to advertise for bids to demolish the Children's Hospital, the Old Main

design and construction of Parking Structure Phases 2A and 2B as described in the Stroger
Hospital of Cook County Master Plan Final Draft and to use funds from Bond Series 22000 and
28000 for such expenditures. The remainder of the Stroger Hospital of Cook County Master Plan
Final Draft is referred back to the full County Board for further action in conjunction with the FY

Commissioner Suffredin stated that the motion he made begins movement on the Stroger Hospital of
