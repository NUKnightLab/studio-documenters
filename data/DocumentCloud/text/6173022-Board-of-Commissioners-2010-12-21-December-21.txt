monthly report. Per Commissioner Young, the Tenant Services Committee held its regular
meeting on Wednesday, December 15th at approximately 1:10 p.m. Staff from the Office of
Resident Services presented the Committee with an update on FamilyWorks.
Commissioner Young then presented an Omnibus Motion for adoption of the Resolutions for
Items A1 thru A4 discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Tenant Services
Committee.
(Item A1)
The resolution for Item A1 approves an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City
Colleges of Chicago (CCC) for Educational Services. The goal of the IGA has been to support
self-sufficiency for families by creating a continuum of education and training opportunities that
allow CHA residents to advance over time to progressively higher levels of education, and obtain
certification and employment that should ultimately result in better paying careers in areas of
economic importance. Under the IGA, existing degree and certification programs have continued
to be made available to CHA residents at no cost in a variety of industries. In addition,
customized bridge programs have enabled residents needing more extensive educational support
to move towards entry into degree and certification programs or directly to employment. City
Colleges provides staff dedicated to support residents as they attend educational programs. They
also provide assistance with navigating CCC’s enrollment procedures, help with decision making
about educational and employment tracks and ensure continued attendance in CCC’s educational
programs through tutoring and retention services. CCC’s staff dedication and CHA participants’
desire to achieve self-sufficiency is demonstrated by 2010 program outcomes. As of October
2010, 206 residents have completed a degree/certificate program, an additional 81 are currently
enrolled and another 14 are waiting for their programs to begin. In addition, 87% of program
registrants have completed or still remain in their degree/certificate program, a 4% increase in
retention from 2009. CCC staff has conducted educational sessions with CHA case management
providers and over 475 residents have attended an orientation.
RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-160
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated December 15, 2010, entitled, “RECOMMENDATION TO
ENTER INTO AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT WITH THE
CITY COLLEGES OF CHICAGO FOR EDUCATIONAL SERVICES”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer, or his
designee, to enter into an intergovernmental agreement with the City Colleges of
Chicago (“IGA”) for the period of January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 in
an amount not-to-exceed $1,000,000.

(Item A2)
In 2009, CHA extended a work requirement to all public housing units through an amendment to
CHA’s Admissions and Continued Occupancy Policy (ACOP), with the exception of
developments that operate under a consent decree. The CHA work requirement requires that
every adult authorized member of a public housing unit, aged 18 to age 62, is required to be
employed at least 20 hours per week unless the resident or authorized adult member of the
household is granted a Safe Harbor. When residents are unable to comply with the work
requirement, they can request Safe Harbor consideration by showing that he/she legitimately
attempted to comply with the work requirement and are still unable to secure employment or
otherwise fully meet the work requirement. Residents who are approved by the CHA for Safe
Harbor status are required to undergo an interim Safe Harbor re-examination with their property
manager every 90 calendar days. The CHA advertised an RFP in September 2010 to solicit
consultants and firms to conduct an assessment of the identified population of residents with
multiple Safe Harbor designations to better understand the social service needs and to form a
strategy for eviction avoidance. The RFP was advertised in area newspapers and on the CHA
website. The CHA also directly solicited 268 firms, including 177 MBE/WBE/DBE firms and
70 assist agencies. Based on the identified competitive range one firm made the competitive
range. Negotiations were held with the firm and a best and final offer was requested and
3

 submitted. Based upon the evaluations of the written proposals, oral presentations, and the best
and final offer, it was determined that the Corporation for Supportive Housing would provide the
best overall service and value to CHA to conduct this needs assessment. Accordingly, the
resolution for Item A2 approves award of contract to Corporation For Supportive Housing to
conduct an assessment of residents in Safe Harbor status.
Commissioner King voted No on Item A2 only.
RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-161
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated December 15, 2010, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO
ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE
HOUSING TO CONDUCT AN ASSESSMENT OF RESIDENTS IN SAFE
HARBOR STATUS”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a fixed fee contract with the Corporation for Supportive
Housing in the amount of $344,769, to conduct a needs assessment of CHA
residents who have received multiple Safe Harbor designations.

(Item A3)
The resolution for Item A3 approves first one-year option with FamilyWorks services providers.
In November 2009, the Board authorized CHA to negotiate and enter into contracts with Center
for New Horizons (CNH); Employment & Employer Services, Inc. (E&ES); Heartland Human
Care Services (HHCS); Jane Addams Hull House Association (JAHHA); Metropolitan Family
Services (MFS) and Uhlich Children’s Advantage Network (UCAN) to provide comprehensive
case management services. The Contracts initial term was January 1, 2010 through December 31,
2010 with four one-year option periods. During the base term of the contracts, Resident Services
has been satisfied with each agency’s contractual performance. The resolution for Item A3
approves exercising the first one-year option of the contract. FamilyWorks agencies work closely
with CHA staff and property management to facilitate efficient communication and coordination
regarding resident needs. The six FamilyWorks agencies serve approximately 9,000 CHA
families throughout the City of Chicago. The FamilyWorks program model addresses two
important challenges facing CHA families: housing stability and employment. The program
model utilizes identifiable outcomes with an intensive concentration on permanent housing
choices, lease compliance, employment preparation and employment retention.
RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-162
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated December 15, 2010, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO
EXERCISE THE FIRST ONE-YEAR OPTIONS OF CONTRACT NO. 9121
WITH CENTERS FOR NEW HORIZONS, CONTRACT NO. 9124 WITH
EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYER SERVICES, INC., CONTRACT NO. 9122
WITH HEARTLAND HUMAN CARE SERVICES, CONTRACT NO. 9125

4

 amount not-to-exceed $25,100,000, adding it to the carryover balance available at
the end of the current contract term.
(Item A4)
The resolution for Item A4 approves contract with Illinois Action For Children (IAFC) to
provide Parent Education and Enhanced Child Care Resource and Referral Services to CHA
families. As the only agency funded by the State of Illinois to administer the Illinois Child Care
Assistance Program for Cook County, IAFC manages and maintains an extensive database of
childcare and early education programs. As the Admissions and Continued Occupancy Policy’s
(ACOP) work-requirement has increased to 20 hours per week in FY2010, accessibility to
childcare has become an increased need for CHA families. Due to the success and importance of
the enhanced referral program IAFC performs, staff recommends the continuation of the
enhanced referral program to assist CHA families in accessing the most effective childcare
resource. Enhanced referrals include an initial consultation to identify key indicators and needs.
Families are then contacted within two days and provided substantial information on available
resources. Additional follow-up is made within a week to track child placement and determine if
additional follow-up is needed. As of October 2010, 487 enhanced referrals have been
completed, and over 4,100 informational packets have been distributed to residents. In addition
to continuing the enhanced resource and referral program, in 2011 IAFC will initiate a parent
leadership program for CHA residents. Participating parents will engage in a series of ten
sessions focused on topics including, but not limited to, child development, parent-child
relationship building, effective communication with children, and cultural learning opportunities
for children.

Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Competitive Fund: revenue totals $31.5 million.
ARRA funding dollars awarded to the Authority were based on a competitive process which

economy. For FY2011, these funds will be used at various CHA mixed income, senior and
family developments for capital related work. Section 8 Fund (Non-MTW): revenue for this

Mod Rehab vouchers and 50 Mainstream vouchers for housing assistance based on annual
contributions contracts from HUD. Hope VI Fund: revenue totals $37.8 million. These funds

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board letter dated December 15,
2010, entitled “APPROVAL OF THE FY2011 COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners, hereby approves the attached, “FY2011

1.

2.

3.

THAT,

that the proposed expenditures are necessary for the efficient and
economical operation of the Chicago Housing Authority for the purpose of

 RESOLUTION 2010-CHA-171
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board letter dated November 16,
2010, Adoption of the Revised Investment Policy.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Revised Investment Policy is adopted.

THAT,

the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are authorized to
implement the above policy.

(Item C3)
The resolution for Item C3 amends Resolution No. 2010-CHA-135 to increase not-to-exceed
funding amount of Davis Vision Contract. On October 19, 2010, the Board passed Resolution
No. 2010-CHA-135 approving contracts with Humana Healthcare (medical and dental), Davis
Vision, Lincoln National Life and Ameriflex for the CHA Employee Health Benefit Plan for an
aggregate amount not-to-exceed $5,882,634.08 for FY 2010 and $6,177,683.08 for FY2012.
The specific amount authorized for Davis Vision was $40,010.93 for both FY2011 and FY2012.
Through an inadvertent error, the Board Letter with respect to Davis Vision, indicated
incorrectly that the new premium rates provided by Davis Vision reflected a 2% decrease in the
premium rates (from the current premium rates) and included an enhanced benefit for contact
lens users. Although the premium rates would have decreased 2% (from the current rates)
without any changes in benefits, with the enhanced benefit, the premium rates actually increased
by 5.05% over the current premium rates. The enhanced benefit to the FY2011 vision plan
includes: Standard contact lens fitting will be covered at 100% and specialty lens fittings will be
covered up to $60, then 15% discount off balance. Currently, employees who undergo standard
contact lens fittings are charged $40.00, unlike employees who are not charged for standard
eyeglass fittings.
RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-172
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Memorandum dated December 15, 2010, entitled “RECOMMENDATION
TO AMEND RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-135 TO INCREASE NOT-TO
EXCEED FUNDING AMOUNT OF DAVIS VISION CONTRACT”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby amends Resolution No. 2010-CHA-135 to
authorize the Chief Executive Officer, or his designee, to increase the funding of
the contract with Davis Vision as part of CHA’s Employee Benefit Plan by an
amount not-to-exceed $2,878.03 for a revised total contract not-to-exceed
$42,888.96 for FY 2011 and, subject to funding availability, and a revised amount
not-to-exceed $42,888.96 for the FY2012 option term. The aggregate amount of
all CHA Employee Health Benefit Plan insurance coverage and the flexible
spending plan is increased by an amount not-to-exceed $2,878.03 for a revised
amount not-to-exceed $5,885,512.11 for FY2011 and subject to funding
availability, an amount not-to-exceed $6,180,561.11 for the FY2012 option term..
