 The operating cash flow needs of the Fund normally require the liquidation of investment
assets monthly. To help minimize transition costs, the Board attempts to coincide these
liquidity needs with proper rebalancing procedures to move asset allocations closer to
determined targets. To incorporate this process, the Board has delegated to the Chief
Investment Officer, in conjunction with the Investment Consultant the ability to liquidate
assets, as necessary, to meet the monthly operating requirements, subject to fiduciary and
fiscal prudence. Liquidity opportunities will focus on allocations that exceed their target
to help move them closer to target. Since the Funds operating cash flow needs are known
well in advance, Fund staff generally will present the Board the plan of action for
required liquidity for their concurrence prior to the liquidation of assets. In the event prior
Board approval is not obtained, Fund staff will notify the Board of the liquidation at the
next regularly scheduled Board meeting.
