PROPOSED RESOLUTION
ISSUING A MORATORIUM ON FELONY PROSTITUTION CHARGES IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, Illinois, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri and Texas are the only eight (8)
states in the Country to have a felony sentencing option for prostitution offenses; and
WHEREAS, of these eight (8) states, Illinois has the harshest sentencing option in the Country requiring only

Page 8 of 9

 one (1) prior prostitution conviction before a felony charge option is available for subsequent offenses; and
WHEREAS, as noted by End Demand Illinois, the Department of Corrections reported 127 felony prostitution
admissions for 2012, costing the state $2,011,680.00. Pretrial detention for those facing felony prostitution
charges costs Cook County Department of Corrections between $5.3 to $9.5 million annually; and
WHEREAS, felony convictions make the transition out of the sex trade to the legitimate economy more difficult
because those with felony convictions can be rejected from jobs, denied work authorization, denied housing and
can even be evicted from their homes for having a felony conviction; and
WHEREAS, rather than continuing to treat prostitution as a crime, we must shift our resources and focus to the
pimps and johns who exploit them.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the State‚Äôs Attorney, the President and the members of the
Cook County Board of Commissioners urge the General Assembly to pass legislation that will permanently
remove the felony prostitution charge option from Illinois State Statute; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the State‚Äôs Attorney, the President and members of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners issue a moratorium on felony prostitution charges in Cook County.
