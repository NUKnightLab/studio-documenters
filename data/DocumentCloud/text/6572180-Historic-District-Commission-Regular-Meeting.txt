The RSX features an integral universal mounting
mechanism that allows the luminaire to be mounted
on most existing drill hole patterns. This “no-drill”
solution provides significant labor savings. An
easy-access door on the bottom of mounting arm
allows for wiring without opening the electrical
compartment. A mast arm adaptor, adjustable
integral slipfitter and other mounting configurations
are available.

FEATURES & SPECIFICATIONS
 

INTENDED USE
The RSX LED area family is designed to provide a long-lasting, energy-efficient solution for the onefor-one replacement of existing metal halide or high pressure sodium lighting. The RSX1 delivers 7,000
to 17,000 lumens and is ideal for replacing 70W to 400W HID pole-mounted luminaires in parking lots
and other area lighting applications.

 

CONSTRUCTION
The RSX LED area luminaire features a rugged die-cast aluminum main body that uses heatdissipating fins and flow-through venting to provide optimal thermal management that both
enhances LED performance and extends component life. Integral “no drill” mounting arm allows
the luminaire to be mounted on existing pole drillings, greatly reducing installation labor. The
light engines and housing are sealed against moisture and environmental contaminants to IP66.
The low-profile design results in a low EPA, allowing pole optimization. All mountings are rated for
a 1.5 G vibration load per ANSI C136.31. WITH Vibration rated per ANSI C136.31: 3G Mountings:
SPA, RPA, MA, IS, AASP, and AARP rated for 3G vibration. 1.5G Mountings: WBA, WBASC, AAWB
and AAWSC rated for 1.5G vibration.

 

 

FINISH
Exterior parts are protected by a zinc-infused Super Durable TGIC thermoset powder coat finish
that provides superior resistance to corrosion and weathering. A tightly controlled multi-stage
process ensures superior adhesion as well as a minimum finish thickness of 3 mils. The result is a
high-quality finish that is warrantied not to crack or peel.

 

OPTICS
Precision acrylic refractive lenses are engineered for superior application efficiency, distributing
the light to where it is needed most. Available in short and wide pattern distributions including
Type 2, Type 3, Type 3S, Type 4, Type 4S, Type 5, Type 5S, AFR (Automotive Front Row), and AFR
rotated AFRR90 and ARFL90.

 

ELECTRICAL
Light engine(s) configurations consist of high-efficacy LEDs mounted on metal-core circuit boards
and aluminum heat sinks to maximize heat dissipation. Light engines are IP66 rated. LED lumen
maintenance is >L92/100,000 hours. CCT’s of 3000K, 4000K and 5000K (minimum 70 CRI) are
available. Class 1 electronic drivers ensure system power factor >90% and THD <20%. Easily
serviceable 10kV surge protection device meets a minimum Category C Low operation (per ANSI/
IEEE C62.41.2).

 

 

nLIGHT AIR CONTROLS
The RSX LED area luminaire is also available with nLight® AIR for the ultimate in wireless
control. This powerful controls platform provides out-of-the-box basic motion sensing
with photocontrol functionality and is suitable for mounting heights up to 40 feet. No
commissioning is required when using factory default settings that provide basic stand-alone
motion occupancy dimming that is switched on and off with a built-in photocell. See chart
above for motion sensor default out-of-box settings. For more advanced wireless functionality,
such as group dimming, nLight AIR can be commissioned using a smartphone and the easy-touse CLAIRITY app. nLight AIR equipped luminaries can be grouped, resulting in motion sensor
and photocell group response without the need for additional equipment. Scheduled dimming
with motion sensor over-ride can be achieved when used with the nLight Eclypse. Additional
information about nLight Air can be found here.

 

INSTALLATION
Integral “no-drill” mounting arm allows for fast, easy mounting using existing pole drillings.
Select the “SPA” option for square poles and the “RPA” option to mount to round poles. Note,
the RPA mount can also be used for mounting to square poles by omitting the RPA adapter
plate. Select the “MA” option to attach the luminaire to a 2 3/8” horizontal mast arm or the
“IS” option for an adjustable slipfitter that mounts on a 2 3/8” OD tenon. The adjustable
slipfitter has an integral junction box and offers easy installation. Can be tilted up to 90° above
horizontal. Additional mountings are available including a wall bracket, adjustable tilt arm for
direct-to-pole and wall and a surface conduit box for wall mount applications.

 October 28, 2019
Ms. Jennifer Ross
City of Detroit
Historic District Commission
2 Woodward Avenue
Suite 808
Detroit, Michigan 48226
RE: Royal Palm Hotel - HDC Submission
Dear Ms. Ross:
Kraemer Design Group (KDG) is writing to submit information to the Detroit Historic District Commission (HDC), on
behalf of Midwest Lodging Group regarding the proposed rehabilitation of the Royal Palm Hotel (RPH) located at
2305 Park Avenue. The proposed exterior work at the RPH will include: masonry cleaning and restoration of the
exterior; removal of the flowerboxes below each storefront bay window on the ground level; new flowerboxes
replaced at each storefront bay window; new exterior doors; new canopies over both the Montcalm entrance and
the Park Avenue entrance; new signage in keeping in character with the historic signage; cleaning and repair of the
iron and metal railings and flagpoles; and new windows in a few, select locations; new roofing and new rooftop
mechanical equipment; and new exterior lighting.
The Royal Palm Hotel was constructed in 1925 for local hotel magnate Lew Tuller. Built at a time when Detroit was
experiencing explosive growth, the Royal Palm Hotel was part of a grandiose plan on the part of Tuller and other
Detroit builders to duplicate the character and real estate market of New York City. Designed by Louis Kamper the
Royal Palm Hotel contains thirteen floors and is faced primarily in orange brick on the two primary facades (east and
south) and beige brick on the two secondary facades (west and north). The building exhibits the typical high-rise
arrangement of a vast expanse of plain brick, punctuated by window openings and—on the Park and Montcalm
facades—is relieved by decorative Italian Renaissance-inspired detailing. Limestone is used on the east and south
facades on the lower two floors while stone detailing appears around the paired windows on third floor and on the
upper two floors. Iron railings appear at the paired windows on the twelfth floor and at the fifth floor in the central
bay. The center window on the third floor of the Park Avenue façade has a console-supported stone balconette with
an iron railing. There is an elaborate cornice made of glazed terra cotta that runs from the Montcalm façade around
to the Park Avenue façade and turns the corner onto the north façade, terminating after one bay on the north
façade. The west façade lacks the cornice entirely although the orange brick wraps the corner onto the west façade
and runs for one bay—the remainder of the west façade is faced in beige brick.
Originally, the building contained 15 hotel rooms on each floor although the layout has been altered on some floors
since then. The Royal Palm Hotel has two primary facades along Park Avenue and Montcalm with the two secondary
facades facing onto two parking lots, one to the north and one to the west. The building is currently vacant awaiting
remodel, and both restaurant spaces on the ground floor are also vacant.
The following is a detailed description of the proposed work and its historic implications:
Masonry Restoration
The brick, terra cotta, and limestone masonry on the exterior of the building are all in good condition overall. The
masonry will be cleaned and inspected for damage. All damaged, deteriorating, or spalling masonry units are to be
removed and replaced with new material to match original units. Missing units are to be replaced to match the
remaining adjacent materials and new brick will match the existing as closely as possible in size, color, texture, and
compressive strength. Any salvaged brick will be reused where replacement is needed before new brick is used. The
cleaning will be done according to the Secretary of Interior Standards, and NPS Technical Preservation Briefs 1, 2 &
6.
1st Floor Storefront Flowerboxes

Page 1 of 3
1420 Broadway   Detroit, MI   48226   p 313 965 3399   f 313 965 3555   www.thekraemeredge.com

 Currently there are no storefronts on the ground floor as they were replaced with bay windows during a previous
renovation by prior owners. Each bay window currently has a large flowerbox under each window unit. These
flowerboxes will be removed both to facilitate repair of the masonry façade beneath and to install new flowerboxes
that will match the current flowerboxes. The bay windows will remain in place.
Exterior Doors
The double doors on the Park Avenue entrance are wood with glazed units with decorative stainless-steel push bars
across each door. These doors are not historic and are in fair condition. Above the doors there is a large iron fanlight
with metal radiating muntins. The doors from Park Avenue into the main lobby will be replaced within the existing
frame with units that complement the historic character of the building without appearing falsely historic. The Town
Pump Tavern entry and doors are not historic and thus the doors on Montcalm Street will be replaced with new
wood units to complement historic character of the building without appearing falsely historic.
Exterior Awning/Canopy
There is a non-historic fabric awning over the Park Avenue entrance that will be removed and replaced with an
arched glass and metal unit. The glass and metal canopy above the Montcalm Street entrance will be removed and
replaced with a new canopy, made of contemporary materials, to complement the historic character of the building
without drawing attention away from the existing historic material or appearing falsely historic. The new Montcalm
canopy will be an arched metal frame with black metal panels overhead. Please see the attached drawings for
additional details.
Exterior Signage
Historically, there was a blade sign on the east façade, right near the southeast corner of the building as well as a
hanging blade sign located over the Montcalm entrance. Historically there was painted signage on the brick at the
top of the building. Currently there is signage on the awning that covers the main Park Avenue entrance and applied
letters at the Montcalm entrance.
This project proposes that signage may be added at: A blade sign on the east façade in the southeast corner of the
building and a hanging blade sign on the south façade will both be re-introduced per historic precedence. The signs
currently painted on the brick at the top of the building will be repainted to reflect the historic name for the hotel
(Royal Palm Hotel). A plaque style sign will be installed on the Park Avenue façade adjacent to the main entry doors.
Finally, above the door on Montcalm, there will be revised applied letters with the new Restaurant name.
Exterior Metal Railings and Flagpoles
This project will retain all the decorative metal railings and flagpoles. These railings and flagpoles will be retained,
cleaned, and painted. Any broken or missing pieces shall be repaired or replaced to match the original as closely as
possible.
Windows
Nearly all the windows in the building were replaced in 2005 and they are in good condition. The 2005-era windows
on floors 2-13 are single-hung aluminum units. The windows that were replaced in 2005 will be cleaned and retained
as is.
There are a few areas with older windows that are in poor condition: the windows on the north facade at the 1st floor
are original and are in poor condition, there are two windows in the previous laundry room space that are boarded
over and are in poor condition, and there are a whole column of windows on the west façade that are also in poor
condition. Finally, there are currently steel frame windows in the penthouse in very poor condition.
The first-floor storefronts were removed by a previous owner and were replaced with recessed metal bay window
units with faux copper hoods; these are in good condition.

Page 2 of 3
1420 Broadway   Detroit, MI   48226   p 313 965 3399   f 313 965 3555   www.thekraemeredge.com

 The steel windows in the penthouse will be replaced with new aluminum units to complement the historic character
of the building. The windows that were not replaced in 2005 will be removed and replaced with units that match the
historic windows as closely as possible, these include: the column of windows on the west façade, the two windows
in the laundry area (which will become the new fitness area), and the 1st floor north facade windows. Note that the
replacement windows are all located on secondary facades (the west façade and the north façade).
On the west façade, two new columns of windows are proposed: one column to each side of the center column of
existing windows. Please see the attached drawings for additional details.
Finally, several new punched openings are proposed on the west façade to accommodate louvered panels and fans
for the venting the mechanical equipment. Please see the attached elevations for details.
The bay window units will be retained, inspected, cleaned, and repaired if necessary.
Exterior Roof Scope
The roofing system will be replaced with a new membrane roofing material. The penthouse will be retained and
repaired as necessary and new mechanical units will be added to the roof; they will be placed around the
penthouse. There will be no roof screen. Please see the attached sightline study regarding the visibility of these
rooftop mechanical units.
Lighting
There are currently sconces on the building. These will be replaced with new up/down sconces. Historically, the
building had gooseneck light fixtures that shone down on the painted signs at the top of the building. It is proposed
that these lights will be reintroduced with new gooseneck fixtures—they will be added above the painted signage
on the north façade, the west façade and on the south penthouse. New lighting will be added underneath the
canopies as well. Please see the attached historic photograph.

The items listed above provide a synopsis of the proposed scope of work for the rehabilitation of the Royal Palm
Hotel. Further detail is provided in the attached drawings, photos, and documentation. Please contact Brian Rebain
at Kraemer Design Group if you have any further questions.

Sincerely,
Kraemer Design Group
