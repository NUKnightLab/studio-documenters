III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
During the discussion of request number 3, the following individuals from the Cook County Department of
Public Health (CCDPH) presented additional information: Dr. Terry Mason, Chief Operating Officer, and
Noreen Lanahan, Chief Financial Officer.
In response to a question from Director Gugenheim regarding whether the grant covers the cost of providing
the services, Ms. Lanahan stated that the State identifies all of the public aid recipients that are in this group
that are referred as high-risk patients from the hospital; because the State is the referral agency, they can
estimate the number of cases they expect CCDPH to receive within the next year. CCDPH receives what is
called a maximum allowable amount, which is based on the State’s projection - that constitutes the contract.
CCDPH reviews the number of cases every month, and estimates exactly how much money is needed for the
budget. The maximum amount might be $150,000 over what CCDPH expects to receive in cases, so they
make that analysis, then put the budget together; every month CCDPH monitors the number of patients that
are referred to them by the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services, in order to keep the budget
managed. They only place on the budget the number of employees that they expect to be paid for – CCDPH
has been pretty successful since the inception of the program with ensuring that they do not spend more
money than what is received from the grant.
Board Chairman Carvalho noted that, for some of the grants received by the System and CCDPH, the cost of
the program is greater than the grant, but in order to continue the program, the program is supplemented with
County resources; this particular grant does not fall in that category.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of request
number 3. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
During the discussion of request number 4, Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, presented
additional information. In response to a question from Director Gugenheim regarding whether there will be a
time in the future when the System will be less reliant on the vendor, Health Management Associates (HMA),
for the provision of these interim staffing and transitional services, Dr. Shannon stated that it is difficult to
predict the future; the administration will need to continue to figure out what complexities are going to come
in the next phases of implementation, at both the state and federal levels of policy around reimbursement,
particularly for the System’s biggest population of paid patients, which are its Medicaid patients. However,
there is a strategic intention to bring as much of this expertise in-house as possible, and to develop that
expertise in-house. For services that would be required beyond this calendar year, the administration has the
intention to do a Request for Proposals (RFP) for these types of services.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of request
number 4. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of request
number 5. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Any items listed under Sections III and IV
IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update on CountyCare Health Plan (Attachment #2)
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, reviewed his presentation regarding the Update on the
CountyCare Health Plan, which included information on the following subjects: Illinois and Mandatory
Managed Care; CountyCare Health Plan; Third Party Administrator (TPA) Transition Update; Waiver-toCounty Managed Care Community Network (MCCN); Medicaid Populations Served; Members and Member
Months; Change in Per-Member Per-Month (PMPM) Impact; 1115 Waiver PMPM; County MCCN PMPM;
and Variable PMPM Rates. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
The Committee discussed the subject of communications with CountyCare members and efforts to ensure that
that there is not any confusion resulting from the transition to the new TPA. Mr. Glass stated that there is a
requirement in the contract with the State that requires that communications to members be provided at a sixthgrade reading level. He stated that he has not heard much about confusion from the members; his hope is that
the transition is pretty seamless for the member. Board Chairman Carvalho stated that perhaps this should be
viewed this as an opportunity for primary education on the plan itself for the members.
Dr. Shannon stated that, overall, this is a complex story - it will become more complex as the year progresses.
He added that, as the System starts to bring on these different populations, there will be a need for the
administration to communicate the complexity, as well as manage it.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved to receive and file the
presentation regarding the Update on the CountyCare Plan. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Report from System Director of Supply Chain Management
A. Report of emergency purchases
There were no emergency purchases to report at this time.

VI. Report from Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #3)
A. Financial Reports through May 2014 (Attachment #4)
John Cookinham, System Chief Financial Officer, reviewed the information presented in his update on
financial matters. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Mr. Cookinham stated that the administration is attempting to lessen the complexity of the information
presented; from this point forward, he will continue to provide the very detailed financial reports, but he will
also produce a summary that will reduce the complexity of the reports and hopefully make them more
understandable. He added that the administration will strive to provide a separate, high-level report on
CountyCare each month.
During the discussion of the information provided regarding the cost for the provision of health care services,
including mental health care services, at Cermak Health Services of Cook County, Director Gugenheim stated
that the System is obligated by the Department of Justice’s order to provide that care; she surmised that the
County’s appropriation for this purpose is not enough to cover the cost. Mr. Cookinham responded that,
through this point in the year, that is what is being reported. Director Gugenheim stated that, from a financial
standpoint, this really ties to the issue of trying to solve the question of what to do with mentally ill people who
are picked up off the streets and end up in the jail system, as opposed to providing them access to some
behavioral health management system. Dr. Shannon stated that they hope to be able to demonstrate that for
those detainees that become CountyCare members, they would be the experimental group to see whether the
costs to provide care could be reduced. He noted that the costs reflected in these materials are perhaps a
conservative estimate of the cost to provide services to the detainees at Cermak; he added that the provision of
those services is an unfunded mandate.
Director Gugenheim thanked Mr. Cookinham for his report, and asked that the minutes reflect that this was an
excellent presentation that really helps to understand the overall picture.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved to receive and file the
Report from the Chief Financial Officer and the Financial Reports through May 2014.
THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:

The Cook County Health and Hospitals System Board approved a contract with Digby?s Detective and
Security Agency, Inc. on 03/28/2013 in the amount of $910,707.84 for security services for the Ambulatory Clinics and
the Hoyne building to ensure the safety of the patients, visitors and staff. The contract was awarded for a period of 24
months from 05/01/2013 thru 04/30/2015.

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:

The scope of work for Provident Hospital has been reviewed and revised. The scope of work has been reduced to be
comparable with the current environment and will yield no negative impact to the safety of our patients and staff. A
Request for Quotation was issued to our two incumbents. The results of the scope of services utilized for the RFQ
which are more closely aligned with true requirements will result in savings of $1 ,213,1 12.70. in keeping with our
desire to standardize across all facilities and based upon both responses received to our Request for
Quotation proposal, we requested to amend and increase the current contract with Digby?s Detective Security
Agency in the amount of $1 ,592,307.30 for fifteen (15) months and to make the contract amendment coterminous with
the original contract period. Subsequently, negotiations broke down with Digby and they withdrew from taking over the
Security responsibilities at Provident Hospital. We requested Star Security to stay on and they agreed. This request is
to correct the record and to request approval to extend and increase the co 

the Digby contract for the ACHN clinics so that appropriate due diligence 0

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended May 31, 2014. This discussion focuses on
the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current month. It
should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of the
CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Starting this fiscal year 2013, we have added the
Medicaid Expansion. Collectively, these entities provide primary, intermediate, acute,
and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to pay. The Bureau of
Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2012 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and Cook County Board Officials
collaborated to cut Medicaid costs, help county taxpayers, and transform Cook County’s
hospital system by jump-starting national health care reform in Cook County. In
November, 2012 the federal governmnent approved the 1115 Medicaid Waiver for Cook
County, allowing CCHHS to enroll more than 115,000 individuals who will be eligible
for Medicaid in 2014 into a Cook County network with no cost to the state of Illinois.
Medicaid Expansion allows the Cook County’s Health System to early enroll certain
uninsured patients into Medicaid. Specifically, these are patients who are not currently
eligible for Medicaid, but who will be eligible in 2014 under the Accountable Care Act.
Many of these individuals are patients who already are being treated by our system
without compensation. The Waiver is funded entirely by the federal government.

May-2014 increased by 9 to 114 days. Additionally, there was a 3 day increase in this
figure, as compared to the previous month’s figure.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage, including the
Medicaid Expansion Program and MANG applications;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Total billed accounts grew by $33.313M (10.4%) as compared to the November-2013
balance. As compared to the previous month, this figure increased by $19.232M (5.8%).
The growth in this figure indicates a decreasing number of accounts are completing the
collection process, which includes charity care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity

 care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for Medicaid Expansion Program patients is
made through a per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of May-2014 increased by
$3.573M (42.2%), as compared the November 30, 2013 balance and increased by
$1.200M (11.1%), as compared to the previous month’s balance. This indicates that
fewer inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous
month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for Medicaid Expansion Program patients is
made through a per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of May-2014 increased by $28.273M (17.7%) as
compared to the November 30, 2013 balance. This figure grew by $2.257M (1.2%)
compared to the previous month’s total.
The increase in this number indicates fewer accounts had the collection process
completed than in the previous month and that less accounts are being removed from
active accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity care and bad
debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
up on the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for Medicaid Expansion Program patients is
made through a per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts increased by $2.582M (23.8%) by the end of
May-2014, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2013. This
balance was $5.954M (-30.7%) less than the previous month’s balance. This change
indicates that more outpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to
the previous month.

 The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.

Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of May-2014 increased by $5.040M
(3.1%), as compared to the balance as of November 30, 2013. This figure is $16.975M
(11.4%) greater than last month’s figure.
The growth in this figure indicates that fewer Out-Patient accounts had their collection
and write-off related activities completed, as compared to the prior month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

 For the current fiscal year, Nonoperating revenues allocated to CCHHS are Cigarette
Tax, Other Tobacco products and Firearms Tax. There is no Sales Tax allocated to
CCHHS for the current fiscal year.

Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

The OFHC FFS budget has been combined with the SHCC FFS budget due to the configuration of CCHHS system that treats OFHC as a SHCC clinic.

The $ -30,000,000 in the BIPA this month reflects the payback of the $30,000,000 advance CCHHS received in FY 2013 for the Medicaid
Expansion / 1115 Waiver program. The advance and repayment were included on the report as BIPA revenue, since the payment was made as
a BIPA payment and not as a Medicaid Expansion / 1115 Waiver program payment.
Beginning March-2014, the capitation for the Medicaid Expansion program is paid at 100% instead of 50%.
The Medicaid fee-for-service revenue through the IGT covers the period beginning week ended 04/23/2014 - 05/14/2014.
Vendor Payments From Revenue are payments out of revenue posted by the County Comptroller. Pharmacy Billing and Revenue Enhancement
payments are reductions to Medicaid revenue. Collection Agency payments are reductions to Self-Pay (Other) revenue. Physician Billing
payments include refunds processed by CCHHS. Included in the "Revenue Enhancement" totals are payments to the state for supplemental
workers hired to help process CountyCare and MANG applications.
The Meaningful Use budget was spread over 12 months, as it was not known at the time the budget was created in which month this payment
will be received. Meaningful Use includes both the Medicare and Medicaid portions. The Meaningful Use payment is detailed as follows:
