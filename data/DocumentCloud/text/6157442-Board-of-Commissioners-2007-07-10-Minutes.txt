RESOLUTION AMENDMENT
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII, Section
6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution; and

2404

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY I 0, 2007

WHEREAS, pursuant to its home rule power, the County of Cook may exerc ise any power and perform
any function relating to its government and affairs including the power to regulate for the protection of
the public health, safety, morals, and welfare; and
WHEREAS, to this end, the County of Cook is dedicated to providing all of its residents with fair and
equal access to the services, opportunities, and protection county government has been established to
administer; and
WHEREAS, there are now approximately 12 million undocumented immigrants in the United States,
including half a million in Illinois and more than 300,000 who live in communities throughout Cook
County, working full-time jobs, paying taxes, and contributing to Social Security and Medicare; and
WHEREAS, conditioning the provision of benefits, opportunities, and services on citizenship or
immigrant status or inquiring about such status in the course of such provision directly contravenes the
County 's commitment to ensuring fair and equal access for a ll of its res idents; and
WHEREAS, the enforcement of civil immigration laws has historically been a federal government
responsibility, a power vested first in the Immigration and Naturalization Service and then in the
Department of Homeland Security; and
WHEREAS, initiatives such as the proposed Federal Clear Law Enforcement for Criminal Alien
Removal Act, which would require local governments to give their local law enforcement agencies
express authority to enforce immigration laws, also s ignals pressure to expend limited local resources on
traditionally federal functions; and
WHEREAS, encouraging local governments that are not specifically equipped or trained to implement
immigration measures is likely to result in inconsistencies and decentralization that undermine instead of
strengthen these measures; and
WHEREAS, as a matter of public safety, the protection of an individual's citizenship and immigrant
status will engender trust and cooperation between Jaw enforcement officials and immigrant communities
to aid in crime prevention and solving, including human and drug trafficking, prostitution, domestic
violence, and even terrorism, and will discourage the threat of immigrant and racial profiling and
harassment; and
WHEREAS, according to the National Immigration Law Center, nearly 50 cities and counties throughout
the U.S. have enacted "Sanctuary Laws'', prohibiting their agencies from inquiring about immigration
status and unilaterally enforcing immigration law provi sions including Cambridge, Chicago, Los Angeles,
and Seattle and several states, including A laska, Maine and Oregon; and
WHEREAS, by means of th is Resolution, Cook County j oins states, cities, and counties across the nation
by declaring itself a "Fair and Eq ual County for Immigrants", which means that Cook County ensures fair
and equal access to essential benefits, opportunities, and services by prohibiting Cook County bureaus,
offices, departments, or employees or other Cook County agencies or agents from inquiring or disclosing
information about immigration status.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that except as provided below or when otherwise required
by law, no Cook County bureau, office, department, employee, or other Cook County agency or agent
shall condition the provision of Cook County benefits, opportunities, or services on matters related to
citizenship or immigrant statust. Municipalities, townships, library, school and park districts shall not be
considered agents of Cook County; and

2405

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2007

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that it shall be the policy of the Cook County Sheriff's Office not to
assist in the investigation of the citizenship or immigrant status of any person unless such inquiry or
investigation is (a) integrally related to an investigation by the Cook County Sheriff's Office regarding a
matter other than the individual 's citizenship or immigrant status, such as criminal smuggling and
harboring of immigrants, or other crimes that have as an element of the crime the illegality of a person 's
presence, or (b) as otherwise required by law. The Cook County Sheriff's Office shall not make inquiries
into immigration status for the sole purpose of detennining whether an individual has violated the civil
immigration laws; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that except when otherwise required by law, no Cook County bureau,
office, department, or employee or other Cook County agency or agent shall disclose information
regarding the citizenship or immigrant status of any person unless required to do so by law or such
disclosure has been authorized in writing by the individual to whom such information pertains, or if such
individual is a minor or is otherwise not legally competent, by such individual 's parent or guardian; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Bureau of Health Services ("CCBH") shall not
condition the provision of health benefits, opportunities, or services on matters related to citizenship or
immigrant status, but may, in the course of determining eligibility for benefits or seeking reimbursement
from state, federal, or other third party payers, inquire about immigrant status for the sole purpose of such
a determination or receipt of reimbursement from said sources and, to such extent as the disclosure of
such information is related to such a determination or receipt of reimbursement, the provisions of this
Resolution and any subsequent ordinance do not apply to the CCBH; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that except when otherwise required by law, where presentation of an
Illinois driver' s license or identification card is accepted as adequate evidence of identity, presentation of
a photo identity document issued by the person's nation of origin, such as a driver's license, passport, or
matricula consular (consulate-issued document) shall be accepted and shall not subject the person to a
higher level of scrutiny or different treatment than if the person had provided an Illinois driver' s license
or identification card except that this provision does not apply to the completion of the federally mandated
1-9 forms provided, however, that a request for translation of such document to English shall not be
deemed a violation of any provision of this Resolution and any subsequent ordinance; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Resolutio n does not create or form the basis for liability on
the part of the County, its agents, or agencies. The exclusive remedy for violation of this Resolution sha ll
be through the County 's disciplinary procedures for officers and employees under regulations including,
but not limited to, County personnel rules, union contracts, civil service commission rules, or any other
agency rules and/or regulations. Any person alleging a violation of thi s Resolution shall forward a

of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and perform any function
pertaining to its government and affairs; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2007

WHEREAS, on Apri l 24, 2002, the Hon. Paul Biebel, Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division of the
Circuit Court of Cook County, appointed Edward J. Egan as Special State's Attorney and Robert D.
Boyle as C hief Deputy Special State's Attorney to investigate allegations that Area 2 Commander Jon
Burge and Chicago Police officers under his command had systematically tortured scores of African
American citizens at the Area 2 and 3 police headquarters; and
WHEREAS, the investigation conducted by Special Prosecutors Egan and Boyle consumed over four
years and cost the taxpayers of Cook County approximately $7 million dollars to date; and
WHEREAS, in July 2006 Egan and Boyle submitted their investigative Report to the Cook County
Board of Commissioners and concluded that although their investigation justified seeking indictments
that they were barred from doing so by the Illinois statute of limitations; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2007

WHEREAS, there exists the Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance, as from time to time
amended (amended November 29, 1976; June 6, 1977; September 19, 1977; May 16, 1978; January 2,
1979; March 3, 1980; September 2, 1980; October 3, 1983; April 2, 1984, November 18, 1985; May 19,

2001; April 9, 2002; July 13, 2004; December 14, 2004; January 18, 2006; February 15, 2006; November
2, 2006; and May 15, 2007); and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance contains a number of
findings by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, including the following: 1) that in certain areas of
Cook County there is a lack of viable industrial buildings which contribute to substantial unemployment
in such areas; 2) that if existing industrial structures were improved and utilized fully, and if new
industrial structures were developed, the County's economic well-being would be improved by an
increase in the level of economic activity, by increased employment opportunities and by a growth in the
real property tax base; and 3) that the creation of new property tax classifications for new development of
industrial structures, or the substantial rehabilitation and re-utilization of existing industrial structures, for
the County as a whole, is an appropriate and necessary method of providing such assistance and
encouragement, and will result in increasing the tax base for the entire County; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance provides for a Class
6b development incentive, and corresponding reduced assessment level of 16% of market value, which is
available for real estate used primarily for industrial purposes where existing industrial structures have
been improved, more fully utilized, or where new industrial structures have been developed; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance currently defines
" real estate used for industrial purposes" to mean any real estate used primarily in manufacturing, as
defined, or in the extraction or processing of raw materials unserviceable in their natural state to create
new physica l products or materials, or in the processing of materials fo r recycling, or in the transportation
or storage of raw materials or finished physical goods in the wholesale distribution of such materials or
goods for sale or leasing; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance currently defines
" manufacturing" to mean the material staging and production of goods used in procedures commonly
regarded as manufacturing, processing, fabrication, or assembling which changes existing materials into
new shapes, new qualities, or new combinations and including research and development associated with
the production of goods; and
WHEREAS, the definition of real estate used for industrial purposes and the definition of mam!facturing
were first defined in the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance by amendment
on May 19, 1986 and said definitions have remained the same since that time, except for an amendment
on November 23 , 1999 that expanded the definitions by adding the current language regarding the
" processing of materials for recycling" as well the current language regarding " research and development
associated with the production of goods"; and
WHEREAS, a number of businesses have put forth the proposition to use real estate to create and build
high-technology enterprises, commonly referred to as "Data Centers" or " Data Farms", which facilities
are a minimum of 100,000 square feet and are used to store large amounts of electronic data and
information on computers, computer servers, communications equipment and other electronic equipment;
and

2409

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2007

WHEREAS, the real estate used for the Data Centers and Data Farms includes real estate used to create a
data center and internet exchange service that offers co-location, traffic exchange, peering and
outsourcing of information technology infrastructure, all of which allow for direct access to a large
number of network providers giving the user a secure, fault-tolerant, redundant internet infrastructure to
be used in the management and control of the user's own network and internet operations; and
WHEREAS, businesses have inquired whether Data Centers and Data Farms would qualify under the
Class 6b development incentive provided for by the Cook County Real Property Assessment
Classification Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, Data Centers and Data Farms are a recent creation and did not exist in 1986 when the
definitions of " real estate used for industrial purposes" and "manufacturing" were first adopted; and
WHEREAS, the use of real estate to support Data Centers or Data Farms is the type of use that provides
an increase in the level of economic activity as well as an increase in employment opportunities and
growth in the real property tax base, all of which contributes to the County's economic well-being,
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners believes that the use of real estate by Data
Centers and Data Farms is the type of use of real estate that should qualify for the Class 6b development
incentive offered through the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, other industries have changed and evolved over the past twenty years due to the creation of
new computer and internet technologies as well as information technologies that did not exist when the
current definitions regarding industrial use were last drafted for the Cook County Real Property
Assessment Classification Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, there may exist some ambiguity as to whether the use of real estate to support other types of
businesses engaged in the creation of computer and internet technology as well as information technology
and products qualifies as the type of use to support a C lass 6b industrial development incentive pursuant
to the Cook County Assessment Classification Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board recognizes that such ambiguity may cause hi-tech business entities
to forego development of their operations in Cook County thereby adversely impacting the economic
well-being of the County through a decrease in the level of economic activity, a decrease in employment
opportunities and a stagnation of the real property tax base; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board desires to promote the use of real estate to support business entities
engaged in hi-tech industry such as those that create computer and internet technology as well as
information technology and products in order that the County remain economically competitive and to
promote and aid in the creation of hi-tech employment opportunities; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board has determined that there is a need to review and amend the Cook
County Real Property Assessment C lassification Ordinance to clarify that real estate used for industrial
purposes includes use by business entities engaged in the creation of computer and internet technology as
well as infonnation technology and products.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that:
Section 1. The above referenced recital s are hereby incorporated into this Resolution.

2410

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY IO, 2007

Section 2. The use of real estate in Cook County to support Data Farms or Data Centers should
be considered real estate used for industrial purposes pursuant to the Cook County Real Property
Assessment Classification Ordinance and as such is the type of use that generally qualifies for a Class 6b
development incentive pursuant to that ordinance.
Section 3. The Real Estate & Business & Economic Development Subcommittee of this Board
should consider the issue of whether the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification
Ordinance has been kept current to reflect the use of real estate by business entities engaged in the
creation of computer and or internet technology as well as information technology and products and make
recommendations as to any appropriate amendments to the Cook County Real Property Assessment
Classification Ordinance.
In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(h )(I), Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by
Commissioner Daley, moved to suspend the rules so that this matter may be considered. The motion
carried unanimously.

Commissioner Schneider, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the Proposed Resolution be

WHEREAS, conditioning the provision of benefits, opportuntttes, and services on

Chairman Daley entered into the record an opinion submitted by the State's Attorney's Office pertaining
to Communication No. 284063. Chairman Daley indicated that Communication No. 284063 is being
moved for discussion purposes only, and that the intent is to defer this Item pending further review by the
State's Attorney's Office. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Chairman Daley stated that the Administration has some concerns regarding the State's Attorney 's Office
rendering an opinion on this issue, but that a number of Commissioners had requested such an opinion in
May.
Chairman Daley asked Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State's Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, to
give an overview of the opinion.
Mr. Driscoll stated one of the most important issues found to be problematic is the applicability of this
ordinance to independently elected officials, unless the elected officials were going to move to opt-in to
such an ordinance. If a certain elected official did such an opt-in procedure, it likely would not bind a
subsequent elected official in that same office. Also, there are questions whether or not this ordinance
would change the form of government of Cook County because it would allow an Inspector General
appointed by this Board to conduct criminal investigations, and to seek contempt sanctions against those
who might not be cooperative. Mr. Driscoll continued by stating it would also infringe upon the powers
of the State's Attorney to perform independent investigations. The State's Attorney has the power of
subpoena issued by a grand jury, which is far different and far more substantive than an administrative
subpoena that would be used by an Inspector General.
In response to Commissioner Quigley's question regarding a distinction among some of the elected
officials, Mr. Driscoll replied the State's Attorney and the Clerk of the Circuit Court are State officers
created by the Constitution in the Judiciary Article. There are other offices, such as the Sheriff, that are
created by separate Article in the Constitution, as well as the Recorder of Deeds, the County Clerk and the
County Treasurer.
In response to Commissioner Quigley's inquiry as to whether the emp loyees of the Offices of the State's
Attorney and the Clerk of the Circuit Court are governed under different ethics measures by the State, Mr.
Driscoll replied the State Inspector General statute does not govern them.
Chairman Daley asked the representative from the Sheriff's Office, Peter Kramer, Sheriff's Legal
Counsel, to comment on this provision of the Ordinance.

2513

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2007

Mr. Kramer stated the Sheriff's office has its own Inspector General who investigates all complaints of
misconduct, whether it is sworn or non-sworn personnel. With respect to sworn personnel, Mr. Kramer
stated after twenty-nine days, they have to be disciplined before the Merit Board.
Commissioner Quigley suggested that an "opt-in" measure be included in the Ordinance, allowing those
elected officials whose offices do not have an inspector general function to voluntarily come under the
purview of the County 's Inspector General' s Ordinance.
Mr. Driscoll replied that this is a possibility.
Commissioner Beavers voiced his opposition to the Ordinance, stating that numerous investigatory bodies
already exist.
Chairman Daley stated that the Office of the President is currently seeking an outside legal opinion on
this matter. He further stated the position of the Administration is that the Ordinance applies to all elected
officials.
Chairman Daley has been asked by the Administration to state their position on this Ordinance.
Richard Velazquez, Special Counsel to the President, delivered remarks on behalf of the Administration' s
position: The Ordinance applies to all elected County officials. These officials all receive County
taxpayer funding, and it is the Pres ident' s will to ensure that these monies are being spent correctly.
Further, the abi lity to investigate a ll elected officials falls within the County 's Home Rule powers.
Commissioner Silvestri noted that except for reducing an elected official 's budget, there is no way to
enforce this Ordinance. He suggested that the various elected officials be invited to opt-in to the
Ordinance.
Mr. Driscoll stated that, were the County to not adequately fund an e lected official's office to the point
where they could not perform their statutory core functions, the elected official could seek legal redress.
He further stated that this issue would hinge o n the definition of "adequate."
Chairman Daley reminded the members that when the County Board approved the ethics and human
rights ordinances, they did not apply to the separately elected officials.
Commissioner Claypool inquired whether there was a limit to the Board 's power to contro l the money
allocated to an elected official, once it passes Board approval and is in the hands of the elected official.
This question was posed to determine whether the ordinance amendment would limit the control of an
elected official.
Mr. Driscoll replied that the Board monitors expenditures on a monthly basis through the trial balance,
and can see from that document what the elected official is spending. He further stated that monitoring
what is being done by an elected official is not controlling what that official does; it is simply oversight or
observation. Controlling operations of an elected official who has statutory internal control wou ld not
pass muster.
Commissioner Murphy voiced her opposition to this Ordinance, stating that another layer of investigation
is unnecessary. She further stated that elected officials should not be part of thi s Ordinance.
Commissioner Peraica commented that the State 's Attorney 's Office interpreted this Ordinance too
narrowly and did not take into account the spirit and intent of the Ordinance 's proposed changes. He
inquired whether the Ordinance would violate the separation of powers among the three branches of
government under the Illinois Constitution.

25 14

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2007

Mr. Driscoll replied in the affirmative. He emphasized that the power of the Board ends with its ability to
fund the offices of elected officials; the Board has no power over the day-to-day operations of these
offices.
Vice Chairman Sims inquired whether a person could ask for an investigation by the Inspector General
against individual Board members, or any elected official.
Mr. Driscoll replied in the affirmative, if the Ordinance were passed in its present form.
In response to an inquiry from Vice Chairman Sims regarding the applicability of the Ordinance to all
elected officials, Mr. Velazquez stated that it is the intent of the President that the Ordinance apply to all
of the elected officials. In his opinion it would not take any power away from the offices of elected
officials, nor would it affect their operations. He further stated that, with all due respect to Mr. Driscoll,
the Office of the President is seeking an outside opinion concerning whether the Ordinance would be
applicable to all elected officials or just certain elected officials.
Vice Chairman Sims inquired whether there is any case law setting precedence that relates to this issue.
Mr. Velazquez replied that he was not aware of any, but that he could look into this and respond to Vice
Chairman Sims.
Vice Chairman Sims indicated that, since there is an opinion being issued by the State's Attorney's
Office, and also an outside opinion being sought by the Office of the President, perhaps the Board should
commission an opinion as well. Vice Chairman Sims stated this issue of seeking legal opinions from
others is setting a precedent.
Mr. Driscoll indicated that the State's Attorney's Office arrived at their opinion without an agenda and
without a vested interest. He further stated that this Ordinance, once passed, would be presumed valid
until overturned by a court.

V, Sections 2-283, be hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 2-283.

Purpose of office.

The purpose of the Office of Independent Inspector General is to detect, deter and
prevent corruption, fraud, waste, mismanagement, unlawful political discrimination or
misconduct in the operation of County government. For purposes of this Ordinance,
" unlawful political discrimination" shall be defined as follows: conduct affecting a nonexempt employee's hiring, firing or terms and conditions of employment based on
political reasons and factors. Such political reasons and factors, include the following:

2515

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2007

W

Recommendations for hiring, promotion or other employment terms for
specific persons from public office holders or political party officials that are not based
on personal knowledge of the person's work skills, work experience or other job-related
qual ifications.

ill

The fact that the person worked in a political camoaign or belongs to a
political organization or political party. Or the fact that the person chose not to work in a
political campaign or to belong to a political organization or a political party. The mere
fact that a person worked for a political campaign for elective office does not prohibit
consideration of a recommendation related to that person insofar as the basis for that
recommendation relates to the person 's relevant work experience.
(£}
The fact that the person contributed money, raised money or provided
something else of value to a candidate for public office or a political organization. Or the
fact that the person chose not to contribute or raise money for a candidate for public
office or a political organization.
@
The fact that the person is a Democrat or a Republican or a member of any
other political party or group. Or the fact that the applicant is not a member.

UD_
The fact that the person expressed views or beliefs on political matters such
as what candidates or elected officials he or she favored or opposed, what public policy
issue he or she favored or opposed, or what views on government actions or failures to
act he or she expressed.
Commissioner Suffredin referred to page ten of the State's Attorney 's opm1on, and stated that
Amendment #2 offers a definition and examples of " unlawful political discrimination," and should be
helpful and provide guidance.

Leave was granted to add all commissioners as co-sponsors of Amendment #2.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved the approval of Amendment #2
to Communication No. 284063. The motion carried.
AMENDMENT #3 TO COMMUNICATION NUMBER 284603

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE BOARD OF COMM ISSIONERS OF COOK COUNTY,
ILLINOIS that Communication # 284063 related to C hapter 2, Divi sion Y , Sections 2284 be hereby amended as fo llows:

Section 2-284. Functions, authority and powers.
[.Ll} To provide a proposed budget request within 90 days of his/her initial appointment
and annually thereafter pursuant to the County's fiscal year budget rules and regulations.

Commissioner Murphy inquired whether ninety days is enough time to work with an inherited budget and
create a new budget.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that within the first ninety days the Board would need to know what fund
transfers are required.
Chainnan Daley inquired what the current budget is for a new Inspector General 's Office.

25 16

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2007

Commissioner Suffredin replied that depending on the timing of the passage of the Ordinance, the Board
may only need to fund one quarter of one year; he does, however, believe additional funding will be
needed, and further expects the Board will have to find some additional revenues to fund this office.

Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved the approval of Amendment #3
to Communication No. 284063. T he motion carried.
AMENDMENT #4 TO COMMUNICATION NUMBER 284063
Sponsor:

Commissioner Larry Suffredin.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF COOK COUNTY,
ILLINOIS that Communication # 284063 related to Chapter 2, Division V, Sections 2287, be hereby amended as follows:

Section 2-287. Quarter ly reports.
Add:

ill

Upon receipt of such reports, the Cook County Board, may take appropriate action,
such as referring the report to a Board committee for further consideration, receiving and
filing, approving or rejecting such report.

Commissioner Suffredin noted that if a report from the Office of the Inspector General was rejected by
the Board, the Board would have to provide specific reasons, such as that the report was not thorough
enough. This process is similar to the process utilized at the State level by the Joint Committee on
Administrative Rules. It is his belief that the Board shou ld be able to take actions (including making
recommendations) on a report.
C hairman Daley inquired whether the Board would have to provide a reason for rejecting a report.
Commissioner Suffredin replied that there would be a record of the Board's discussion concerning any
rejection of a report. The Board would not have to send any document back to the Inspector General's
Office to reject the report. Amendment #3 does not intend to create dialogue between the Inspector
General's Office and the Board. It simply allows the Board to let its will be known to the Office of the
Inspector General.

Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Quigley, moved the approval of Amendment
#4 to Communication No. 284063. T he motion carried.
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved to defer consideration of the

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR WLY 10, 2007

*****
Commissioner Suffredin requested that Ms. Lechowicz Felicione, Special Counsel to the President,
clarify the provisions of the proposed Substitute Ordinance.
Ms. Lechowicz Felicione provided the following explanatory remarks: This Substitute Ordinance
provides for requirements that all potential bidders and proposers certify that they have paid all municipal
and state taxes and that they have a certificate of good standing with the State of Illinois. They must be in
compliance will the County's Ethics Code, specifically the campaign disclosure provisions and provisions
regarding receiving and soliciting gifts. They must execute an economic disclosure statement that is
currently being drafted by the Purchasing Department, including persons or entities who have made
lobbying contracts on behalf of the vendor with respect to the contract. Detailed procedures regarding the
competitive bidding process have been implemented in this Ordinance, as well as detailed procedures
regarding requests for proposals and requests for qualifications process. This wou ld require, unless
otherwise approved by the Board, that all contracts over $25,000 that are professional services types of
contracts to be issued through a request for proposal or a request for qualification. The Ordinance calls
for the Purchasing Department to initiate an electronic procurement system. There are now official
provisions regarding sole-source requirements and emergency procurement and there have been
enhancements to the disqualification procedures including disqualifications for failing to pay childsupport payments.
Commissioner Murphy asked whether the Jiving wage is provided for in this Substitute Ordinance.
Ms. Lechowicz Felicione responded that the new living wage which was recently submitted by
Commissioner Maldonado and approved by the Board is included in the Substitute Ordinance.
Commissioner Quigley inquired how vendors who have performed at less than peak level or are somehow
problematic (e.g. didn 't pay their s ubcontractors) are treated under this Substitute Ordinance.
Ms. Lechowicz Felicione replied that this would constitute a failure to perform and would result in a
default on the contract.
Chairman Daley inquired as to the status of an individual who has been disqualified but afterwards forms
a new company.
Ms. Lechowicz Felicione replied that if a new contractual entity is fonned, it wouldn ' t possess an
automatic default status. She requested that Carmen Triche-Colvin, County Purchasing Agent, provide
further detail.
Ms. Triche-Colvin stated that the economic disclosure form (EDF) asks whether an individual has
defaulted on any contract. Upon learning this, the Purchasing Department would recommend that the
company not be awarded the contract.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether there are provisions for any of the following: failure to comply
with occupational health and safety laws, minimum wage laws and labor laws; being in debt to the
County.
Ms. Triche-Colvin replied that all of these provisions are covered in the economic disclosure fonn; fraud
and other crimes (as well as any ongoing investigation by the State or Federal government) are accounted
for as well.

2558

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2007

Commissioner Collins voiced concern over the number of contracts that the Board awards to out-of-State
entities, and that provisions she introduced to curb this are not being complied with.
Ms. Triche-Colvin replied that the Local Business Preference Ordinance is enforced, but only applies to
those entities within Cook County. Also, the new economic disclosure form requires that all partners of a
company be listed on the form.
Commissioner Gorman inquired as to the request for proposal (RFP), and request for qualifications (RFQ)
process.
Ms. Lechowicz Felicione stated a template is being drafted by the Purchasing Department that will be
used countywide. It defines the process, the conduct of the evaluation process, and ensures it is posted on
the County' s website. Once the using department has made a selection, the recommendation will be
brought to the County Board for final approval.
Commissioner Peraica was assured the debarment period for default or termination of a vendor was not
changed from the original ordinance. In response to Commissioner Peraica' s inquiry as to whether there
is justification to have a differentiation in terms of the amount of time that a vendor is prohibited from
doing business with the County, Mr. Driscoll replied there can be differentials, and that it is a policy
question.
Commissioner Murphy indicated that future amendments to this Ordinance should be considered which
relate to providing vendors from the state of Illinois the same two percent local business preference as
Cook County vendors; and increasing the threshold from $25,000 to $50,000.

Leave was granted to add all commissioners as co-sponsors of the Substitute Ordinance
Amendment.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Quigley, moved that the Substitute Ordinance
Amendment for Communication No. 285682 be approved and adopted. The motion carried.

WHEREAS, it is equally crucial that the citizenry have absolute faith in the integrity of
the electoral process by which our public officials are chosen; and
WHEREAS, to accomplish this, the County of Cook has adopted certain rules and
regulations including campaign finance laws that establish , among other things,
limitations on the amounts of political contributions that may be made by individuals and
entities doing business with the County, regi stered lobbyists and other entities that have
an interest in influencing the policies and decisions of County government; and
WH EREAS, these laws limit the amount of money that such individuals and entities
may contribute to candidates for public office to $ 1,500 during a single candidacy and
$3 ,000 during an election year; and
WHEREAS, it is the intent of the elected officials w ithin the County of Cook to reduce
the abi lity of entities to brazenly ignore these limitations, thereby restoring faith in the
integrity of the e lectoral process and the candidates who might otherwise benefit from
these abuses; and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook wishes to strengthen its campaign finance laws to
prevent persons or entities with a financial or other interest in the decisions made by
County government from attempting to manipulate the County's campaign finance laws
through cynica lly c lever and circuitous financing and contribution methods; and

WHEREAS, this ordinance is intended to put an end to this untenable situation, to close
any real or perceived loopholes, and to avoid future abuses of the County 's campaign
finance laws by the very people these laws were intended to constrain.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that Chapter 2, Article VII, Sections 2-561, 2-585 and 2-601 of the Cook
County Code are hereby amended as follows:
Division 2. Code of Ethical Conduct
Subdivision I. In General
Sec. 2-561. Definitions.
Sec. 2-585. Limitations of contributions to candidates and elected officials.
Sec. 2-601. Employment sanctions.
*Referred to the Committee on Finance on 04/18/07.
Commissioner Beavers, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved approval of the Proposed
Ordinance Amendment (Communication No. 286277).
Commissioner Suffredin inquired whether the Chicago Federation of Labor, AFSCME Council 3 1 and
other labor umbrella groups with whom the County has no contracts would be included under this
Ordinance.
Commissioner Beavers replied in the affirmative. He further stated that this Ordinance would apply to
any union organization that has a contract with Cook County.
Commissioner Suffredin contested that this Ordinance expands the County's jurisdiction well beyond the
Board's authority. He averred that Organized Labor is a protected class at the state and federal level and
that County employees have the right, under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, to
participate in the electoral process.
Commissioner Silvestri requested an opinion on this matter from the State's Attorney's Office.
Driscoll agreed to provide this.

Mr.

Commissioner Murphy stated that it is very difficult for a candidate to raise money. She further stated
that she does not believe, given the state and federal laws on this matter that the electorate should be
subject to further restrictions.
Vice Chairman Sims agreed, particularly as a representative from a less affluent district.
Chairman Daley inquired whether this Ordinance would prohibit a political organization from
contributing over $1500 to a candidate.
Commissioner Beavers replied in the negative. He further stated the Ordinance limits contributions from
these entities to $1500 per committee. An organization can have, for example, five committees, so its
total contribution would be $7500.
Commissioner Murphy opined that there is a distinct difference between a vendor who has a contract with
the County and a union, which is comprised of employees and is not a registered lobbyist.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY IO, 2007

Commissioner Peraica urged the passage of this Ordinance.
The Commissioners agreed to defer thi s item until the State's Attorney 's Office provides an opinion on
the matter. Chairman Daley requested that the opinion define the term, " political organization."
Commissioner Silvestri requested that the opinion address the scope of the Ordinance, including to whom
it would apply, such as unions that have collective bargaining agreements with the County as well as
umbrella groups comprised of individual labor organizations.
Commissioner Beavers, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved to defer consideration of the
Proposed Ordinance Amendment (Communication No. 286277). The motion carried.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Audit Committee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Monday, June 18, 2007 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118
North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.

2672

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2007
Chairman Daley began the meeting by requesting leave of the Committee to allow Donna L. Dunnings,
Chief Financial Officer, to address the issue of the difference between the date of an audit report and the
date the report is issued to the Board.
Ms. Dunnings detailed the new procedures and mechanisms that she has installed since she has taken over
as Chief Financial Officer that should ensure consistency, timeliness and synchronicity in audit review
processes. This involves cooperation across bureaus and departments. For example, she has been
working with the Chief Information Officer to make sure any issues regarding fixed assets are worked
out. She also meets weekly with the audit team and holds status hearings to ensure deadlines are being
met. She stated that she now has a Director of Financial Reporting who is managing the whole process;
once staff training and all new procedures are in place, it is her goal to have the process running smoothly
within the next two to three years.
Chairman Daley requested that a letter from Laura Burman, Cook County Auditor, be made a part of the
record. This letter was sent to the Audit Committee members and addresses the issue. (The referenced
document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Commissioner Quigley inquired as to the reason for the delay in receiving independent audit results. He
wondered whether the delay was attributable to the management response.
Chairman Daley responded that he believes that may be part of the reason, however he suggested that Ms.
Dunnings and Ms. Burman address Commissioner Quigley 's question.
Ms. Dunnings stated that with regard to the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, it was more of a
training issue to ensure that timelines were being followed. She added that representatives from Deloitte
& Touche, LLP were present and could discuss improvements that have been seen in this process.
In response to a question by Commissioner Quigley regarding the flow of an audit once finished by an
independent auditor, Ms. Dunnings replied that the finished audit first goes to the Comptroller and Chief
Financial Officer for their review. These individuals then meet with the Administration to review the
audit and to provide input in terms of management response and resolution of issues.

Commissioner Quigley asked when the Board should expect to see the final audits, under the improved
process described by Ms. Dunnings.
Chairman Daley added specificity to Commissioner Quigley's question, posing the question of when the
Board should expect the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the Fiscal Year ended November
30, 2006, under the improved process.
Ms. Dunnings stated that it is recommended that the Board receive the completed audit within six to nine
months after the end of the fiscal year.
Commissioner Quigley commented that if there is an issue of extraordinary concern that arises as a result
of audit findings, it should be communicated to the Board immediately.
Ms. Burman suggested that while the Office of the County Auditor's policy is to keep findings contained,
the Board could set up a process to go into Executive Session during Audit Committee meetings to
discuss any issues of extraordinary concern that may arise during an audit.
Chairman Daley added that in some cases departmental cooperation in the audit process has been difficult
to achieve.

2673

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2007

Commissioner Quigley responded that the Board shou ld be aware of such cases.
Commissioner Peraica expressed concern that the Board has not yet received the external auditor's report
on the alleged missing funds at the Public Administrator's Office.
Chairman Daley reminded the Committee members of testimony given at the last Audit Committee
meeting by the current Public Administrator, Michael Ian Bender. Mr. Bender had indicated that the
Attorney General had requested the report not be released. Chairman Daley read into the record a portion
of a letter dated March 9, 2007 from Mr. Bender, which was sent to the President and Commissioners. It
stated, "currently the Illinois Attorney General 's Special Prosecutions Bureau is prohibiting this office
from releasing the external audit due to an inquiry regarding matters that occurred prior to the existence
of my administration."
Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State's Attorney, believed that limited information could possibly be given
to Commissioners on this subject in Executive Session.
Chairman Daley stated that a request would be made to the Attorney General on the subject of ho lding an
Executive Session on this issue.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
287222

OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT - INDEPENDENT AUDITOR
REPORT. Transmitting a Communication, dated May 31 , 2007 from Dorothy Brown,
Clerk of the Circuit Court:
submitting the Fiscal Year 2006 Independent Auditor Report for the Office of the Clerk
of the Circuit Court. Please note that this year there is no Management Letter from Ernst
& Young. According to the partner, Mr. Kenneth R. Berlin , the Clerk of the Circuit
Court's Office has successfully cleared all its findings, and therefore no Management
Letter is necessary. Please accept this report and refer it to the Audit Committee for
review.

* Referred to the Audit Committee on 06/05/07.
Commissioner Quigley pointed out the seemingly wide range between interest rates earned on accounts
that have similar amounts of deposits. He inquired as to the reason for this.
Wasil Fashina, Comptroller for the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court, responded that the lower rates
correspond with lower deposit amounts. He also stated that their investment policy allows for shopping
around for the best rates, which can be impacted by the date and time of renewal.
For the record, Chairman Daley stated that this audit was for the year ending November 30, 2006.

Vice Chairman Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Schneider, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 287222. The motion carried.

2674

 JO URN AL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2007

BUREAU OF FINANCE, by Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, transmitting a
Communication, dated January 3, 2007:
Subject:

Cook County Health Facilities Fund of Illinois, Financial Statements for the
Fiscal Year Ended November 30, 2005

submitting is a copy of Cook County 's Health Facilities Fund of Illinois Financial
Statements for the fi scal year ended November 30, 2005, prepared by Ernst & Young
LLP. I am requesting the opportunity to discuss this report with the Finance Committee
of the Board of Commissioners.
The Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) found on pages 3 through 8,
provides an overview of the Bureau's operations and financial position.

* Referred to the Committee on Finance on 01/09/07.
* Discharged from the Committee on Finance and referred to the Audit Committee
on 06/05/07.
Commissioner Gorman asked for additional information on the provision for bad debt expense.
Kelvin Magee, Comptroller for Stroger Hospital of Cook County, responded that this was a calculation
based on the receivables they expected to be uncollectible.
John Cookinham , Chief Financial Officer for the Bureau of Health Services, replied that this is part of the
ongoing effort to identify insurance coverage at the onset of services provided. He stated that
approximately forty percent of the patients are not covered by Medicaid or third party insurance. The
provision for bad debt expense is a result of that. There is screening at the front side for eligibility for
Medicaid, however he expects that there will always be a significant provision for bad debt expense; it
will never be zero. He added that they were trying to improve the eligibility and screening process.
Vice Chairman Goslin asked Mr. Cookinham about the Bureau 's procedure for writing off bad debt.
Mr. Cookinham replied that the request to write off bad debt must come before the Board of
Commissioners for approval.
Vice Chairman Goslin further inquired on the composition of the $252 million in bad debt expense. He
asked whether this figure included the estimated $2-3 million in uncollected bills found in boxes earlier
this year.
Mr. Cookinham explained that Medicaid will accept bills only up to one year, and any of those bills that
go beyond that would be a part of the $252 million .
Chairman Daley added that the administration is attempting to receive an exemption from Medicaid that
would allow the County to pursue reimbursement for an additional six months beyond that for these
particular bills.
Commissioner Maldonado voiced concerns about current screening and eligibil ity processes at the
Bureau, and asked whether any consideration had been given to privatize this function.

2675

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY I 0, 2007

Mr. Cookinham responded that they had contemplated privatizing some of the eligibility services at the
front end, but not the registration services.
Commissioner Maldonado expressed his dissatisfaction with the condition of the Limit of Liability
program.
Mr. Cookinham acknowledged that improvements are needed for this program and to the overall
eligibility process, in order to create a patient-friendly environment.
In response to a question from Commissioner Peraica pertaining to declining revenues, Mr. Cookinham
responded that he believed that the declining revenue was not only from patient billings, but also as a
result of reductions in intergovernmental transfers from the state.

Chairman Daley added for the record that the Board was made aware that the intergovernmental transfers
would decline. He also stated for the record that on page nineteen of this report, the figure reflecting the
total of self-pay patients is forty-seven percent.

FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE TELEPHONE COMMISSIONS AND SALVAGE

dated May 11 , 2007 from Laura A. Burman, C.P.A., Cook County Auditor:
submitting the financial report of the Telephone Commissions and Salvage Sales, for the
Department of Central Services, for the period ended November 30, 2004.
Please accept this report and refer it to the Audit Committee for review.
Please note that field work on this audit was conducted from 2004 through 2006, and our
findings represent issues we found present throughout our fieldwork and were evident as
of our exit conference with the Department of Central Services in March 2007.
The management responses to the findings and recommendations presented in our report
were provided by Mary Jo Horace, Interim Chief Information Officer, Bureau of
Information Technology and Automation.
As you may be aware, a document titled 'Central Services Audit Responses' was
provided by Catherine Maras O'Leary, former Chief of the Bureau of Infonnation
Technology and Automation, in regards to our Department of Central Services
management Jetter dated April 2, 2007. As this correspondence was dated April 17,
2007, when Catherine Maras O'Leary was no longer a County employee, her responses
were not included in the accompanying report, however a copy of the report has been
submitted.

2680

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2007
We noted many inaccuracies in the 'Central Services Audit Responses' provided by
Catherine Maras O'Leary. We provided our comments regarding these inaccuracies and
additional information surrounding our management letter and its content in a letter to
President Stroger dated April 24, 2007, a copy of which has been submitted for your
review.

* Referred to the Audit Committee on 05/15/07.
Chairman Daley indicated that Catherine Maras O'Leary, former Chief Information Officer of Cook
County, was present. He stated that Commissioner Gorman had requested that Ms. O' Leary be given
some time above the three minutes to answer some questions regarding this report.
Dorothy Loving, Audit Supervisor from the Office of the Cook County Auditor, was introduced and gave
a summary of the audit. She stated that the audit was of the financial transaction portion and also to find
whether the parties were complying with the contract. Upon review, the Auditor' s Office could not find
invoices from the subcontractor, Crucial Communications, LLC, for services rendered or materials
provided for their $1.7 million participation in the contract. Copies of the invoices were requested from
SBC/AT&T, the contractor for this contract. However, SBC/ AT&T indicated that there were no invoices.
Furthermore, Ms. Loving reported that there were some inaccuracies in management responses to these
audit findings. For example, one audit finding raises the question of whether the County is owed
$551,000. The answer to this question hinges upon when the contract began. According to Ms. Loving,
the contract was amended or modified with SBC/AT&T in July 2006, without Board approval, and
allegedly reflected a change in the original contract's start date. She stated that this change could
preclude the County from collecting the over $551,000 that she believed was owed by SBC/AT&T.
Mr. Driscoll stated that the original contract was executed on July 13, 2004 for a period of three years,
and is set to expire on July 13, 2007. It provided for extensions after July 13, 2004. He understood that
there was a period of time of negotiations that was impacted by the fire at the Administration Building,
but it was his understanding that they were still paying under the terms of a prior contract.
Commissioner Peraica asked the State's Attorney if their office was reviewing whether the minority
contractor certification for this contract was not properly handled according to County procedures.
Mr. Driscoll replied that he was unsure, but that he would find out. He said that he personally was not
reviewing this, as his Bureau would not be involved in this type of review.
Other difficulties that Ms. Loving faced in completing the audit were described. She stated that the lack
of recordkeeping at Central Services with regard to this contract presented the auditors with problems in
attempting to get an understanding of the reliability of SBC/AT&T's records. Revenue was being paid
and reported by SBC/ AT&T, however, if revenue is being based upon a number, the auditors wanted to
know if that number is accurate. According to Ms. Loving, no one in Central Services had been verifying
that infonnation.
She said that they were keeping track of it to some extent, but their figures were inaccurate. When the
audit began, these inaccuracies were pointed out to them by the Auditor's Office. As a result, they
proceeded to try and recover some of those dollars.
Commissioner Quigley asked whether Crucial Communications, LLC is still being paid.

2681

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2007

With regard to the overall contract, Ms. Loving replied that the County is still on a month to month with
SBC, until an RFP is completed.
Mary Jo Horace, Director of the Department of Office Technology, stated that Crucial Communications,
LLC is still on as a subcontractor, and that they have a staff person on site perfonning duties, and a group
of people working at a service center.
Commissioner Butler asked who was paying whom on this contract.
Chairman Daley stated that SBC/AT&T pays the subcontractor.
Chairman Daley then introduced Catherine Maras O'Leary, former Chief Information Officer of Cook
County.
Ms. O'Leary began by reading a statement into the record (The referenced document is on file in the
Office of the County Clerk.).
There were conflicting views between Ms. O'Leary and the Office of the Auditor as to certain findings
and statements made with regard to this audit, particularly with regard to the question of when the
contract began and whether monies are due to the County, and whether certain functions were performed,
such as recordkeeping and oversight on the billings.
Chairman Daley clarified the contract dates for the Committee members, stating that the proposed
contract which was to be submitted for Board approval was received by the Purchasing Agent on June 14,
2004. The Board approved the contract on July 13, 2004, under Contracts and Bonds submitted by the
Purchasing Agent.
Chairman Daley was concerned with the possibility that the County may be owed over $551,000. He
indicated that he would like to hear from the Administration about collection or negotiation efforts with
regards to this amount.
Commissioner Quigley was interested in gaining insight into the specifics of how and to what degree
Crucial Communications, LLC is involved in the day-to-day operations of this contract.
Commissioner Beavers asked permission for the County's Chief Information Officer, Antonio Hylton, to
address the Committee.
Mr. Hylton recently received a letter from SBC/ AT&T on this subject, a copy of which will be submitted
for the record. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.) This letter
suggested that the twelve-month extension would not be honored after the contract' s termination date of
July 13, 2007. It would instead be compressed into thirty-day extensions and the County could lose
commissionable revenue.
As a result of Mr. Hylton' s negotiations with SBC/ AT&T in response to this Jetter, the contract will stay
at the existing terms and higher commission until October 1st. In addition, a new RFP has been
developed to take this to a competitive procurement process.

2682

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2007

Mr. Hylton indicated that there would be answers sought to the question of whether the County is owed,
and resolution of the matter is expected.
Chairman Daley requested that Mr. Hylton report this information back to the Committee Chair, who will
then give the information to the members of the Committee.

Notwithstanding any rules to the contrary, the owner of a permitted site shall remit to the
Cook County Department of Environmental Control the following filing permit fees,
payable every three years upon obtaining or renewing a permit, and annual emissions

(b) The Cook County Department of Environmental Control ("Department") may deny
an application for the issuance, transfer, or renewal of an air pollution operating permit if
any air pollution site fee owed by the applicant has not been paid within 60 days of the
due date, unless the applicant, at the time of application, pays to the Department in
advance the air pollution site fee for the site that is the subject of the operating permit,
plus any other air pollution site fees then owed by the applicant. The denial of an air
pollution operating permit for failure to pay an air pollution site fee shall be subject to
review by the County Environmental Control Board of Appeals pursuant to the

2691

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2007

(c) If the Cook County Department of Environmental Control determines that an owner
or operator of a site was required, but failed , to timely obtain an air pollution operating
permit, and as a result avoided the payment of permit fees, the Department may collect
the avoided permit fees with or without pursuing enforcement. The avoided permit fees
shall be calculated as double the amount that would have been owed had a permit been
timely obtained. Fees collected pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited into the
Cook County Environmental Management Fund
( d) If the Cook County Department of Environmental Control determines that an owner
or operator of a site was required, but failed, to timely obtain an air pollution operating
permit and as a result avoided the payment of permit fees, an enforcement action may be
brought. In addition to any other relief that may be obtained as part of this action, the
Cook County Department of Environmental Control may seek to recover the avoided
permit fees. The avoided permit fees shall be calculated as double the amount that would
have been owed had a permit been timely obtained. Fees collected pursuant to this
subsection (d) shall be deposited into the Cook County General Fund .
(e) If a Permittee subject to a fee under this Section fails to pay the fee within 90 days of
its due date, or makes the fee payment from an account with insufficient funds to cover
the amount of the fee payment, the Department shall notify the Permittee of the failure to
pay the fee. If the Permittee fails to pay the fee within 60 days after such notification, the
Department may, by written notice, immediately revoke the air pollution operating
permit. Failure of the Cook County Department of Environmental Control to notify the
Permittee of failure to pay a fee due under this Section, or the payment of the fee from an
account with insufficient funds to cover the amount of the fee payment, does not excuse
or alter the duty of the Permittee to comply with the provisions of this Section.

Section 30-397. Emission Levels Reduction.
Permit Holders for sites where the levels of pollution emissions exceed I 00 tons per year
of cumulative regulated air pollutants shall be required to submit an annual "Regulated

will be made to decrease the Site 's cumulative regulated pollutant emissions by 10%
within the term of the air pollution operating permit.
(a) Annual Regulated Air Pollutant Emission Reduction Plans submitted to the Cook
County Department of Environmental Control will be verified by reviewing the
Site/Permitee 's Illinois Annual Air Emission Report (AER).
(b) Established Regulated Air Pollutant emission reductions exceeding 10% on an annual
basis will allow a 10% credit reduction of the following year annual air permit fee.
(c) Failure to reduce Regulated Air Pollutant emissions as indicated in the County
approved Reduction Plan may result in penalty fees or loss of permit.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the backbone of our democracy is a voluntary military service; and
WHEREAS, over 275,000 military veterans live in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, many veterans rely on governmental programs for services that help them
deal with service-related issues and it is vital that all those who are eligible for assistance
know what is available; and
WHEREAS, the needs of Cook County veterans are finding increasingly limited
resources.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Richard Morbidoni, Superintendent of
the Cook County Commission on Veterans Assistance, appear before the Committee on
Legislation, Intergovernmental and Veterans Relations to present a detailed explanation
of the programs and resources available to Cook County veterans and to explain the
outreach efforts used to educate our military veterans of these programs.

* Referred to the Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental

& Veterans

Relations on 06/05/07.

Chairman Suffredin introduced Richard Morbidoni, Superintendent of the Veterans Assistance
Commission of Cook County, and explained that Mr. Morbidoni would report to the Committee regarding
veterans' services and programs in which the County is involved.
Mr. Morbidoni outlined the services to veterans currently offered by the Veterans Assistance
Commission. They offer transportation services to veterans enrolled in outpatient programs at Hines and
Jesse Brown Veterans Administration Hospitals. Transportation services are also offered to veterans
going for employment interviews, and if they are hired they can continue to receive transportation to that
job until they receive their first paycheck. Finally, the Veterans Assistance Commission of Cook County
assists veterans with rental and utilities payments, and can assist with burials for veterans. If a burial is
$2,500 or less, they offer $600.
Chairman Suffredin inquired as to the source of the funding for these programs.
Mr. Morbidoni responded that Cook County's general revenue fund was the only funding source.
Chairman Suffredin asked how the County's Veterans Assistance Commission interacts with the State of
Illinois.

2697

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2007

Mr. Morbidoni replied that they really don ' t, however, he indicated that he would like to partner up with
other local, state and federal entities to enhance services to veterans.
Chairman Suffredin stated that last year the Illinois General Assembly passed a bill to provide veterans
with a form of health care protection overlaying the federal Veterans Administration benefits. He asked if
Mr. Morbidoni had worked with the State to identify eligible veterans who may be receiving health care
services at Stroger, Provident or Oak Forest Hospitals, because as a result of the passage of this bill, the
County may find additional reimbursement opportunities from the State for health care services provided
to veterans.
Mr. Morbidoni stated that they had not yet worked with the State on that issue, but that he was willing to
do so.
Commissioner Schneider inquired as to the total budget allocated to the Veterans Assistance Commission.
Mr. Morbidoni replied that it is $500,000, half of which goes to office expenses and salaries.
Chairman Suffredin introduced Stewart Reeve, Chief of Staff to 1llinois Department of Veterans' Affairs
Director Tammy Duckworth.
Mr. Reeve introduced his colleague, Christine Glunz, who 1s Deputy Chief of Staff at the Illinois
Department of Veterans ' Affairs.
Mr. Reeve and Ms. Glunz provided the Committee members with an overview of the programs offered by
the Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs.
Mr. Reeve began by stating the mission of the Department of Veterans' Affairs: to ensure that returning
veterans or veterans who have already returned from conflict or service to the nation are properly signed
up with their dependents and/or survivors for the respective education, health care, or other such veterans'
opportunities available.
Mr. Reeve stated that there are currently seventy-three veterans' service officers in fifty-one offices
across the State. In Cook County alone, there are eleven such officers and offices. These offices perform
the initial screening and are the best way to access information on State and federal programs.
Ms. Glunz reviewed the programs offered by the State. (The referenced document is on file in the Office
of the County Clerk.)
Chairman Suffredin asked Mr. Morbidoni to work with the State to continue outreach to veterans. He
also suggested interaction between the Veterans Assistance Commission, the President's Office of
Employment Training and the Bureau of Heal th Services to ensure that all possible opportunities can be
made available to veterans.
Chairman Suffredin mentioned pending legislation in Springfield that could provide further assistance to
veterans. Senate Bill 13, which deals with the seven percent cap, also includes an increased homestead
exemption provision for returning veterans.

Vice Chairman Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved the approval of
Communication No. 287221. The motion carried.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2007

WHEREAS, it has been acknowledged, in opinions of the Illinois Appellate Court, the Illinois Supreme
Court, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the Chicago Police Department's Office of Professional Standards and
elsewhere that Burge and his subordinates committed numerous acts of torture against African-American
men at Area 2 and 3 Police headquarters; and
WHEREAS, the Report of the Special State 's Attorney states that the acts of abuse committed by Burge
and detectives under his command included electrically shocking individuals on their genitals, lips and
ears with an electric shock box or cattle prod; suffocating individuals with plastic bags; subjecting
individuals to mock executions with guns; physical beatings with telephone books and rubber hoses; and
other forms of physical and psychological abuse; and
WHEREAS, Burge and his men committed these acts of abuse to extract confessions from the victims
which were subsequently admitted as evidence against them in their criminal prosecutions resulting in
their convictions; and
WHEREAS, at least twenty-six African-American men remain behind bars as a direct result of
convictions which were based in whole or in part on their confessions that were allegedly elicited by
abuse committed by Burge and his men; and
WHEREAS, the use of physical force to gain a confession as well as the admission of such a confession
in a criminal court proceeding violates state, federal and international laws; and
WHEREAS, the twenty-six victims who remain behind bars are therefore entitled to new hearings to
determine if their confessions were coerced by Burge and his men, and, if so, to new trials at which the
unlawfully coerced confessions are not used as incriminating evidence against them.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Comm issioners
recommends that the Illinois Attorney General initiate new hearings for the twenty-six Chicago Police
torture victims who were wrongfully convicted and remain incarcerated in the State of Illinois.
