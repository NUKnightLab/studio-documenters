ASSIGNMENT OF GROUND LEASE AGREEMENT (PROPOSED AGREEMENT).
Transmitting a Communication dated December 20, 2011 from Anna Ashcraft, Director,
Real Estate Management Division.

Approval is respectfully requested for the County to execute and deliver an Assignment of
Ground Lease Agreement, (?Assignment?) and a First Amendment to Lease (?First
Amendment?) pursuant to a request from Vision House, Inc. and Chicago Commons, Inc.
The County?s consent is needed to effectuate the Assignment. The First Amendment will
permit the new use, ?nancing and renewal option described below.

On January 20, 2000, the Board of Commissioners approved a Ground Lease with Vision
House, Inc., granting Vision House the right to construct and operate a child care center for
HIV-impacted families on vacant land owned by the County and located at 515 E. 50th
Street in Chicago, Illinois. The term of the Ground Lease expires on January 31, 2030,
subject to Ground Tenant?s option to extend for an additional ten-year term. The County
received a lump-sum payment for the value of the land upon execution of the Ground Lease.

1. Assignment of Ground Lease
Vision House completed construction of the child care center, but advancements in medical
treatment rendered the program unnecessary. Since use of the facility for AIDS and HIV
impacted families is no longer feasible, Vision House has requested permission to assign all

Chairman:

of its right, title and interest to Chicago Commons so that the property can be operated for a
suitable use which will bene?t the residents of Cook County.

Founded in 1894, Chicago Commons, a long time provider of social services, intends to use
the facility for an adult and senior health and daycare program serving low-income, frail,
and chronically ill elderly residents and developmentally disabled adults on Chicago?s
southwest side.

The Adult Day Services program is designed to meet the speci?c needs of seniors and
adults who have signi?cant limitations in activities of daily living, but are capable of riding
a handicapped-accessible bus. Acquisition of the facility will also allow Chicago Commons
to create specialized and separate programming for Alzheimer?s clients, traumatically brain
injured- clients, and developmentally disabled clients.

Chicago Commons has provided all requested ?nancial information and a commitment
letter from the Illinois Facilities Fund for ?nancing of the acquisition and
renovation cost in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Assignment of Lease
Agreement.

2. First Amendment to Ground Lease
The proposed First Amendment will modify the Original Ground Lease to re?ect current
conditions, permit the new use as outlined above, and allow Chicago Commons to obtain a
Leasehold Mortgage from the IFF to make certain improvements to the Premises to
facilitate its use. The First Amendment also grants Chicago Commons a second option to
extend the Ground Lease for one additional ten (10) year period, for additional
consideration payable upon exercise of the option.

I believe permitting the assignment and amendment of the Original Lease is in the best
interests of the County.

Approval is recommended.
