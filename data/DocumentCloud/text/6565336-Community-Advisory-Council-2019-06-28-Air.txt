 BACKGROUND
NOACA forecasts daily peak eight-hour ground-level
ozone concentrations and fine particulate matter
concentrations.

• In 2019, daily forecasts for ozone began March 1 and will
conclude October 31
• Daily forecasts for fine particulate matter are year-round

NOACA posts daily air quality forecasts through
AirNowTech, in affiliation with the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA)
5-15

 BACKGROUND
NOACA ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter
forecasts based on a review of several meteorological
variables and model guidance.

• National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
National Air Quality Forecast Capability (ozone only).
• Classification and Regression Tree (CART) Model
• Sonoma Tech Guidance (via Columbus/Central Ohio Forecast
on AirNow.gov)

5-15

 BACKGROUND
Anticipation of Exceedance

• Consult Forecast Discussion Group (FDR) the morning before
anticipated exceedance
• Decide based on meteorological forecast, model forecasts and
FDR input (no later than 2PM)
• Prepare advisory and press release
• Constant Contact
• Social Media

• Notify partners

• Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) Office of Highways
(Dynamic Message Signs)
• National Weather Service (NWSChat and National Weather Alerts

 NEXT STEPS
• Track forecast performance of NOACA and NOAA for
ozone; NOACA only for fine particulate matter
• Collaborate with NOAA personnel to report model
performance in Northeast Ohio
• Update subcommittees and advisory councils as
necessary

5-15

 NOACA will STRENGTHEN regional
cohesion, PRESERVE existing
infrastructure, and BUILD a
sustainable multimodal transportation
system to SUPPORT economic
development and ENHANCE quality
of life in Northeast Ohio.
