Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 and 2. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the approval of request
number 3. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
With regard to request numbers 4 through 8, Director Carvalho noted that the question that he has continued to
have on all of the grants, particularly the ones in which the System is not mandated to provide those services,
is whether the grant funding covers the System’s costs to provide those services. That information should be
made available to the Board, so whenever the Board is accepting a grant that it is not mandated to do, however
worthwhile it is to do it, it should be making a conscious choice that it will also be devoting county resources
to make up the differences in cost of services provided associated with the grant.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of request
numbers 4 through 8. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
With regard to request number 9, Board Chairman Hammock requested that Ms. Besenhofer advise the
Committee if there are any other items like this that are perhaps not covered by current contracts that should be
focused on - if there are, he would like for them to be identified and placed on a to-do list.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the approval of request
number 9. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of request
number 10. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
With regard to request number 11, Board Chairman Hammock inquired further regarding how the
administration keeps track of billing for the hours used on these types of contracts. Ms. Besenhofer stated that
there are several people within the nursing department who receive in all of the invoices. There are timesheets
that are associated, which is also part of the contract requirements - they need to be signed off by the individual
managers on the floors, from a review perspective. The employees are held at the same standards to which the
CCHHS employees are held.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the conditional approval of
request number 11, pending completion of review by Contract Compliance. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Carvalho, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the approval of request

Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, suggested that Donna Hart, System Interim Chief Information Officer, give
an update and overview at a high-level at the next Audit and Compliance Committee meeting. He noted that,
in a recent week, there was a nationwide assault on health system information systems; the System’s firewalls
effectively rebuffed a couple of these attacks that were coming from outside of the country.

regarding including within the set of metrics that the Committee will soon see on a monthly basis the category
of “who is CCHHS losing to other programs or insurance categories?” Mr. Glass stated that some of that
information is not available or is very difficult to obtain; he will take the question back to his team to see if
they can further address the question.

September 16, 2014
TO: Chairman Jerry Butler and Members of the Finance Committee

FROM: Claudia M. Fegan, MD, FACP, 
Executive Medical Director

In my capacity as the Executive Medical Director for the Cook County Health Hospitals System, I am
respectfully seeking approval for payment to Rush University Medical Center (RUMC) in the amount of
$1,592,936, for the provision of perfusion services for the Department of Surgery and the Main
Operating Room at John H. Stroger, Jr., Hospital of Cook County between August, 2009 and November,
2014.

As a Level 1 Trauma Center, Stroger is required to provide perfusion services for emergency

cardiac surgery and emergency trauma surgery on a 24/7 basis. Stroger currently performs
approximately 160 cardiac surgeries with cardiac perfusion annually. Cardiac perfusion is a highly
specialized, costly and extremely dif?cult profession to recruit. From 1998 to 2009, all perfusion
services were provided through a contract with RUMC. In 2009, the system decided to employ
perfusionists. However, we were unsuccessful in recruiting the requisite number of perfusionists needed
to meet our demand. The system currently employs one cardiac perfusionist and continues to rely on
RUMC to provide additional cardiac perfusionists.

The dif?culty in recruitment of employed perfusionists led to the decision to contract for these services.
In September and October of 2012 as well as in July of 2014, issued Requests for Proposals for
perfusionists services which did not yield any responses.

 

 

 

The RFP has recently been revised and is currently posted. Pote

No prior contract history.

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:

The single-plane angiographic system and the biplane angiographic system that we are using are more than 12 years old and
have experienced numerous mechanical failures. The failure rate of each lab is increasing, which compromises patient care
and safety, prolongs hospitalization time and causes disruption of the catheterization lab schedule. The purchase of new
innovative labs will enable us to safely perform procedures such as ASD (Atrial Septic Defect), OTC (Optical Coherence
Tomography) which will result in less cardiothoracic surgeries and lessen the hospital stay for patients.

Designed for interventional cardiac vascular and neuro procedures, the bi?plane and single-plane angiography systems will
assist us in providing excellent clinical care with high image clarity and the proper x-ray dose. The systems that we are
currently using are past their life expectancy and have experienced increased down time.

TERMS OF REQUEST: 
This is a request to execute contract number in an amount not to exceed $5,327,767.00, as needed, for a one-

Re: Emergency Purchases

has placed an emergency order. This memo serves as notification, as required in
Section 2.8 of the Procurement Policy adopted by the Board on April 9, 2009.

The Radware software purchase is required for our online security. As you may have heard in
the news, three Chicago area hospitals patients? records were recently compromised. This
software will ensure the safety of our patient data.

The perpetual application and server monitoring is necessary for us to remain proactive versus
reactive to software and system issues.

Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2012 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and Cook County Board Officials
collaborated to cut Medicaid costs, help county taxpayers, and transform Cook County’s
hospital system by jump-starting national health care reform in Cook County. In
November, 2012 the federal governmnent approved the 1115 Medicaid Waiver for Cook
County, allowing CCHHS to enroll more than 115,000 individuals who will be eligible
for Medicaid in 2014 into a Cook County network with no cost to the state of Illinois.
Medicaid Expansion allows the Cook County’s Health System to early enroll certain
uninsured patients into Medicaid. Specifically, these are patients who are not currently
eligible for Medicaid, but who will be eligible in 2014 under the Accountable Care Act.
Many of these individuals are patients who already are being treated by our system
without compensation. The Waiver is funded entirely by the federal government.

 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the eight months with overall
revenue of $914,068 and overall expenses was $932,163.
Net Patient revenue for the eight months was $765,312.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $4,344. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable
General
As compared to November 30, 2013, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
July-2014 increased by 11 to 116 days. Additionally, there was a 3 day increase in this
figure, as compared to the previous month’s figure.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage, including the
Medicaid Expansion Program and MANG applications;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Total billed accounts grew by $29.144M (9.1%) as compared to the November-2013
balance. As compared to the previous month, this figure increased by $3.380M (1.0%).
The growth in this figure indicates a decreasing number of accounts are completing the
collection process, which includes charity care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
6

 care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for Medicaid Expansion Program patients is
made through a per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of July-2014 increased by
$3.060M (36.2%), as compared the November 30, 2013 balance and decreased by
$0.648M (-5.3%), as compared to the previous month’s balance. This indicates that more
inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for Medicaid Expansion Program patients is
made through a per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of July-2014 increased by $25.517M (16.0%) as
compared to the November 30, 2013 balance. This figure grew by $2.285M (1.3%)
compared to the previous month’s total.
The increase in this number indicates fewer accounts had the collection process
completed than in the previous month and that less accounts are being removed from
active accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity care and bad
debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
up on the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for Medicaid Expansion Program patients is
made through a per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts increased by $7.676M (70.8%) by the end of
July-2014, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2013. This
balance was $4.336M (30.6%) larger than the previous month’s balance. This indicates
that fewer outpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the
previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.

Page 67 of 96

 Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of July-2014 increased by $3.627M
(2.3%), as compared to the balance as of November 30, 2013. This figure is $1.095M
(0.7%) greater than last month’s figure.
The growth in this figure indicates that fewer Out-Patient accounts had their collection
and write-off related activities completed, as compared to the prior month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

cigarette tax in the amount of $72.374M and property tax in the amount of $24.379M.
For the current fiscal year, Nonoperating revenues allocated to CCHHS are Cigarette
Tax, Other Tobacco products and Firearms Tax. There is no Sales Tax allocated to
CCHHS for the current fiscal year.

 Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

The OFHC FFS budget has been combined with the SHCC FFS budget due to the configuration of CCHHS system that treats OFHC as a SHCC clinic.

Beginning March-2014, the capitation for the Medicaid Expansion program is paid at 100% instead of 50%.
The Medicaid fee-for-service revenue through the IGT covers the period beginning week ended 06/18/2014 - 07/16/2014.
Vendor Payments From Revenue are payments out of revenue posted by the County Comptroller. Pharmacy Billing and Revenue Enhancement
payments are reductions to Medicaid revenue. Collection Agency payments are reductions to Self-Pay (Other) revenue. Physician Billing payments
include refunds processed by CCHHS. Included in the "Revenue Enhancement" totals are payments to the state for supplemental workers hired to help
process CountyCare and MANG applications.
The Meaningful Use budget was spread over 12 months, as it was not known at the time the budget was created in which month this payment will be
received. Meaningful Use includes both the Medicare and Medicaid portions. The Meaningful Use payment is detailed as follows:
