RE: Reprogramming Amendment to the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
Annual Action Plan for ?scal year 2018-19

Honorable City Council:

The Housing Revitalization Department (HRD) is requesting that changes be made to the
City?s CDBG Annual Action Plan consistent with meeting the City's CDBG Timeliness Test on
May 2, 2019.

The City has previously had signi?cant challenges meeting its timeliness test, which requires that
the City have no more than 1.5 times its CDBG allocation on hand at any time. A test of this
metric is made sixty (60) days before the end of the program year for all CDBG recipients. This
test is one of the primary ways in which the City's performance is measured by U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

The funding will change as follows:

Line Item to be Reprogrammed (decrease):
I Demolition (FY 2018-19) 1,000,000

Line Item for Funding Addition (increase):
0 108 Loan Defeasance (FY 2018-19) 33 1,000,000

We respectfully request that your Honorable Body approve the attached resolution authorizing
this change to amend the CDBG Annual Action Plan for the stated purpose. This proposed
amendment was posted on the City?s website and advertised in the Detroit News/Free Press.
Upon City Council?s approval, it will be transmitted to HUD.

RE: Petition to ESTABLISH an Industrial Development District on behalf of the City of
Detroit, for the area generally bounded by St. Jean, Mack, Conner, and the Conrail
right-of-way, more specifically described in the attached Exhibit A.

Honorable City Council:

The City of Detroit (?City?) is submitting this petition to request the establishment of an
Industrial Development District pursuant to Michigan Public Act 198 of 1974, the Plant
Rehabilitation and Industrial Development Districts Act (?the Act?). The request encompasses

the area described in Exhibit A.

The City?s intent is to create an incentive district to support the investment and development in
this area to support future investment at the facilities. It is expected that investment within
the IDD would create new Operations that spur employment opportunities for Detroit residents
and competitively position the City to take advantage of ?iture advanced manufacturing and/or
industrial related investments in this area. Since 1974, the City has worked with the investor on
this site to support operations growth and by consequence stimulate local job growth. Therefore,
to support continued future investment in this site, this request is being made to establish a new

Industrial Development District.

Development activities are expected to add more than 600,000 sq ft of additional manufacturing
space. As a result, the expected total investment for the site will be approximately $2.5 billion.
The expected development will occur between 2019 and 202] . The proposed project is expected
to create a minimum of 4,950 jobs. This project will leverage both State and City resources to

develop the site for productive use.

The City has recognized that property tax abatements are necessary to attract and support this
nationally competitive project. To that end, it should be noted that the district does not in itself
create a tax abatement. The investor[s] will need to apply to the City of Detroit for an Industrial
Facilities Exemption Certi?cate that provides for the actual abatement. All Industrial Facilities
Exemption Certi?cates would be subject to approval by the Detroit City Council and the
Michigan State Tax Commission.

 

 

 

The company is committed to an engagement strategy that encompasses local workforce
agencies, the community group in its City Council District, and the City of Detroit Civil Rights
and lnclusionary Of?ce to ensure that Detroit based ?rms are represented on the development of
the facility and that quali?ed Detroit residents have access to employment opportunities.
Additionally, all future projects seeking approval to utilize this tool would be subject to the same

standards.
This area quali?es for the Industrial Facilities Exemption per statute as follows:

MCL 207.554. Sec. 4. (DA local governmental unit, by resolution ofits legislative body,
may establish plant rehabilitation districts and industrial development districts that
consist of or more parcels or tracts of land or a portion of a parcel or tract ofland.

MCL 207.554. Sec. 4. (2) The legislative body of a local governmental unit may establish
a plant rehabilitation district or an industrial development district on its own initiative or
upon a written request ?led by the owner or owners of 75% of the state equalized value

of the industrial property located within a proposed plant rehabilitation district or
industrial development district. This request shall be ?led with the clerk of the local

governmental unit.

The proposed new facility that will be developed in connection with this petition is expected to
be completed by 2021. The construction, alteration, and installation of the new facility has not

commenced prior to this request.

In the interim, should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me
directly.

Thank you for your consideration of this petition.

Dear Mr. Cox

The Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of the Assessor, has reviewed the request for the creation of an Industrial
Development District for the area generally bound by St. Jean, Mack, Conner and the Conrail right-of way in the Conner Creek
Industrial District.

The rationale for creating Industrial upon 
that granting the exemption is a benefit to the city and that expansion, retention, or location of an eligible business will not
occur without this exemption. PA 198 of 1974, as amended, also provides a tax incentive tO manufacturers in order to enable
renovation and expansion. of aging facilities, building of new facilities, and to promote establishment of high tech facilities.

MCL 207.554 Sec. 4 (2) states ?The legislative body of a local governmental unit may establish a plant rehabilitation district
or an industrial development district on its own initiative or upon a written request ?led by the owner or owners of 75% of
the state equalized value of the industrial prOperty located within a proposed plant rehabilitation district or industrial
development district. This request shall be ?led with the clerk of the local governmental unit.?

The project as proposed by FCA US LLC would add more than 600,000 square feet of additional manufacturing space and the
expected total investment for the site will be approximately $2.5 billion. The proposed project is expected to create a

minimum of 4,950jobs.

A field investigation indicated that the proposed St. Jean/Conner Industrial Development District located in the area as
described above is eligible as outlined under PA 198 of 1974, as amended.

PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT 
TO: Veronica Farley, Housing and Revitalization
FROM: Esther Yang, Planning and Development
RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Industrial Development District/ Plant Rehabilitation
District (PA 198)
DATE: April 2, 2019
CC: Maurice Cox, Director, Planning and Development

In order to ensure consistency with the City's Master Plan of Policies, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public
Act 198 of 1974 (section 207.554), the Planning and Development Department?s Planning Division submits
the following interpretation for the establishment of an Industrial Development District (IDD). The
Petitioner is the City of Detroit, Planning and Development Department

Location and Project Proposal:

The subject site area is bounded by St. Jean, Mack, Conner, and the Conrail Right of Way

The City seeks to create an incentive district to support the forthcoming investment on FCA Facilities.
Development activities are expected to add more than 600,000 square feet of additional manufacturing
space and the creation of 4,950 jobs.

Existing Site Information: The subject site is currently operating with industrial uses for FCA including
an employee parking lot and parking lot for assembled vehicles

Master Plan Interpretation

The subject site area is designated General Industrial (IG). General Industrial areas should consist of
areas for light and heavy industrial uses such as manufacturing, assembly or warehousing. General
Industrial areas are characterized as large sites with considerable truck or rail traffic. General industrial
areas should have freeway and rail access and be located along a major thoroughfare. Large-scale
industrial uses may include producing or assembling components, auto manufacturing, structural steel
fabrication, chemical plants, power plants, etc.

The proposed development conforms to the Future General Land Use characteristics of the area.
