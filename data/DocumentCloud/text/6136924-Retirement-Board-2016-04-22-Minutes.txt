In the matter of Jose Garcia, on receipt of a duty disability benefit, the Board finds that Officer Garcia’s
disability resulting from an act of duty incident has ceased, therefore his duty disability benefits shall
cease April 30, 2016, and he is directed to return to the Chicago Police Department for assignment.

In the matter of Adam Nasadowski, the Board finds that Nasadowski was for a time disabled as the
result of an act of duty incident, but that the injury was exacerbated by a preexisting physical defect or
other disease. Therefore, Nasadowski's application for a duty disability benefit is granted in the amount
of 50 percent of salary as more fully defined in the Pension Act for the period commencing August 2,
2015, the date he exhausted his CPD medical leave. The Board further finds that Nasadowski is no longer
disabled as disability is defined in the Act and, therefore, his disability benefit will cease on April 30,
2016.
It was moved by Trustee Lappe, seconded by Trustee Hamburger that the Board adopt the order on Adam
Nasadowski as submitted.

In the matter of Richard Hagan, a petition for pension credit for prior service. On February 25, 2016,
Hagan failed to appear before the Board for a scheduled hearing. The Board considered the documents
tendered by Officer Hagan and the Board finds that it does not have jurisdiction to hear Officer Hagen's
case as this matter was previously before the Board and a decision was made on this matter on March 25,
2010. Pursuant to 40 ILCS 5/5-214.2 and the previous Board order, Officer Hagan had until March 25,
2015, to pay for his prior service credit. The Board has no statutory authority to rehear cases, and,
therefore, the request of Richard Hagan for Board to rehear his application for police pension credit prior
to his appointment as a CPD officer is hereby denied.
It was moved by Trustee Lappe, seconded by Trustee Wright that the Board adopt the order on Richard
Hagan as submitted.

data from Fund with respect to this undertaking. After lengthy discussion it was mutually agreed that
the Fund will provide the requested member data to the FOP upon receipt of a signed, written
confidentiality agreement from the FOP, which would, in substance, require the FOP to confirm that
they will use the information requested solely to secure healthcare for the Fund’s members.

•

Audit and Actuarial draft results for the year ended December 31, 2015, continue to be finalized.
However, there is a concern regarding the pending legislation of SB 777, which was presented to
Governor Rauner on March 31, 2016. Given the significance of the legislation to the Fund’s financial
condition, the suggestion was made to complete the Fund’s financials after May 31, 2016, when the
Governor’s action on SB 777 is known. The finalization of the financial statements and actuarial

results. Time of such meeting is to be determined.

of Trustee Hamburger, the Executive Director prepared a draft letter, to be sent to the current Fund
retirees, which discusses the current health insurance and possible termination of such coverage. The
Board requested that the Executive Director send the letter to the Fund retirees.

•

The Executive Director updated the Board on the Naviant case. Based on communication from Avi
Josefson, a copy of which was provided to the Board, a larger claimant has come forward and, thus,
they believe it is in the best interest that this Fund step down and not continue as the lead plaintiff.
The Board agreed with Mr. Josefson’s recommendation.

•

The last item for Board consideration concerned tenant improvements to the Fund’s office space. To
begin remodeling tasks, the service of an engineer is required. The Executive Director requests hiring
an engineer for an estimated fee of $3500. Trustee Hamburger noted that she would like the architect
firm to work to identify minority businesses as appropriate. Director Tuczak did indicate that such
