GENERAL BACKGROUND
The Office of Information Technology Services is responsible for assuring the Chicago Housing
Authority’s (“CHA”) technical infrastructure and essential applications are continuously
maintained to support the agency’s operations. Prudent business practices dictate having
maintenance and service agreements in place to ensure critical business functions are maintained
in good working order on an ongoing basis and restored quickly and efficiently in the event of
any disruption or other impact.
The CHA issued Invitation for Bid (“IFB”) # 01448 on February 23, 2006. This IFB solicited
competitive bids from qualified firms and/or individuals who could provide Hewlett Packard
equipment maintenance to the CHA; a total of four-hundred thirty one (431) vendors received
bid invitations, sixty-one (61) vendors picked up the solicitation and eight (8) vendors
responded. Of the eight respondents, CTG of Illinois, Inc. (d/b/a Novanis) submitted a proposal
that was determined to be the most advantageous for the CHA.
In March of 2006, the CHA entered into a maintenance contract with Novanis for Hewlett
Packard equipment maintenance services. The contract was awarded at the firm fixed price of
$80,478.00 for a two (2) year base term, with three one (1) year term option extensions, each
priced at $49,728.21. The CHA has come to the end of the second one (1) year option term and
service has been satisfactory to warrant exercising the final extension option. The Office of
Information Technology Services is now requesting permission to execute the provision for the
third one (1) year option extension for equipment maintenance and support under Contract No.
6009 at a price of $49,728.21.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the Chicago Housing Authority to authorize
the Chief Executive Officer or his designee, to exercise the third one year option of Contract No.
6009 with Novanis for the amount of $49,728.21.
