WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 5 of the Annual Appropriation Bill and Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2015,
the Cook County Board of Commissioners (“Board of Commissioners”) provided that “[i]n the event that union
employees receive cost of living adjustments in fiscal year 2015 as a result of negotiated and approved 2012-2016
collective bargaining agreements, non-union employees shall also receive cost of living adjustments” subject to the
approval of the Budget Director, Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources and the Board of Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners have approved salary adjustments and general wage increases for a large
number of Cook County employees covered under collective bargaining agreements with said changes being both
retroactive and prospective; and
WHEREAS, in consideration of the 2015 Budget Resolution, the Interim Budget Director and the Interim Chief of
the Bureau of Human Resources have worked to recommend appropriate salary adjustments for the County’s
non-union workforce which could be implemented in fiscal year 2015 and going forward; and
WHEREAS, in order to achieve cost savings, it is recommended that any increase in salary for the County’s
non-union workforce be prospective in nature and not retroactive and that step increases be frozen for the County’s
non-union workforce in fiscal year 2016; and
WHEREAS, it is recommended that all Grade 23 and lower non-union County employees receive a
non-compounded 4.5% cost of living increase effective the first pay period of October, 2015; and
WHEREAS, it is recommended that all Grade 24 and Grade 24 Equivalent positions receive an increase effective
the first pay period in October, 2015; however, said increase will be tied to length in current position and certain

WHEREAS, it is recommended that all non-union employees unless otherwise exempt herein shall receive a
compounded 2% cost of living in the 2016 fiscal year with said increase taking effect on December 1, 2015; and
WHEREAS, in order to match the union increases provided in the Collective Bargaining Agreements for the period
of December 1, 2012 through November 30, 2017, it is contemplated that additional increases may be provided in
fiscal year 2017; and

 WHEREAS, in addition to providing cost of living adjustments for the County’s non-union workforce, it is further
recommended that the health plan revisions implemented for the unionized workforce include the County’s
non-union employees and elected officials; and
WHEREAS, the proposed health plan revisions impact both plan designs and employee contributions and are
recommended to be implemented effective December 1, 2015 with additional contributions taking effect in fiscal
year 2016; and
WHEREAS, the proposed revised health plans continue to provide excellent benefits coverage at reasonable rates
to participating employees and officials; and
WHEREAS, the County continues to review benefit options for all participating employees and officials; and

by the Budget Director and the Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources:
