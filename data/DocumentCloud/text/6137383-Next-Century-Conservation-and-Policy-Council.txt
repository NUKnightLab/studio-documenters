 Attachment 2: Council Responsibilities
The Conservation and Policy Council is charged with helping the Forest Preserves to implement
the Next Century Conservation Plan, which is a 25-year vision for the Preserves, by overseeing
the development and annual update of a 5 year strategic and financial plan.
The General Superintendent has established a series of committees led by Preserves staff and
representatives of partner organizations to support the Council in developing this strategic
operating plan (see attachment 3). The partner organizations are contributing their time and
talent to assist, in some cases with funding from foundations or other outside resources. In
addition, through a generous grant from the Chicago Community Trust, Openlands is
collaborating with Forest Preserves staff to support Council operations and planning for the first
year.
The committees organized around the four goals of the plan will be responsible for identifying
tasks and milestones for the first year of implementation. Using this information, Openlands
and the Forest Preserves staff will work with Council members to develop a draft five-year
strategic and financial plan for the Council’s review and recommendation at its September 2015
meeting.
The proposed Council planning calendar for 2015 is as follows:
