partners, volunteers and visitors. The National Association of Counties will recognize award-winning
counties at its 2017 Annual Conference and Exposition July 21-24 in Franklin County, Ohio; and

in the preserves. Since launching in 2015, CLIC has trained more than 70 group workers and teachers,
who in turn have brought out more than 500 participants; and
WHEREAS, the Bird the Preserves marketing campaign, developed and implemented by the
communications division of the Office of the General Superintendent, received the Marketing Award for

Summary: The proposed Stormwater Management Wetlands Project consists of an open-water feature,
wetlands and sedge meadow. The project will provide an additional 74 acre-feet of stormwater storage
on the Preserves land as part of a comprehensive stormwater plan that includes a variety of additional

controlling open spaces to be incorporated for stormwater storage, conveyance, or water quality
improvements, including the Winnetka Park District, Winnetka School District 36, and New Trier High
School District. Upon satisfactory completion of the above-referenced items, the Preserves and
