Several of the speakers provided testimony in response to a recent news story that reported that the CCHHS
administration is considering phasing out its inpatient pediatric unit at Stroger Hospital. Dr. John Jay Shannon,
Chief Executive Officer, provided general comments relating to that subject.
Following are Dr. Shannon’s verbatim comments.

I appreciate the perspective of everyone who has come this morning. I’ll point out a distinction to our last
speaker - the mission statement of the organization is to care for the communities that we serve, regardless
of their ability to pay; that says nothing about citizenship. Another point is that our organization continues
to change; it has been around for more than 180 years, in one way, shape or form, and a lot of things have
pleasantly changed in those 180 years. We have improved the circumstances for the communities we serve.
As we’re going to continue to discuss in Board Meetings today and to follow, we’ve got to change with that
environment.

I’m a person who trained under Dr. Ron Anderson for 9 years, and I know Dr. Anderson, who died last
year, and who was a personal hero of mine, I think of very well. One of the things that Dr. Anderson knew
is that you had to get ahead of the curve, and as one of our speakers said, “be the change you wish to see.”
We as an organization have a long, proud history as an acute care hospital, running and performing what
Dr. Anderson would refer to as “resurrection medicine.” That is the medicine of the past; what we want
to be doing in the future is using all the resources – the buildings, revenue support and employees that we
have to improve in the best way possible for all of the communities we serve, and for all the ages and
distributions of illnesses that we see, in the best way that we can. Increasingly that future is an ambulatory
future. It is a future that is aligning the resources we have as a provider of health care. As the managers
of a growing Medicaid health plan, we have the ability to touch more, not fewer, people than we have
historically ever done. It is a correctional health system that allows us to interdict early with people who
have problems with behavioral health and substance abuse, and it is in the community, not based on the
“mother ship” strategy.
I am a pulmonary critical care doctor and an intensivist. And I appreciate and I know the critical nature
of highly specialized acute care services – I’ve done them all my life. But I also know that the future of our
health system is in the community, and it is linking evidence-based practices to improve the public health,
reduce the likelihood that a person gets pregnant when she doesn’t want to be, to reduce the likelihood
that the woman doesn’t carry to term, and thus to reduce the likelihood that she delivers a small, critically
ill child. That is where we’re going to be putting the resources of this organization going forward. I want
to emphasize that, contrary to what has been published, the organization has made no recommendation to
this Board about Pediatric services, and it has made no decisions about Pediatric services. So as we go
forward, as we must - we’re going to be responsible fiscal stewards and responsible proponents of the
communities of residents of the County that we serve.

CCHHS Assistant General Counsel, Jessica Pipersburgh, recently completed a fellowship program
through the University of Chicago’s Civic Leadership Academy. The Civic Leadership Academy is
an interdisciplinary leadership development program for emerging high-potential leaders in nonprofit
organizations and local government agencies within the City of Chicago and Cook County. Developed
by the University's Office of Civic Engagement in partnership with LISC Chicago and the Civic Consulting
Alliance, with funding from the Searle Funds at The Chicago Community Trust, the program is designed
to develop a pipeline of talented leaders to help nonprofits and government agencies thrive.

Activities and Announcements


This week marked the 50th Anniversary of the Medicare and Medicaid program, a pivotal milestone in
national health policy. From humble roots as programs tied structurally to “welfare” benefits,
Medicare and Medicaid have evolved into crucial health coverage for low-income families, persons
with disabilities and the elderly and continue to serve a major role in our country.
Today, approximately 1 in 3 Americans (more than 120 million individuals) receive health coverage
through Medicare or Medicaid. In Illinois, 1.9 million individuals are covered by Medicare and 3.1
million are served through Medicaid and CHIP. While the finances of these programs are calculable,
Page 38 of 44

 what cannot be measured is the just as real human impact of ensuring access to care for our nation’s
most vulnerable populations.
In 1940, only 9 percent of hospital patients had some form of health insurance. By 1968 the number of
people with hospital insurance increased to 80 percent. Since the implementation of the Affordable
Care Act (ACA), today nearly 90 percent of Americans have insurance. There is no doubt that federal
legislation has made great strides in providing access to care for a majority of Americans: access that
improves health status, quality of life and the overall health of our communities. From reimbursement
structures to disease treatment to safety, Medicare and Medicaid also serve as drivers of our nation’s
health care industry, challenging providers to bend the cost curve while providing high-quality,
effective care.
At the Cook County Health & Hospitals System, more than 60 percent of our patients have health
coverage through Medicare and Medicaid. As a result of Medicaid expansion, the system is caring for
more insured patients than uninsured patients for the first time in our history. And without question,
the function Medicare and Medicaid have as payors plays a key role in helping us keep our doors open.


We have completed two management “pilots” of customer service training as part of the system’s
Patient Experience Initiative, validating that our training design was complete, clear and even “fun”
from the nearly 20 attending.
We have completed two rounds of three sessions each in June and three rounds in July. Using a course
evaluation form after every session, the June sessions scored 4.75 on a 5-point scale for
tools/techniques offered, effectiveness of facilitators and overall helpfulness/plans to use information
learned in the training. Written comments included the following:
-

The PEI has helped me become more aware of my behavior and how to improve some of my
interactions – thank you!
Wonderful class experience! Can’t wait to see this in action across the system!
I enjoyed myself and will be practicing what I learned.
Thank you for making us proud of our workplace.

July sessions were rated at the same level. A total of approximately 150 staff members from numerous
departments and service sites have received training. In July, six new trainers completed the “train-thetrainer” day facilitated by System Manager of Learning and Development for HR, Karen Williams. They
have begun their co-facilitation opportunity.
Through the remainder of 2016, thirteen new rounds of training are scheduled. Additionally, Dr.
Benjamin Mba will train 143 Internal Medicine residents in early September. By year end, a minimum
of 700 staff members will have been trained.


To recognize National African American Hepatitis C Action Day on July 21, CORE staff provided
educational materials and rapid HCV and HIV testing at Stroger Hospital. Persons with a reactive
Hepatitis C result were followed up with a linkage program in place for HCV positive clients. Those with
reactive HIV tests were referred and linked to CORE Center for care. CORE Center’s Dr. Toyin Adeyemi,
a founding member of the Illinois Hepatitis C Task Force task force and staff managed the outreach
effort.

 Legislative Update
Cook County



Sean Morrisey was appointed to serve as Cook County Board Commissioner for the 17th District on
July 22, 2015. Commissioner Morrison succeeds Elizabeth Doody Gorman who resigned on July 15,
2015.
Commissioner Morrison is the owner of Morrison Security, a private security company located in
Alsip, IL. Sean Morrison also serves as the Republican Committeeman of Palos Township. He is a
graduate of Brother Rice High School and attended Moraine Valley Community College.
The 17th Cook County Board District includes portions of thirty municipalities running along the
western edge of Cook County from Orland Park to Des Plaines.

State



The State of Illinois has been without an operating budget since the new fiscal year started July 1,
2015. Nearly all of the budget bills passed by the General Assembly were vetoed by the Governor;
the only exception was the elementary and secondary education funding bill. The Senate voted to
override the Governor’s vetoes on the remaining budget bills, but the House did not take up a vote.
A temporary one-month budget was passed by both chambers earlier this month and was sent to
the Governor on July 15, 2015. To date, no action has been taken.



On July 23, in response to a court filing from the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law
and the AIDS Legal Council of Chicago (ALCC), federal Judge Joan Lefkow ordered the Illinois
department of health and Family Services (HFS) to reimburse ALL Medicaid providers that offer
services to children in Cook County, even in the absence of a state budget.
The Shriver Center and ALCC based their filing on the Memisovski v. Maram consent decree which
the state entered into in 2004 to ensure equal access to providers for children on Medicaid in Cook
County. It is CCHHS’ understanding that the ruling applies to payments to managed care entities
that provide services to children, which will should allow CCHHS to receive FY16 monthly PMPM
payments for children AND adults. As of July 24, 2015 HFS has not appealed this ruling, nor
responded to how or when they plan to comply.



The Illinois House is scheduled to return to Springfield on July 28 and the Illinois Senate is scheduled
to return to Springfield August 4.

Federal


On July 8, 2015 the House Committee on Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Health held a
hearing titled "Medicaid at 50: Strengthening and Sustaining the Program.“ A number of
Congressmen discussed how Medicaid expansion has dramatically reduced the number of
uninsured. There was also discussion of the increasing costs of the program, transparency, 1115
waivers, and community health centers. Illinois Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky participated in the
hearing and spoke about the role of nursing homes and the need to lessen institutional care.

 

Managed Care was also discussed. On June 1, 2015 CMS issued new regulations that they hope will
clarify myriad managed care issues. CCHHS has provided individual comment to CMS on the
proposed regulations and also submitted a joint letter with Los Angeles County Health Services
addressing shared concerns. Managed Care Regulations have not been updated in ten (10) years.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for CCHHS at both the State and Federal level.

 Cook County Health and Hospitals System
Board of Directors Annual Meeting Minutes
July 31, 2015

ATTACHMENT #9

Page 43 of 44

 Dear CCHHS employees,
At today’s Cook County Health & Hospitals
System Board of Directors Meeting, we
presented initial plans to enhance the services
we provide and improve our competitive
position on the south side of Chicago. This is in
keeping with our mission to ensure the continued
access to quality care for all.
The growth of CountyCare in the Provident
catchment area coupled with a solid payor mix
at Provident/Sengstacke presents substantial
opportunity for CCHHS to deliver increased
state-of-the-art healthcare in a community we
have long and proudly served.
I am pleased to announce that we intend to
pursue construction of a new health and
diagnostic center in the Provident community.
We envision a regional outpatient center (ROC)
focused on primary care and prevention,
accessible to our patients and integrated with
community services. We plan to build a center
that is whole-person and family-centered while
delivering evidence-based care in a safe,
coordinated and modern environment.
A new ROC will provide primary and specialty
care services, laboratory and diagnostic services
including a full spectrum of radiology services.
We hope to ultimately provide dental,
behavioral health, orthopedics and geriatric
services. In expanding our same day surgery
capabilities, we are thrilled to offer
ophthalmology as a center of excellence
providing state-of-the-art eye care putting us on
the cutting edge of treatment and bringing a
much needed service to this community.
We hope to move deliberately through the
approval, planning, design and construction
phases but it will take some time. This facility will
provide expanded services and convenient
access for patients who historically travelled to
the central campus for some of their care.
From an inpatient perspective, admissions at
Provident remain low but as the healthcare
environment around us continues to change,

there may be additional inpatient opportunities.
We will need to right size Provident in the coming
budget to more appropriately reflect the current
and projected inpatient census. But we are
optimistic that the dynamics in the market
coupled with the new ROC may increase
CCHHS’ share of necessary acute care
hospitalizations over time.
As we move ahead with these ambitious plans,
we will keep you informed. For now, I hope you
share our excitement as we expand services for
our patients and improve the working
environment for our staff.
Sincerely,

Dr. Jay Shannon
Chief Executive Officer

The insurance status of our patients should serve
as a constant reminder that the majority of our
patients can now choose their provider. Every
interaction we have with them can influence their
loyalty. Please do your part to improve the
patient experience.
And remember that the services we provide to
the insured allow us to remain true to our mission
to care for the uninsured.
