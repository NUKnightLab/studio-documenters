Staff requests setting aside $500,000 in available SFY19 CLEP funds to issue a
competitive NOFO in the third quarter of 2018 for the CLEP program.
Note: This NOFO will only be released if the Community-Law Enforcement Partnership
for Deflection and Addiction Treatment Act becomes law.
Police-led Deflection
Individuals face a range of barriers to entering or gaining access to treatment, including
uncertainty about how to access to services, shame and stigma, denial of a substance use
disorder or substance misuse, costs and lack of insurance/Medicaid, transportation,
treatment waiting lists, and prior negative treatment experiences (Appel, Ellison, Jansky,
& Oldak, 2004). Police agencies across the nation have implemented programs to reduce
these barriers.
Applicants may request funding under one or more of these funding categories:
(1) A post deflection response initiated by a peace officer or law enforcement agency
subsequent to emergency administration to reverse an overdose, or in case of
severe substance use disorder with acute high risk for overdose.
(2) A self-referral deflection response initiated by an individual by contacting a peace
officer or law enforcement agency in the acknowledgement of their substance use
disorder.
(3) An active outreach deflection response initiated by a peace officer or law
enforcement agency because of a proactive identification of persons thought
likely to have a substance use disorder.
(4) An officer prevention deflection response initiated by a peace officer or law
enforcement agency in a response to a community call when no criminal charges
are present.
(5) An officer intervention deflection response when criminal charges are present but
held in abeyance pending engagement with treatment.

B. Death Penalty Abolition Act Fund
Recommended Designation
Staff recommends designating $6.5 million in appropriated SFY19 Death Penalty
Abolition Act (DPA) funds to offer a September 2018 Notice of Funding Opportunity.
Public Act 725 ILCS 5/119(b) directed the transfer of all unobligated and unexpended
monies remaining in the Capital Litigation Trust Fund to the Death Penalty Abolition
Fund, a special fund in the state treasury, to be expended by the Illinois Criminal Justice
Information Authority. These funds shall be used for services for families of victims of
homicide or murder and for training of law enforcement personnel.
Through smaller appropriations in state fiscal years 2017 and 2018, ICJIA has used DPA
funds to support crisis response and recovery services to family members of Chicago
homicide victims provided by Chicago’s Citizens for Change. With this Notice of
Funding Opportunity, ICJIA will solicit applications for both crisis response services and
law enforcement training.
The Notice of Funding Opportunity will make funds available from approximately
December 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019. Contingent of satisfactory performance and
future appropriations, successful applicants may receive funding for a maximum of 36
months of program activity through this solicitation.
Staff will be available at the Budget Committee meeting to answer any questions.
C. Duane Dean Behavioral Health Center Fund
The Duane Dean Behavioral Health Center’s Community Diversion Program seeks to
employ a broad based comprehensive approach in Kankakee County to educate and
increase access to services to the local criminal justice systems, the local community and
the opioid dependent individuals. This program will incorporate community education
and trainings, cognitive behavioral counseling, medication assisted therapy (MAT), case
managers, peer support specialist, and recovery coaches.
Staff recommends designating $400,000 in SFY19 line-item appropriated General
Revenue funds to The Duane Dean Behavioral Health Center to support its Community
Diversion Program. Further details are provided in the attached Grant Recommendation
Form.
D. Prescription Pill and Drug Disposal Fund
The Illinois General Assembly passed Public Act 097-0545, which established the
Prescription Pill and Drug Disposal (PPDD) Fund, a special fund in the state treasury.
The Act states, “monies in the Fund shall be used for grants by the Illinois Criminal
Justice Information Authority to local law enforcement agencies for the purpose of
11

 SFY 2019 State Appropriations
August 14, 2018
Page 4 of 5

facilitating the collection, transportation, and incineration of pharmaceuticals from
residential sources that are collected and transported by law enforcement agencies.”
Medicines are found in nearly every home. These products include over-the-counter and
prescription medications, such as pills and capsules, creams, liquids, and aerosols. When
used as directed, these products are generally safe for humans and the environment.
However, unused or unwanted medicine needs to be disposed of properly to help prevent
accidental poisoning, substance abuse, and contamination of water resources.
According to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, unused or unwanted
medicines should not be flushed down the toilet or poured into the sink. These methods
create the potential for harmful chemicals to end up in our lakes, rivers, streams, and
groundwater. In fact, traces of some medicines have been found in water samples in 30
states, which have been connected to harmful impacts on localized aquatic ecosystems.
The negotiation and execution of many grants smaller than $2,000 each would be onerous
for both ICJIA and the recipient agencies. In early 2018, ICJIA asked the Illinois
Sheriff’s Association (ISA) and the Illinois Association of Chief of Police (IACP) to
consider procuring drug disposal kits with SFY18 PPDD funding on behalf of their
member agencies. ISA accepted and agreed to make the kits available to ISA and IACP
members.
While larger drug store chains have made drug disposal boxes available in more populous
areas of the state, rural areas lack access to these disposal sites. ISA prioritized requests
from law enforcement agencies in jurisdictions with less access to commercial disposal
sites.
Recipient agencies agreed to follow standard procedures for the receipt, storage, and
disposal of the collected drugs. ISA developed a standard certification that recipient
agencies signed to assure required drug handling, inventory, and disposal practices are
followed. The agreement includes, at minimum:









The recipient will identify two staff members as Drug Disposal Box (DDB)
Controllers.
The DDB may only be opened by the two designated DDB Controllers.
The contents of the DDB must be removed at least monthly.
Contents of the DDB must be inventoried by weight and secured in compliance
with standard department evidence handling procedures.
The contents of the DDB must be disposed of by the two DDB Controllers at a
facility approved by the Illinois EPA.
The two DDB Controllers will obtain a signed and dated receipt for the items
disposed of at the EPA-approved site.
The DDB keys must under the secure control of the sheriff/chief of police or his
or her designee, following procedures controlling access to evidence storage.
The recipient agencies will submit to ISP a monthly standard report totaling the
weight of drugs collected and disposed.

During the brief performance period of March 15, 2018, to June 30, 2018, ISA
successfully procured and arranged for the delivery of boxes to 27 rural counties. ISA has
agreed to continue to implement the program using SFY19 PPDD funds. Staff
recommends designating $150,000 in SFY19 PPDD funds to the ISA to support this
effort. Further details are provided in the attached Grant Recommendation Form.
E. Safer Foundation Fund
Staff recommends designating $500,000 in SFY19 line-item appropriated General
Revenue funds to The Safer Foundation (SF) to support its partnership with Mount Sinai
Hospital’s Sinai Urban Health Institute (SUHI) as it seeks to better understand the issues
connected to gun violence in Chicago’s west side communities. As a referral partner,
SUHI seeks to work with SF to build their previous study of non-fatal gun violence
victims who are treated and discharged quickly. The goal is to refer such persons for SF
services and to identify their social needs, gaps, resources and barriers to employment
and workforce development comparing those with and those without arrest/conviction
records.
ICJIA funds will allow Safer Foundation to use mechanisms to provide additional
supports to participants participating in a higher level of credentialed training and job
training, including higher literacy, skill level, case management, and wrap around
services. Further details are provided in the attached Grant Recommendation Form.

Prescription Pill and Drug Disposal – Illinois Sheriff’s Association

Funding Source:

SFY19 Prescription Pill and Drug Disposal: $150,000; No match requirement

Agency Budget:

$1,025,000

Request Type:

ICJIA request

Program Description
To facilitate the safe disposal of drugs, the Illinois General Assembly passed Public Act 097-0545, which
established the Prescription Pill and Drug Disposal (PPDD) Fund, a special fund in the state treasury. The Act
states, “monies in the Fund shall be used for grants by the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority to
local law enforcement agencies for the purpose of facilitating the collection, transportation, and incineration of
pharmaceuticals from residential sources that are collected and transported by law enforcement agencies.”
Program Activities
Through this program, the Illinois Sheriff’s Association (ISA) offers local law enforcement agencies drug
disposal kits consisting of secure drop boxes and disposal bags. Because more rural areas of the state lack
access to commercial drop boxes which are common at pharmacies in more populated areas, ISA will prioritize
applications from more rural areas, and will order and arrange for the delivery of drug disposal kits to the
selected law enforcement agencies at no cost. Recipient agencies must agree to maintain control of the drugs
collected and dispose of them according to ICJIA-approved guidelines.
Goals
The goal of the program is to increase public health and safety by enabling law enforcement agencies to safely
collect unused prescription pills and medications.
Priorities
The Illinois General Assembly named ICJIA the agency responsible for the implementation of the program.
Funding Prospectus
ISA agreed to pilot this program using SFY18 PPDD funds and to continue implementation using an SFY19
appropriation. Future funding is contingent on General Assembly appropriation.

Program Description
Safer Foundation has a record of effectively combatting recidivism and crime reduction by providing
employment opportunities to individuals who are at risk of engaging in unlawful activities, becoming the
victims and/or perpetrators of violence, or falling into the ranks of the long-term unemployed. Safer Foundation
enjoys a robust network of resources to support its work in workforce development and human capital
development leading to employment and economic stability for people with arrest and conviction records. In
collaboration with its community partners, employer partners and training partners, Safer will recruit, screen,
and prepare program participants for sustainable employment. Job placement strategies will include: transitional
jobs, on-the-job training and permanent placements. ICJIA funds will allow Safer Foundation to use
mechanisms to provide additional supports to participants participating in a higher level of credentialed training
and job training, including higher literacy, skill level, case management, and wrap around services. Job training
and placement is anticipated to occur in one of these fields: auto mechanics, food service/culinary arts,
woodworking/cabinetry, consumer goods manufacturing, construction, and media.
In addition, Safer will partner with Mount Sinai Hospital’s Sinai Urban Health Institute (SUHI) as it seeks to
better understand the issues connected to gun violence in Chicago’s west side communities. The rippling effect
of gun violence has both social and economic impacts including lost wages and taxes, medical bills, high law
enforcement and corrections costs, and community disinvestment. As a referral partner, SUHI seeks to work
with Safer to build their previous study of non-fatal gun violence victims who are treated and discharged
quickly. The goal is to refer such persons for Safer services and to identify their social needs, gaps, resources
and barriers to employment and workforce development comparing those with and those without
arrest/conviction records. This partnership leverages the expertise of both organizations and employs new
strategies in addressing violence reduction. This program element would provide needed staffing to conduct
assessments of non-fatal gun violence victims with superficial injuries in the emergency department and to link
those with arrest or conviction records to Safer workforce development services in high demand/skill areas.
This is anticipated to occur for six months beginning in October 2018 as part of the outreach and referral
pipeline/year.

recommends designating $455,000 in FFY16 funds to the Chicago Department of Family and
Support Services to fund the Statewide Domestic Violence Hotline. Please see the attached Grant
Recommendation Report for more information.
Transitional Housing
The Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee in 2013 identified transitional housing programs as a funding
priority. In July 2016, ICJIA issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) seeking
applications for the development or enhancement of transitional housing for victims of domestic
violence and/or human trafficking. Eleven of the 19 submissions were recommended for funding
by the review panel. Staff recommends designating funds to the following entities and programs
to allow them to continue for 18 months. This additional 18 months of funding will complete the
recommended 36 months of funding for the Transitional Housing program as stated in the
NOFO. Please see the attached Grant Recommendation Reports for more information.

Program Description
The Domestic Violence Hotline is a 24- hour toll free confidential resource that serves as a clearinghouse
providing domestic violence victims with immediate information about their safety planning, available options
and how to access supportive services. Callers can obtain a direct three-way link to domestic violence resources
including shelter, counseling, legal advocacy and children’s services.
Program Activities
The City of Chicago Department of Family and Support Services contracts with the Chicago Metropolitan
Battered Women’s Network to staff the Domestic Violence Hotline 24-hours a day, seven days per week.
Trained Victim Information and Referral Advocates (VIRA’s) assist victims, law enforcement, faith leaders and
various community stakeholders with information and referrals to supportive services when requested. Funding
for this initiative will directed towards personnel cost associated with staffing the Domestic Violence Hotline
and includes partial funding of the following positions:





Three Supervisors for each of the shifts - one for each eight-hour shift;
Eight full-time VIRA’s;
Six part-time VIRA’s;
Three hourly VIRA’s; and

Goals
The goal of the program is to provide direct services to domestic violence victims to alleviate trauma and
suffering incurred from victimization.
Priorities
Funding to support the Domestic Violence Hotline corresponds with the Authority identified funding priority of
addressing fundamental needs of victims. When victims’ call the Domestic Violence Hotline for assistance, they
are made aware of the options available to them and are provided safety planning, referrals to shelter,

Template Revision Date: 07/03/2018

counseling, legal services and referrals to numerous other forms of assistance and/or services. Additionally,
having access to the Language Line removes a considerable barrier by affording victims the opportunity to
communicate in their native language which provides a measure of relief as they seek to reclaim their lives free
of violence and abuse.
Funding Prospectus
The Domestic Violence Hotline has consistently provided unparalleled assistance and support to victims of
domestic violence as well as various other stakeholders since its inception in 1998. The Domestic Violence
Hotline remains the only entity capable of directly linking victims to the services they seek by being a single
point of access to assistance. The ability to make one telephone call and obtain emotional support, safety
planning, shelter referrals, legal advocacy as well as referrals to a wide array of other services is critically
important for domestic violence victims as it eliminates many of the barriers they face when seeking to free
themselves and their dependent children from violence. There is no other Hotline in the City of Chicago/State of
Illinois with the depth of experience and quality in providing assistance, information and referrals to services,
concerned family and friends and various other community stakeholders.
The Domestic Violence Hotline has consistently exceeded the goals established for the program based the
volume of calls responded to within the City of Chicago as well as throughout the State of Illinois. Victims,
concerned family and friends, faith leaders, law enforcement, and a host of community stakeholders continue to
rely on the Domestic Violence Hotline as the single point of access for domestic violence information,
assistance and referrals to services.
Past Performance
During the past 12 months, the program has provided the following services:







2,421 clients were provided with information about the criminal justice process
1,518 of clients provided with information about victims’ rights, how to obtain notifications, etc.

Program Description
Safe Passage has been privileged since 1981 to provide DeKalb County a 24/7 crisis hotline; an emergency
shelter; legal and medical advocacy; individual, group, and family counseling and therapy; and transitional
housing to victims of intimate partner violence (IPV), including domestic violence, sexual assault, dating
violence, stalking and human trafficking. The organization’s transitional housing program has 21 years of
experience and successful operation of a trauma-informed and lifesaving service that helps victims of IPV avoid
homelessness or return to an abuser and successfully rebuild their lives. Victims come with severe and complex
trauma histories and daunting barriers to escaping abusive partners and life situations. Poverty, mental illness,
PTSD, unemployment, limited education, health concerns, affordable child care, legal problems, and ruined
credit are just a few of the barriers they face. This program offers clients safe housing, trauma-informed
services, and 24 months to rebuild their lives.
The need to expand this program is evident in the increasing lengths of stay victims in the emergency shelter
have required in the last few years. The shelter is always full and each week program staff turn away many
women and children. Requested are funds to expand housing from 7 to 10 apartments and to hire a programdedicated case manager and part-time counselor to provide a full array of trauma-informed services. The
additional staff and housing will allow the program to help more victims of IPV, who need the time and support
that transitional housing offers to become safe, independent, productive members of the community.
Program Activities
Adult clients with or without children will be screened for eligibility and placed into transitional housing units.
Needs assessment with completed service plan will be conducted and a caseworker will be assigned. The
program will offer financial education, education with GED or certification/degree with goal of employment
while offering life skills and securing stable housing.
Goals
To provide victims of domestic violence and/or human trafficking and their children to permanent safe housing
and self-sufficiency through individualized empowering approaches.

Program Description
WINGS’s North Cook Transitional Housing (NCTH) program allows homeless victims of domestic violence to
access an apartment, rent, and utility support coupled with individualized case management and traumainformed services. The NCTH program specializes in providing trauma-informed services to underserved
populations. This program is a partnership between two domestic violence agencies, WINGS and Apna Ghar.
The NCTH program’s tailored approach complements WINGS’ and Apna Ghar’s belief that each participant in
NCTH should be given afforded the most autonomy possible. Both agencies have been working with victims of
domestic violence for over 25 years. Apna Ghar will be responsible for overseeing rent payment and case
management for 8 units, and WINGS will be responsible for overseeing rent payment and case management for
4 units. Self-empowerment is a core value of the NCTH program; this is seen through the individualized case
management services provided where clients have a choice of community, choice of home, and an
education/training plan. All services offered through the program follow a trauma-informed, client-driven
model. Recovery is possible when survivors are empowered to make the choices that they believe best address
their needs and when supports are offered in a holistic, culturally appropriate way
Program Activities
WINGS and Apna Ghar will make an array of services available to the participants including: safety planning;
supportive counseling around domestic violence issues for adults and children, and making connections if
therapeutic counseling is needed; budgeting and financial planning support; connecting clients with mainstream
resources, including crime victim compensation; providing family activities; and providing access to food and
supply pantries, and resources around the holidays, back to school, and other times.
Goals
To provide victims of domestic violence and/or human trafficking and their children with pathways to
permanent, safe housing and self-sufficiency through individualized, empowering approaches.

Program Description
The Allies in Healing program will serve adult survivors of child abuse in Cook County. The program will
serve the entire city with an emphasis on marginalized communities, including Bridgeport, Little Village,
Pilsen, Brighton Park, Englewood, and Back of the Yards, and underserved populations, males, people of color,
second language learners, and victims with an undocumented immigration status. The program will aid victims
of abuse with counseling, legal advocacy, and emergency services (relocation assistance, medical attention etc.).
Program Activities
Adult survivors of childhood abuse and their family members can engage in the following services, available in
English and Spanish: crisis intervention, case management, individual counseling, family counseling, and
therapy. Trauma support groups are provided to adult survivors of childhood abuse at a substance use treatment
facility. Case management includes direct service (e.g., notifying and assisting with victim compensation
paperwork; obtaining criminal or civil protection orders; relocation services; assisting in filing for losses
covered by public and private insurance programs; accompanying victims to the hospital, assisting victims to
address life skill development that was impaired as a direct result of the victimization), advocacy (e.g.,
intervening with employers, creditors, and others on behalf of the victim), and community referrals (e.g.,
English learning programs or dental or health).
Goals
The goal of counseling and therapy services is to improve mental well-being and address the impact of
participants’ victimization. The goals of trauma support groups are to improve mental health and increase
resources for adults suffering from substance use disorders by treating childhood abuse and trauma in a
substance use treatment setting.
