REPORT FROM SYSTEM BOARD CHAIRMAN WARREN L. BATTS
Chairman Batts indicated that he would provide a report at the next meeting.

_________________________________

REPORT FROM THE SYSTEM
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WILLIAM T. FOLEY
Mr. Foley presented information regarding the following (Attachment #1):
Update on Project Brotherhood
Mr. Foley stated that at a previous meeting of the Board, representatives from Project Brotherhood addressed the
Board during public comments. He provided a brief description of Project Brotherhood, stating that it is a
program based out of the clinic at the Woodlawn Center. Although they are not a County agency, there is a
quasi-relationship with the County. Mr. Foley stated that he will present a proposal to the Finance Committee to
support this program, as their grant funding is running out.
Revised Chief Executive Officer’s 90 Day – 6 Month – 1 Year Plan for the Cook County Health
and Hospitals System
Mr. Foley briefly reviewed the plan. He stated that Navigant Consulting’s performance improvement
assessment will probably not be completed until the end of September, as they are having difficulties gathering
the data that is needed. Additionally, the revised MedAssets contract is expected to be presented to the Finance
Committee at its meeting of June 30th.
Mr. Foley stated that there is a contract on the agenda that will allow him to bring in an interim Director of
Office of Performance Improvement. This position would lead, coordinate and facilitate all of the performance
improvement initiatives currently going on.
With regard to the work currently being done by Solucient on the full-time equivalent employee benchmarking
study, Mr. Foley stated that the work should be completed early in July.
Memo of Understanding from Geo-Vax Labs, Inc.
Response from CORE Foundation Board to Geo-Vax Labs’ Memo of Understanding
Mr. Foley stated that Geo-Vax Labs, Inc. is a publicly-traded biotech company developing a preventative and
therapeutic vaccine for HIV treatment. They submitted a proposal to Cook County Board President Todd H.
Stroger’s office, which would involve the CORE Center in conducting Phase I trials of therapeutic HIV
vaccines, and then to engage in possible future preventative HIV vaccine phases to be in subsequent trials. An
agreement was drafted, which in his opinion would have overly-committed the System, CORE Center, and
CORE Foundation Board. He did not sign that agreement.
Subsequently, a revised agreement was drafted (included in the attachment). He added that Elizabeth Reidy,
Deputy Chief of the Civil Actions Bureau of the Office of the State’s Attorney, and Laura Lechowicz Felicione,
Special Counsel to President Todd H. Stroger, had worked on it. What the revised agreement allowed was for
Mr. Foley to bring to the attention of the System Board as well as the CORE Foundation Board this proposal.
He added that he was bringing the matter to the Board for informational purposes only.

REPORT OF THE
BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
JUNE 26, 2009

On June 24th, the CORE Foundation Board had a meeting, and the agreement was discussed. Dr. Robert
Weinstein, Chief Operating Officer of the CORE Center, raised the issue at the meeting. There was a lengthy
discussion, and in the letter (included in the attachment) from CORE Foundation Board President Commissioner
John Daley, Executive Vice President Dr. Larry Goodman, Dr. Weinstein, and Ruth Rothstein, they concluded
that for scientific reasons, they recommended that the CORE Foundation Board not pursue the proposal.
Mr. Foley provided further information on the discussion that took place at the Core Foundation Board meeting.
He stated that this was really a scientific issue, because it relates to drug trials. There was a lengthy discussion
at that meeting, with experts and Dr. French, the Institutional Review Board (IRB) Chairman. Based on that
discussion, the recommendation was that the proposal should not be pursued.
Dr. Weinstein provided additional information. He stated that they vetted the question through the world’s
experts, and that was the decision based upon the extensive vetting.
Director Carvalho inquired as to the reason why the CORE Foundation would be the party making that decision;
he stated that the Foundation has no operational role.
Dr. Weinstein stated that that might be a legal issue, not a medical issue. His interpretation is that he believes
this company is looking for a 501(c)(3) organization with which to participate in fundraising. He thought that
they identified the CORE Foundation as that entity.
Director Ansell stated that he was unsure why it reached this level; if the Chief Operating Officer, Dr.
Weinstein, didn’t want to do it, it should have never reached the Board.
Mr. Foley stated that there would have been some commitments that would have involved the CORE
Foundation, in terms of funding and raising money. Since they were having that discussion at the CORE
Foundation meeting, Dr. Weinstein invited the scientific experts in so they could have the benefit of the
discussion prior to today’s meeting. He stated that the System Board has the ultimate authority, and added that
they are recommending that they not pursue it.

REPORT FROM THE SYSTEM INTERIM
CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER JOHN RABA, MD
Dr. Raba presented information regarding the following (Attachment #2):
Integration of System-wide Clinical Services
Dr. Raba pointed out that since the last time he reported on the subject, an additional six or seven departments,
programs, or divisions have been integrated System-wide.
Collaborations within and outside the System
As a result of the increased integration of System-wide clinical services, there have been opportunities for
increased collaborations within and outside the System.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM

Single Medical Staff Bylaws
Dr. Raba stated that efforts continue on the draft of the single medical staff bylaws. He expects that they will
need a few more weeks to complete the draft, after which it will be presented to the medical staffs for review by
their bylaws committees. He hopes to have everything finalized, after review and approval by the appropriate
entities, by the Fall.
Physician Salary Inequity Correction
Dr. Raba provided an update on an issue came up in the Human Resources Committee with regard to physician
salary inequity corrections. He stated that they were directed to create a plan that would equalize salaries for
similar specialties and primary care providers. The plan has been created, and affects 279 providers in the
System. They will receive an estimated 4.79% annual increase in one of the payrolls in July. They are already
getting a 2.0% increase based on the new salary scales, so it is really another 2.79% increase for this year. That
will result in approximately $635,000 in additional costs to the County for this fiscal year, and next year, if it is
annualized out, it will cost approximately $1,500,000.
Accountability and Productivity
Dr. Raba stated that the System chairs have been directed to come up with System metrics that they would like
to see. This will be important, in order to be able to look across the System to see productivity at each of the
sites.
He added that the dual employment standards for the clinical leaders have been finalized, and compliance by the
Department chairs is being implemented.
With regard to the issue on dual employment, Director Lyne inquired whether any exceptions would be allowed.
Dr. Raba responded that there would only be exceptions that are clearly to the benefit of the County; such
exceptions will require the permission of both the affiliate Chief Medical Officer and the System Chief Medical
Officer.
Director Ansell noted that another issue that should be addressed sometime in the future is System-wide
conflicts of interest. He added that other entities have comprehensive policies with regard to this subject.
Cermak Health Services
Dr. Raba provided an update on Cermak Health Services, and added that further information will be provided
during the closed session discussion.

piece of equipment is needed, a draw-down on the line is done and the rate is fixed for the draw at that time. He
added that these will be operating leases, not capital leases, so the County’s bonding authority is not impacted.

GEOVAX PROPOSAL
. What follows is an overview of GeoVax and the my I AIDS Vaccines that are the subject of the proposed trials.,
some history oftheir di>velopment and results from earlier trials. and the proposal f.or a cooperative effort between
Cook County, the foundation and GooVa.x to acce.\erare the schedule for conducting clinical trials necessary to
establish efficacy and obtain required regulatory approval fur general distribution oftbe Vaccines.

The proposal calls for participation by the Health System through the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center in
conducting clinical trials in Cook County and participation by the CORE Foundation and Cook County in
obtaining sufficient funds from private non-profit or govem.mentsourees to conduct the overall cUnical trial
program (such funds, the "Qualifying Funds"'). The involvement ofGeoVax entails responsibility for production

of the vaccines, the establishment, management and oversight ofthe clinical trials process, and regulatory
compliance, which includes interaction with regulatory a.uthorities.

Baekgrouoo.

HfV a.ffects the entire globe and comes ina variety of sub1}'Pes. Clade B is the predominant subtype iII North
America where there are roughly 60.000 new infections each year. Globally, there are about 2.5 million AIDS
infections per year, most involving subtypes AG, B, and C. 1n 2007, UNAIDS reported 13 million people Hving
with AIDS In. North America. and 33.2 millwn peopfe living with AIDS worldwide. Presently, there is little to
prevent HfV 1:ran&missionother than education, circumcision, and condoms. It 1S obvious from the spread of the
disease that these methods are not adequate. ExiSting treatments for individuals infected with liIV include anti­
retroviral therapies that are effective but have serious medical side effe~ts and are very expensive (upwards of
S1.500/month). This cost is borne by the individual. third party insurance, local heatthcare, federal or world health
organ izations.
Development and distribution of an effective HIV/AIDS vaccine holds great promise. The GeoVax Vaccine

GeoVas.aud theHIV/AIDS VB«i:aes.

Gee Vax is a publicly-traded biotech developer of preventative and therapeutic vaecines to combat HNIAIDS.
The company was formed in 200 l·asa spin-off from the Emory University Vaccine Center· and latm'merged with
a Chicago-based publicly-held company. Company founder and lead v.accine scientist, Dr. Harriet Robinson,.
remains active in the Company and serves as its Vice President ofResearch and Development. Discoveries
described in 14 exclusively licensed parents make up the technology bebind tire Company's Vaccines. The
science behind the Vaccines 'was developed in collaborations with scientists at Emory University, the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control. and the U.$. National Institutes of Health..
OeoVax' 5 Vaccines are being developed both as a preventative vaccine (to protect HIV uninfecred people from
contracting AfDS after exposure to the HIV virus) and as a therapeutic vaccine (to reduce the need for expensive

anti-retroviral drugs in treating infected people). The GeoVax Vaccines have two components· a recombinant
DNA vaccine that expresses tire three IU!\jor proteins of HIV-1 and a recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara
(MY A) vaccine thai expresses the same three HJV ~ 1 proteins.. Bothvacc_ .~ non-infectioUs virus like
particles"
The DNA vaccine is used to prime the immmc response while the MVA is used to boost the immune response.
The MVA Vaccine can also be used to both prime and boost an immune response. Both vaccines stimulate the
production of protective antibody and protective T -call (type of white blood cell) immune responses. The vaccine·

3

 17

elicited antibodies recognize and I:ilock the HJV -I virus before infection, while theT-cells recognize and killHIV­
infected cells. The two responses complement one another in reducing infection.

3.

Clinkal Trial History.

The Vaccines have been tested in five completed Phase I safety clinical trials. These trials, conducted in healthy
uninfected volunteers through the HJV VaccineTrials Network have established the proper dose and timing for
the injections to maximize Vacc,ine responses. The DNA priming combined with MYA boosting has been found
to elicit the highest T cell responses whereas the MV A prime combined with a MV A boost has been found to
elicit the highest antibod:yresponses. The HTV Vaccine Trials Network is the largest world\\.ide Clinical trials
program for the testing of HfViAIDS vaccines and is supported through funding from the U.S. National Institutes
of Health.
The company recently began a Phase 2a trial of its preventative application, working with the HlV Vaccine Trials
Network, in low risk, uninfected volunteers. This trial (called the HVTN 205 tria.!) consists of 150 Vaccine
recipients and 75 placebo recipients and is being conducted in 13 sites. Eleven of the sites are spread throughout
North America and two are in Peru, South America.
Since the 1990's more than 80 Phase I protocols involving mv{AIDS vaccines have been undertaken by the HfV
Vaccine Trials Network. Of these, only five have progressed into Phase 2 or beyond. Of these five; only three
candidate vaccines continue to be'supported. The GeoVax Vaccine is one' ofth.ose three candidate vaccines with
continuing support

Encouraging results from animal. trials provide a .rationaJe for conducting therapeutic trials in people. Recent
.trials conducted by Dr. Rarna Amara at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University
addressed the potential of the simian immunodeficiency virus prototype ofthe GeoVax HIV Vaccine to provide
therapeutic benefit to recently infected non~human primates. Macaque monkeys were given the simian version of

the HIV virus Hnd t 2 weeks later placed on oral anti-retroviral medication that reduced the \'inti load. Then the
animals were given the simian equivalent of the therapeutic vaccine and were removed from the oral medication
to see if the vaccine responses could control the infection in .tbe absence ofdrugs. fu one non human primate the
infection wa.<; controlled to IOO-times lower Jev.cIs than found pre-drug treatment. I.n the second, it was controlled
to > I OOO-times lower levels.

Clinical Trials ProposaL

GeoVax proposes that the parties negotiate a formal agreement to conduct, dependent upon funding generared by
private or government sources through Cook County and the Foundation, at least one and up to seven
progressively more advanced clinical trials for therapeutic andprevemative vaccines. OeoVa-.: further proposes
that in each case, the conduct ofa given clinical trial through the cooperation wUl inciude the Health System
through the CORE Center serving as a [lead] clinical sIte and wiII be dependent upon the receipt by the
Foundatiof4 a nOI1-profit 501 (c)(3)} cl)l1lOt8tion, of funds from independent privare or government sources that
are sufficient in the view of the Foundation, Health System and GeoVax tAl adequately fund the multi-site clinical
trial at all sites participating in the trial, including any sites operated directly by the Health System. The currently .
proposed clinical trials are summarized below. Plans may change depending upon results obtained in the clinical

trials, discussions ",ith regulatory authorities and regulatory consultants and ather factors or as otherwise
approved by the Health System Boord of Directors or the Foundation Board of Directors.
Therapeutic: Vac:dne. Geo Vax proposes an immediate therapeutic trial in HIV infected individua.ls at three sites.
This 15 subject trial scheduled to start in late 2009 would involve the Atlanta location, AIDS Research
Consortium of Atlanta and one site in Chicago. A dmft protocol is being fmalized for the Atlanta site and could
easily be amended to include more subjects and a Chicago site. This Phase I trial would not be blinded and is
intentionally small because it is the first time the Vaccine is being used in HJV positive subjects.

 18

Assuming positive results from the Phase 1 therapeutic trial. a se.cond 50-patient Phase 2a trial, spread over ten
sites including sites in Chicago, would commence by mid::W II, Then in earty 2013 two parallel placebo
controlled trials (400 patients each), double.blind, randomiz.ed Phase 2b trial would finalize the testing for the
therapeutic licensure of the vaccine by the U.s. Food and Drug Administration ("'FDA").
Preventive Vaccine. GeoVax., with cooperation from the HfV Vaccine Trials Netl-vork, is currently in a Phase 2a
clinical trial testing a vaccine consisting of two DNA immunization compon.ents and two MVA immunization
components (DDMM) in low risk individuals. Subject to available funding through CORE, a parallel trial would
be conducted using a three MYA (I\1:MM) dosing regimen. This MMM group is proposed because the results of
current phase I trials show the MMM regimen eliciting better antibody responses than the DDMM regimen. In
contrast, the DDMM regimen /las elicited better T cd! responses than the MMMregimen. Consequently, both
regimens warrant testing in small scale efficacy trails for proof ofconcept for protective potential.
When.the ongoing DDMM and the MMM trials are completed in early 2011, the vaccine will have sufficient data
to compare both regimens in uninfected subjects who are at high risk for infection for prot~'1:ive efficacy in a
screening ''test of concept" for the P~e 2b trial. This trial will compare 7,0 subjects using DDMM, versus 750
subjects with MMM and 750 placebo StiQ.jects. This trial will end the debate as to which version is. preferable and
by 2013 a final Phase. 3 trial in high risk subjects can·begin with 2500 or more subjects. AU of these trials will be
sU~fect to regulatory approval and will be modified as neces.sary in response to FDA requirements.
Clinical Trials Summary. As long as the clinical sites are qualified to conduct the: trials, several of the sites can be
located in Chicago. For the sake of scientific rigor, the trials wiH also need to be conducted at geographically
dispersed sites around the country. The following summarizes the proposed clinical trial. regimen discussed above.

William Foley
Chief Executive Officer
Cook County Health & Hospitals System
1900 W. Polk, Suite 220
Chicago, IL 60612
Dear Mr. Foley,
The CORE Foundation Board reviewed the opportunity to work with Geo V ax Labs. Inc., to
conduct a phase 1 trial of the Geo Vax therapeutic HIV vaccine and to engage in possible future
preventive HIV vaccine phase 2B (or 3) trials.
After reviewing the scientific basis of therapeutic and preventive HIV vaccines - including
discussions with the federally-funded HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the federal National
Institutes of Health (NIH) and internal experts (e.g., the Chair of Cook County Health &
Hospitals System's Institutional Review Board and CORE Center's Research Committee, and
the CORE Center's Chief Medical Officer) - the medical/scientific recommendation is not to
proceed at the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center with further discussion to evaluate the existing
GeoV ax vaccine(s).
The CORE Foundation Board accepted this recommendation not to proceed and suggests that
other medical/scientific issues be referred directly to the CORE Center's Chief Operating Officer
for initial consideration.
Sincerely,

Interim System CMO Report
CCHHS Meeting
June 26, 2009
Integration of System-wide Clinical Services
•   19 clinical departments, divisions, and programs have now been designated as system­
wide entities. Since the last CMO report system chairs of Breast Cancer, Screening,
Treatment, and Prevention Services, Gastroenterology, OB-Gyn, Ophthalmology,
Palliative Care, Psychiatry, and Radiology, and have been added to Adult Endocrine,
Emergency Medicine, Family Practice, Hematology-Oncology, Infectious Diseases,
Neurology, Pain, Pediatrics, Pulmonary/Critical Care, Rehabilitation and Physical
Medicine, Surgery, and Urology. Cardiology, ENT, and Family Planning/Dysplasia are
in process. Searches for System Chairs of Anesthesiology, LaboratorylPathology, and
Medicine are in various stages of completion.
•   The second meeting of system-clinical services was held on 5/12/09. Chairs presented
their activities concerning system-wide integration. Each department is now developing
metrics to evaluate clinical services across the CCHHS.
•   The reporting relationships between the CCHHS affiliate leadership, the system CMO,
and the system-wide chairs have been clarified in writing.
•   The job description for System-wide Clinical Chairs has been finalized and will be
presented to the HR committee.

Collaborations within and outside the System
•   Pain Clinic has been re-constituted at Oak: Forest Hospital staffed by Stroger physicians
now privileged at OFH.
•   Pulmonary/Critical Care providers are now cross-credentialed at all CCHHS hospitals
with staffing levels being re-aligned with service needs at the three hospitals.
•   Radiology staffing levels at Provident Hospital are being assessed and opportunities to
expand on-site radiologist coverage and minimize utilization of contracted radiologist
hours are being identified.
•   OB-Gyn has cross-credentialed Stroger physicians at Provident Hospital and elective
gynecological cases have begun to be shifted from SH to PH.
•   PH and OFH collaborated on the recruitment of a Gastroenterolgist position. SH
gastroenterologists provided emergency coverage of PH during an unexpected absence of
the PH GI specialist.
•   Surgical consolidation efforts continue. Surgeons and anesthesiologists have been cross­
credentialed. OR techs and nurses are being moved to allow maximum OR effectiveness
and utilization. PH surgeons are staffing surgical clinics, taking General Surgery call,
and performing acute care surgery at SH. Stroger Podiatry, Orthopedic, and Gynecology
surgeons are doing elective cases at PH.
•   Emergency Medicine has implemented uniform First Net patient boards at SH, PH, and
OFH allowing real time tracking of patient volumes and through-put.
•   Pediatric specialty clinics are receiving an increasing number of referrals from FQHC
community health centers due to the expansion of IRIS for Kids which allows children to
be immediately given an appointment date and time. The show rate for these referrals has
been high and the program is being expanded to additional FQHCs. The Pediatric
Department is also collaborating with the Juvenile Detention & Treatment Center to
provide post-discharge medical care homes.

1

 25

•   Inpatient diabetes protocols in place at Stroger will be instituted at Provident and Oak
Forest Hospitals as part of a system·wide Quality indicator expansion.
•   Efforts are in process to allow non-CCHHS FQHC community health center partners to
have access to medical information in Cemer on shared patients.
•   Discussions have been initiated with the University of Chicago concerning a
collaborative relationship with Provident Hospital concerning urgent care services and
with ACHN concerning U ofC's 47th Streetclinic.
•   The hospital Quality Directors are developing an organizational structure that unifies the
approach to quality and patient safety at both the local affiliates and throughout the
CCHHS

Single Medical Staff Bylaws
•   The State's Attorneys and representatives of the CMOs continue to work on the final
draft of a unified System medical staff bylaws. Once the draft is completed the three
hospital bylaws committees will be given 6 weeks to separately and then jointly review
the document. The States Attorneys will review and incorporate revisions recommended
by the bylaws committees and CMOs into a final document that will be presented to the
CCHHS Board. Once approved by the CCHHS, the new bylaws will be scheduled to be
voted upon by the medical staffs ofthe System. It is not anticipated that draft will be
ready for vote in the early Fall, 2009.

Physician Salary Inequity Correction
•   The implementation of a new physician salary scale by the CCB exacerbated physician
salary inequities in the CCHHS. As directed by the HR committee, a plan to correct
these inequities has been finalized. 279 physicians will be given a @4.79% raise. The
additional cost over current salaries will be $635,000 in FY 2009 and $1,532,000 over the
next 12 months. This pay adjustment will be instituted in July.

Accountability and Productivity
•   System-wide metrics that are facility, center, and provider specific are been identified by
system chairs.
•   Radiology staffing levels and productivity are being assessed system-wide with a 

resultant realignment of staffmg at PH and increased coverage at Cermak. 

•   Dual employment standards for clinical leaders have been finalized. Compliance by
Department chairs with these standards is being implemented.

Cermak Health Services
•   New leadership (COO, CMO, Associate Medical Chair) has been established.
•   The memorandum of agreement with the Department of Justice is being finalized.
•   Schematic and architectural plans for a new Intake (RCDC) and Residential Unit facility
at the CCDOC have essentially been completed.
•   Efforts are now being instituted to link NCCHC accreditation preparation to the 

stipulations in the DOJ report.

STRATEGIC PLANNING TOWNHALL MEETINGS
The Cook County Health & Hospitals Strategic Planning Committee is
working with the Healthcare Consortium of Illinois and a taskforce of key
stakeholders to plan a series of town hall meetings aimed at engaging
constituents in all geographical locations of Cook County in our strategic
planning process.
The purpose of the town hall meetings is to gather input from agencies,
community and faith-based organizations, population groups of homeless,
immigrants, substance abusers, mentally ill, recently uninsured, and ex­
offenders who regularly use county services. Through the use of
questionnaires, the meetings will illicit data on perceptions, unmet needs,
priority of core services, and vision to be included in the final strategic
planning document.
We also plan to schedule future town hall meetings in the fall to review the
draft strategic plan prior to Board approval.
