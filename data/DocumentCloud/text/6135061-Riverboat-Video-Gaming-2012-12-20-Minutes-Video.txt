 Member Vander Weele seconded the motion. The Board approved the motion unanimously by

Caleb Melamed appeared before the Board and gave a brief summary of the Amendments to the
Video Gaming Rules.
Sections 78 (a) (3) and (b) of the Video Gaming Act grant to the Board both regular and
emergency rulemaking authority regarding the Video Gaming Act. At the December 20, 2012
open meeting of the Illinois Gaming Board, the Board’s legal staff will submit proposals to
amend the Board’s rules on video gaming (11 Ill. Admin. Code 1800) as follows:
Applicant may not reapply for a license for a one-year period following denial:
The proposed rulemaking amends Section 1800.560 (“Issuance of License”) to prohibit an
applicant who has been denied a license from reapplying for one year following the date of
denial, unless granted leave to reapply by the Board.
Service, repair, and maintenance of video gaming terminals (“VGTs”) shall be performed
only by licensed technicians and licensed terminal handlers:
The duties of licensed technicians and licensed terminal handlers with respect to the service,
repair, and maintenance of VGTs are currently set forth in Section 1800.260. Nowhere in the
video gaming rules is there an explicit requirement, however, that only licensed technicians and
licensed terminal handlers shall perform service, repair, and maintenance functions after the
VGTs have been placed at licensed locations. The proposed rulemaking adds
such a requirement by inserting new language into Section 1800.230 (“Duties of Licensed
Manufacturers”), Section 1800.240 (“Duties of Licensed Distributors”), and Section 1800.250
(“Duties of Licensed Video Terminal Operators”). For each amended section, the inserted
language provides that a covered licensee “has an ongoing duty to….[s]ervice, maintain, or
repair video gaming terminals at licensed video gaming locations only by licensed technicians
and licensed terminal handlers.”
Adoption of the new language will enhance security in connection with the service, maintenance,
and repair of VGTs because of the existing requirement in Section 1800.260 e) that each
licensed terminal handler and licensed technician shall “carry and display identification issued by
the Board when working on video gaming terminals and associated video gaming equipment.”
Replacement fee for identification badges:
The proposed rulemaking will amend Section 1800.260 (“Duties of Licensed Technicians and
Licensed Terminal Handlers”), to provide a $10 replacement fee for lost badges issued by the
Board to licensed terminal handlers and licensed technicians and add a requirement that licensed
technicians and licensed terminal handlers return their identification to the Board upon
resignation or termination of employment. The new provision is modeled after analogous

2

 language contained in Section 245 i) of the riverboat gambling rules [86 Ill. Admin. Code
3000.245 i)].

regarding duties of licensed technicians and licensed terminal handlers, and Section
1800.560 regarding issuance of a license, by submitting proposals for First Notice
