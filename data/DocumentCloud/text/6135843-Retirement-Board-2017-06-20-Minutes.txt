MEMORANDUM
June 19, 2017

TO: The Honorable Members of the Board of Trustees,
Laborers? Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago

FR: Robert S. Molaro Associates

Springfield Report

For the third year in a row, the General Assembly finished its Spring legislative session with
no state budget in place.

. Although the Senate produced a budget and accompanying revenue increases
and spending cuts before the May 31 deadline, the House did not act on the
Senate package or craft its own spending plan. House Democrats, led by
Speaker Madigan, indicated they were concerned that Gov. Rauner would veto
any budget and tax plan that they might send to him.

. SB 14, which contains the funding increases for both the Municipal and Laborers?
Pension Funds and which has passed both Houses of the Illinois General
Assembly, is still being held. The City and the Speaker will be deciding when to
release this funding bill to the Governor for his signature or veto. The Governor

vetoed an identical bill earlier this year.

. 834027 and 834045 have been passed out of the Pension Committee in the
House. These bills were not called in the House before the May 31St deadline.
These bills are essentially the same as SB 16, which is the ?Grand Bargain?

pension reform bill proposed by the Governor and the Senate President. These
bills contain the ?salary/consideration? model written by Eric Madair, former
attorney for President Cullerton.

0 SB1345 is the vehicle bill that may be used to include the City funding language form SB
14, language submitted by Cook County for their funding and some changes for the State
funds requested by the Governor. This may be an attempt to urge the Governor to sign

the City and County?s pension funding request.

During the last few weeks of legislative session, the Senate passed several of the so?called

?Grand Bargain? bills, mainly on straight party-line votes. The legislation included:

A 37.3 billion 2018 Fiscal Year Budget Senate Bill 6 closely matches the budget
proposed by Gov. Rauner earlier this year. The spending plan includes spending
authority for ?pass through? money for municipalities, including for the Motor Fuel Tax,
Video/Casino Gaming, Use Tax and 9-1-1 funds.

Spending Cuts That Preserve Current LGDF Levels After an aborted attempt to
pass a package of spending cuts that included a two-phase slash in the Local
Government Distributive Fund (LGDF), Senators approved legislation May 23 reducing
spending by about $3 billion without reducing LGDF distributions, which would remain at
FY 2017 levels. Senate Bill 42, the Budget Implementation Bill, originally included cuts

to the municipal share of income tax collections, but it was voted down May 18.

Two-year Property Tax Freeze - The Illinois Senate approved Senate Bill 482 a two-
year, temporary property tax freeze on municipalities for levy years 2018 and 2019. The
bill did exempt pensions and bonds/indebtedness costs, but even these levies could
only be increased by a maximum of either 5 percent or the Consumer Price Index (CPI),
whichever is less. (The CPI was about 1.8 percent in 2016).

. $5.4 billion in New Taxes The Senate moved a tax increase package (Senate Bill 6).
Under this legislation, the personal income tax rate would go from 3.75 percent to 4.95
percent and the corporate rate from 5.25 to 7 percent, retroactive to Jan. 1, 2017.
Starting on July 1, 2017 (or when - and if the bill becomes law) the state?s 6.25
percent sales tax would be expanded to apply to several services, including:

Dry-cleaning and laundry;

0 Self?storage units;

0 Private detective and alarm services,

0 Pest control;

0 Personal care, including skin care, cosmetic ?make-overs,? manicures, pedicures,
hair removal, tanning, and body piercing, but not haircuts and other salon services.

in addition, lawn care and home improvement services would continue to be exempt
from sales tax.

Under the Senate plan, the state would keep all the sales tax proceeds through June
30, 2018. On July 1, 2018, municipalities would be in line to receive 7 percent of the
6.25 percent tax. In the two subsequent Fiscal Years, 2019 and 2020, the local share
would increase to 13 percent and then 20 percent. SB 6 also included a 5 percent tax
on satellite TV, and a 1 percent levy on video streaming services.

It should be noted that municipalities would not receive any of the income tax increase
in SB 9 via the LGDF.

Meeting in June

Despite the May 31 deadline, both the House and Senate are expected to meet in June with
the start of Fiscal Year 2018 looming on July 1. However, any budget or revenue related

legislation voted on now will require a 3/5ths, rather than a simple, majority to become
effective for the new fiscal year. While it appears that Gov. Rauner and the legislature are
still far apart on any budget deal, a downgrade of the state?s credit rating to the lowest in the
country by both Moody?s Investors Service and Standard Poors the day after the
legislative session may serve as an impetus to make a deal this month. A ?stop-gap?
budget, which would include an appropriation to fund thru 12 education and will
also be considered.

Governor Rauner has called a Special Session of the Illinois General Assembly. This
Special Session is scheduled for June 21 through June 30, 2017 and is being convened to
deal with the budgetary issues.
