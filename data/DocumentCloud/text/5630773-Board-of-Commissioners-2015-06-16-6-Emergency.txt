COMPLIANCE INFORMATION
N/A
GENERAL BACKGROUND
The purpose of the Emergency Safety and Security Program is to address safety and security
emergencies that pose an increased threat to the health and safety of public housing residents.
These grant funds will be used to supplement the existing video surveillance camera network at
Altgeld Gardens. Gang warfare and open drug markets pose an everyday threat to the 3,500
residents living at Altgeld, and over the past year crime incidents have increased nearly 13%.
The Emergency Safety and Security grant will be used to purchase security equipment to augment
and enhance the existing surveillance camera network at Altgeld Gardens, including:

 





Sixty (60) new cameras with fast and precise pan/tilt performance for wide area coverage
and great detail when zooming in low light conditions.
Two HP Gamma Series Client Viewing Stations for the project management office with
remote access and control of cameras.
Four 55” LG Smart video monitors for the CHA security office and Altgeld project
management office.
4 Panasonic C2 Toughbooks to monitor video tapes in the field.
Additional lenses for two existing cameras to monitor wide areas, capturing details with
just one click. The lenses are easily mounted onto existing cameras.

The enhanced digital camera system will allow CHA representatives to better zoom in on areas of
concern, cover blind spots and enter video files into evidence. Like existing cameras, video files
and data from these enhancements to the system can assist the Chicago Police Department in
investigations and criminal prosecutions. The integrated access control system will ease
identification of people entering CHA properties.
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority Board policies. The Chief Financial Officer and the Deputy Chief Housing
Officer of Resident Services concur with the recommendation to ratify and accept a grant award
from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) in the amount of $248,845 from
the Emergency Safety and Security Program and increase the Asset Management Department
budget accordingly.
The CEO/President recommends that the Board ratify and accept a grant award from the
Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) in the amount of $248,845 from the
Emergency Safety and Security Program and increase the Asset Management Department budget
accordingly.
The Chief Financial Officer, Deputy Chief Housing Officer of Asset Management, and the Office of
the General Counsel have completed all necessary due diligence to support the submission of this
initiative and recommend the approval of this item accordingly.
