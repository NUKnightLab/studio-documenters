Mr. Walters asked how the building qualifies as functionally obsolete. Mr. Vosburg stated that all of the
mechanical systems including the elevator systems in the building need to be updated.
Mr. George asked when the building was built. Mr. Egan stated that the building was built in 1972 and was
always used for commercial purposes including as a financial institution at one time. Ms. Ferrari added that
there was a former structure on the Property from 1884 until 1960 that was demolished and the current
structure was built in 1972.
Mr. Gonzalez asked if the building is divided into two section by the brick portion of the building. Mr. Egan
stated that the building has a lobby space in the middle and that the plan is to remove the brick and the
existing glass curtain walls and install a new glass curtain wall with an aluminum screen on the façade. Mr.
Egan added that there are also plans to use the space to the east of the building as public space and make
the space even with the sidewalk which also includes removing and lowering the existing public space and
landscaping in order to have full pedestrian access to the entire first floor of the Property.
Ms. DeSantis asked what the anticipated tenant mix is for the building. Mr. Egan stated that the Developer
anticipates office uses on the top three floors and commercial tenants with potentially restaurant, retail, and
office uses on the first floor. The Developer is in negotiations with potential tenants but cannot yet share
who those tenants are due to confidentiality obligations with the exception of the Downtown Detroit
Partnership which has already announced their plan to locate in the building. Mr. Walters added that he
would encourage the Developer not to include a financial institution as a potential tenant because of the
close proximity to other financial institutions.
Ms. DeSantis asked for more information on the financing for the project. Ms. Ferrari stated that there is
currently $8.5 million in senior debt, $7.8 million in equity, $1.5 million in TIF financing, and deferred
developer fees.

Developer is pursuing an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act Tax Abatement and that the district for such

 abatement has been approved by Detroit City Council and the certificate will be requested once the Property
transfers ownership from the Wayne County Land Bank to the Developer.
Mr. Walters asked what the purchase price for the Property was. Mr. Schenk stated that the purchase price
for the Property was approximately $4.2 million.
Mr. Schenk stated that there are easement agreements because of the location of mechanical equipment
for the Guardian Building on the roof of the Property.

currently steps that go up to the building from the sidewalk and that those steps will be removed, a small
open barrier will be installed around the public patio space, and there will be a heating system installed
under the new public space to make it suitable for use year-round.
Mr. Egan stated that the biggest impact the Property will have is that it is the last undeveloped piece to
connect Campus Martius to Hart Plaza and the Detroit Riverfront.
