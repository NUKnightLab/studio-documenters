4. President Foreman stated that a report of disciplinary actions taken by the Board during the
previous month appears in the blue books made available at the meeting, and he noted that this
report and the Board?s written ?ndings and decisions are posted on the Board?s website. He then
announced that the Board considered in a closed meeting one disciplinary case, and that the
Board will now take ?nal action on this case.

0 Case No. 18 PB 2941. Board Member Sweeney moved to ?nd Police Of?cer Amy
McGrath guilty of possessing and using illegal drugs, and to discharge her from the

President Foreman stated that the decision in the above case will be entered as of today?s date
and will be issued to the parties, and that a copy of the written decision will be posted on the
Board?s website as required by the Municipal Code of Chicago.

President Foreman noted that there is one additional disciplinary matter to announce.

0 Case No. 18 RR 07. Board Member Flores announced that pursuant to Section 2-78-130
of the Municipal Code of Chicago, he has considered a matter on which the Chief
Administrator of the Civilian Of?ce of Police Accountability and the Superintendent of
Police did not agree regarding the discipline of a police of?cer. Board Member Flores
reported that this matter involves an allegation that Police Of?cer Erick Grady failed to
allow for a reasonable time after ?knock and announce? before making forcible entry into
a residence. The Chief Administrator recommended sustaining this allegation and
requiring the of?cer to receive additional training. The Superintendent recommended
classifying this allegation as Unfounded. Board Member Flores reported that, in his
opinion, the response of the Superintendent did not meet the burden of overcoming the
Chief Administrator?s recommendation for discipline, and therefore, according to the
Municipal Code, the Chief Administrator?s recommendation for discipline is deemed
accepted by the Superintendent. A copy of the written opinion will be posted on the
Board?s website as required by the Municipal Code.

to 0 opposed.

Policy Regarding the Attendance of and Participation by
the Public at Board Meetings

(Adopted 15 December 2005)

The Police Board values the attendance of the public at its meetings and the opportunity
to receive comments and questions on matters concerning the Board or the Police
Department. The Board will treat members of the public with courtesy and respect, and
expects that the public will treat Board members and Department members in a similar
manner.

Toward that end, the Board has adopted the following rules governing conduct at Board
meetings:

1. An individual wishing to address the Board must sign-up in advance by
contacting the Board?s of?ce by phone, fax, or in person no later than 4:30 pm.
of the day before the meeting.

2. When called upon to address the Board, each speaker is to identify him/herself
and speak clearly so that all in attendance may hear and so that the court reporter
may make an accurate record of the proceedings.

3. Due to time constraints, each speaker is limited to two minutes and must
conclude when asked to do so by the Board member acting as parliamentarian.

4. Personal attacks, obscene language, ?ghting words, threats, conduct intended to
disrupt or interfere with the meeting, and comments not related to matters within
the Board?s or the Department?s jurisdiction, by a speaker or any person in
attendance, are strictly prohibited.

Violation of any of the above rules may result in the removal of the violator from the
meeting room, or in the immediate adjournment of the meeting; in addition, repeated
violations may result in the violator not being permitted to attend or participate in future
Board meetings.
