Ms. Grace Gallucci reported on the following:
•

The U.S. House approved $5 million for future Hyperloop planning oversight. The R.K.
Mellon Foundation provided NOACA with a grant in the amount of $100,000 that will
be used for research and outreach to add Pittsburgh to the Great Lakes Hyperloop
route.

•

NOACA submitted an INFRA Grant application for the Irishtown Bend project. NOACA
is requesting $15.7 million to stabilize Irishtown Bend. The application has been
placed on Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s desk. NOACA is looking for
continued support from the Northeast Ohio legislators. NOACA may submit a BUILD
grant application for this project, as well.

Presentation / Discussion Items
Complete and Green Streets Policy
Ms. Sarli provided background on complete and green streets and reviewed the following:

8285c

1-1

 •
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Anatomy of a complete street
Anatomy of a green street
National land cover data that includes impervious surface in NOACA’s five-county
region
Local examples of complete and green streets policies
Benefits of complete and green streets
Reason for having a stand alone complete and green streets policy
Goals of the draft Complete and Green Streets Policy
Requirements and exceptions

Ms. Sarli stated that complete and green streets are not a design prescription and not a
mandate for immediate retrofit. All projects requesting inclusion to the long-range
transportation plan (LRTP) and/or the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) will be
reviewed against this policy for opportunities to expand complete and green streets in the
NOACA region. All projects requesting NOACA administered funds shall be required to
adhere to this policy and are, therefore, eligible for NOACA funding participation to implement
complete and green street recommendations.
Ms. Sarli stated that input from the Committee will be used to further develop the NOACA
Complete and Green Streets Policy. She noted that the policy will be brought back to the
Committee at its meeting in October 2019.
Councilman Matt Zone thanked NOACA for creating the policy and encouraging communities
to implement initiatives. He mentioned that the biggest challenge with complete and green
streets is the maintenance aspect. He suggested that NOACA work with the Northeast Ohio
Regional Sewer District (NEORSD) on a comprehensive region wide plan to effectively deal
with bioswales and retention areas.
Ms. Gallucci commented that Councilman Zone’s suggestion was a great idea since NEORSD
has worked with NOACA on a number of initiatives. She noted that staff will think about
working with NEORSD on a larger level.
Mr. Rick Switalski asked if the policy will be a consideration when putting future projects on
the TIP. Ms. Gallucci said yes. She noted that the policy is the protocol, but it will not work
in every situation. NOACA supports the policy and would fund incremental costs when
possible.
Mr. Switalski asked if funds would come from STBG or from some other source. Ms. Gallucci
stated that funding could come from any funding source.
Engineer Andrew Conrad expressed some concern about the following language in the policy.
He said the following sentence seems awkward or misplaced:
“The project may not warrant consideration if one or more of the following
conditions are met.”
Ms. Sarli said she would reword the sentence.

8285c

1-2

 Mayor Greg Zilka commented on the importance of maintaining the complete and green
streets.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned there was some discussion in the past about NOACA having an
agreement with communities that receive funding requiring them to maintain the streets at a
certain level. She said staff will present policy language to the Committee at its next meeting.
Councilman Zone stated that the purpose of complete and green streets is to save lives, make
streets safer and provide people with greater mobility throughout the communities.
Chief McCall stated that some thought should be given to the type of plants used for complete
and green streets.
Mayor Bobst mentioned there has not been a lot of training provided to city workers to maintain
plants. She suggested that other funding sources be considered to cover the cost of training
and maintaining complete and green streets.
Mr. Dale Vandersommen asked that the line of sight be considered when selecting plants for
complete and green streets.
NOACA’s Water Quality Management Plan (208 Plan) Policy to Consider Development
Impact of Proposed Wastewater Facility Planning Area (FPA) Modifications
Mr. Eric Akin recapped the Committee’s discussion in April on the Urban Sprawl FPA Policy
and provided an overview of the following:
•
•
•
•
•

FPA boundary and prescription modifications
Current FPA modification policies
Criteria considered under current policies
Impacts not explicitly considered under current policies
Focus group relevant FPA policy recommendations in the new 208 Plan

Mr. Akin mentioned that one of the questions on the Wastewater Decision Makers
Questionnaire asked if NOACA should examine if a proposed FPA modification would further
increase urban sprawl and the responses were as follows:
•
•
•

Strongly agree – 17%
Somewhat agree – 21%
Neutral – 45%

•
•

Somewhat disagree – 8%
Strongly disagree – 9%

Mr. Akin mentioned that the Water Quality Subcommittee discussed the Urban Sprawl FPA
Policy at its meeting in June 2019. He noted that the following are takeaways from that
meeting:
•
•
•
•
•
•

8285c

Region has excess wastewater capacity
Reduce “infrastructure sprawl”
Short-term versus long-term costs
Policy requires approval by Ohio EPA & USEPA
Policy must be defensible
Investigate an asset management component to a proposed policy

1-3

 Mr. Akin reviewed a list of potential questions to guide staff’s review. He noted that NOACA
will continue to review the Urban Sprawl FPA Policy issue; and develop potential criteria and
structure for the policy.
Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Program Update
Mr. Randy Lane provided background on the TLCI program. He mentioned that a special
meeting was held in February to address concerns the Community Advisory Council (CAC)
had about the program.
Mr. Lane stated that NOACA staff further presented the TLCI application process and the City
of Cleveland Planning Commission presented its process to partner with stakeholders and
non-eligible entities. At the February meeting, CAC members offered to provide a role in
communicating the TLCI program and improving coordination with local stakeholders.
Mr. Lane reviewed the TLCI Program Policy and noted that it does not adequately address
concerns raised by CAC’. Ms. Gallucci mentioned that CAC highlighted some things that
NOACA has experienced, such as assurance that a project is supported by its community and
the grant will be accepted before funding is awarded.
Chief McCall commented on the importance of getting input from residents in the communities.
Mr. Lane mentioned that there are opportunities to improve the TLCI process based on the
following suggestions made by CAC members:
•
•
•
•

Require a public meeting/hearing for the proposed project prior to application
Require coordination with interested and/or impacted community and business groups
prior to application
Develop application guidance specific to external partners, including community and
business groups
Disseminate program announcements through advisory councils and stakeholders to
better target special groups

Mr. Lane stated that potential revisions to the TLCI Program Policy will be brought back to the
Committee, as necessary.
Councilman Zone stated that the TLCI program provides an opportunity to dispel a lot of
myths. He noted that when people do not know or understand transportation networks, the
TLCI process will help them realize the decisions being made on their behalf. Councilman
Zone talked about a TLCI project on Franklin Boulevard.
Mayor Sam Alai asked if the applicant or NOACA would hold the public meeting. Mr. Lane
stated that the exact approach has not been determined, but noted that NOACA staff would
be willing to provide assistance to the communities.
Mayor Bobst stated that stakeholder meetings are part of the application process when
applying for STBG funds. She mentioned there is a lot of meaningful work being done in the
communities that engages stakeholders. She said it was important to recognize other
processes when evaluating the TLCI program.
Old Business
No old business was discussed at this meeting.

RE:

Safety Performance Target Setting for CY 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Executive Committee at its November
2019 meeting. This action updates safety performance targets approved by the Board of Directors (Resolution
2019-022) for the current 2018-2021 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) and the AIM Forward 2040
Long Range Transportation Plan.
BACKGROUND
Safety Performance Management (Safety PM) is part of the overall Transportation Performance
Management (TPM) program, which FHWA defines as a strategic approach that uses system information to
make investment and policy decision to achieve national performance goals. It establishes safety
performance measure requirements for the purpose of carrying out the State’s Highway Safety
Improvement Plan (HSIP) and to assess fatalities and serious injuries on all public roads.
The federal Safety PM Final Rule established five performance measures as the five-year rolling averages
to include:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Number of Fatalities
Rate of Fatalities per 100 million Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)
Number of Serious Injuries
Rate of Serious Injuries per 100 million VMT
Number of Non-motorized Fatalities and Non-motorized Serious Injuries

The Safety PM Final Rule also establishes the process for State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and
Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to establish and report their safety targets.
State DOT’s are required to adopted targets annually. MPOs are required to establish targets within of 180
days and shall represent the anticipated outcomes for the same calendar year as the State DOT target (23
U.S.C. 134(h)(2)). MPO targets can be established through one of two options:
1. Agree to plan and program projects so that they contribute toward the accomplishment of the State
DOT safety target for a safety performance measure, or
2. Commit to a quantifiable target for a safety performance measure for the metropolitan planning area.
4-1

 NOACA adopted ODOT’s calendar year 2018 target of a 1% reduction for each of the five performance
measures consistent with the first option above. For calendar year 2018, NOACA’s 1-year performance in
each of the 5 performance measures is presented in the table below. It can be seen that fatalities, serious
injuries, and non-motorized fatalities all declined versus the previous three years, reversing the prior trend
of increasing FSI’s since 2014.

NOT MET

Fatalities

Within the NOACA region, frequency targets for Fatalities and Non-Motorized FSI’s were not met, in spite of
significant reductions in fatalities and serious injuries in 2018. This is because the targets are established
and reported using 5-year rolling averages, not annual crash frequencies, and the frequencies included in
the rolling averages for 2018 were greater than the ones replaced from 2013. The rate-based target for
fatalities was also not met, largely for the same reason.
ODOT has established a 2% reduction for each of the five performance areas for calendar year 2020, an
increase from 1% versus last year. A rate of 2% reflects a more aggressive approach toward reducing
crashes that reflects the 2% reductions recommended for emphasis areas in NOACA’s SAVE Plan. Staff
recommends that NOACA adopt ODOT’s target of a 2% reduction for calendar year 2020 to support state
targets for safety performance.

4-2

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the AIM Forward 2040 plan and current FY 2018-2021 TIP will be amended to
reflect the 2020 adopted safety targets. Staff will support these targets by working to implement the
recommendations and strategies outlined in “SAVE: NOACA’s Regional Safety Action Plan.”

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

October 4, 2019

RE:

NOACA’s Water Quality Management Plan (208 Plan) Development Impact
Policy for Proposed Wastewater Facility Planning Area (FPA) Modification
Requests

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and discussion only.
BACKGROUND/INFORMATION
At its January 2019 meeting, the NOACA Policy Committee adopted focus areas. One of
those focus areas was to evaluate the potential inclusion of criteria that would address FPA
boundary changes requested for the purpose of new housing or commercial development.
NOACA staff presented information to the Policy Committee and Water Quality Subcommittee
(WQS) on the current 208 Plan policies that govern FPA modifications. Staff then solicited input
from both bodies on what criteria should be considered or added to the 208 Plan to evaluate
development impacts of FPA modifications. Their feedback directed staff to create criteria
where development impacts should be a consideration in FPA modification requests, but may or
may not impact the final decision made by the NOACA Board of Directors. Furthermore, any
policy language or criteria included in the 208 Plan will need to be acceptable to Ohio EPA and
legally defensible by NOACA.
The current 208 Plan is undergoing a comprehensive update, including policies relevant to staff
review of FPA modification requests. To further inform the content of the new 208 Plan, a
questionnaire was developed to gather input from wastewater decision makers. The
wastewater decision maker questionnaire included the following question about consideration of
urban sprawl and development impacts in NOACA’s review of FPA modification requests:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? During NOACA staff
review of proposed Facility Planning Area (FPA) modifications, staff should
examine whether a proposed modification is primarily driven by new development
and whether that new development would further expand the development
footprint (i.e., increase urban sprawl) in Northeast Ohio.
Of the 67 respondents that answered the question, 39% somewhat or strongly agreed with the
statement, 19% somewhat or strongly disagreed with the statement and 45% were neutral.
Twenty-one (21) of the 26 respondents (81%) who somewhat or strongly agreed with the

5-1

 statement were from DMAs or communities in Cuyahoga and Lorain Counties, the two most
populated counties in the NOACA region.
Given the lack of objection, NOACA staff drafted the following FPA modification policy language
and criteria:
Proposed Policy Language: The NOACA Board may consider regional development
impacts if the FPA Boundary modification is primarily for new residential or commercial
developments.
Development Impact Questions/Criteria:
• Is the modification request primarily for new construction (residential or commercial)?
• Is the modification request area within an U.S. Census Bureau urban area?
• Estimate the number of new homes or structures proposed for construction.
• Estimate the new sanitary sewer infrastructure to be constructed to serve the requested
modification area (e.g. linear feet of gravity sewers, linear feet of force main sewers,
number of pump stations, etc.).
• Is the proposed sanitary sewer infrastructure expansion part of an asset management
plan?
• Is there conveyance and treatment capacity within the existing sewerage system to
accept the wastewater flow from the modification request area?
• Estimate the projected capacity impacts to the transportation system resulting from the
proposed developments.
NOACA staff recommend the proposed policy language be incorporated into the new 208 Plan
Policy 4-2: Modifications to Facility Planning Area Boundaries. The Development Impact
Questions/Criteria are recommended to be added to the FPA Modification Request Packet and
Guidelines. The Packet and Guidelines outline the information that should be provided by the
wastewater DMA for an FPA modification request submitted to NOACA.
The proposed Development Impact Policy language, questions, criteria and staff
recommendations were presented for discussion at the September 2019 WQS meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
None
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Staff will use the input to further refine the FPA modification policies in the new 208 Plan.

RE:

Regional Workforce Accessibility and Mobility

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and discussion only.
BACKGROUND/INFORMATION
As was illustrated to the Policy Committee at several meeting in 2019, there is a vivid mismatch
between workers’ home and work locations in the NOACA region that results in longer work
commutes for many workers and increased traffic congestion and Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)
in the region.
Staff has continued modeling benefit calculations of shortening work commutes by lessening
travel times to work and traffic congestion. Shorter work trip also reduces the VMT in the region
and consequently less fuel consumption and greater air quality.
Adjusting living and working locations usually prompts major investments policies and
implementation through long term plans and programs. This study however, indicates that some
minor improvements could also have noticeable benefits and impacts.
Staff will present the monetized benefits of increasing the number of workers living within 30
minutes or less from their workplace by about one percent of the regional workforce. These
benefits will be shown for the major job hubs in the regions and two cases of the total workers
and the industry class with highest percent of employment of these job hubs.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
None
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Staff will continue to use Committee input to further develop the workforce accessibility and
mobility policy area recommendations. Draft policy recommendations will be presented at future
meetings as developed.

RE:

Electric Vehicle Charging Station Plan Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for presentation and discussion only.
BACKGROUND/INFORMATION
Nationally, the number of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEV) is projected to reach 18.7 million in
2030, up from slightly more than 1 million at the end of 2018. Thus, creating a nationwide
infrastructure network is critical to support the travel resulting from increasing adoption rates of
the new technology. Even more important to NOACA is the impact on our region and the
challenge to ensure adequate infrastructure for our communities. As NOACA supports and
encourages consumer adoption of PEV’s in order to improve air quality in this region,
developing a planning study to identify PEV charging station sites for deployment is a priority.
The study documents the current status, and projected growth of PEVs over the next ten years
in the NOACA region, and focuses on the implementation of charging stations at workplace and
other publically accessible locations, representing both Level 2 and Direct Current Fast Charge
(DCFC) station types respectively. The Committee will be updated on the progress of the study
at the meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
None
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
The Committee will continue to be updated on the Electric Vehicle Charging Station Plan and
determine the potential policy implications.
