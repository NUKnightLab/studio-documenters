INFANT WELFARE SOCIETY
WHEREAS, in 1900, it was recorded that one out of every ten children died before their first birthday.
Following the establishment of the Chicago Milk Commission in 1908, concerned by the alarming infant

voluntarily educate mothers about infant care and to examine vulnerable infants via home visits; thus
beginning the creation of the Infant Welfare Society of Chicago (IWS); and
WHEREAS, by 1912, IWS performed 40,000 home visits on an annual basis which directly impacted the
reduction of infant mortality rates. In 1913, the Infant Welfare Society Auxiliary was formed to support the
work of the organization and its mission. The Auxiliary began their work making home visits, raising funds,
and sewing clothes. This work is carried on by the Auxiliary’s 750 member body to this day with pledges
of further fundraising to offset the maintenance of their environment-friendly facility; and
WHEREAS, IWS was one of the first public health organizations in Chicago to institute mental health
services in the 1920s and in 1950, was nationally recognized for implementing a preschool program for
emotionally disturbed children; and

prenatal, speech pathology, general health, STD education and screening and mental health to name a few,
a testament to their commitment to family and community health; and

Harvey Infant Welfare Society of Chicago Community Health Center. Located at 3600 W. Fullerton, IWS
continues to provide free services to over 12,000 mothers, infants and families, annually, driven by the
same mission and commitment for which they were founded over a hundred years ago; and
WHEREAS, following in the footsteps of the visionaries before her, Executive Director Robin McGinnis,
pushes forward with the leadership, foresight and creative programming that has made IWS an invaluable
resource for the community for years to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby
congratulate and recognize the Infant Welfare Society of Chicago for its legacy of over 100 years of serving
Chicago’s under-resourced communities and Ms. Robin McGinnis and staff for their continuous vision of
an organization that serves all walks of life; and

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AMENDING THE COOK COUNTY CODE OF ORDINANCE RELATING TO THE OFFICIAL
SEAL OF COOK COUNTY TO PROHIBIT FRAUDULENT AND DECEPTIVE USE BY
PRIVATE PERSONS AND ENTITIES
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a Home Rule Unit of Government pursuant to the 1970 Illinois
Constitution, Article VII, Section 6; and,
WHEREAS, pursuant to its home rule power, the County of Cook may exercise any power and perform
any function relating to its government and affairs, including the power to regulate for the protection of
the public health, safety, morals and welfare; and,
WHEREAS, the official seal of Cook County (“County Seal”) is an important symbol of the government
of Cook County which is used by Cook County government officials, departments and agencies to
convey, and does convey, the official imprimatur of the Cook County government; and
WHEREAS, when members of the public see the County Seal on any communication or object, they are
likely to believe, and do reasonably believe, that the person or entity displaying the County Seal is a
Cook County government official, department or agency, and that the communication or object has been
approved by a Cook County government official, department or agency; and thus the display of the
County Seal communicates official approval by Cook County government and an association with
official Cook County government business; and
WHEREAS, from time to time, private persons or entities have displayed the County Seal on various
communications and objects with the intent and/or the effect of misleading and confusing members of
the public into believing that the private person or entity is acting as a representative of the Cook County
government and/or acting on official Cook County business; and
WHEREAS, examples of potential fraudulent misuse of the County Seal include, but are not limited to,
the use of the County Seal on letters from non-government entities offering property tax appeal
assistance under the ruse of gathering sensitive personal financial information and the use of the County
Seal by private persons to gain entry to the residences and workplaces of people living and doing
business in Cook County under the false pretense of being Cook County government officials or
employees; and
WHEREAS, such fraudulent use of the County Seal puts the most vulnerable members of the public at
financial and physical risk and creates a public safety danger;

NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Part I

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING CALLING UPON THE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT TO
COMMUNICATE AND COORDINATE WITH THE COOK COUNTY SHERIFF’S POLICE TO
ADDRESS ISSUES RELATED TO THE PRACTICE OF “STOP AND FRISK,” BY REVIEWING
THE POLICIES OF THE SHERIFF RELATED TO MOTOR VEHICLE STOPS, SEARCHES AND
SEIZURES, SUPERVISORY RANK AND RESPONSIBILITY, AND DETENTIONS
WHEREAS, despite the fact that the nation’s attention has turned to police practices because of high
profile killings, concerns about policing extend beyond the use of force and into the everyday
interactions of police with community members; and,
WHEREAS, in black and Latino communities, these everyday interactions are often a “Stop and Frisk”;
and,
WHEREAS, under the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), officers are
allowed to stop you if the officer has reasonable suspicion that you have been, are, or are about to be
engaged in criminal activity. Once you are stopped, if an officer has reasonable suspicion that you are
dangerous and have a weapon, the officer can frisk you, including ordering you to put your hands on a
wall or car, and running his or her hands over your body; and,
WHEREAS, a report on “Stop and Frisk” police practices by the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) of Illinois, published this past Spring, contains troubling signs that the Chicago Police
Department has a current practice of unlawfully using stop and frisk; and,

Page 34 of 201

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 10, 2015

WHEREAS, “Stop and Frisk” is disproportionately concentrated in the black community. Last month’s
ACLU Report found that black Chicagoans were subjected to 72% of all stops, though they constitute
just 32% of the city’s population; and,
WHEREAS, the ACLU of Illinois, comparing stops to population, found that Chicagoans were stopped
more than four times as often as New Yorkers at the height of New York City’s stop and frisk practice;
and,
WHEREAS, the abuse of stop and frisk is a violation of individual rights, but it also poisons police and
community relations and directly impacts the bottom line for Cook County taxpayers by leading to
arrests that would not have otherwise occurred, thereby burdening Cook County Courts and the Cook
County Jail; and,
WHEREAS, the Cook County Sheriff operates pursuant to four specific policies that govern the
procedures of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police related to “stop and frisk,” namely the following: Section
500 of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police Supplemental Manual dealing with Motor Vehicle Stops;
Section 312 of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police Policy Manual dealing with Searches and Seizures;
Section 201 of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police Policy Manual on Supervisory Rank and
Responsibilities; and Section 421 of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police Policy Manual on Detentions; and,

WHEREAS, all units of county and local government stand to benefit by exchanging information
regarding best practices;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Cook County President and the Board of
Commissioners that the Chicago Police Department be urged to review the above-referenced policies of
the Cook County Sheriff’s Police, and meet with the Chief of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police to
discuss the manner in which these policies are implemented and whether these policies might be directly
transferable to the work of the Chicago Police Department, particularly regarding “Stop and Frisk.”

Non-retailer Transfers of Motor Vehicles, Cook County Department of Revenue entered into an
agreement with Electronic License Service, LLC for their various Cook County authorized sales agent
locations to act as a designee to collect payments from taxpayers that are subject to the Cook County
Home Rule Use Tax Ordinance for Non-retailer Transfer of Motor Vehicles.
The original agreement with ELS was executed on 5/2/2013 and included a provision whereby the
agreement would be terminated if and when the County entered into a separate agreement for collection
by the State of Illinois. Such an agreement was reached in November 2014. However, since the State
will not begin collection until July 2015, at the earliest, and then will not collect on any bills issued prior
to that date, it is necessary to amend the agreement with ELS to allow for them to provide collection
services for all amounts that will not be collected by the State.
Since the beginning of this fiscal year, there are 250 sales agent locations participating and we have
collected approximately $446,000.
This Agreement has been reviewed and approved as to form by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s
Office.

RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE TONI PRECKWINKLE, PRESIDENT,
COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
RESOLUTION TO ADD MEMBERS TO THE COOK COUNTY HOME CONSORTIUM
WHEREAS, the County of Cook (the County) is an entitlement community pursuant to the regulations
of the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) at 24 CFR Part 92 and the Community
Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) at 24 CFR Part 570, which entitles the County to receive an
annual allocation of CDBG and HOME grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD); and
WHEREAS, the amount of HOME funds that the County receives pursuant to entitlement status is
determined by a HUD formula that takes into consideration the populations of the municipalities within
its jurisdiction; and
WHEREAS, the City of Des Plaines and the Village of Arlington Heights (the Electing Municipalities)
within the County that receive Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds directly from HUD
can elect to join the County’s HOME Consortium (the Consortium), which would allow HUD to take
into account the populations of these municipalities when calculating the County’s annual HOME funds
entitlement grant, thus increasing the County’s annual allocation; and
WHEREAS, the Electing Municipalities are choosing to join the Consortium, as signified by resolution
of their municipal boards; and
WHEREAS, each Electing Municipality must conform to the Consortium Program Year, which runs
October 1 through September 30 in accordance with HUD rules; and
WHEREAS, as the Electing Municipalities move to the Consortium Program Year they may experience
a gap in their administrative funding for the few months after their old program year expires and before
the Consortium Program Year begins. (i.e., if their current program year ends on June 30 there is a three
month gap before the new program year starts on October 1); and
WHEREAS, the County wants to maximize its federal allocation of HOME Funds by including the
Electing Municipalities in the Consortium. The County’s HOME Investment Partnerships Program could
see up to a $163,000 increase over two years by adding the populations of the Electing Municipalities
into the formula for calculating the grant amount.; and
WHEREAS, to facilitate the addition of the Electing Municipalities to the Consortium, the County will
provide the financing for the loss in administrative funding and program funding that is needed to align
the program years in each Electing Municipality; and
WHEREAS, HUD requires that the Cook County Board of Commissioners act by resolution to add the
new entitlement communities into the HOME Consortium; and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, the President and the Board of Commissioners of the

within a three year period, due to the alignment of the program years of the Electing Municipalities with
the Consortium Program Year in accordance with HUD requirements.
Section 2: That the County be and is hereby authorized to enter into an Addendum to the HOME
Investment Partnerships Program Consortium Agreement for Federal Fiscal Years 2016, and 2017 to add
the Electing Municipalities and that the President, Bureau Chief of Economic Development or the
County Clerk are hereby authorized to execute said HOME Investment Partnerships Program Consortium

PROPOSED GRANT AWARD
Department: Circuit Court of Cook County, Office of the Chief Judge
Grantee: Circuit Court of Cook County
Grantor: John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation
Request: Authorization to accept grant
Purpose: This Safety+Justice Challenge Program Grant will fund the development of a comprehensive
plan to examine how the Cook County Department of Corrections is being used and to develop and
implement strategies to reduce the incarceration of low-level, nonviolent persons awaiting trial without
compromising public safety.
Grant Amount: $150,000.00
Grant Period: 5/1/2015 - 12/31/2015
Fiscal Impact: None
Accounts: N/A
Concurrences:
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any.
Summary: Cook County was one of 20 jurisdictions out of nearly 200 applicants from 45 states
selected by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation to receive a $150,000 Safety+Justice
Challenge Program Grant to reduce the number of low level, nonviolent persons incarcerated in the Cook
County Department of Corrections and to increase the number of persons who can safely be released
while awaiting trial. The award marks the first time that all Cook County criminal justice stakeholders
have joined forces to obtain funding to implement system-wide change that will enhance access to
justice.
The awarding of the grant also builds onto recent collaborative efforts by the Chief Judge, the State’s
Attorney, the Public Defender, the Sheriff, the Circuit Court Clerk, and the Cook County Board President
that have helped to reduce the jail population to its lowest point since 1991, while maintaining public
safety. These include increased use of electronic monitoring and pretrial supervision, deferral from
prosecution programs, and the development of specialty courts that offer alternatives to incarceration.
The stakeholders recognize that significant challenges remain. These include the disproportionate
incarceration of people of color; recent increases in length of stay in the Cook County Department of
Corrections; and continued high levels of parole and probation violations and new arrests. The
stakeholders will use this planning grant to identify the key data and decision points that influence these
outcomes, and develop collaborative responses.

RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE RICHARD R. BOYKIN, COUNTY COMMISSIONER
RESOLUTION CALLING FOR A HEARING OF THE HUMAN RELATIONS COMMITTEE
OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS ON SERVICE GAPS IN
COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES
WHEREAS, the City of Chicago closed six of its 12 Community Mental Health Clinics in April of 2012;
and,
WHEREAS, according to Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, the reduction in funding for mental health
services across multiple levels of government, including the Chicago clinic closures, has resulted in the
Cook County Jail being the largest mental health facility in the state and possibly the nation; and,
WHEREAS, according to a joint report authored by the Mental Health Movement of Chicago and
AFSCME Council 31, Chicago’s closure of half of its mental health clinics resulted in a failure by the City
of Chicago to account for hundreds and perhaps thousands of people who had depended on these clinics for
mental health treatment services; and,
WHEREAS, that same report, entitled “Abandoning the Most Vulnerable,” cites a complete lack of a
comprehensive effort to determine how many people lost access to mental health treatment services after
the Chicago clinic closures and similar lack of effort to make contact with the individuals who lost access
to treatment and connect them with new service providers; and,
WHEREAS, Cook County, which is charged with providing services to the most vulnerable members of
our local population, deals every day with the consequences of an inadequate safety net that has stranded
too many of our residents without access to care that they urgently need; and,
WHEREAS, we count among those consequences an overcrowded Jail, court system and Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center, all of which constitute a significant drain on Cook County’s Budget and
resources;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County President and Board of Commissioners
does hereby request a meeting of the Human Relations Committee of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, to take place Thursday, March 19, 2015 at 10 AM at 118 North Clark Street, Rm. 569,
Chicago, Illinois.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County President and the Board of Commissioners that the
above referenced meeting of the Human Relations Committee of the Cook County Board of Commissioners
focus exclusively on the service gaps caused by reduction in Community Mental Health Services in the

payment in lieu of any such money. The types of fees and charges and the initial amounts of such fees and

provided in an electronic format compatible with the County's geographical information system
in use at the time such information is required to be provided or compatible with the County's

required under this article or a license, such description shall include (i) all dimensional details
such as diameter, thickness or pipe walls, materials used, and all other details necessary to fully
describe the facility and (ii) three-dimensional coordinates and all information necessary to

(c) Proprietary information. Information provided to the County is subject to disclosure as a public
record pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (5 ILCS 140/1 et seq.) If any
information required to be provided to the County under this article is reasonably considered by
grantee to include trade secrets, commercial or financial information where the trade secrets or
information are proprietary, privileged or confidential, or where disclosure of the trade secrets or
information may cause competitive harm, or which information would otherwise be exempt from
disclosure pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (5 ILCS 140/7, 2006)
or if the disclosure of such information could, in the reasonable judgment of a grantee, impair
security of facilities operated by such grantee in providing utilities or other services essential to
public health or public safety (such information being referred to as "proprietary information"),
then grantee may delete such proprietary information from the information to be provided, so
long as the information provided is adequate, in the reasonable judgment of the Superintendent
to inform the County of the nature and location of the facilities for its regulatory purposes, and so
long as the grantee provides a written certification, signed by an officer of grantee, identifying
the type of information deleted and the reason for such deletion. Grantee shall cooperate with the
Highway Department to assure that the information provided is adequate to meet the County's
requirements.
Sec. 66-56. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURE
Sec. 66-57. - License requirements.
In situations where the applicant (i) has or proposes to have facilities in a significant portion of the
public ways as determined by the Highway Department (for example, a utility company) (such license
applicant being sometimes referred to as a "major user"), or (ii) has or proposes to have facilities that require
continued regulation (for example, a pipeline operator), as determined by the Highway Department, but do
not occupy a significant portion of the public ways (such license applicant being sometimes referred to as
an "other user"), then the applicant shall be required to obtain a license from the County. The license

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

agreement shall be in a form provided by the County and will include payment of a license fee, obligations
of the grantee to indemnify the County, furnish insurance, and such other terms and provisions as are
determined by the Director to be appropriate in any instance.
Sec. 66-58. - General requirements and provisions.
Any license granted pursuant to this article creates a license only and does not create an interest or
estate of any kind whatsoever in the public way by virtue of this article, a license agreement, or grantee's
use of the public way.
(a) Existing facilities. In the event that any person is operating facilities in the public way under a
license, easement or similar agreement with the County, this article shall apply only to the extent
it is not inconsistent with such license, easement or similar agreement during the term of such
license, easement or similar agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this article, including but
not limited to permitting requirements of this article, shall govern any maintenance, repair,
replacement, removal, relocation, reconstruction, upgrading, modification or extension of any
existing facilities, and all the provisions of this article shall apply to installation of any new
facilities in the public ways not covered by such agreement. Persons having facilities located in
the public ways as of the effective date for which a license is required under Section 66-57, and
as to which no license, easement or similar written agreement is currently in effect, shall comply
with the licensing requirements set forth herein by filing an application for a license for such
existing facilities within 60 days after the effective date. The effective date of such license
agreement shall be July 1, 2007. If a person having existing facilities with no such agreement in
place fails to timely apply for or diligently pursue a license agreement, then the County may
exercise the rights and remedies described in this article, including assessment of penalties and
requiring removal of such person's facilities. In addition, the County may refuse to process any
applications or grant any permits until such license agreement is executed.
(b) Ordinance 85-O-18. On February 4, 1985, the Board adopted Ordinance No. 85-0-18, which
granted to Illinois Bell Telephone Company, and its successors, the non-exclusive right to use
certain public ways in Cook County in exchange for certain benefits granted to the County, under
the terms set forth in such Ordinance. For so long as such Ordinance is in full force and effect,
the grantee or its successors under Ordinance 85-O-18, as amended, including as amended by
Ordinance 07-O-27, shall be required to apply for a license within 60 days after the effective date
of this article as to public ways and shall be required to comply with all permit requirements set
forth in Division 3, except that license fees and permit fees shall be waived to the extent provided
in Ordinance 85-O-18, as amended by Ordinance 07-O-27 and as further amended.
(c) License nonexclusive. No license shall be exclusive. Every license shall be deemed to reserve to
the County the right to grant other licenses to use and occupy the public ways or other property
of the County for any other purpose on such terms as the County may deem appropriate.
(d) License subject to County use. All licenses shall be subject to the County's use of its public ways,
including the widening of County highways, roads, streets and bridges. Any removal, relocation
or modification of a grantee's facilities necessitated by the County's use of its public ways shall
be at the grantee's cost, and shall be governed by Section 66-81
Sec. 66-59. - License application.
Applications for a license shall be submitted to the Director on application forms promulgated by the
Director. The application form shall request facts and information the County deems appropriate, including
the specific location of the Facilities as provided in Section 66-55. Applicants applying for a license for

Page 110 of 201

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 10, 2015

facilities existing prior to the effective date, shall include drawings, plans and specifications fully describing
such existing facilities and the location of such facilities as required by Section 66-55. The Director may
agree to accept the foregoing information after issuance of a license for good cause shown. In determining
whether to issue the license prior to receiving all such information, the Director shall take into consideration
the extent of the grantee's facilities in the public way and the burden on the grantee of providing the
information within the required time. If a license as to all the public ways is requested, the information as
to the current locations of facilities shall nevertheless be required. The Director may request additional
information from the applicant at any time during the application process.
(a) Review process. The Director shall coordinate any necessary review of the application by all
interested County Departments, which may include Highway, Building and Zoning and Risk
Management. If the foregoing review indicates that the license may be issued, then based upon
the application and such information as may be obtained during the review process, the Director
shall prepare a license agreement for execution by the applicant, setting forth the terms and
conditions upon which the Director is prepared to recommend issuance of a license.
(b) Execution by applicant. Upon execution of the license agreement, applicant shall submit the
annual license fee for the first year of the term. Such annual license fee shall be refunded if the
license agreement is not approved and executed by the Board. No provision of this article shall
be deemed or construed as to require the Board to grant a license. The Board may consider any
relevant facts and circumstances, including the qualifications of the applicant, in determining
whether to grant a license.
(c) Term of license agreement. The term of a license agreement shall commence on the date the
license agreement is executed by the County ("effective date"), and shall expire on June 30 of the
calendar year in which the tenth anniversary of the effective date occurs, such that all licenses
shall expire on June 30, unless sooner terminated in accordance with the terms of the license
agreement; provided, however, that a license agreement issued to a person having existing
facilities as described in Section 66-58(a) shall be effective as of July 1, 2007, regardless of the
date executed.
Sec. 66-60. - Annual requirements.
(a) A grantee is required to provide the following documentation to the Director prior to each July 1 falling
within the term, or as set forth below:
(1) A current certificate of insurance, or other evidence acceptable to the Director of Risk
Management, evidencing all insurance required to be maintained by grantee under Section 6662., , must be on file with the Director at all times; therefore, an updated certificate of insurance
must be provided to the Director upon expiration and renewal of any policies required under the
license agreement.
(2) The annual license fee in effect from time to time.
(3) A certified report of current facilities and their locations, including plans, drawings or such other
material as is necessary to fully describe the facilities and their locations, as provided in Section
66-55, or a statement certified by an authorized representative of the grantee stating that there has
been no change to the facilities since the prior annual report or the issuance of the license, in the
case of the first such certified report.
(4) Such other documentation and information reasonably requested by the Director.
(b) Failure to fulfill annual requirements. If grantee fails to fulfill the annual requirements by July 1,
grantee shall be subject to penalties as set forth in Section 66-91 and, in addition, the Director may

Page 111 of 201

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 10, 2015

revoke the license at any time thereafter by terminating the license agreement as set forth below;
provided, however, that if grantee provides the certificate or other acceptable evidence of insurance
and pays the annual fee within 15 days after receipt of notice from the County of failure to comply
with the annual requirements (which shall constitute a violation notice under Section 66-87), grantee
may request an extension as to Section 66-60(a)(3) and the Director may grant such extension as the
Director deems appropriate (which shall constitute additional time to cure pursuant to Section 6688(c)). If such extension is granted, no penalties will accrue and the County will not be entitled to
revoke the license if the requirement is fulfilled prior to the expiration of the extension period. If
grantee fails to provide the annual report within the extension period, then penalties shall be assessed
retroactively to the date which is five days after receipt of the County's notice, and the Director may,
in his or her discretion, revoke the license. If the Director deems it advisable to revoke the license as
allowed under this Section 66-60(b), the Director shall notify the grantee in writing not less than 30
days prior to the effective date of such revocation, which notice shall be ineffective if the grantee
fulfills all requirements prior to the effective date set forth in the notice. If a grantee fails to fulfill the
annual requirements as provided herein, then the County may exercise the rights and remedies
described in this article, including assessment of penalties and requiring removal or deactivation of
such person's facilities. In addition, the County may refuse to process any applications or grant any
permits until such license agreement is executed.
Sec. 66-61. - Annual license fee.
A grantee shall pay to the County an annual license fee at the rate in effect from time to time, prorated
on a daily basis if the license commences on a date other than July 1 or terminates on a date other than June
30 (other than a termination due to breach by grantee). The annual license fee for the first year of the term
shall be paid upon presentation of the license agreement to the Director of Real Estate Management,
executed by the applicant, and shall be refunded if the license is not issued. All succeeding annual license
fee payments shall be made on or before July 1 of every year during the term of the license agreement.
Sec. 66-62. - Insurance requirements.
At all times during the term of a license, and at all times until the removal of facilities is completed,
as provided for herein, a grantee shall maintain insurance as provided in the license agreement. Failure to
comply with insurance requirements shall be a violation of this article and subject grantee to the penalties
provided in Section 66-91.

Sec. 66-63. - License renewal.
A grantee shall be solely responsible for requesting the County, in writing, to renew a license for any
subsequent ten-year term. Such a request shall be made to the Director not less than six months prior to the
then current license expiration date, unless a later date is agreed to in writing by the Director.
(a) Request for license renewal shall be made in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section
66-59 of this article for a new license; however, Board authorization shall not be required for
license renewals, which may be approved by the Director. If a grantee having existing facilities
fails to timely apply for or diligently pursue a renewal of a license, then the County through the
Director may exercise the rights and remedies described in this article, including assessment of
penalties and requiring removal of such person's facilities.

Page 112 of 201

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 10, 2015

(b) Notwithstanding the fact that the County Director may determine that a grantee has been in
reasonable compliance with the terms and conditions imposed by this article and the license
agreement, the County Director shall have no obligation to renew the license. If the County
Director does not renew the license, the County Director shall have the option to require the
removal of all grantee's facilities and other property located within the licensed area, at the
grantee's expense, in accordance with Section 66-80. Should the Director not renew a license
following an application to renew, the annual license fee accompanied with accompanying the
renewal application shall be refunded. No provision of this article shall be deemed or construed
as to require the Board or Director to grant a license. The Director may consider any relevant
facts and circumstances, including the qualifications of the applicant and compliance with the
license agreement in the past, in determining whether to grant or renew a license. The Director
shall inform the Board within 30 days of any renewal license applications denied by the Director.
The Director shall provide a report to the Board during the first quarter of any year in which
license renewals will occur listing all licenses expiring in that year. The Director shall in addition
provide a report by the end of each such year setting forth all licenses renewed by the Director,
any licenses which the Director declined to renew, and any which the licensee declined to renew.
Sec. 66-64. - Transfer of license.
Neither a license nor a license agreement shall be assigned, transferred, sold or disposed of, in whole
or in part, by voluntary sale, sale and leaseback, merger, including merger by operation of law,
consolidation or otherwise or by forced or involuntary sale (any of the foregoing being hereinafter referred
to as a "transfer"), without written notice to the Director which shall be signed by both the original grantee
and the party accepting the transfer (the "transferee"). Such notice shall be given no later than ten days after
the transfer occurs, and shall include an assumption by the transferee of all the grantee's obligations under
the license agreement, together with evidence of transferee's insurance and a replacement bond or letter of
credit provided by transferee as required under the license agreement.
(a) Transfer in violation. Any sale, transfer or assignment not made according to the procedures set
forth in this article shall render the license and the license agreement voidable at the option of the

Summary: These five (5) contiguous properties are located in close proximity to the Village Hall and
comprise a total of less than 18,000 square feet (.4 acres). The properties are either vacant
(15-0507-307-035-0000, 15-0507-307-048-0000 and 15-0507-307-057-0000) or as stated in the affidavit
or of occupancy form, have an unoccupied structure (15-0507-307-050-0000 and 15-0507-307-051-0000).
This past year the village demolished the structure which was on 15-07-307-035-0000 due to its deleterious
and unsafe condition. The village plans on using the property for a public purpose and therefore will file
for tax exempt status on all five (5) properties if tax deeds are obtained. The Village intends to retain
ownership of the parcels and therefore will not be applying with a Third Party.
The Village will retain legal counsel to assist with completion of the application, title search, tax deed
petition and will bear all other costs related to the acquisition of these parcels through the No Cash Bid
(NCB) Program and agrees to file NCB reports on the status of each parcel for five years or until
development is complete, whichever occurs first.

vacant for over 4 years. The City of Oak Forest has been working on various economic development
plans for the region where this parcel exists. By regaining economic development control of the area, the
City can begin to move these plans along to fruition. The primary land use for this property will be
commercial. Due to the lack of a third party requestor the City cannot provide a specific use or function,
but through the use of the City’s Comprehensive Land Use Plan and economic development planning the
city looks to reposition the property in the following manner: the City is working diligently to redevelop
and reinvigorate the Cicero Ave. corridor by investing in its streetscape and attain development control
on dilapidated multi-family/commercial buildings. One major issue along the commercial corridors of
Oak Forest is the smaller parcel commercial properties and lack of space for larger, more tax-producing
users. Oak Forest would like to retain control of this property as step1of the land consolidation with the
neighboring lots to create a larger more buildable lot in the future.
The City of Oak Forest will utilize its legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all legal and other costs
associated with the acquisition of the parcel. If the City is awarded the subject property, the City will provide
an annual status report on the development of the property for five years or until development is complete
or conveyed for future development, whichever occurs last. The City of Oak Forest will file for tax-exempt
status for the subject properties for as long as the City is in ownership of these properties.

the city plans to reposition the properties in the following manner:
The City of Oak Forest is the current and owner of 28-16-208-014-0000. The City seeks these properties
(28-16-208-015-0000, 28-16-208-016-0000) in order to consolidate all three parcels and create a new
commercial outlot on Cicero Avenue which will produce new tax increment in the City’s TIF district.
Through this development, the City plans to decrease the amount of ingress/egress driveways create a new
vehicle circulation pattern for nearby commercial entities that will result in better parking ratios, lot
circulation, and an increase in safer movements on and off Cicero Ave. The City projects this property
(28-27-203-003-0000) to be preserved as open space and possibly used as common detention area for the
future non-residential development of SE 167th Street & Cicero dependent on qualifying detention
standards. The City projects this property (28-27-203-012-0000) to be part of the land assembly required
to create a large scale development at SE 167th & Cicero Ave, as proposed by the Comprehensive land Use
Plan. The City seeks development control to ensure this property will be available as part of a future land
assembly.The City of Oak Forest will utilize its legal counsel to obtain the tax deeds and bear all legal and
other costs associated with the acquisition of the parcels. If the City is awarded the subject properties, the
City will provide an annual status report on the development of the properties for five years or until
development is complete or conveyed for future development, whichever occurs last. The City of Oak
Forest will file for tax-exempt status for the subject properties for as long as the City is in ownership of
these properties.

Volume and Property Index Number:
175, 15-33-411-051-0000
Summary: This Request Package contains one PIN. This property is vacant land that is located between
our existing Beach Oak Park and the Indiana Belt Harbor Railroad. The property contains mature trees and
thick underbrush. The District was recently awarded an Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR)
Open Space Lands Acquisition and Development (OSLAD) grant for redevelopment of our Beach Oak
Park. We believe by acquiring this parcel that we could incorporate the land into our park, expanding the
park size in its southwest corner and improve it aesthetically. A site plan of the proposed improvements is
attached.
If acquired, the District will file for tax exempt status and will request to rezone it as park land with the
Village of La Grange Park. The part of the parcel which has railroad tracks is intended to be transferred to
the Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad, a possible Third Party Requestor. We are currently in discussions of their
interest in being a Third Party Requestor. The District will retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and
bear all legal and other costs associated with acquisition of the parcel. The District agrees to submit, to the
Cook County Department of Economic Development, No Cash Bid Reports on the status of the parcel for
five years or until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No
Cash Bid Ordinance.

Summary: The number of parcels in this request is one (1). The property is currently vacant and it is the

time there are no Third Party Requests, no prospective developers and no organizations identified to assume
development or ownership of this parcel.
The Village will retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deeds and bear all legal and other costs associated
with acquisition of the parcel. The Village of Crestwood agrees to submit to the Cook County Department
