PROJECTS
Land Assembly Project: Authorization to Enter into MOU with Fiat Chrysler and City of
Detroit
Ms. Bridges presented the Land Assembly Project: Authorization to Enter into MOU with Fiat
Chrysler and City of Detroit to the DBRA Board.
As the Board is aware, the City of Detroit administration has requested the assistance of the City
of Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (“DBRA”) in industrial land assembly activities
aimed at establishing market-ready industrial sites within City limits in order to attract
manufacturing and logistics companies (the “Land Assembly Project”). On October 24, 2018
(DBRA 18-10-262-01) and November 7, 2018 (DBRA 18-10-262-02) the Board approved certain
initial steps in connection with the Land Assembly Project, including the allocation and acceptance
of a total of $10 Million in initial funds from the City for the Land Assembly Project.

 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (“FCA”) recently announced that it intends to do the following in the city
of Detroit (the “Project”):
•

•

Construct a new assembly plant at the site of its current Mack Engine Plant located at
Mack and St. Jean, with an estimated investment of $1.6 billion and creation of
approximately 3,850 net new full-time jobs; and
Invest approximately $900 million at its Jefferson North Assembly Plant, located at
Jefferson and St. Jean, creating approximately 1,100 net new full-time jobs.

In order to move forward with the Project, FCA needs approximately 200 acres of market-ready
land to support its operations at the 2 facilities for Project-related activities such as employee
parking, trailer marshalling, and finished vehicle storage.
As part of the Land Assembly Project, DBRA authorized agents have executed a Memorandum
of Understanding among the City, DBRA, and FCA, attached hereto as Exhibit A, (the “MOU”)
pursuant to which, subject to DBRA Board approval, the DBRA and the City would have a 60-day
period to accomplish certain milestones towards obtaining a binding commitment from FCA to
undertake the Project.
Specifically, the MOU contemplates that each of the following would occur prior to April 27, 2019:
a. Execute binding agreements to deliver title to sufficient acreage adjacent to or in
close proximity to the Project site to meet FCA’s expansion needs.
b. Complete appropriate environmental reviews and develop any necessary
remediation plans to deliver the properties in appropriate environmental condition
for FCA’s manufacturing and related purposes.
c. Negotiate a binding development agreement with FCA for the Project.
d. Identify funding sources sufficient to meet DBRA’s land acquisition and site
preparation obligations for the Project
e. Complete the process for a PA 198 tax abatement agreement (expected to be
worth approximately $12 million to FCA over 12 years).
f. Initiate any necessary rezoning and right of way vacation petitions.
g. Engage in the City’s Community Benefits process and reach final
recommendations as required by the ordinance.
In addition to the above, the DBRA will work with the City to remove the berm located along St.
Jean between Mack and East Warren prior to mid-May.
In the event that the above-milestones are met within the required timeframes, it is anticipated
that the resulting final agreements would then be presented to the DBRA Board of Directors and
Detroit City Council for approval. In the event that final agreements are not reached, FCA and
DBRA will split the cost of the berm removal.
DBRA staff seeks the Board’s approval of the MOU and the DBRA’s actions required to be
undertaken thereunder, as well as actions reasonably required to conduct due diligence on and
clear title to any sites identified for the Project.
Mr. Walters stated that the DBRA Board can anticipate a large number of agenda items in the
next sixty days related to the Land Assembly Project.

 Ms. DeSantis stated that as a resident of the east side of the City of Detroit and the founder and
former executive director of a community development corporation that serves the community to
be impacted by the project, she is aware of what is at stake and of what could happen to the
community and opportunities that the community may be able to take advantage of, so she is not
ready to move forward with the project without more information. Ms. DeSantis stated that in her
experience private companies don’t always fulfill the promises that they make and the DBRA
Board needs to be able to ask hard questions in order to have answers for the community.
Ms. McClain asked if certain DBRA Board members as mayoral appointees are to appear
conflicted when making decisions for the project. Mr. Walters stated that it has never been an
issue with prior projects and although the magnitude of this project is much larger and the
involvement of the DBRA is greater, the DBRA Board is being asked to review items in the same
manner, and that his prior statement regarding the number of items that the DBRA Board can
anticipate reviewing was just for their information and awareness.
Ms. DeSantis asked if the DBRA and the City of Detroit does not meet the sixty-day timeline set
forth in the MOU, to what extent will the DBRA be made whole, and why is the DBRA assembling
land on behalf of a private corporation, and that she needs more clarity on the proposed uses of
the land. Ms. Navin stated that within the sixty-day period the DBRA is being asked to have certain
properties under contract and to negotiate purchase agreements which will come to the DBRA
Board for review and approval, and that it is anticipated that there will be a sixty-day due diligence
period negotiated in such purchase agreements and in the event that the project does not move
forward, any deposits made for properties pursuant to the purchase agreements shall be
refundable, if applicable. Ms. DeSantis asked if that language is included in the MOU. Ms. Navin
stated that such language would be negotiated in the purchase agreements which will come to
the DBRA Board for review. Ms. Navin added that some of the risk on the part of the City of Detroit
and the DBRA in acquiring the property should the project not move forward, has been mitigated
by FCA’s commitment to split the cost of the berm removal. Ms. Navin added that funds have
been transferred to the DBRA from the City of Detroit for this project and that the funds of the
DBRA are not affected.
Ms. DeSantis asked why it is necessary to remove the berms. Ms. Bridges stated that in order to
have the required acreage assembled for the project and based on the need for employee parking
in close proximity to the expanded operations, the berms will need to be removed to satisfy those
requirements. Ms. Navin added that due to the restrictive timelines for the project and that the
need for displaced employee parking is immediate, the removal of the berms is necessary and
must occur before the end of the sixty-day timeframe set forth in the MOU, and due to these
circumstances FCA has agreed to split the cost of removing the berms should the project not
move forward.
Ms. DeSantis asked what will replace the berm as a buffer between the facility and the
neighborhood. Ms. Bridges stated that other installations are being explored that will mitigate
sound as well as serve as an attractive element for the community. Mr. Robertson added that a
sound study is underway and that a possible option is to build a sound barrier wall to replace the
berm.
Mr. Walters stated that the Mayor and Council Member Spivey will be holding discussions within
the community regarding the project to share information and receive concerns from the
community regarding the project.

 Ms. DeSantis asked what the footprint is of the 200 acres of land that will be assembled for the
project. Pointing to an aerial photo projected on the screen, Ms. Bridges stated that the acreage
extends south of Jefferson but not extending to the Detroit River, Connor St. to the east, north of
Warren at the former Federal -Mogul site, and St. Jean to the west, and the expansion of the
footprint of the facility will take place north of the former Mack Engine Plant. Mr. Walters added
that there are no residential parcels to be included in the project, and that the acreage being
assembled is commercial and industrial. Ms. Bridges added that there is a shopping center to the
north on Connor St. and the shopping center is not being pursued, but the vacant parking lots
south of the shopping center are being pursued for potential purchase.
Ms. DeSantis asked for clarification on what the proposed uses are for the land that is being
assembled for the project. Ms. Bridges stated that the land uses are expansion of the facility,
employee parking, vehicle storage for truck and trailer distribution, and trailer marshalling areas
for transport of the finished vehicles.
Ms. DeSantis asked if the land is already zoned for industrial use. Mr. Walters stated that most of
the property is currently zoned for its end use, however there will be some rezoning that will need
to be completed for a few parcels in order to use the land for the end industrial use.
Ms. McClain asked if the DBRA and the City of Detroit will be able to accomplish the requests in
the MOU in the sixty-day timeline. Mr. Walters stated that the timeline is very aggressive and
there are many tasks that will need to be completed, but the DBRA and the City of Detroit will
make its best efforts to complete the tasks within the timeframe.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the Land Assembly Project: Authorization to Enter into
MOU with Fiat Chrysler and City of Detroit as presented. The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Ms. McClain, seconded by Mr. Gonzalez, DBRA Resolution Code 19-02262-08 was approved. Ms. DeSantis abstained.
Mr. George asked what the anticipated percentage of Detroit residents that will be able to take
advantage of the possible job opportunities will be. Ms. Bridges stated that at the current Jefferson
North Assembly Plant approximately 80% of the employees are Detroit residents and a similar
number is expected at the new facility, and that FCA is working closely with Detroit Employment
Solutions Corporation.
Land Assembly Project: Authorization to Enter into Construction Management Agreement

Mr. Robertson presented the Land Assembly Project: Authorization to Enter into Construction
Management Agreement with the Mannik & Smith Group, Inc.to the DBRA Board.

of Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (“DBRA”) in industrial land assembly activities
