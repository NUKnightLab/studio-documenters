PROPOSED RESOLUTION, AS AMENDED
COOK COUNTY BOTTLE WATER BAN
WHEREAS, Cook County spends over $400,000 annually on the purchase of bottled
water for County employees; and
WHEREAS, bottled water costs up to 10,000 times more per gallon than tap water;
and
WHEREAS, bottled water is often not of high water quality; and
WHEREAS, and in a study conducted by the National Resources Defense Council
one third of bottled water tested contained significant contamination; and
WHEREAS, 60-70 percent of bottled water is not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA); and
WHEREAS, for the 30-40 percent it does regulate, the FDA only requires companies
to test a sample of water once per week; and
WHEREAS, the EPA requires testing of municipal water systems between 300-480
times per month; and
WHEREAS, supplying the plastic for the water bottles consumed by Americans
required more than 47 million gallons of oil annually, equivalent to the release of one
billion pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere; and
WHEREAS, the transportation and shipment of bottled water burns massive quantities
of fossil fuel; and
WHEREAS, 86 percent of plastic water bottles used in the U.S. end up in landfills,
where they will take up to 1,000 years to biodegrade; and
WHEREAS, the incineration of the plastic bottles releases toxic byproducts such as
chlorine gas and ash laden with heavy metals into the air; and
WHEREAS, nearly 28 percent of U.S. children ages 2 to 5 have at least one cavity;

WHEREAS, the increased use of non-fluoridated bottled water contributes to tooth
decay, cavities, and periodontal disease; and
WHEREAS, the cities of Los Angeles, Ann Arbor, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and
Santa Barbara have banned the city-financed purchase of plastic water bottles and the
sale of plastic water bottles on municipal property; and
WHEREAS, the cities of Oklahoma City, Charlottesville (VA), and New York are
considering bans; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Conference of Mayors passed a resolution calling for a study on
the impact of plastic water bottles on municipal waste systems, citing the increased
plastic waste created by the bottles, the fossil fuels used to produce and transport
them and the billions spent by city governments on water each year; and
WHEREAS, methods exist to provide purified water to County employees through
means that minimize harm to the environment.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that no County department or agency shall purchase single serving
bottles of water using County funds, unless an employee contract specifies usage or
unless needed for public health purposes, and that this prohibition will apply to County
contractors and County funded and/or sponsored events; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Purchasing Agent and the Bureau of
Administration Department of Maintenance shall, within 90 days of passage, work with
all County departments to conduct a water audit to assess their current water usage,
availability of fresh tap water, and the feasibility and cost of installing water purification
systems; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that such audit shall determine the viability of switching
all bottled water dispensers to bottle-less water dispensers; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that such audit shall also determine the viability of
turning on all currently disconnected drinking water fountains; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that no County department or agency shall purchase
bottled water dispensers or bottled water refills beginning December 1, 2007 February
1, 2008, and the County shall install bottle-less water dispensers where appropriate;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that no County department or agency shall enter into a
bottled water contract that extends beyond February 1, 2008.
