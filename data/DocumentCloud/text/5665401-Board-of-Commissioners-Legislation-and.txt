PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
REQUIRING A TWO THIRDS MAJORITY VOTE OF THE BOARD TO ENACT ANY NEW
OR ADDITIONAL TAX IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, multiple cities as well as states have either enacted or considered a supermajority

requirement for tax increases as it provides residents with another level of protection from unpopular
taxes, and
WHEREAS, taxpayers expect reasonable limits, like a 2/3 majority vote requirement for tax increases in

order to protect them from controversial votes being used to raise or create new taxes without broad
public support, and
WHEREAS, the burden of new and increased taxes that falls on the shoulders of Cook County residents

should not be left to a simple majority vote, and
WHEREAS, the process of both increasing taxes and creating new taxes should be agreed upon by a

large majority of those who will be effected by them, and
WHEREAS, the board should establish the requirement that all new taxes and new tax increases can

only be enacted by a two third majority vote from the Board of Commissioners.
NOW,

THEREFORE

BE

IT

ORDAINED,

by

the

which a higher majority is required by law, all questions shall be determined by a majority vote of those

taxation, shall require a two thirds majority vote of the board in order to pass. A vote of “present shall not
be counted in determining the number of Commissioners voting on a question
