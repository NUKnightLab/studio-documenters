Review of 2018 Year-End Hospital Survey Changes 2018

Experience Results 
a Hospital survey historically has been divided into 2 data streams

Mandatory CMS HCAHPS and oversample

- CMS requires 300 surveys annually. Due to low volume of HCAHPS mandatory survey, hospitals usually
conduct additional surveys as party of oversample. Historically MetroHealth surveys were conducted by
mail. StartingQ4 2018 mandatory HCAHPS continued by mail, as required by CMS. MHS will continue to
monitor already established trends.

. Oversample survey is now collected by e?mail phone resulting in higher response rate and faster
returns. Q4 2018 will become a baseline for 2019 reporting.

Hospital Trends Overview

. Went over the key drivers: Care Transitions, Responsiveness, Nurse Communication and Doctor
Communication.
