Dear City of Detroit Representative 

Re: Rocket Mortgage Classic

When announcements were first made about the PGA tournament taking place at the Detroit Golf
Club, I had no idea how significant this event was to PGA, the City of Detroit and our neighborhoods.
Accordingly, a team of people from Rocket Mortgage has engaged themselves with members of the
community to heighten our awareness of the event and to communicate how we might help make it
successful. The "Rocket Team" has:

. Assembled community leaders in the Palmer Park and surrounding areas for communication
meetings and to answer questions about the event.

. Communicated ways in which members of our community might be able to participate in some
aspect of the event. This has helped us feel much more engaged in what is happening.

- Communicated how our individual neighborhood associations may benefit from the event.

- Inspired us to work as a unit (neighborhoods) to make sure the event is supported.

As a result of efforts from the "Rocket Team" we now view the event as being very beneficial for our

community and we are now fully committed to doing what we can to make it a positive experience for
the golfers and all others who will be visiting and participating.

Statement for your Special Events Application:

Quicken Loans and the Rocket Mortgage Classic organizers have worked diligently to include and involve members of
the communities that border the Detroit Golf Club in the planning and discussions regarding the impact to those
communities. As the partner who represents the interests of Palmer Park, this is critically important to us. The PGA
Tournament will truly have an impact on Palmer Park given its geographic proximity to the Detroit Golf Club, so assuring
that this will have a positive impact and effect on the park is important to us as a community stakeholder.

Potential Activations

Rocket Mortgage Classic Potential Activations

Below is a list of potential or targeted activations and events that we are continuing to explore. As we get closer
to the Rocket Mortgage Classic (RMC) we fully expect to have a concrete list of activations with full detail
submitted in advance of the tournament.

One of the primary purposes of these activations and events is to strengthen the connection between the
Rocket Mortgage Classic and the Community, creating increased access and opportunity across the region.

Downtown Public Activations:

.-

Cadillac Square:

0 Cadillac City Series Activation with Opti?Shot (June 15 or 22): working with DDP to have an Op-
ti?Shot golf simulator pop up in partnership with Cadillac. Cadillac would also bring a few vehicles
and an information tent. DDP is planning on hosting their downtown street eats program during
this time as well.

0 Putting Green: We are looking into the potential of activating Cadillac Square with a putting green
that would be open to the public. This is in the beginning stages and would be something that we
would work directly with DDP on as an event rental.

Campus Martius:

0 Rocket Mortgage Logo Photo Opportunity: Photo opportunity of a large rocket mortgage branded
piece of signage where individuals can take pictures engage with the event on social media. The
idea would be to activate the sign with a small putting green and an information table. Nothing
would be sold. This is in the beginning stages and would be something that we would work direct-
ly with DDP on as an event rental.

group to teach youth entrepreneurship skills through running a "lemonade stand" as if it was a conces?

Monday Pro-Am: A potential Pro-Am (an event with both professional and amateur golfers) that would
take place at the Detroit Golf Club on Monday, June 24*? This event is not confirmed but would not Open

Dear City of Detroit Representative 

Re: Rocket Mortgage Classic

When announcements were first made about the PGA tournament taking place at the Detroit Golf
Club, I had no idea how significant this event was to PGA, the City of Detroit and our neighborhoods.
Accordingly a team of people from Rocket Mortgage has engaged themselves with members of the
community to heighten our awareness of the event and to communicate how we might help make it
successful. The "Rocket Team" has:

. Assembled community leaders in the Palmer Park and surrounding areas for communication
meetings and to answer questions about the event.

. Communicated ways in which members of our community might be able to participate in some
aspect of the event. This has helped us feel much more engaged in what is happening.

- Communicated how our individual neighborhood associations may benefit from the event.

- Inspired us to work as a unit (neighborhoods) to make sure the event is supported.

As a result of efforts from the "Rocket Team" we now view the event as being very beneficial for our

community and we are now fully committed to doing what we can to make it a positive experience for
the golfers and all others who will be visiting and participating.

HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: RECOMMENDATION FOR DEFERRA
ADDRESS: 6380 Ashton 
NAME: Vendee Mortgage Trust 2003?]
Demolition Ordered: October 1, 2018

In response to the request for a deferral of the demolition order on the property noted above, the Buildings, Safety Engineering and
Environmental Department (BSEED) submits the following information:

A special inspection conducted on April 4, 2019 revealed that the building is secured and appears to be sound and repairable. The owner has
paid all taxes and is current. The proposed use of the property is owner?s use and occupancy. This is the 1?t deferral request for this

property.

Therefore, we respectfully recommended that the demolition order be deferred for a period of six months subject to the following
conditions:

1. A permit for rehabilitation work shall be applied for within te_n (10) business days from the date of the City Council
decision.
2. BSEED will schedule a Progress Inspection within forty-?ve (45) calendar days from the date of the rehabilitation

 

permit to determine whether substantial progress has been made. Thereafter, the owner must submit to BSEED
detailed inspection reports, with photos showing evidence of the work completed, every forty-five (45) calendar
M, for the duration of the rehabilitation work, to demonstrate that substantial progress has been made during
the approved time frame for rehabilitation.

3. The building shall have all imminently hazardous conditions immediately corrected, be maintained, and securely
barricaded until rehabilitation is complete. Rehabilitation work is to be completed within six (6) months, at which
time the owner will obtain one of the following from this department:

0 Certi?cate of Acceptance related to building permits
0 Certi?cate of Approval as a result of a Housing Inspection
0 Certi?cate of Compliance, required for a_l  rental properties

4. The owner shall not occupy or allow occupancy of the structure without a certi?cate (as outlined above).
5. The yards shall be maintained clear of overgrown vegetation, weeds, junk and debris at all times.
6. Prior to seeking a permit extension, the owner must contact BSEED and request to extend the deferral period.

We recommend that utility disconnect actions cease to allow the progress of the rehabilitation.

At the end of the deferral period, the owner must contact this department to arrange an inspection to evidence that conditions of the deferral
have been satis?ed and that there has been substantial progress toward rehabilitation. If the building becomes open to trespass or if conditions
of the deferral are not followed, the deferral may be rescinded by the City Council at any time and we may proceed with demolition without
?irther notice. In addition, pursuant to the Property Maintenance Code we will issue a Blight Violation Notice.

Any request exceeding three (3) deferrals must be made by petition to City Council through the office of the City Clerk.

Honorable City Council:

RE: Petition No. 639 - Pope Francis Center, request to vacate easements for the
property located at 3769 Canfield Street.

Petition No. 639 - Pope Francis Center, request to vacate all remaining easements in the
Block bounded by Canfield Avenue, 60 feet wide, Gar?eld Avenue, 60 feet wide, Ellery
Street, 60 feet wide, and Mt. Elliott Avenue, 60 feet wide.

The request is being made to render the parcel of land unencumbered for a future
development. The alleys in the block have been previously vacated with subsurface
easements and sewer easements. Resolutions previously approved by your Honorable
Body include: 1) Alley vacation approved on October 15, 1929 and dedication accepted
October 29, 1929. 2) Alleys vacated reserving a sewer easement approved October 9,
1962 on J.C.C. pg. 2331. 3) Alleys vacated reserving a subsurface utility easement
approved January 25, 1978 on J.C.C. pgs. 160-162.

The petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for investigation
(utility review) and report. This is our report.

Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has no objection to the vacation
provided certain provisions are met. The DWSD provisions are a part of the attached
resolution.

All other involved City departments and privately owned utility companies have reported
no objections to the vacation. Provisions protecting the rights of the utilities and the City
are a part of this resolution.

I am recommending adoption of the attached resolution.
