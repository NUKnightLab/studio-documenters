 Proposed Mixed Finance Rental Development
CHA would submit a development proposal for the acquisition and rehabilitation of the Carling Hotel
into a mixed finance rental development that would include 26 public housing units. The acquisition
would allow CHA to convey the property to MDC either in fee simple or by ground lease, in order to
generate additional donation tax credit equity financing for the transaction. The total estimated
development budget for The Carling Hotel rental development is approximately $24,595,323 and
includes the CHA Loan of $7,799,740.
Proposed PRA Development
 The Carling Hotel currently consists of 155 total Single Room Occupancy (SRO) units. The

 Substantial rehabilitation of a 4-story elevator building located in the Near North community
area. The new units will be approximately 320-350 square feet.
 Currently none of the units have kitchens and most units do not have full bathrooms.
 The scope of work includes constructing kitchens and full bathrooms in all units and
replacement of major building systems including heating electrical, elevators and exterior
masonry.
 Target population is individuals. For the PRA scenario, 8 units will be designated for the State
Referral Network.
 Building amenities will include a library/reading room, vending snack machines, laundry
facilities, secured bicycle parking, individual storage lockers, no-smoking units, on-site property
management, secured entrances and common hallways, security cameras and intercom system.
Developer Background
 The Michaels Development company (MDC) was established in 1973 and is an arm of The
Michaels Organization, which owns 8 companies that provide various affordable housing
services including development, construction oversight, property management, mortgage
financing, tax credit syndication and supportive services.
