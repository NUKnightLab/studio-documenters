Re: Abolishment of the Chalmers Square Brownfield Redevelopment Plan
Dear Honorable Council Members:

The Chalmers Square Brownfield Redevelopment Plan (the ?Plan") was approved by City
Council more than two years ago in 2009. The legal descriptions for the subject Plan are
attached (Exhibit A).

At the regularly scheduled August 14, 2019 DBRA Board of Directors meeting, DBRA
staff recommended abolishment of the Plan on the basis that the project has been
completed and the purposes for which the Plan was established have been accomplished
in accordance with Section 14(8)(a) of Act 381. The DBRA subsequently adopted a
resolution (Exhibit B) approving the abolishment of the Plan and authorizing the
submission of a copy of its resolution to request that City Council adopt a resolution
abolishing the Plan.

The DBRA, as authorized by City Council, sent a notification of termination of the Plan
(Exhibit C) in accordance with Section 

Authority's Request
The Authority is respectfully requesting the following action from the City Council:

October 1 2019
Referral of the resolution terminating the Plan to Detroit City Council Planning and
Economic Development Standing Committee on July 18, 2019.

 

October 3 2019
Consideration of the City Council's Planning and Economic Development Standing
Committee to terminate the Plan and opportunity for the Developer to be heard
during public comment.

 

October a 2019
City Council adoption of the Resolution (Exhibit D), terminating the Plan.
