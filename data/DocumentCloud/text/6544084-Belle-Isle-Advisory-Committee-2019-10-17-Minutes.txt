 General Updates
Karis Floyd, DNR
• Aquarium and Conservatory will receive a new boiler
• Pump house stabilization and assessment is in progress
• Phase 2 of mobility study – signage
• Flooding is receding in the canals in the park
• Athletic complex roof to be replaced (800,000)
• November 4th floor for the Pavilion restored, HVAC and windows replaced
Bud Denker: Was the portable coffer (new) dam ever used this year and what is the impact if we
continue to have high water levels?
Amanda Treadwell: Not at this time as the water levels declined.
Chief Ron Olson: If the water levels get to a certain point none of the provisions will matter.
The electrical, sewer and water will be the real issue which we will prepare for by spring.
Bud Denker: The culverts can’t stop it?
Chief Ron Olson: The culvert will allow water to move through the system but if the water
levels in the river exceed the design there is little control of the canal water levels.
Michelle Hodges: Isn’t there an ability to have some control of the water levels in the Great
Lakes?
Chief Ron Olson: We will look into that.
Park Updates
Karis Floyd, DNR
• Looking forward to hiring 2 new lead park rangers plus 2 park rangers.

PUBLIC COMMENTS (3 minutes each)
Michael Betzold
Peter Potoski

.

Requested information is needed about the Grand Prix contract
extension.
Can see the benefit to the Grand Prix bringing more money to the
island for improvements, but also supports the quiet nature of the
natural park environment and feels a compromise can be reached.

Tom Janiszewski

Will there will be foot trails on the island? Amanda Treadwell
stated there would be.

Angela Lugo-Thomas

The BIPAC should have at least 1-2 members who are regular park
users with no ties or obligations to the Grand Prix/Penske
organization.
I am a member of Belle Isle Concern, a grass roots citizen opposed
to the running of the Grand Prix on Belle Ilse, a public park. What
is the point of allowing public comments at these meeting when
our concerns, comments and questions are rarely, if ever, answered
or addressed?
Can you explain why the grass in almost every area of the Grand
Prix occupation is dead/destroyed?

 Angela DiSante

Against Grand Prix destroying the island every spring. Money
may talk, but people matter.

COMMITTEE MEMBER ITEMS
Bud Denker

If the public would like to be aware of the initiatives taking place
on the park, the website is BELLEISLEPARK.ORG.

Rev. Lonnie Peek

Would like to congratulate the park on the $3.7 million federal
grant for the flatwoods restoration and thank Amanda for her hard
work.

Michelle Hodges

Wanted to address the fact that it is difficult to be asked to
comment on theoretical situations or things that have yet to occur
in regard to future contracts and partnerships. But when the time
comes to address them the proper processes will be followed.

Current HAS facilities do not
meet the local need.

Additional access is desired 
the public-

3 of the 33 Michigan counties
around the studs' area account
for over l??it. of all registered
boats in the state.

Fisheries projects that
native fish population increases
will spur increased fishing
access.

Report Findings predict heater

continue to grow.
