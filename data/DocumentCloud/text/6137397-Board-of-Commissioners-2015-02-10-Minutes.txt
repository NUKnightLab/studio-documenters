RESOLUTION CONGRATULATING THE COOK COUNTY BAR ASSOCIATION
ON ITS 100TH ANNIVERSARY
WHEREAS, in 1869 Lloyd G. Wheeler became the first Black man licensed to practice law in the State
of Illinois, and in 1894 Ida Platt became the first Black woman licensed to practice law in the State of
Illinois. By 1896, thirty-two (32) African Americans had been admitted to the Illinois Bar, and they began
meeting informally to devise a legal strategy to protest discrimination in hotels, theaters, restaurants,
schools and the judiciary; and
WHEREAS, this informal collaboration among African American attorneys lasted until 1914, when a
younger generation of Black lawyers decided to form the Cook County Bar Association (“CCBA”) to
improve, protect and defend the lives and rights of all citizens in the Greater Chicago Area. The Cook
County Bar Association (CCBA) is the oldest association of Black lawyers in the country; and
WHEREAS, since the Cook County Bar Association (“CCBA”) inception, its members have served as
advocates, judges, and legal educators, and as elected and appointed representatives, participating at every
level of government, to fight injustice, to advocate on behalf of underserved communities, and to promote
the interests of African American lawyers and judges; and
WHEREAS, throughout its distinguished history the Cook County Bar Association (“CCBA”) has
provided leadership, service and advocacy for African American attorneys and to people residing in
underserved communities; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bar Association (“CCBA”) myriad accomplishments include the work of
its outstanding members, such as C. Francis Stradford, who co-founded the National Bar Association in
1925; Earl B. Dickerson, who represented the plaintiffs in Hansberry v. Lee, the seminal 1940 case
protesting restrictive covenants in Chicago’s housing markets; and William R. Ming, who served on the
National Association for the Advancement for Colored People (NAACP) team litigating Brown v. Board
of Education in 1954; and

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

WHEREAS, since its founding, the Cook County Bar Association (“CCBA”) has celebrated many firsts
with its members, including Jewel Stradford LaFontant’s appointment as the first Black female Deputy
Solicitor General; Edith Sampson’s election as Illinois’ first Black female Municipal Court Judge; James
Parson’s appointment to the U.S. District Court; John Stroger’s election as Cook County Board President;
and Harold Washington’s election as Mayor of the City of Chicago. The Cook County Bar Association
(“CCBA”) membership roster includes many members of the judiciary; members of the Chicago City
Council, both past and present; and President Barack Obama, to name just a few; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bar Association (“CCBA”) continues its tradition of service by providing
a variety of legal programs to advance the legal profession and its members, such as sponsoring the largest
job fair for law students in the Midwest, a Law Day for high school students, a free monthly legal clinic
for Chicago residents, scholarships and awards, and expanded In Court Bar Program for Cook County Bar
Association (“CCBA”) members, various neighborhood legal forums, and Call A Lawyer Day. The Cook
County Bar Association (“CCBA”) has also worked to develop an organized system for fair and impartial
evaluations of judicial candidates, an effort which has led to a joint alliance with other minority bar
associations; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bar Association (“CCBA”) celebrated its centennial anniversary in 2014
with a vision for the future that honors its storied past, celebrates its present successes, and eagerly invites
innovations that a rapidly changing society and the legal community require; and
WHEREAS, it is in keeping with this spirit that the Cook County Bar Association adopted “Cook County
Bar Association (“CCBA”) 100: Service-Struggle-Success” as the theme for its Centennial Celebration.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County President and Board of Commissioners
do hereby commend the Cook County Bar Association (CCBA) for its unsurpassed contributions to the
legal profession, for its sustained efforts to advance the cause of racial equality, and for its decades of
service to the residents of Cook County, Illinois; and do hereby extend to the Cook County Bar Association
(CCBA) our congratulations on achieving the milestone of its 100th Anniversary; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be presented to the Board of
Directors of the Cook County Bar Association (CCBA) as a token of our appreciation and esteem.

Comprensión y Apoyo a Latinos en Oposición al Retrovirus or Comprehension and Support of Latinos
Against the Retrovirus (CALOR) to increase the programs and services it offered to people with HIV/AIDS
and to reach out to people with other disabilities. Comprensión y Apoyo a Latinos en Oposición al
Retrovirus or Comprehension and Support of Latinos Against the Retrovirus (CALOR) began offering
substance abuse services and added a vocational program to provide employment and training to Latinos
with disabilities, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Acquired Immuno Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS); and
WHEREAS, throughout the years, Comprensión y Apoyo a Latinos en Oposición al Retrovirus or
Comprehension and Support of Latinos Against the Retrovirus (CALOR) has continued to thrive and
expand its services. It opened Casa Contreras, a 17-unit residential building named after two (2) of
Comprensión y Apoyo a Latinos en Oposición al Retrovirus or Comprehension and Support of Latinos
Against the Retrovirus (CALOR) founding members-Salvador Contreras and José Luis Contreras and
started American Cinema Editors (A.C.E.), a new Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Acquired

which has become one of Comprensión y Apoyo a Latinos en Oposición al Retrovirus or Comprehension

WHEREAS, Joseph A. Tecson had a long and distinguished legal career. In the late 1970s, he founded
Joseph A. Tecson and Associates, followed by Chuhak & Tecson in 1987, which he co-founded with the
late Thomas S. Chuhak . He focused his practice on municipal law and health-care law. He was outside
general counsel for MacNeal Hospital in Berwyn and the Clarke Group in St. Charles, Illinois and
represented the Village of North Riverside. He practiced law for more than 50 years before retiring; and
WHEREAS, Joseph A. Tecson was a visionary leader in the area of transportation. He served on the

Regional Transportation Authority is still widely consulted regarding transportation matters; and
WHEREAS, Joseph A. Tecson served as a delegate to the 1970 Illinois Constitutional Convention which

is largely credited with crafting the rules for how state officials are elected; and
WHEREAS, as a Delegate, Joseph A. Tecson was known for his diplomatic skills, skills that were
instrumental in brokering not only a truce between extremely different perspectives but helped craft a
document that is widely regarded for its wisdom and fairness. The end result was a hard fought set of
compromises between many diverse interests in Illinois. Delegates wrestled with myriad hot-button
issues, including the death penalty and employment and housing discrimination. It was largely due to
Tecson’s diplomacy at the convention that the delegates were able to put aside such polarizing differences.
They created a document that continues to serve the people of Illinois nearly five (5) decades later; and

to help adversarial parties find common ground. This quality is viewed by colleagues and family members

Board of Directors of MacNeal Hospital and helped lead the complete turnaround of that institution through
the construction of a new replacement hospital; and

agencies, including the Illinois Department of Insurance, the Medical Disciplinary Board, the Department
of Public Aid, the Department of Public Health and the Department of Professional Regulation; and
WHEREAS, Joseph A. Tecson also served on the boards of two (2) banks and was the municipal attorney
for the Village of North Riverside and an Arbitrator for the American Arbitration Association; and
WHEREAS, Joseph A. Tecson’s absence will be felt most acutely by his wife of over sixty (60) years
Caroline and their children, Andrew, Sarah and David; eight (8) grandchildren; and one (1) greatgrandchild.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County that the

URGING THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY
TO RESTORE JUDICIAL DISCRETION IN THE TRANSFER OF
JUVENILES TO ADULT COURT

Page 55 of 189

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

February 10, 2015

WHEREAS, the nation’s first juvenile court was created in Cook County 115 years ago, based on the
understanding that children are different and should be treated differently than adults; and
WHEREAS, scientific research has proven that the adolescent brain is not fully developed in the areas that
regulate rational decision making and impulse control; and
WHEREAS, 705 ILCS 405/5-130 of the Juvenile Court Act, mandates that youth predominantly fifteen
(15) and older, but as young as thirteen (13), automatically be tried as adults, in adult court, facing adult
sentences, based solely on the charge brought, which is at the exclusive discretion of the prosecutor; and
WHEREAS, Illinois is one (1) of only fourteen (14) states that do not require a hearing in front of a juvenile
court judge before a child is transferred to adult court; and
WHEREAS, according to a study by the Illinois Juvenile Justice Initiative (JJI), since the passage of the
Automatic Transfer statute in 1982, transfers to adult court have increased from 57 annually to 86 annually
as of 2012; and
WHEREAS, the number of youth charged as Automatic Transfers increased dramatically after the passage
of “Raise the Age” legislation from 96 in 2013 to 178 in 2014; and
WHEREAS, Automatic Transfer of youth to adult court has a direct impact on the Cook County Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center (JTDC) in which the average daily population of transferred youth has nearly
doubled over the last year from 72 to 138; and
WHEREAS, according to the Illinois Juvenile Justice Initiative (JJI) study, the implementation of
Automatic Transfer has resulted in more children being transferred to adult court for less serious crimes as
compared to when judges made the transfer decisions; and
WHEREAS, Automatic Transfer has an extreme disproportionate impact on children of color. In a three
(3) year sample of automatic transfers in Cook County, only 83% of youth transferred were African
American and only one (1) youth was white; and
WHEREAS, approximately 54% of Automatic Transfer youth in the three (3) year study by Illinois
Juvenile Justice Initiative (JJI) ultimately pled guilty to lesser charges that if originally charged would have
been prosecuted in juvenile court; and
WHEREAS, Adult court cases are processed at a much slower pace than juvenile cases with an average
time to disposition of 369 days for Automatic Transfer youth whose cases where disposed of in the last
year; and
WHEREAS, according to a 2007 survey by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention children
prosecuted as adults are 34% more likely to reoffend than children with similar criminal histories who are
prosecuted in juvenile court for similar offenses; and
WHEREAS, “The Consequences of Transfer” a study published by the University of Chicago Press, found
that children prosecuted as adults are more likely to commit more serious new crimes at a faster rate than
those tried in juvenile court; and

Page 56 of 189

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

February 10, 2015

WHEREAS, according to analysis by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice there is no correlation
between the transferring of juveniles to adult court and the drop in youth violence across the country; and
WHEREAS, the United Nation Human Rights Committee urged the U.S. to end prosecution of juveniles
in adult court; and
WHEREAS, the Supreme Court of Illinois in People v. Patterson, urged the legislature to reform the
automatic transfer statute in Illinois stating “While modern research has recognized the effect that the
unique qualities and characteristics of youth may have on juveniles’ judgment and actions, the automatic
transfer provision does not. Indeed, the mandatory nature of that statute denies this reality. Accordingly,
we strongly urge the General Assembly to review the automatic transfer provision based on the current
scientific and sociological evidence indicating a need for the exercise of judicial discretion in determining
the appropriate setting for the proceedings in these juvenile cases; and
WHEREAS, automatic transfer prevents any consideration by a judge of the particular characteristics of a
child, the crime or the child’s role in the crime in determining the appropriate venue for sentencing; and
WHEREAS, automatically transferring youth accused of certain crimes ignores the scientific research and
the underlying philosophy of the juvenile court; and
WHEREAS, every child in Illinois deserves a fair hearing in front of a juvenile court judge to determine
whether their case is more appropriately handled in juvenile or adult court; and
WHEREAS, it is in the best interest of justice to restore judicial discretion in all decisions relating to the
transfer of a child to adult court.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby
urge the Illinois General Assembly to pass HB172, which ends the Automatic Transfer of youth to adult
court and restores judicial discretion, by requiring a hearing in front of a juvenile court judge to determine
whether a child is suitable for the rehabilitative focus of the juvenile court or should be transferred to adult
court and sentenced as an adult; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of the Resolution be tendered to the Speaker of the
Illinois House of Representatives and the President of the Illinois Senate.
Approved and adopted this 10th of February 2015.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION CALLING FOR A HEARING OF THE HUMAN RELATIONS COMMITTEE
OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS ON SERVICE GAPS IN
COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES
WHEREAS, the City of Chicago closed six (6) of its twelve (12) Community Mental Health Clinics in
April of 2012; and
WHEREAS, according to Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, the reduction in funding for mental health
services across multiple levels of government, including the Chicago clinic closures, has resulted in the
Cook County Jail being the largest mental health facility in the state and possibly the nation; and
WHEREAS, according to a joint report authored by the Mental Health Movement of Chicago and
AFSCME Council 31, Chicago’s closure of half of its mental health clinics resulted in a failure by the City
of Chicago to account for hundreds and perhaps thousands of people who had depended on these clinics
for mental health treatment services; and
WHEREAS, that same report, entitled “Abandoning the Most Vulnerable,” cites a complete lack of a
comprehensive effort to determine how many people lost access to mental health treatment services after
the Chicago clinic closures and similar lack of effort to make contact with the individuals who lost access
to treatment and connect them with new service providers; and
WHEREAS, Cook County, which is charged with providing services to the most vulnerable members of
our local population, deals every day with the consequences of an inadequate safety net that has stranded
too many of our residents without access to care that they urgently need; and
WHEREAS, we count among those consequences an overcrowded Jail, court system and Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center, all of which constitute a significant drain on Cook County’s Budget and
resources.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County President and Board of Commissioners
does hereby request a meeting of the Human Relations Committee of the Cook County Board of

Page 184 of 189

Commissioners, to take place Thursday, March 19, 2015 at 10 AM at 118 North Clark Street, Room 569,

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County President and the Board of Commissioners that the
above referenced meeting of the Human Relations Committee of the Cook County Board of Commissioners
focus exclusively on the service gaps caused by reduction in Community Mental Health Services in the
City of Chicago and its impact on the Cook County Budget and the population that the County serves.

RESOLUTION TO DISCUSS WORKFORCE, HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
AFFFAIRS IN COOK COUNTY GOVERNMENT
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII, Section 6(a) of

its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, Cook County is committed to fostering economic, workforce and community development
within Cook County by strategically leveraging the tools and resources with a growing regional capacity
to expand the amount of jobs and housing and support stable, resilient communities for its residents and
businesses.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, the Cook County Committee on Housing, Workforce and
