remedial affirmative action program in Public Works Contracts.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012

(d) The County seeks to provide a level playing field and equal access for all prime
contractors and subcontractors to participate in Public Works Contracts;
(e) The County has engaged in committee hearings in which the County has heard
anecdotal evidence of discrimination in the construction industry, has commissioned a
study on the levels of PCE participation in Public Works Contracts, has reviewed the
report prepared indicating evidence of discrimination in Public Works Contracts and has
considered the evidence in relevant case law; and
(f) In the absence of application of the Program to Public Works Contracts, the
County has witnessed a drastic decline in PCE in its Public Works Contracts, to levels
below the availability of PCEs, and thus, the County would be a passive participant in a
discriminatory marketplace without the application of PCE goals.
Sec. 34-287 Policy.
Based on the findings set forth in subdivision I, Sec. 34-261 and the findings set forth in
subdivision II, Sec. 34-286, and in addition to the policy set forth at Sec. 34-262, the policy and
purpose of this subdivision is to establish and implement goals for participation of PCEs in Public
Works Contracts, in accordance with all applicable laws.
It is hereby found, determined and declared that the purpose of this Ordinance is to ensure
the full and equitable participation of Minority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprises in the
County's procurement process as both prime and subcontractors in the County's construction
contracts. The County is committed to a policy of preventing discrimination in the award of or
participation in construction contracts and has recommended appropriate narrowly tailored
remedies to eliminate any such discrimination.
Sec. 34-288. Program goals. Applicability.
The Program Goal applicable to Public Works Contracts shall be a goal of twenty-four
percent (24%) of the annual total dollar amount of Public Works Contracts to MBEs and a goal of
not less than ten percent (10%) of the annual total dollar amount of Public Works Contracts to
WBEs. In establishing a Contract Specific Goal for Public Works Contracts, the CCD shall
consider the availability of sufficient Certified MBEs and WBEs for each trade required as part of
the project.
This subdivision shall apply to all construction contracts funded in whole or in part by
County funds, regardless of the sources of other funds; provided that any contract with respect to
which a goal for Minority-Owned Business Enterprise or Women-Owned Business Enterprise
participation is inconsistent with or prohibited by State or Federal law shall be exempt from the
goals included in this subdivision.
Sec. 34-289. Commercially Useful Function. Severability.
To determine whether a PCE is performing a Commercially Useful Function, the County
will evaluate whether the portion of the work subcontracted to or by a PCE is in accordance with
industry standards. For example, if a PCE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a Contract
than would be expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
Commercially Useful Function. In addition, to perform a Commercially Useful Function, the PCE
must be responsible, with respect to materials, equipment and supplies used in performing its
portion of the Contract, for negotiating price, determining whether quality meets specifications,
ordering the material, installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself.

court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the subdivision shall not be affected by such
invalidity.

evidence.
(b) Only a firm owned by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person(s) may be
certified as a MBE or WBE.
(1) The firm's ownership by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person must be
real, substantial, and continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of the firm as
reflected in ownership documents. The owner(s) must enjoy the customary incidents
of ownership and share in the risks and profits commensurate with that ownership
interest.
(2) The contributions of capital or Expertise by the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) to acquire the ownership interest must be real and substantial.
If Expertise is relied upon as part of a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner's contribution to acquire ownership, the Expertise must be of the requisite
quality generally recognized in a specialized field, in areas critical to the firm's
operations, indispensable to the firm's potential success, specific to the type of work
the firm performs and documented in the firm's records. The individual whose
Expertise is relied upon must have a commensurate financial investment in the firm.
(c) Only a firm that is managed and controlled by a Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged person(s) may be certified as a MBE or WBE.

There can be no restrictions through corporate charter provisions, by-law provisions,
contracts or any other formal or informal devices that prevent the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s), without the cooperation or vote of any nonSocially and Economically Disadvantaged person, from making any business decision
of the firm, including the making of obligations or the disbursing of funds.
(2) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the power to
direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the firm and to make
day-to-day as well as long-term decisions on management, policy, operations and
work.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
(3) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) may delegate various areas of
the management or daily operations of the firm to persons who are not Socially and

and fire any such person. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s)
must actually exercise control over the firm's operations, work, management and
policy.
(4) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have an overall
understanding of, and managerial and technical competence, experience and

and to make independent decisions concerning the firm's daily operations, work,
management, and policymaking.
(5) If federal, state and/or local laws, regulations or statutes require the owner(s) to have a
particular license or other credential to own and/or control a certain type of firm, then
the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the required
license or credential. If state law, County ordinance or other law regulations or statute
does not require that the owner posses the license or credential, that the owner(s) lacks
such license or credential is a factor, but is not dispositive, in determining whether the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the firm.
(6) A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside
employment or other business interests that conflict with the management of the firm
or prevent the owner from devoting sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the
firm to manage and control its day to day activities.
(d) Only an independent firm may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An independent firm is
one whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another firm. Recognition of an
applicant as a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to
demonstrate that a firm is independent and non-Affiliated. In determining whether an applicant is
an independent Business, the CC Director will:
(1) Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Firms in such areas as personnel, facilities,
equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.
(2) Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified
Firms or persons associated with non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's
independence.
(3) Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Firms to determine whether a
pattern of exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Firm compromises the
applicant's independence.
(4) Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified
Firms with normal industry practice.
(e) An applicant shall be certified only for specific types of work in which the Socially and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and Expertise to manage and control the
firm's operations and work.
(f) The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or WBEs and
non-Certified Firms. To be considered an eligible Joint Venture, at least one partner of the Joint
Venture must be a Certified Firm, with a share in the capital contribution, control, management,
risks, and profits of the Joint Venture which is equal to its ownership interest. Each Certified Firm
partner must contribute property, capital, efforts, skill and knowledge and be responsible for a
distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the contract. Joint Ventures must have an
agreement in writing specifying the terms and conditions of the relationships between the partners
and their relationship and responsibility to the contract.
(g) In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the CC Director by rule may accept formal
certifications by other entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if the CC Director
determines that the certification standards of such entities are comparable to those of the County.
(h) The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the
Office of Contract Compliance. Failure of the firm to seek recertification by filing the necessary
documentation with the CC Director as provided by rule may result in decertification.
(i) It is the responsibility of the Certified Firm to notify the CC Director of any change in
its circumstances affecting its continued eligibility for the Program, including decertification by
another agency. Failure to do so may result in the firm's decertification.
(j) The CC Director shall decertify a firm that does not continuously meet the eligibility
criteria.
(k) Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by
the County. The challenged firm shall have the burden of proving that its County certification
should be maintained.
(l) A firm that has been denied certification or recertification or has been decertified may
protest the denial or decertification as provided by rule.
(m) A firm found to be ineligible may not apply for certification for six (6) months after
the effective date of the final decision.
(n) A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for certification or a
Certified Firm as provided by rule. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the individual
challenging the eligibility of an applicant for certification or a certified form. The burden of proof
shall rest with the complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The CC
Director shall be the final arbiter of all challenges. The presumption that the challenged firm is
eligible shall remain in effect until the CC Director renders a final decision.
Sec. 34-294. Annual aspirational goals.
The Annual Aspirational Goals for the utilization of MBEs and WBEs on County
construction contracts and subcontracts shall be 24 percent for MBEs and ten (10) percent for
WBEs.
Sec. 34-295. Project specific goals.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012

The CC Director, in consultation with the User Department, shall establish Project
Specific Goals for construction Contracts based upon the availability of at least three MBEs and
three WBEs to perform the anticipated subcontracting functions of the project and the County's
utilization of MBEs and WBEs to date.
Sec. 34-296. Counting MBE and WBE participation.
(a) The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the MBEs or
WBEs own forces shall be counted, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the
MBE or WBE for the work of the contract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the
MBE or WBE (except supplies and equipment the MBE or WBE purchases or leases from the
prime Contractor or the prime Contractor's Affiliate).
(b) The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a MBE or WBE for providing a
bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for
providing bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of a contract, shall be
counted, provided the fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily
charged for similar services.
(c) When a MBE or WBE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of
the total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the
Joint Venture's contract that is performed by the MBE or WBE with its own forces and for which
it is separately at risk, shall be counted.
(d) Only expenditures to a MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially Useful
Function shall be counted. To determine whether a MBE or WBE is performing a Commercially
Useful Function, the County will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices,
whether the amount the MBE or WBE is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the
work it is actually performing and other relevant factors. To perform a Commercially Useful
Function, the MBE or WBE must be responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on
the contract, for negotiating price, determining quality and quantity, ordering the material,
installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself. A MBE or WBE does not perform
a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in the contract
through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or WBE participation. If
a MBE or WBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would be expected
based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful Function.
When a MBE or WBE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the
Certified Firm may present evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e) One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from a MBE or
WBE Manufacturer or Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of the fees or
transportation charges for the delivery of materials or supplies required on a job site shall be
counted only if the payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and are commensurate
with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(f) If a firm ceases to be a Certified Firm for any other reason than graduation from the
M/WBE Construction Program during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of work
performed under a contract with that firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted.
(g) In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of a MBE or

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
WBE shall not be counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-297. Contract pre-award compliance procedures.
(a) For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all
subcontractors from which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific
Goals have been established, its achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The
Utilization Plan shall be due at the time the bid / proposal is due.
(b) Any agreement between a Contractor and a MBE or WBE in which the Contractor
requires that the MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is
prohibited.
(c) Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CC Director will
determine whether the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). In making this
determination, the Director will consider, at a minimum, the Contractor's efforts to:
(1) Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid
meetings, advertising and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs certified
in the scopes of work of the contract. The Contractor shall provide interested MBEs
and WBEs with timely, adequate information about the plans, specifications, and
requirements of the contract to allow MBEs and WBEs to respond to the solicitation.
The Contractor must follow up initial solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEs.
(2) Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to increase
the likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where
appropriate, breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units to
facilitate MBE and WBE participation, even when the Contractor would otherwise
prefer to perform these work items with its own forces. It is the Contractor's
responsibility to make a portion of the work available to MBEs and WBEs and to
select those portions of the work or material needs consistent with the availability
MBEs and WBEs to facilitate their participation.
(3) Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such negotiation
includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEs that were
contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and
specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and why agreements could not
be reached with MBEs and WBEs. The Contractor may not reject MBEs and WBEs as
being unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their
capabilities. That there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using
MBEs and WBEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the
Project Specific Goals, as long as such costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a
Contractor to perform the work of a contract with its own organization does not
relieve it of the responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all scopes of work that
could be subcontracted.
(4) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit,
or insurance as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.
(5) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary equipment,
supplies, materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
(6) Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women
community organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government
sponsored minority/women business assistance offices and other appropriate
organizations to provide assistance in the recruitment and placement of MBEs and
WBEs.
(e) In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of
other Contractors in meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the
apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be
reasonably questioned whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful
Contractor could have met the Project Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful
Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average MBE or
WBE participation obtained by other Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent
successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.
(f) A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the work, materials,
equipment or services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE and the agreed upon
dollar value shall be due at the time of bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(g) The CC Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the
scope of work and the letters of intent from MBEs and WBEs. The CC Director may request
clarification in writing of items listed in the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not
include the opportunity to augment listed participation or Good Faith Efforts.
(h) If the CC Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project
Specific Goals have been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User
Department, the CC Director and User Department shall recommend award to Procurement
Officer Department.
(i) If the CC Director finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts,
the CC Director shall communicate this finding to the User Purchasing Department and
recommend that the bid/proposal be rejected. A Contractor may protest this determination
pursuant to the County's bid protest procedures.
Sec. 34-298. Contract administration procedures.
(a) Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the
Project Specific Goals become covenants of performance by the Contractors and incorporated in
the contract.
(b) The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the
performance of the contract, and detailed subcontractor information to the County with each
request for payment submitted to the County or as otherwise directed by the County. The CC
Director and the User Department shall monitor subcontractor participation during the course of
the contract. The County shall have full and timely access to the Contractor's books and records,
including without limitation payroll records, tax returns and records and books of account, to
determine the Contractor's compliance with its commitment to MBE and WBE participation and
the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion of the contract. This provision shall be in
addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision allowing inspection of the Contractor's
records by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
(c) The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or
WBEs named in the Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CC Director,
Procurement Officer and the User Department. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a
violation of this subdivision and a breach of contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of
the bid or proposal or cause termination of the executed contract for breach, the withholding of
payment and/or subject the Contractor to contract penalties or other sanctions.
(1) All requests for changes or substitutions of a MBE or WBE Subcontractor(s) named in
the Utilization Plan shall be made to the CC Director, Procurement Officer and the
User Department in writing, and shall clearly and fully set forth the basis for the
request. A Contractor shall not substitute a MBE or WBE subcontractor or perform
the work designated for a MBE or WBE subcontractor with its own forces unless and
until the CC Director, Procurement Officer in consultation with the User Department,
approves such substitution in writing. A Contractor shall not allow a substituted
subcontractor to begin work until both the Director, Procurement Officer and the User
Department have approved the substitution.
(2) The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should
have been known by either party before the submission of the Utilization Plan. Bid
shopping is prohibited. The Contractor must negotiate with the MBE or WBE
subcontractor to resolve the problem. Where there has been a mistake or disagreement
about the scope of work, the MBE or WBE can be substituted only where an
agreement cannot be reached for a reasonable price for the correct scope of work.
(3) Substitutions of the subcontractor shall be permitted only on the following bases:
(i) Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed.
(ii) Failure of performance.
(iii) Financial incapacity.
(iv) Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price.
(v) Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a solicitation
where agreement upon a reasonable price cannot be reached.
(vi)

Failure of the subcontractor to meet insurance, licensing or bonding
requirements; or

(vii) The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal.
(4) The final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed substitution, and the basis of
any denial, shall be communicated to the parties in writing by the CC Director.
(5) Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the satisfaction of
the County, the Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization
Plan. The Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in
obtaining a new MBE or WBE. If the Project Specific Goal(s) cannot be reached and
Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a nonCertified Firm.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012

(6) If the County requires the substitution of a MBE or WBE subcontractor listed in the
Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall undertake Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the
Utilization Plan. The Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of Contract
Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBE subcontractor. If the Goal(s) cannot be
reached and Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a
non-Certified Firm.
(d) If a Contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not
previously disclosed in the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of the CC
Director to modify the Utilization Plan and must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure that MBES
and WBEs have a fair opportunity to bid on the new scope of work.
(e) Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User Department at the time
they arise to establish the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the MBE or
WBE goal.
(f) Prior to contract closeout, the CC Director shall evaluate the Contractor's fulfillment of
the contracted goals, taking into account all approved substitutions, terminations and changes to
the contract's scope of work. If the County determines that Good Faith Efforts to meet the MBE or
WBE commitments were not made, or that fraudulent misrepresentations have been made, or any
other breach of the contract or violation of this subdivision, a remedy or sanction may be imposed,
as provided in the contract.
Sec. 34-299. Sanctions and penalties.
(a) The following violations of this subdivision may result in a breach of contract:

certification or recertification or colluded with others to do so;

proposal or documentation of Good Faith Efforts, post-award compliance, or other

evaluate whether the portion of the work subcontracted to or by a PCE is in accordance with industry

expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful
Function. In addition, to perform a Commercially Useful Function, the PCE must be responsible, with
respect to materials, equipment and supplies used in performing its portion of the Contract, for
negotiating price, determining whether quality meets specifications, ordering the material, installing

Sec. 34-293. Program eligibility.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
(a) Only Businesses that meet the criteria for certification as a an MBE or WBE may participate
in the Program. The applicant has the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence.
(b) Only a firm owned by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person(s) may be certified
as a MBE or WBE.
(1) The firm's ownership by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person must be real,
substantial, and continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of the firm as reflected in
ownership documents. The owner(s) must enjoy the customary incidents of ownership and
share in the risks and profits commensurate with that ownership interest.
(2) The contributions of capital or Expertise by the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner(s) to acquire the ownership interest must be real and substantial. If Expertise is relied
upon as part of a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner's contribution to acquire
ownership, the Expertise must be of the requisite quality generally recognized in a specialized
field, in areas critical to the firm's operations, indispensable to the firm's potential success,
specific to the type of work the firm performs and documented in the firm's records. The
individual whose Expertise is relied upon must have a commensurate financial investment in
the firm.
(c) Only a firm that is managed and controlled by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
person(s) may be certified as a MBE or WBE.
(1) A firm must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions that limit the customary
discretion of the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s). There can be no
restrictions through corporate charter provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any other
formal or informal devices that prevent the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner(s), without the cooperation or vote of any non-Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged person, from making any business decision of the firm, including the making
of obligations or the disbursing of funds.
(2) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the power to direct or
cause the direction of the management and policies of the firm and to make day-to-day as
well as long-term decisions on management, policy, operations and work.
(3) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) may delegate various areas of the
management or daily operations of the firm to persons who are not Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged. Such delegations of authority must be revocable, and the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must retain the power to hire and fire any
such person. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must actually exercise
control over the firm's operations, work, management and policy.
(4) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have an overall understanding
of, and managerial and technical competence, experience and Expertise, directly related to the
firm's operations and work. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must
have the ability to intelligently and critically evaluate information presented by other
participants in the firm's activities and to make independent decisions concerning the firm's
daily operations, work, management, and policymaking.
(5) If federal, state and/or local laws, regulations or statutes require the owner(s) to have a
particular license or other credential to own and/or control a certain type of firm, then the

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the required license or
credential. If state law, County ordinance or other law regulations or statute does not require
that the owner posses the license or credential, that the owner(s) lacks such license or
credential is a factor, but is not dispositive, in determining whether the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the firm.
(6) A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside employment or
other business interests that conflict with the management of the firm or prevent the owner
from devoting sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the firm to manage and control its
day to day activities.
(d) Only an independent firm may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An independent firm is one
whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another firm. Recognition of an applicant as a
separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is
independent and non-Affiliated. In determining whether an applicant is an independent Business, the CC
Director will:
(1) Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Firms in such areas as personnel, facilities,
equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.
(2) Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified Firms or persons
associated with non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's independence.
(3) Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Firms to determine whether a pattern
of exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Firm compromises the applicant's
independence.
(4) Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified Firms with
normal industry practice.
(e) An applicant shall be certified only for specific types of work in which the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and Expertise to manage and control the firm's
operations and work.
(f) The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or WBEs and nonCertified Firms. To be considered an eligible Joint Venture, at least one partner of the Joint Venture must
be a Certified Firm, with a share in the capital contribution, control, management, risks, and profits of the
Joint Venture which is equal to its ownership interest. Each Certified Firm partner must contribute
property, capital, efforts, skill and knowledge and be responsible for a distinct, clearly defined portion of
the work of the contract. Joint Ventures must have an agreement in writing specifying the terms and
conditions of the relationships between the partners and their relationship and responsibility to the
contract.
(g) In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the CC Director by rule may accept formal
certifications by other entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if the CC Director determines
that the certification standards of such entities are comparable to those of the County.
(h) The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the Office of
Contract Compliance. Failure of the firm to seek recertification by filing the necessary documentation
with the CC Director as provided by rule may result in decertification.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
(i) It is the responsibility of the Certified Firm to notify the CC Director of any change in its
circumstances affecting its continued eligibility for the Program, including decertification by another
agency. Failure to do so may result in the firm's decertification.
(j) The CC Director shall decertify a firm that does not continuously meet the eligibility criteria.
(k) Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by the
County. The challenged firm shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be
maintained.
(l) A firm that has been denied certification or recertification or has been decertified may protest
the denial or decertification as provided by rule.
(m) A firm found to be ineligible may not apply for certification for six (6) months after the
effective date of the final decision.
(n) A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for certification or a Certified Firm
as provided by rule. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the individual challenging the
eligibility of an applicant for certification or a certified form. The burden of proof shall rest with the
complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The CC Director shall be the
final arbiter of all challenges. The presumption that the challenged firm is eligible shall remain in effect
until the CC Director renders a final decision.
Sec. 34-294. Annual aspirational goals.
The Annual Aspirational Goals for the utilization of MBEs and WBEs on County Public Works
contracts and subcontracts shall be twenty-four percent for MBEs and ten (10) percent for WBEs.
Sec. 34-295. Project specific goals.
The CC Director, in consultation with the User Department, shall establish Project Specific Goals
for construction Contracts based upon the availability of at least three MBEs and three WBEs to perform
the anticipated subcontracting functions of the project and the County's utilization of MBEs and WBEs to
date.
Sec. 34-296. Counting MBE and WBE participation.
(a) The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the MBEs or WBEs own
forces shall be counted, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the MBE or WBE for the
work of the contract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the MBE or WBE (except supplies
and equipment the MBE or WBE purchases or leases from the prime Contractor or the prime Contractor's
Affiliate).
(b) The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a MBE or WBE for providing a bona
fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing bonds or
insurance specifically required for the performance of a contract, shall be counted, provided the fee is
reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(c) When a MBE or WBE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of the
total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the Joint

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
Venture's contract that is performed by the MBE or WBE with its own forces and for which it is
separately at risk, shall be counted.
(d) Only expenditures to a MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function
shall be counted. To determine whether a MBE or WBE is performing a Commercially Useful Function,
the County will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the
MBE or WBE is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing
and other relevant factors. To perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be
responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining
quality and quantity, ordering the material, installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself.
A MBE or WBE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra
participant in the contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or
WBE participation. If a MBE or WBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would
be expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful
Function. When a MBE or WBE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the
Certified Firm may present evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e) One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from a MBE or WBE
Manufacturer or Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of the fees or transportation
charges for the delivery of materials or supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the
payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and are commensurate with fees customarily
charged for similar services.
(f) If a firm ceases to be a Certified Firm for any other reason than graduation from the M/WBE
Construction Program during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of work performed under a
contract with that firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted.
(g) In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of a MBE or WBE
shall not be counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-297. Contract pre-award compliance procedures.
(a) For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all
subcontractors from which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have
been established, its achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan
shall be due at the time the bid / proposal is due.
(b) Any agreement between a Contractor and a MBE or WBE in which the Contractor requires
that the MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c) Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CC Director will
determine whether the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). In making this
determination, the Director will consider, at a minimum, the Contractor's efforts to:
(1) Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings,
advertising and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs certified in the scopes of
work of the contract. The Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and WBEs with timely,
adequate information about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract to
allow MBEs and WBEs to respond to the solicitation. The Contractor must follow up initial
solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEs.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
(2) Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to increase the
likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate,
breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBE
participation, even when the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items
with its own forces. It is the Contractor's responsibility to make a portion of the work
available to MBEs and WBEs and to select those portions of the work or material needs
consistent with the availability MBEs and WBEs to facilitate their participation.
(3) Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such negotiation
includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEs that were
contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for
the work selected for subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached with MBEs
and WBEs. The Contractor may not reject MBEs and WBEs as being unqualified without
sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities. That there may be some
additional costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEs is not in itself sufficient
reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as such costs are
reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the work of a contract with its
own organization does not relieve it of the responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all
scopes of work that could be subcontracted.
(4) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or
insurance as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.
(5) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies,
materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate.
(6) Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women community
organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government sponsored minority/women
business assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the
recruitment and placement of MBEs and WBEs.
(e) In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of other
Contractors in meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the apparent
successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably
questioned whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor could have met
the Project Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project
Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBE participation obtained by other
Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.
(f) A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the work, materials,
equipment or services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE and the agreed upon dollar value
shall be due at the time of bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(g) The CC Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the scope of
work and the letters of intent from MBEs and WBEs. The CC Director may request clarification in
writing of items listed in the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the opportunity
to augment listed participation or Good Faith Efforts.
(h) If the CC Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project Specific
Goals have been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User Department, the
CC Director and User Department shall recommend award to Procurement Officer Department.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012

(i) If the CC Director finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the CC
Director shall communicate this finding to the User Purchasing Department and recommend that the
bid/proposal be rejected. A Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest
procedures.
Sec. 34-298. Contract administration procedures.
(a) Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the Project
Specific Goals become covenants of performance by the Contractors and incorporated in the contract.
(b) The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the performance of
the contract, and detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment
submitted to the County or as otherwise directed by the County. The CC Director and the User
Department shall monitor subcontractor participation during the course of the contract. The County shall
have full and timely access to the Contractor's books and records, including without limitation payroll
records, tax returns and records and books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its
commitment to MBE and WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion
of the contract. This provision shall be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision
allowing inspection of the Contractor's records by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.
(c) The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEs
named in the Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CC Director, Procurement Officer
and the User Department. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this subdivision
and a breach of contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause
termination of the executed contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the Contractor
to contract penalties or other sanctions.
(1) All requests for changes or substitutions of a MBE or WBE Subcontractor(s) named in the
Utilization Plan shall be made to the CC Director, Procurement Officer and the User
Department in writing, and shall clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request. A
Contractor shall not substitute a MBE or WBE subcontractor or perform the work designated
for a MBE or WBE subcontractor with its own forces unless and until the CC Director,
Procurement Officer in consultation with the User Department, approves such substitution in
writing. A Contractor shall not allow a substituted subcontractor to begin work until both the
Director, Procurement Officer and the User Department have approved the substitution.
(2) The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should have been
known by either party before the submission of the Utilization Plan. Bid shopping is
prohibited. The Contractor must negotiate with the MBE or WBE subcontractor to resolve the
problem. Where there has been a mistake or disagreement about the scope of work, the MBE
or WBE can be substituted only where an agreement cannot be reached for a reasonable price
for the correct scope of work.
(3) Substitutions of the subcontractor shall be permitted only on the following bases:
(i) Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed.
(ii) Failure of performance.
(iii) Financial incapacity.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012

(iv) Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price.
(v) Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a solicitation where
agreement upon a reasonable price cannot be reached.
(vi) Failure of the subcontractor to meet insurance, licensing or bonding requirements; or
(vii) The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal.
(4) The final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed substitution, and the basis of any
denial, shall be communicated to the parties in writing by the CC Director.

Section 30-961 through Section 30-972 shall be known, and may be cited, as the Cook County
Demolition Debris Diversion Ordinance
Sec. 30-962. Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this Ordinance is to establish a program for recycling and salvaging of
construction and demolition waste consistent with the Cook County Solid Waste Plan. This
Ordinance is intended to introduce reuse and recycling requirements that will help achieve Cook County’s
goal to:
(1)

Reduce the amount of construction and demolition waste generated at the source;

(2)
Regulate the salvage and transport of salvageable construction and demolition material
and to prevent the improper disposal of construction and demolition debris within the County of
Cook; and,
(3)
Recover materials for the purpose of recycling and reuse that would otherwise be
discarded and return them to the economy.
Sec. 30-963. Findings.
(a)

The County finds and determines that:

(1)

The County is committed to protecting the public health, safety, welfare and environment
and in order to meet these commitments it is necessary that the County promote the
reduction of solid waste and reduce the stream of solid waste going to landfills.

(2)

The debris generated in construction and demolition projects accounts for a
significant portion of the materials disposed of in landfills and a large percentage of
such debris is comprised of materials particularly suitable for recycling.

(3)

The reuse and recycling of certain portions of construction and demolition debris
is essential to further the County’s efforts to reduce solid waste.

(4)

Except in unusual circumstances, it is feasible to divert an average of at least
seventy percent (70%) of all construction and demolition debris from construction and
demolition projects.

directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, for an expenditure that has been paid by the County prior to the

any action required by the provisions of Section 148(f) of the Code in order to assure compliance with
Section 709 of the Master Indenture. Nothing contained in this Ordinance shall limit the ability of the

certified copy of this Ordinance, together with all Exhibits, to IDOT and the Superintendent and the Chief
Financial Officer are authorized to provide IDOT with such additional documents or information as shall

depository or (ii) notify DTC of the availability through DTC of Bond certificates and transfer or cause

or permitted to be made by Owners of Bonds under this Master Indenture on a

Temporary Bonds

(A)
Until the definitive Bonds of any Series are prepared, the County may execute, in the
same manner as is provided in Section 303, and, upon the request of the County, the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, in lieu of definitive Bonds, but subject to the same provisions, limitations and
conditions as the definitive Bonds except as to the denominations thereof and as to exchangeability, one
or more temporary Bonds substantially of the tenor of the definitive Bonds in lieu of which such
temporary Bond or Bonds are issued, in Authorized Denominations, and with such omissions, insertions
and variations as may be appropriate to temporary Bonds. The County at its own expense shall prepare
and execute and, upon the surrender of such temporary Bonds the Trustee shall authenticate and, without
charge to the Owner thereof, deliver in exchange therefor, definitive Bonds of the same aggregate
principal amount, Series and maturity as the temporary Bonds surrendered in Authorized Denominations.
Until so exchanged, the temporary Bonds shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits and security
as definitive Bonds authenticated and issued pursuant to this Master Indenture.
(B)
The Owner of any temporary Bond or Bonds may, at its option, surrender the same to the
Trustee in exchange for another temporary Bond or Bonds of like aggregate principal amount, Series and
maturity of any Authorized Denominations, and thereupon the County shall execute and the Trustee shall
authenticate and, in exchange for the temporary Bond or Bonds so surrendered and upon payment of the
taxes, fees and charges provided for in Section 306, shall deliver a temporary Bond or Bonds of like
aggregate principal amount, Series and maturity in such other Authorized Denominations as shall be
requested by such Owner.
(C)
All temporary Bonds surrendered in exchange either for another temporary Bond or
Bonds or for a definitive Bond or Bonds shall be forthwith cancelled by the Trustee.
ARTICLE IV

REDEMPTION OF BONDS
Section 401.
Privilege of Redemption and Redemption Price. Bonds subject to redemption
prior to maturity shall be redeemable, upon notice given as provided in this Article IV, at such times, at
such Redemption Prices and upon such terms, in addition to the terms contained in Article IV, as may be
specified in the Supplemental Indenture authorizing such Series.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
Section 402.
Redemption at the Election or Direction of the County. In the case of any
redemption of Bonds at the election or direction of the County, the County shall give written notice to the
Trustee of its election or direction so to redeem, of the date fixed for redemption, of the Series, and of the
principal amounts of the Bonds of each maturity of such Series to be redeemed. Such notice shall be
given at least thirty-five (35) days prior to the specified redemption date or such shorter period as shall be
acceptable to the Trustee. In the event notice of redemption shall have been given as in Section 405
provided, there shall be paid on or prior to the specified redemption date to the Trustee an amount in cash
or Government Obligations maturing on or before the specified redemption date which; together with
other moneys, if any, available therefor held by the Trustee, will be sufficient to redeem all of the Bonds
to be redeemed on the specified redemption date at their Redemption Price plus interest accrued and
unpaid to the date fixed for redemption; such amount and moneys shall be held in a separate, segregated
account for the benefit of the Owners of the Bonds so called for redemption.
Section 403.
Redemption Otherwise Than at County’s Election or Direction. Whenever by the
terms of this Master Indenture the Trustee is required or authorized to redeem Bonds otherwise than at the
election or direction of the County, the Trustee shall select the Bonds to be redeemed, give the notice of
redemption and pay the Redemption Price thereof, plus interest accrued and unpaid to the date fixed for
redemption, in accordance with the terms of Articles IV and V to the extent applicable.
Section 404.
Selection of Bonds to Be Redeemed. Unless otherwise provided by Supplemental
Indenture, if less than all of the Bonds of like maturity of any Series shall be called for prior redemption,
the particular Bonds or portion of Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected at random by the Trustee not
more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption in such manner as the Trustee in its discretion
may deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that the portion of any Bond of a denomination of
more than the minimum Authorized Denomination for the Bonds of such Series to be redeemed shall be
in the principal amount of an Authorized Denomination for the Bonds of such Series and that, in selecting
portions of such Bonds for redemption, the Trustee shall treat each such Bond as representing that number
of Bonds of said minimum Authorized Denomination which is obtained by dividing the principal amount
of such Bond to be redeemed in part by said minimum Authorized Denomination. If all Bonds of any
Series are held in book-entry only form, the particular Bonds or portions thereof of such Series to be
redeemed shall be selected by the securities depository for such Series of Bonds in such manner as such
securities depository shall determine.
Section 405.
Notice of Redemption. When the Trustee shall receive notice from the County of
its election or direction to redeem Bonds pursuant to Section 402, and when redemption of Bonds is
authorized or required pursuant to Section 403, the Trustee shall give notice, in the name of the County,
of the redemption of such Bonds, which notice shall specify the Series and maturities of the Bonds to be
redeemed, the date fixed for redemption and the place or places where amounts due upon such date fixed
for redemption will be -payable and, if fewer than all of the Bonds of any like Series and maturity are to
be redeemed, the letters and numbers or other distinguishing marks of such Bonds so to be redeemed, and,
in the case of Bonds to be redeemed in part only, such notice shall also specify the respective portions of
the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Such notice shall further state that on such date there shall
become due and payable the Redemption Price of each Bond to be redeemed, or the Redemption Price of
the specified portions of the principal thereof in the case of Bonds to be redeemed in part only, together
with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and that from and after such date interest thereon
shall cease to accrue and be payable. The Trustee shall mail copies of such notice by first-class mail,
postage prepaid, not less than 30 (thirty) days before the date fixed for redemption, to the Owners of the
Bonds to be redeemed at their addresses as shown on the registration books of the County maintained by
the Registrar. If the Trustee mails notices of redemption as herein provided, notice shall be conclusively
presumed to have been given to all Owners.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
With respect to an optional redemption of any Bonds, unless moneys sufficient to pay the
Redemption Price of the Bonds to be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee prior to the giving
of such notice of redemption, such notice may, at the option of the County, state that said redemption
shall be conditional upon the receipt of such moneys by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for
redemption. If such moneys are not received, such notice shall be of no force and effect, the County shall
not redeem such Bonds and the Trustee shall give notice, in the same manner in which the notice of
redemption was given, that such moneys were not so received and that such Bonds will not be redeemed.
If the notice of redemption to be given in connection with an optional redemption of any Series of
Bonds is not made expressly conditional as provided in the preceding paragraph, the Trustee will not give
any such unconditional notice of redemption unless sufficient funds to pay the full Redemption Price of
such Series of Bonds to be redeemed are on deposit with the Trustee at the time such notice is given.
Section 406.
Payment of Redeemed Bonds. Notice having been given in the manner provided
in Section 405, the Bonds or portions thereof so called for redemption shall become due and payable on
the date fixed for redemption at the Redemption Price, plus interest accrued and unpaid to such date, and,
upon presentation and surrender thereof at any place specified in such notice, such Bonds, or portions
thereof, shall be paid at the Redemption Price, plus interest accrued and unpaid to such date. If there shall
be called for redemption less than all of a Bond, the County shall execute and the Trustee shall
authenticate and the appropriate Fiduciary shall deliver, upon the surrender of such Bond, without charge
to the Owner thereof, for the unredeemed balance of the principal amount of the Bond so surrendered,
fully registered Bonds of like Series and maturity in any Authorized Denominations. If, on the date fixed
for redemption, moneys for the redemption of all the Bonds or portions thereof of any like Series and
maturity to be redeemed, together with interest to such date, shall be held by the Trustee so as to be
available therefor on said date and if notice of redemption shall have been given as aforesaid, then, from
and after the date fixed for redemption, interest on the Bonds or portions thereof of such Series and
maturity so called for redemption shall cease to accrue and become payable. If said moneys shall not be
so available on the date fixed for redemption, such Bonds or portions thereof shall continue to bear
interest until paid at the same rate as they would have borne had they not been called for redemption.

on such Principal Payment Date have been satisfied. Any such amount shall be transferred promptly from
the Principal Sub-Account to the County and deposited in the Pledged Sales Tax Revenue Fund and
applied pursuant to Section 504(B) hereof; provided, however, that no amounts derived from the
investment of moneys in the Principal Sub-Account shall be so transferred but shall be retained therein.

and in the manner prescribed by Article XI.
Section 1003. Filing of Counsel’s Opinion. Each Supplemental Indenture described in Section

will be valid and binding upon the County, the Owners and the Trustee.
ARTICLE XI
AMENDMENTS
Section 1101. Mailing. Any provision in this Article for the mailing of a notice or other
information to Owners shall be fully complied with if it is mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid or
delivered only to each Owner of Bonds then Outstanding at its address, if any, appearing upon the

Section 1102. Powers of Amendment. Except for Supplemental Indentures described in Section
1001, any modification or amendment of this Master Indenture and of the rights and obligations of the
County and of the Owners of the Bonds hereunder, in any particular, may be made by a Supplemental
Indenture with the written consent given as provided in Section 1103 hereof (i) of the Owners of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Bonds Outstanding at the time such consent is given, and (ii) in case
less than all of the several Series of Bonds then outstanding are affected by the modification or
amendment, of the Owners of at least a majority in principal amount of the Bonds of each Series so
affected and Outstanding at the time such consent is given; provided, however, that if such modification
or amendment will, by its terms, not take effect so long as any Bonds of any specified like Series and
maturity remain Outstanding, the consent of the Owners of such Bonds shall not be required and such
Bonds shall not be deemed to be Outstanding for the purpose of any calculation of Outstanding Bonds
under this Section. No such modification or amendment shall permit a change in the terms of redemption
or maturity of the principal of any Outstanding Bonds, or of any installment of interest thereon or a
reduction in the principal amount or the Redemption Price thereof or in the rate of interest thereon
without the consent of the Owner of such Bond, or shall reduce the percentages or otherwise affect the
classes of Bonds the consent of the Owners of which is required to effect any such modification or
amendment, or shall change or modify any of the rights or obligations of any Fiduciary without its written
assent thereto. For the purposes of this Section, a Series shall be deemed to be affected by a modification
or amendment of this Master Indenture if the same adversely affects or diminishes the rights of the

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
Owners of Bonds of such Series. The Trustee may in its discretion determine whether or not the rights of
the Owners of Bonds of any particular Series or maturity would be adversely affected or diminished by
any such modification or amendment, and its determination shall be binding and conclusive on the
County and all Owners of the Bonds.
Consent of Owners. The County may at any time authorize the execution and delivery of a Supplemental
Indenture making a modification or amendment permitted by the provisions of Section 1102, to take
effect when and as provided in this Section. Upon the authorization of such Supplemental Indenture, a
copy thereof shall be delivered to and held by the Trustee for the inspection of the Owners. A copy of
such Supplemental Indenture (or summary thereof or reference thereto in form approved by the Trustee)
together with a request to Owners for their consent thereto in form satisfactory to the Trustee, shall be
mailed to the Owners, but failure to mail such copy and request shall not affect the validity of such
Supplemental Indenture when consented to as in this Section provided. Such Supplemental Indenture
shall not be effective unless and until, and shall take effect in accordance with its terms when (a) there
shall have been filed with the Trustee (i) the written consents of the Owners of the required principal
amount of Outstanding Bonds, and (ii) a Counsel’s Opinion stating that the execution and delivery of
such Supplemental Indenture has been duly authorized by the County in accordance with the provisions
of this Master Indenture, is authorized or permitted by this Master Indenture and, when effective, will be
valid and binding upon the County, the Owners and the Trustee, and (b) a notice shall have been mailed
as hereinafter in this Section provided. A certificate or certificates by the Trustee delivered to the County
that consents have been given by the Owners of the Bonds described in such certificate or certificates of
the Trustee shall be conclusive. Any such consent shall be binding upon the Owner of the Bonds giving
such consent and upon any subsequent Owner of such Bonds and of any Bonds issued in exchange
therefor whether or not such subsequent Owner has notice thereof; provided, however, that any consent
may be revoked by any Owner of such Bonds by filing with the Trustee, prior to the time when the
Trustee’s written statement hereafter in this Section referred to is filed, a written revocation, with proof
that such Bonds are held by the signer of such revocation. The fact that a consent has not been revoked
may be proved by a certificate of the Trustee to the effect that no revocation thereof is on file with it.
Any consent, or revocation thereof, may be delivered or filed prior to any mailing or publication required
by this Article and shall not be deemed ineffective by reason of such prior delivery or filing. Within 30
days of any date on which the consents on file with the Trustee and not theretofore revoked shall be
sufficient under this Section, the Trustee shall make and deliver to the County a written statement that the
consents of the Owners of the required principal amount of Outstanding Bonds have been filed with the
Trustee. Such written statement shall be conclusive that such consents have been so filed. Any time
thereafter notice, stating in substance that the Supplemental Indenture has been consented to by the
Owners of the required principal amount of Outstanding Bonds and will be effective as provided in this
Section, shall be given by mailing to the Owners (but failure to mail such notice or any defect therein
shall not prevent such Supplemental Indenture from becoming effective and binding). The Trustee shall
deliver to the County proof of the mailing of such notice. A record, consisting of the information required
or permitted by this Section to be delivered by or to the Trustee, shall be proof of the matters therein
stated.
Section 1103. Modifications by Unanimous Action. The Indenture and the rights and
obligations of the County and of the Owners of the Bonds thereunder may be modified or amended in any
respect by a Supplemental Indenture effecting such modification or amendment and with the consents of
the Owners of all the Bonds then Outstanding, each such consent to be accompanied by proof of the
holding at the date of such consent of the Bonds with respect to which such consent is given. Such
Supplemental Indenture shall take effect upon the filing (a) with the Trustee of (i) a copy thereof, (ii) such
consents and accompanying proofs and (iii) the Counsel’s Opinion referred to in Section 1103 and (b)
with the County of the Trustee’s written statement that the consents of the Owners of all Outstanding
Bonds have been filed with it. No mailing or publication of any Supplemental Indenture (or reference

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
thereto or summary thereof) or of any request or notice shall be required. No such modification or
amendment, however, shall change or modify any of the rights or obligations of any Fiduciary without its
written assent thereto.
Section 1104. Exclusion of Bonds. Bonds owned or held by or for the account of the County
shall not be deemed Outstanding and shall be excluded for the purpose of any calculation required by this
Article. At the time of any consent or other action taken under this Article, the County shall furnish the
Trustee a certificate of an Authorized Officer, upon which the Trustee may rely, identifying all Bonds so
to be excluded.
Section 1105. Notation on Bonds. Bonds authenticated and delivered after the effective date of
any action taken as in Article X or this Article provided may, and if the Trustee so determines shall, bear
a notation by endorsement or otherwise in form approved by the County and the Trustee as to such action,
and upon demand of the Owner of any Bond Outstanding at such effective date and presentation of its
Bond to the Trustee, suitable notation shall be made on such Bond by the Trustee as to any such action. If
the County or the Trustee shall so determine, new Bonds so modified which, in the opinion of the Trustee
and the County, conform to such action may be prepared, authenticated and delivered, and upon demand
of the Owner of any Bond then Outstanding shall be exchanged, without cost to such Owner, for such
Bond then Outstanding.
ARTICLE XII
MISCELLANEOUS
Section 1201.

Defeasance.

(A)
If the County shall pay or cause to be paid or there shall otherwise be paid to the Owners
of all Bonds the principal or Redemption Price, if applicable, and interest due or to become due thereon,
at the times and in the manner stipulated therein and in this Master Indenture, then the pledge of any
Pledged Sales Tax Revenues and other moneys and securities pledged under this Master Indenture and all
covenants, agreements and other obligations of the County to the Owners shall thereupon be discharged
and satisfied. In such event, the Trustee, upon request of the County, shall provide an accounting of the
assets managed by the Trustee to be prepared and filed with the County for any year or part thereof
requested, and shall execute and deliver to the County all such instruments as may be desirable to
evidence such discharge and satisfaction, and the Fiduciaries shall pay over or deliver to the County all
moneys and securities held by them pursuant to this Master Indenture which are not required for the
payment of Bonds not previously surrendered for such payment or redemption. If the County shall pay or
cause to be paid, or there shall otherwise be paid, to the Owners of all Outstanding Bonds of a particular
Series, maturity within a Series or portion of any maturity within a Series (which portion shall be selected
by lot by the Trustee in the manner provided in Section 404 hereof for the selection of Bonds to be
redeemed in part), the principal or Redemption Price, if applicable, thereof and interest due or to become
due thereon, at the times and in the manner stipulated therein and in this Master Indenture, such Bonds

agreements and obligations of the County to the Owners of such Bonds and to the Trustee shall thereupon
be discharged and satisfied.
(B)
Bonds or interest installments for the payment or redemption of which moneys shall have
been set aside and held in trust by the Escrow Agent at or prior to their maturity or redemption date shall
be deemed to have been paid within the meaning of and with the effect expressed in this Section 1201 if
the County shall have delivered to or deposited with the Escrow Agent (a) irrevocable instructions to pay

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
or redeem all of said Bonds in specified amounts no less than the respective amounts of, and on specified
dates no later than the respective due dates of, their principal, (b) irrevocable instructions to publish or
mail the required notice of redemption of any Bonds so to be redeemed, (c) either moneys in an amount
which shall be sufficient, or Defeasance Obligations the principal of and the interest on which when due
will provide moneys which, together with the moneys, if any, deposited with the Trustee at the same time,
shall be sufficient, to pay when due the principal or Redemption Price, if applicable, and interest due and
to become due on said Bonds on and prior to each specified redemption date or maturity date thereof, as
the case may be, and (d) if any of said Bonds are not to be redeemed within the next succeeding 60 days,

the Trustee and that said Bonds are deemed to have been paid in accordance with this Section and stating
the maturity or redemption date upon which moneys are to be available for the payment of the principal or
Redemption Price, if applicable, of said Bonds. The Defeasance Obligations and moneys deposited with
the Trustee pursuant to this Section shall be held in trust for the payment of the principal or Redemption
Price, if applicable, and interest on said Bonds. No payments of principal of any such Defeasance
Obligations or interest thereon shall be withdrawn or used for any purpose other than the payment of such
principal or Redemption Price of, or interest on, said Bonds unless after such withdrawal the amount held
by the Trustee and interest to accrue on Defeasance Obligations so held shall be sufficient to provide fully
for the payment of the principal of or Redemption Price and interest on such Bonds, at maturity or upon
redemption, as the case may be.
(C)
Amounts deposited with the Trustee for the payment of the principal of and interest on
any Bonds deemed to be paid pursuant to this Section 1201, if so directed by the County, shall be applied
by the Trustee to the purchase of such Bonds in accordance with this subsection. Bonds for which a
redemption date has been established may be purchased on or prior to the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding
the redemption date. The principal amount of Bonds to be redeemed shall be reduced by the principal
amount of Bonds so purchased. Bonds which mature on a single future date may be purchased at any
time prior to the maturity date. All such purchases shall be made at prices not exceeding the applicable
principal amount or Redemption Price established pursuant to paragraph (B) of this Section 1201, plus
accrued interest, and such purchases shall be made in such manner as the Trustee shall determine. No
purchase shall be made by the Trustee pursuant to this subsection if such purchase would result in the
Trustee holding less than the moneys and Defeasance Obligations required to be held for the payment of
all other Bonds deemed to be paid pursuant to this Section 1201.
(D)
The County may purchase with any available funds any Bonds deemed to be paid
pursuant to this Section 1201 in accordance with this subsection. Bonds for which a redemption date has
been established may be purchased by the County on or prior to the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the
redemption date. On or prior to the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the redemption date the County shall
give notice to the Trustee of its intention to surrender such Bonds on the redemption date. The Trustee
shall proceed to call for redemption the remainder of the Bonds due on the redemption date and shall pay
to the County on the redemption date the Redemption Price of and interest on such Bonds upon surrender
of such Bonds to the Trustee. Bonds which mature on a single future date may be purchased at any time
prior to the maturity date. The Trustee shall pay to the County the principal amount of and interest on
such Bonds upon surrender of such Bonds on the maturity date.
(E)
Any time after any Bonds are deemed to be paid pursuant to this Section 1201, the
County shall not at any time permit any of the proceeds of the Bonds or any other funds of the County to
be used directly or indirectly to acquire any securities or obligations the acquisition of which would cause
any Bond to be an “arbitrage bond” as defined in the Code and Regulations.
(F)
Each Fiduciary shall continue to be entitled to reasonable compensation for all services
rendered under this Master Indenture, notwithstanding that any Bonds are deemed to be paid pursuant to
this Section 1201.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
(G)
Anything in this Master Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, any moneys held by a
Fiduciary in trust for the payment and discharge of any of the Bonds which remain unclaimed for two
years after the date when such Bonds have become due and payable, either at their stated maturity dates
or by call for earlier redemption, if such moneys were held by the Fiduciary at such date, or for two years
after the date of deposit of such moneys if deposited with the Fiduciary after the said date when such
Bonds become due and payable, shall, at the written request of the County, be repaid by the Fiduciary to
the County, as its absolute property and free from trust, and the Fiduciary shall thereupon be released and
discharged with respect thereto and the Owners of such Bonds shall look only to the County for the
payment of such Bonds.

Indenture may require or permit to be signed and executed by the Owners may be in one or more
instruments of similar tenor, and shall be signed or executed by such Owners in person or by their
attorneys appointed in writing. Proof of (i) the execution of any such instrument, or of an instrument
appointing any such attorney, or (ii) the holding by any Person of the Bonds shall be sufficient for any
purpose of this Master Indenture (except as otherwise herein expressly provided) if made in the following
manner, or in any other manner satisfactory to the Trustee, which may nevertheless in its discretion
require further or other proof in cases where it deems the same desirable:
(1)

The fact and date of the execution by any Owner or its attorney of such instruments may
be proved by a guarantee of the signature thereon by a bank, national banking association
or trust company or by the certificate of any notary public or other officer authorized to
take acknowledgments of deeds, that the Person signing such request or other instruments
acknowledged to that Person the execution thereof, or by an affidavit of witness of such
execution, duly sworn to before such notary public or other officer. Where such
execution is by an officer of a corporation or association or a member of a partnership, on
behalf of such corporation, association or partnership, such signature guarantee,
certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of authority.

(2)

The ownership of Bonds and the amount, numbers and other identification and date of
holding the same shall be proved by the registration book maintained by the Registrar.

(B)
Any request or consent by the Owner of any Bond shall bind all future Owners of such
Bond in respect of anything done or suffered to be done by the County or any Fiduciary in accordance
therewith.
Section 1203. Moneys Held for Particular Bonds. The amounts held by any Fiduciary for the
payment of interest, principal or Redemption Price due on any date with respect to particular Bonds shall,
on and after such date and pending such payment, be set aside on its books and held in trust by it for the
Owners of the Bonds entitled thereto.
Section 1204. Preservation and Inspection of Documents. All documents received by any
Fiduciary under the provisions of this Master Indenture, shall be retained in its possession and shall be

before maturity, and all mutilated Bonds surrendered pursuant to Section 307, shall be delivered to the
Trustee when such payment or redemption is made or upon surrender, as the case may be, and such

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
Bonds, together with all Bonds purchased by the Trustee, shall thereupon be promptly cancelled. Bonds
so cancelled may at any time be destroyed by the Trustee, who shall execute a certificate of destruction in
duplicate by the signature of one of its authorized officers describing the Bonds so destroyed, and one
executed certificate shall be delivered to the County and the other retained by the Trustee.
Section 1206. Parties Interested Herein. Nothing in this Master Indenture expressed or implied
is intended or shall be construed to confer upon, or to give to, any Person, other than the County, the
Fiduciaries and the Owners of the Bonds, any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Master
Indenture or any covenant, condition or stipulation thereof; and all the covenants, stipulations, promises
and agreements in this Master Indenture contained by and on behalf of the County shall be for the sole
and exclusive benefit of the County, the Fiduciaries and the Owners of the Bonds.

interest on the Bonds or for any claim based thereon or on this Master Indenture against any past, present
or future member, director, officer, employee or agent of the County, or any successor, public body or any

Resolution prepared by the Department of Highways to vacate an unimproved parcel of Flavin Road
(104th Avenue), located at the intersection of Flavin Road at 95th Street, in unincorporated Palos
Township, Cook County, Illinois.
A strip of land was dedicated to the County of Cook for highway purposes along a route known as Flavin
Road, north of 95th Street, and recorded on October 24, 1923. The curved portion of Flavin Road at the
northeast corner of 95th Street and Flavin Road is not improved and that is part of said dedication but is no
longer needed for highway purposes. There is no physical road on said parcel nor are there any
discussions for a future improvement that would include said parcel. The adjacent property owner has
requested that the County of Cook vacate said parcel; and, because said parcel was dedicated in lieu of a
purchase, the vacated parcel shall revert to the adjacent property owner at no cost to the property owner.
It is therefore respectfully requested that, should your Honorable Body concur in this recommendation,
the Resolution be adopted and executed and that the three (3) certified originals be forwarded to the
Illinois Department of Transportation, Division of Highways, for approval.

To the extent and as required by "An Act regulating wages of laborers, mechanics and
other workers employed in any public works by the State, county, city or any public body
or any political subdivision or by any one under contract for public works," approved
June 26, 1941, as amended, the general prevailing rate of wages in this locality for
laborers, mechanics and other workers engaged in the construction of public works
coming under the jurisdiction of this County is hereby ascertained to be the same as the
prevailing rate of wages for construction work in the Cook County area as determined by
the Department of Labor of the State of Illinois as of June 2012, a copy of that
determination being submitted hereto and incorporated herein by reference. As required
by said Act, any and all revisions of the prevailing rate of wages by the Department of
Labor of the State of Illinois shall supersede the Department's June determination and
apply to any and all public works construction undertaken by the County of Cook. The
Definition of any terms appearing in this Ordinance which are also used in aforesaid Act
shall be the same as in said Act.

Section 2.

Nothing herein contained shall be construed to apply said general prevailing rate of
wages as herein ascertained to any work or employment except public works construction
of this County to the extent required by the aforesaid Act.

Section 3.

The Bureau of Human Resources shall publicly post or keep available for inspection by
any interested party in the main office of this Bureau of Human Resources (County) this
determination or any revisions of such prevailing rate of wage. A copy of this
determination or of the current revised determination of prevailing rate of wages then in
effect shall be attached to all contract specifications.

Section 4.

The Clerk shall mail a copy of this determination to any employer, and to any association
of employers and to any person or association of employees who have filed their names
and addresses, requesting copies of any determination stating the particular rates and the
particular class of workers whose wages will be affected by such rates.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
Section 5.

The Bureau of Human Resources shall promptly file a certified copy of this Ordinance
with both the Secretary of State Index Division and the Department of Labor of the State
of Illinois.

Section 6.

The Bureau of Human Resources shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general
circulation within the area a copy of this Ordinance, and such publication shall constitute
notice that the determination is effective and that this is the determination of this public
body.

Section 7.

The Chief Procurement Officer of Cook County shall specify in the call for bids in any
contract for public works that the general prevailing rate of wages in the locality for each
craft or type of laborer or mechanic needed to execute the contract to perform such work,
also the general prevailing rate for legal holiday and overtime work as ascertained by the
Bureau of Human Resources, shall be paid for each craft or type of work needed to
execute the contract or to perform such work. The Chief Procurement Officer in
awarding the contract shall cause to be inserted in the contract a stipulation to the effect
that not less than the prevailing rate of wages, as found by the Bureau of Human
Resources, shall be paid to all laborers, workers and mechanics performing work under
the contract, and the Chief Procurement Officer shall also require in all such contractor's
bonds that the contract include such provision as will guarantee the faithful performance
of such prevailing wage clause as provided by the contract.

Section 8.

In the case of any underpayment of the prevailing wage, a penalty of 20% of the
underpayment shall be assessed against the contractor or subcontractor; and the 20%
penalty shall be payable to the Illinois Department of Labor. Any underpayment that has
not been repaid to a worker within thirty-days of violation is subject to an additional 2%
of the underpayment as a punitive damage assessment. This is payable to the worker.

Section 9.

There is an automatic two (2) year debarment of any contractor or subcontractor found to
have violated the Act on two (2) separate occasions. An affected contractor or
subcontractor may request the Department to hold a hearing on the alleged violations
within ten (10) days notification of the second violation.

RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE TONI PRECKWINKLE
PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
WHEREAS, the County of Cook (the County) is an entitlement community pursuant to the regulations of
the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) at 24 CFR Part 92 and the Community
Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) at 24 CFR Part 570, which entitles the County to receive an
annual allocation of CDBG and HOME grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD); and
WHEREAS, the amount of CDBG and HOME funds that the County receives pursuant to entitlement
status is determined by a HUD formula that takes into consideration the populations of the municipalities
within its jurisdiction; and
WHEREAS, certain municipalities (the Electing Municipalities) within the County that receive
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds directly from HUD can elect to join the County’s
HOME Consortium (the Consortium), which would allow HUD to take into account the populations of
these municipalities when calculating the County’s annual HOME funds entitlement grant, thus
increasing the County’s annual allocation; and
WHEREAS, the Electing Municipalities are choosing to join the Consortium, as signified by resolution
of their municipal boards; and
WHEREAS, each Electing Municipality must conform to the Consortium Program Year, which runs
October 1 through September 30 in accordance with HUD rules; and
WHEREAS, as the Electing Municipalities move to the Consortium Program Year they may experience
a gap in their administrative funding for the few months after their old program year expires and before
the Consortium Program Year begins. (i.e., if their current program year ends on June 30 there is a three
month gap before the new program year starts on October 1); and
WHEREAS, the County wants to maximize its federal allocation of HOME Funds by including the
Electing Municipalities in the Consortium. The County’s HOME Investment Partnerships Program could
see up to a $938,000.00 increase over two years by adding the populations of the Electing Municipalities
into the formula for calculating the grant amount.; and
WHEREAS, to facilitate the addition of the Electing Municipalities to the Consortium, the County will
provide the financing for the loss in administrative funding and any social service funding that is needed
to align the program years in each Electing Municipality; and
WHEREAS, HUD requires that the Cook County Board of Commissioners act by resolution to add the
new entitlement communities into the HOME Consortium.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and the Board of Commissioners of the
County of Cook, Illinois:
Section 1:

That the County will set aside a fund of no more than $439,575.43 in non-federal dollars
to be used to fund the administrative costs incurred by the Electing Municipalities for
periods not funded, within a three year period, due to the alignment of the program years
of the Electing Municipalities with the Consortium Program Year in accordance with
HUD requirements.

Section 2:

That the County be and is hereby authorized to enter into an Addendum to the HOME
Investment Partnerships Program Consortium Agreement for Federal Fiscal Years 2013
and 2014 to add the Electing Municipalities and that the President, Bureau Chief of
Economic Development or the County Clerk are hereby authorized to execute said
HOME Investment Partnerships Program Consortium Agreement Addendum and any
modifications thereto.

Section 3:

That this Resolution shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and

REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT DIVISION
INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT AMENDMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 15, 2012 from
ANNA ASHCRAFT, Director, Real Estate Management Division
respectfully requesting approval of a First Amendment to Intergovernmental Agreement between the
County of Cook and the Forest Preserve District of Cook County.
By Resolution 09-R-498, this Board authorized conveyance of land adjacent to the Oak Forest Health
Center Campus to the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (the “District”), and a joint planning
initiative for the purpose of preserving and memorializing the history of the County’s ownership of the
land, and providing for cooperation in the development of the preserve in harmony with the continued use
of the Oak Forest Health Center Campus (the “Campus”).
On July 12, 2011, this Board authorized an Intergovernmental Agreement (the “IGA”) between Cook
County and the District to implement this joint planning initiative. Pursuant to the IGA, a consultant was
retained to develop a Master Plan. This Amendment provides for phase 1 of the implementation of the
Master Plan. Actions authorized are as follows:

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2012
1.

The new preserve (the “Oak Forest Heritage Preserve”) will be accessed through the main
entrance to the Oak Forest Health Center. The District will be permitted to place signage directing
visitors to the Preserve, at locations to be agreed upon by the Cook County Real Estate
Management Division in conjunction with the Cook County Health and Hospitals System
(“CCHHS”).

2.

An area for parking on the Campus for District patrons will be agreed upon in conjunction with
CCHHS. This parking may be temporary, depending upon the location of a future visitors’ center
and the needs of the Health Center.

3.

CCHHS will refrain from mowing certain areas of the Campus during the remainder of 2012 and
during 2013, as necessary, in order to allow regeneration of existing seed banks. If the District
determines that an oak savannah ecosystem will likely regenerate in such areas, the parties will
negotiate an agreement or arrangement for development of such ecosystem.

4.

In conjunction with CCHHS, the Real Estate Management Division and the District will work
cooperatively to identify a structure or an area in a structure on the Campus for use as a visitor’s
center, and to develop a plan for appropriate funding and staffing.

5.

The Real Estate Management Division will continue to work with the District and CCHHS on
phase 2 of the Master Plan planning process.

Fiscal Impact: None
This Agreement is being submitted simultaneously to the Cook County Health and Hospitals System
Board and for approval by the Forest Preserve District Board of Commissioners at the next available
