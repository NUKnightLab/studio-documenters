The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

3301 S. Indiana
(Pilgrim Baptist Church – 3rd Ward)
Proposal:

Phase 1: Proposed partial reconstruction of church severely damaged by fire,
including a new roof, an exposed steel frame for the upper roof, and temporary
enclosing of masonry openings.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The applicant shall include side-by-side comparison exhibits with the
HABS drawings and proposed elevations and roof plans in the permit
submittal showing that the exposed roof structure form and size matches
the historic dimensions;
2. A report by a licensed structural engineer addressing the proposed
structural work relative to how the building should be braced and protected
during construction shall be submitted for Historic Preservation staff
review and approval as part of the permit plans. The recommended
measures, sequencing and protections shall be incorporated into the
structural and architectural drawings;
3. The proposed metal panels system on the east (rear) elevation shall have a
dark gray non-reflective finish in order to avoid distracting from the
historic materials;
4. Any cleaning methods for the historic masonry shall be the gentlest
possible, and shall be non-abrasive. Cleaning products and methods shall
be reviewed and approved by Historic Preservation staff prior to order and
application;
5. The applicant shall provide a sample of the exposed steel finish/color as
well as any samples of masonry replacement units and mortar color for
Historic Preservation staff review and approval. All samples shall match
historic in profile, color, size and type;

 6. Location of light fixtures and fixture cut-sheets shall be submitted in the
permit plans for Historic Preservation staff review and approval; and,
7. The project shall return to the PRC prior to applying for building permits
for future phases.
2.

319 W. Concord
(Old Town Triangle District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed rehabilitation of single-family residence including construction of a
new foundation, new 2-story rear addition with basement and rear masonry
garage.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. Report and drawings by a licensed structural engineer addressing how the
historic facades and roof should be supported, braced and protected, in-situ,
during the demolition of the exterior portions of the building and the
interior structure and the excavation and construction of the new addition
as well as during the foundation work, shall be included on the permit
plans. The report should include recommended measures and sequencing
plan;
2. As proposed, non-historic siding shall be removed from all elevations of
the existing building. Upon removal of the non-historic siding, Historic
Preservation staff shall inspect and confirm whether any historic wood
siding remains at the north (front) and east facades. Historic siding shall be
retained and be repaired, if possible. Areas beyond repair may be replaced
with new wood siding to match the historic siding in size and profile.
Fiber-cement siding, as submitted, may be used as a substitute cladding
material on the west elevation of the existing building and all elevations of
the existing and proposed additions. This siding shall have a smooth finish
and otherwise match the wood siding in size and profile. Details and
material samples of the existing and proposed siding shall be reviewed and
approved by Historic Preservation staff as part of the permit application;
3. The second-floor window openings at the front façade shall be restored to
match the historic opening sizes based on the physical evidence uncovered
at the building. The existing two-over-two wood windows may be replaced
with new two-over-two wood or clad-wood windows. The new windows
may be true-divided lite or simulated-divided lite windows matching the
exterior profiles of the existing wood windows. Details of the existing and
proposed windows shall be included with the permit plans;
4. Details of new trim and window surrounds at front façade shall be based on
any physical evidence that may be uncovered after the removal of nonhistoric siding. Should no evidence be found, the design of these elements
may be based on similar historic properties in the district. Details of the
trim and window surrounds shall be included on the permit plans;
5. As proposed, the existing 1st floor masonry shall be repointed and repainted. Staff encourages the applicant to consider removing the paint and
leaving the brick exposed to be more consistent with the historic
appearance of the building. Should any replacement of brick be required,

 the replacement brick shall match the historic in size, color, texture and
finish. Pointing mortar shall match original in type, color and joint profile;
6. As proposed, the existing dormers on the west side of the existing roof
shall be removed to restore the historic roofline of the building; and,
7. Any structural repair work proposed to the existing roof to remain shall
maintain the existing ridge and eave heights and roof slopes (i.e., by
aligning the top of any new structural member with the top of the existing
structural member).
In addition, the Committee found that the amount of demolition involved with
the project, based upon the submitted information, does not trigger the
requirements of Section 2-120-825 governing the demolition of 40% or more
of landmark buildings.
3.

1238 N. Hoyne
(Wicker Park District – 32nd Ward)
Proposal:

detached rear 3-car garage with a roof deck.

Historic Preservation staff review and approval prior to permit submittal.
The brick and stone colors and textures shall match typical colors and
textures found within the district, and mortar shall match the color of the
face brick; and,
2. Proposed window details shall be submitted with the permit plans.

4.
