item.
2. Administrative Report
a. Duty Disability Notification Plan
The Executive Director provided the Board with an update about the administrative matters
of the Fund. Nickol Hackett reported the general process that the Fund follows so that
members are made aware of the need to file disability applications while their disability
exists as required by the Pension Code. The Fund provides this information on its website
and at least once a year in its newsletters. Gary LeDonne further described how the Fund has
worked with the Cook County Department of Risk Management to notify members about the
need to file an application for duty disability benefits with the Fund. The Fund has some
access to Risk Management’s Workers’ Compensation records and can identify those
members who have submitted claims under the Illinois Workers’ Compensation Act
(“IWCA”) so long as the claimants are properly identified by Risk Management.
The Trustees discussed whether the Fund staff should send letters to the members who have
filed claims under the IWCA to notify them of the need to file application for duty disability
benefits while their disability still exists. The letters could be sent as a courtesy to the
members, even though the Fund has no obligation to inform them of their benefits under the
Pension Code. It was agreed that the Fund staff would develop a procedure for notifying
those members who have filed a claim under the IWCA of their rights to duty disability
benefits and of the need to file applications for such benefits with the Fund.
b. Education Approval
Ms. Hackett then stated that the Fund, as a current investor in a Blackstone Alternative Asset
Management vehicle, was invited to attend its 2013 Annual Hedge Fund Conference at which
due diligence and advisory issues would be addressed. She added that it would be in the
interest of the Fund to send a representative to the conference so that the Board can be
advised about developments related to this asset class.
It was then moved by Trustee Samstein and seconded by Trustee Richardson, Jr. that the
expenses, including any associated travel expenses, incurred by the Executive Director in

County Employees’ and Officers’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Cook County

 attending the 2013 Blackstone Alternative Asset Management Annual Investor Conference in
New York City, New York, on Oct 17, 2013 be approved provided that any reimbursement
shall be in and for amounts consistent with the Fund’s Travel Expense Reimbursement
Policy.

c. Election Update
Paul Rzeszutko provided an update about the election for trustees to the Board. He reported
that five members filed petitions to be candidates for the County Employee position. All of
the members who filed petitions met the requirements for candidacy and will appear on the
ballot. The candidates are: Alexis Herrera, Thomas Iacovetti, David M. Feller, Paul Bonilla
and Michele Coleman. Mr. Rzeszutko stated that all of the candidates have prepared
statements that are posted on the Fund’s website. The ballots have been ordered and the
election for the County Employee position on the Board will proceed on October 30, 2013.
There was only one petition filed for the position of County Annuitant member and one
petition filed for the position of Forest Preserve Annuitant member. Those petitions were
filed by John E. Fitzgerald and Robert Janura, respectively. Because the elections for those
positions are uncontested, no election is necessary under the Fund’s rules. Instead, the
Independent Election Administrator will declare Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Janura the successful
candidates for these positions.
3. Legal Report
a. Request for Hearing Officer – Laurie Brennan
Margaret M. Fahrenbach provided a report to the Board regarding legal matters. Because the
matters were not confidential, there was no need to request a closed session pursuant to
Section 2(c)(11) of the Open Meetings Act. Ms. Fahrenbach reported that Ms. Laurie
Brennan had requested an administrative hearing because the Board found that she was not
eligible for the ordinary disability benefits she requested. The Board had found that she was
not eligible for benefits because the County Physician could not make a determination that
Ms. Brennan was disabled and recommended that the member be referred for an Independent
Medical Examination (“IME”).
The Board discussed the process for referring members for IMEs and considered how to best
proceed under these circumstances. They also discussed whether they needed to both appoint
a hearing officer and approve the referral of Ms. Brennan for an IME. The Fund staff
advised the Board that the recommendation by the County Physician that a member be

p. 4

 referred for an IME was not common, but expected that such recommendations would
increase in the future.
It was then moved by Trustee Lewandowski and seconded by Trustee Samstein that Ms.
Brennan be referred for an IME. It was further moved that Retired Judge Michael C. Close be
appointed to serve as the hearing officer for the administrative hearing requested by Ms.
Brennan if following the IME, there was no determination that she was disabled.

Ms. Fahrenbach also reported that a settlement agreement had been very recently reached in
the litigation brought by Latoya Hayward concerning the right to benefits under the
Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act. The settlement agreement will
presented for the Board’s approval at the November meeting. Fund staff also reported that
the Military Service Policy is expected to be completed and will be presented to the Board at
that time for consideration.
4. Finance Report
a. Fourth Quarter Cash Flow Report
Michael Maratea reported on the cash flow requirements of both the County Fund and the
Forest Preserve Fund to cover projected expenses through December 31, 2013. He reported
on the current cash balances and on the projected shortfalls for each of the Funds. Mr.
Maratea stated that the County Fund needed to withdraw cash in an aggregate amount not to
exceed $110 million dollars and that the Forest Fund needed to withdraw an aggregate
amount not to exceed $3.5 million dollars for projected expenses through December 31,
2013. No trustee raised any objection to the proposed withdrawals for either the County
Fund or the Forest Preserve Fund.
On the motion of Trustee Lewandowski, which was duly seconded, it was moved to allow
the prior fully affirmative roll call vote to stand for purposes of this item.
Vote Result:

MOTION ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY BY VOICE VOTE

5. Health Benefits Report
a. Consideration of September 26, 2013 Health Benefits Committee Recommendations
The Trustees then discussed the recommendations made by the Health Benefits Committee at
their special meeting on September 26, 2013, relating to the tiered subsidy schedule for

p. 5

 health benefits as previously considered by the Board. The Trustees discussed the
recommendation of the Health Benefits Committee that further analysis and evaluation was
needed before implementing the tiered subsidy structure.
It was then moved by Trustee Janura and seconded by Trustee Goode that the Board adopt
the recommendation made by the Committee at the special meeting on September 26, 2013,
to approve a revised target date of January 1, 2015, for implementation of a service-based
subsidy schedule, subject to a satisfactory completion and review of feasibility and impact
determinations as requested by the Committee.
Vote Result:

MOTION ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY BY VOICE VOTE

b. Open Enrollment
Brenda Deming provided an update about Open Enrollment for health benefits. She stated
that at the Open Enrollment meeting scheduled for November 1, 2013, various venders will
offer preventive and health awareness activities. The Fund staff will also be available for
consultation regarding health benefit and retirement issues. Members will also receive
mailings about the Open Enrollment process, including a notice about transferring HMO
Classic participants to the HMO Advantage plan, with the option to re-enroll in the HMO
Classic plan if the member chooses to do so.
6. Actuary Authorization
a. Authorization to Engage Actuary for Experience Study
Nickol Hackett presented to the Board the request from Buck Consultants, the Fund’s
actuary, that it conduct an experience review for both the County Fund and the Forest Fund
for the December 31, 2013 actuarial valuations based upon the four year period from January
1, 2009, through December 31, 2012. The Board discussed the need for the experience
review and agreed that the request was reasonable.
b. Authorization to Engage Actuary for Health Benefits Special Projects
Nickol Hackett proposed, and as is consistent the recommendation from the Health Benefits
Committee that further analysis and evaluation was needed before implementing a tiered
subsidy structure, that Buck Consultants be retained to evaluate the impact of the proposed
changes at a cost not to exceed $40,000. She added that this amount was allocated in the
2013 budget for actuarial services for special projects.
It was then moved by Trustee Lewandowski and seconded by Trustee Janura, that Buck
Consultants should perform an experience review for the County Fund and the Forest Fund
based upon the four year period from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2012. It was
further moved that Buck Consultants be retained at a cost not to exceed $40,000, to evaluate
the impact of implementing a tiered subsidy structure for health benefits.

7. Old Business/New Business
Trustee Janura then asked if there was any report regarding action by the General Assembly
concerning pension reform issues. The trustees discussed the commonly held expectation that
changes to the state funds would be enacted first and that similar changes to the local funds would
follow. The trustees further discussed the duties owed by both the General Assembly and Cook
County to the Fund and how the Fund should proceed in the current environment. It was noted that
at the present time, there was no expectation that pension reform will be enacted in the General
Assembly’s veto session in October, 2013.
Mary Pat Burns stated that it would be beneficial to the Board to conduct a general review of
litigation that is pending in various jurisdictions concerning both the funding of public pension funds
and unauthorized payments made by public funds. She proposed that such a review would provide
guidance to the Board about how to address these issues.
There being no further business before the Board, the meeting was adjourned.
The next Board meeting is scheduled for November 7, 2013, at 9:30 a.m.
