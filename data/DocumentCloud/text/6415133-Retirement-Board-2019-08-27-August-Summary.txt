MONTHLY NEWS AND INFORMATION FROM YOUR RETIREMENT BOARD

NEW TRUSTEES
I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Retirement Board and the FABF membership, to
welcome the Fund’s newest Trustees: City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin and City Comptroller
Reshma Soni.
City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin, previously served as a State Representative in the Illinois
House of Representatives and holds a bachelor’s degree in finance and an MBA, while City
Comptroller Reshma Soni, previously worked as the Chief Financial Officer for the Department of
Aviation, and has a master’s degree in accounting and a bachelor’s degree in economics.
They are both excellent additions to the Retirement Board. We look forward to their insights and
participation in the coming years.
HEALTHCARE SUBSIDY
On August 7, 2019, the Fund sent notices to certain annuitants regarding their potential eligibility for
the statutory health insurance premium subsidy for periods after December 31, 2016, stemming from
the Underwood v. City of Chicago litigation. As a reminder, in order to qualify for the health
insurance premium subsidy payments for the period between January 1, 2017 and December 31,
2018, you must complete and return the “Health Insurance Subsidy Eligibility Form” that was
enclosed with the notice. The Fund will be unable to process your subsidy payment until it has
received and accepted the completed “Health Insurance Subsidy Eligibility Form”. If you do not return
a completed Form by December 31, 2020, the Fund will assume that you have declined the health
insurance subsidy. If you have any questions about the notice or the “Health Insurance Subsidy
Eligibility Form”, please call the Fund at 312-726-5823.

Fund Secretary,

Captain Anthony Martin

 FABF members,
I am concerned that the City of Chicago will attempt to mirror budgeting and legal maneuvering
by other municipalities to temporarily reduce the 3% COLA granted to retirees. My concern
increased substantially after the Fund’s legal counsel advised the Board of the Rhode Island
Supreme Court case involving the suspension of cost of living adjustments. After reading and
following the fact summary in the case, I share the fund attorney’s recognition of the significance
of this legal decision. Below I will try to give a brief summary of the case followed by some
quotes from the court opinion that I think are relevant. Please note, the Pension Board administers
the Fund based on the pension code. It is not the Pension Board’s role to obtain benefits for the
members. When securing new benefits, it has been my consistent view that a funding source needs
to be identified and providing adequate resources at the same time the fund is providing the new
benefit. Otherwise, it is my opinion, the pension fund risks failing for all members, not just a
particular class of the membership.
Rhode Island Supreme Court Case Summary
In the 1990’s Cranston Mayor met with police and firefighter union leaders in an attempt to
address the poor financial condition of the pension fund. In 1996, the City passed two ordinances
based on an agreement reached with unions, creating a two-tiered pension system. Additionally,
the ordinance provides a minimum 3% compounded COLA to match the benefits offered under
the state’s pension plan.
The fiscal issues of the pension plan did not subside with the passage of the 1996 ordinances and
the City’s pension liability remained an issue throughout the early 2000s. When a new mayor took
office in 2009, the City was in a “dire” fiscal condition. In order to improve its financial situation,
the City made cuts to personnel, eliminated city vehicles, and increased health care co-shares for
its employees.
In 2011, the General Assembly passed the Rhode Island Retirement Security Act (RIRSA). The
act established that a pension fund that had a funding ratio under 60% would be considered in
“critical status”. The act also required municipalities with pension plans in critical status to devise
and submit a funding improvement plan detailing the municipality’s strategy for emerging from
critical status within 20 years, or else face losing a portion of state aid.
In 2012, the Cranston pension fund was funded at only 16.9%, meeting the definition for critical
status. The City put together an ‘alternative funding improvement plan’, consistent with RIRSA.
The plan included raising taxes, cutting more personnel, eliminating city services and a 10-year
COLA suspension for retirees. The mayor presented the COLA suspension plan to the City
Council in two proposed ordinances in October 2012.
The mayor withdrew the COLA suspension ordinances in favor of negotiating with the plan
participants through the fire and police unions. Ultimately, however, the City enacted the
ordinances in April 2013 which suspended the minimum 3% COLA for ten years, beginning in
July 2013.
The Cranston Police Department Retirees Association filed suit against the City alleging the
ordinances violated the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions. The parties reached a
settlement agreement in December 2013 calling for a COLA suspension in alternating years for
ten years, and a 1.5% COLA payment in years 11 and 12. Each retiree was given the opportunity
to opt out of the settlement agreement and to retain the right to pursue civil claims against the
City. The members of CPRAC (Cranston Police Retirees Action Committee) are

 retirees enrolled in the City’s pension system who opted out of the settlement agreement and
initiated a lawsuit against the City. Sixteen witnesses testified over the course of five days. The
following is a summary of the testimony:
The President of CPRAC testified that there were approximately 75 members. The members
consistently testified that they believed that they would receive the COLAs for life, and that the
suspension of the COLA benefit had a significant financial impact on their lives. The CBAs
(collective bargaining agreements) were admitted as exhibits and each CBA provided for COLAs
to the pension benefits at a rate of at least 3%. The plaintiffs called in an expert witness, an actuary,
whose analysis concluded the COLA suspension caused an average loss of $210,000 per retiree.
The actuary went on to testify that the City’s pension problems were foreseeable and
predictable, and that the City had not chosen the least drastic remedy available when it chose to
suspend the COLAs.
Cranston’s mayor testified that he felt if the City did not address the financial crisis, Chapter 9
bankruptcy “could be a very real possibility”. The mayor also testified that in addition to the
COLA suspension, the City implemented wage freezes, layoffs of City employees, tax increases,
health care co-share increases, and expense reduction, in order to raise revenue during its financial
crisis.
The finance director for the City testified that raising taxes on the City’s residents would not
resolve the pension system’s problems because the City would need to raise taxes so substantially
that it would have been unfair and unsustainable, considering the fact the City already had one of
the highest tax rates in the state.
In July 2016 the trial justice issued a written decision resolving, in favor of the City, the claims for
violation of the Contract Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions, breach of
contract and injunctive relief. In essence, the court allowed the suspension of the COLA increases.
The retirees, through CPRAC, appealed to the Rhode Island Supreme Court. The Rhode Island
Supreme Court, in June 2019, sided with the initial court finding that determined the COLA
suspension did not violate the US or Rhode Island Constitution.
The following passages were taken directly from the Supreme Court decision:
•

The trial justice also concluded that the 2013 ordinances were reasonable and necessary,
finding that the City presented sufficient evidence that it had considered alternatives, a
more moderate course was not available, and the 2013 ordinances were reasonable in light
of the surrounding circumstances because they were “circumscribed, temporary,
precipitated by fiscal emergency, and prospective.”

•

We are mindful, however, that a legitimate public purpose is not to be found in all
circumstances, particularly when it related to economic issues. “If a State could reduce its
financial obligations whenever it wanted to spend the money for what it regarded as an
important public purpose, the Contract Clause would provide no protection at
all.”……..These ordinances were not intended merely for the “financial benefit of the
sovereign, but rather, were designed to address the City’s serious fiscal crisis, one that
was brought about by several factors, many not within the City’s control….protecting the
solvency of a pension system could be a legitimate public purpose – one that, here, is
critically important to plaintiff’s members, who derive income from the system.

 •

Moreover, we agree with the trial justice’s conclusions that the 2013 ordinances were
narrowly tailored to the problem and that the impairment was temporary and prospective
in nature because the 2013 ordinances suspend a future benefit for a finite period of
time. The 2013 ordinances did not eliminate the COLA benefit altogether, and only
affected COLAs not yet made available to retirees.

Again, the Pension Board is not involved in negotiating your benefits or the funding for your
benefits. The Pension Board administers the pension fund based on the Illinois Statute, as
amended by the Illinois Legislature. The pension fund trustees, given their unique position, are
able to better see the long-term risks facing the member’s retirement security. It is from this
perspective that I think the time is approaching where difficult decisions are going to start being
made regarding how to address the precarious financial footing of the Fund. I assure you I will
keep you abreast of any new developments as I become aware of them. Best regards to all the
pension fund members.
