Present:

Ben Weese
John Baird
Edward Torrez

Staff:

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Historic Preservation Division, Department
of Zoning and Land Use Planning
Dijana Cuvalo
Beth Johnson
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

1531 N. Damen
(Wicker Park District – 1st Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed new 15’ x 50’ aluminum canopy for outdoor dining on the front
of a 1-story masonry building

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The permit plans shall include canopy details and sections, as well as
attachment details;
2. Signage was not reviewed as a part of this application and shall be
submitted for review and permitted separately; and,
3. Any planter boxes surrounding the dining area shall be subject to
Historic Preservation staff review and approval.

2.

1060 W. Addison
(Wrigley Field – 44th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed renovation of the Center Field scoreboard to include roof
repairs, replacement of rear metal siding and the reinstallation of the
painted “pennant” with “Chicago Cubs” letters and neon on the back of
the scoreboard. (No work is proposed for the scoreboard side facing the
field.) Removal of non-historic concrete panels and installation of new
chain-link fencing on the south elevation (right field side) of stadium
along Addison Street

 Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed, the existing Chicago Cubs “pennant” sign on the back of
the scoreboard will be dismantled and reinstalled on the new
replacement metal siding to match the existing sign. The following
shall be reviewed and approved by Historic Preservation staff prior to
issuing the permit:
a. Prior to dismantlement, the existing sign shall be photographed
for documentation purposes. The proposed “charting” of the
sign and artwork by the contractor shall be dimensioned, both
for the sign and artwork itself as well as its location on the
back of the scoreboard;
b. As proposed, the flagpoles and lights are not to be removed.
The dimensioned location of the flagpole and lights on the roof
of the scoreboard shall be documented;
c. As proposed, the metal letters are to be salvaged and
reinstalled. If the letters prove to be beyond repair, Historic
Preservation staff shall be notified. Replacement letters shall
match the originals, subject to Historic Preservation staff
review and approval;
d. If the neon tubes cannot be salvaged and reused, the new neon
shall match the design, dimensions, locations, and color of the
existing neon; and,
e. All removed elements of the scoreboard shall be salvaged and
retained until the reinstallation is complete.

3.

808 N. Dearborn
(Washington Square District Extension – 42nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed new rooftop addition and rear addition for a 2-story mid-block
masonry rowhouse with raised basement; and a handicapped-accessible
ramp in the front yard area

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The proposed 3rd-floor addition shall be no larger or taller than
submitted:
a. the safety railing shall be set back 5’-8 ¾” from the front
façade and be no higher than 39’-9 1/2” above grade;
b. the front slope of the 3rd floor addition shall be set back 17’-9
¾” from the front façade of the building and be no higher than
44’-7 ½” above grade; and,
c. the section of greatest height of the addition shall be set back
38’-7” from the front façade and be no higher than 51’-6”
above grade.

 2. Cladding for the additions shall be compatible with historic materials
within the district, or it shall have a dark, non-reflective color subject
to Historic Preservation staff review and approval prior to permit
application; and,
3. Historic Preservation staff shall review and approve any required
basement doorway modifications as part of the proposed accessibility
ramp.
The Committee noted for the record that the existing billboard to the south
of the subject property would limit views of the proposed addition from
this direction, but considering the impermanent nature of signs and
billboards, the Committee further noted that the existing billboard should
not be taken into consideration in judging visibility. The Committee
additionally concluded, however, that the proposed addition would be
minimally visible, regardless of the existence of the billboard, and
instructed the Historic Preservation staff to revise the staff report to further
clarify this issue.
4.

1338 E. Madison Avenue Park
(Kenwood District – 4th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed front façade renovations of c.1950s building including paint
removal, masonry repair and replacement, alterations to front parapet and
dormer, and installation of rusticated masonry at the base of the building
and at front stairs

Action:

The Committee continued review of the project subject to the following
conditions:
1. Further research shall be completed regarding the front façade changes
that the Committee believes may have been completed c.1930s. [The
Committee directed the Historic Preservation staff to undertake this
additional research.]; and,
2. The condition of the masonry of the front facade must be further
evaluated, since whether the masonry can be retained and repaired or,
alternatively, must be completely replaced will effect the project
and how it would be reviewed by the Committee. The paint on the
façade shall therefore be completely removed and the condition of the
masonry further evaluated. The applicant will notify Historic
Preservation staff after the paint has been removed so that the staff
may inspect the condition of the masonry. A written evaluation with
photographs and/or elevation drawings detailing the condition of the
masonry shall be submitted for Committee review and
address areas where repair or localized replacement will be necessary
or, alternatively, due to substantial deterioration and/or other facade
conditions, entirely replaced. Specifications for the paint removal

 shall be submitted to Historic Preservation staff for review and
approval prior to obtaining an environmental permit for this work.
5.

1200 E. Madison Avenue Park
(Kenwood District – 4th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed demolition and reconstruction of masonry piers and repair of
wrought-iron fence for Madison Avenue Park

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
3. The applicant shall provide existing and proposed dimensioned plans
and elevations for the piers and stone fence curbs, along with a
phasing plan explaining how the existing wrought iron fence will be
salvaged, cleaned, repaired and reinstalled;
4. The proposed brick and stone shall match the historic masonry in
regard to size, color, design, texture and appearance. Historic
Preservation staff shall review and approve brick and limestone
samples prior to order and installation; and,
5. Mortar shall match the joint profile, color and finish of historic mortar.

6.

Criteria for Review of Visible Dormers
(Old Town Triangle District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed additional criteria to consider in the review of visible dormers on
front-gable-roofed cottages in the Old Town Triangle District

Action:

The Committee adopted (2-1, John Baird against) the following for use on
a preliminary basis in the Old Town Triangle District:
The following additional criteria shall be considered in evaluating
whether proposed new dormers on front-facing gable-roofed cottages
in the Old Town Triangle District will have an adverse effect on the
district when such dormers would be visible from the public right-ofway. Such factors as relative visibility of any proposed dormer, given
the building size, the site conditions (e.g., unusually wide side yards or
a double lot) and the surrounding context, as well the proposed
location, size, massing and design of the dormer itself, will be
considered in the review of such projects on a case-by-case basis. Due
to the high degree of visibility, these criteria would not apply to visible
dormers on the street side of a front-gabled cottage on a
corner property.
1. Alternative dormer locations and/or configurations, where the
dormer or other addition would otherwise not be visible from the
public way, are not possible;

 2. The proposed visible dormer is minimized in size and
configuration to minimize its visibility from the public way and its
impact on the historic rooflines of the building as much as possible
(e.g., insetting the rear portion of a dormer so that it is effectively
screened from public view by the front portion of the dormer and
thereby reduces its visibility);
3. Regardless of visibility, no more than one dormer (including
existing dormers) is proposed per building side; furthermore, if a
dormer exists and/or is proposed for both sides of the building, the
visibility of each individual dormer as well as the cumulative
visibility (e.g., if both dormers would be visible from the same
vantage points) is taken into consideration in evaluating the
potential adverse effect;
4. The proposed visible dormer is set back from the front facade of
the building as much as possible, but with a setback of at least 25
feet or 60% of the length of the original footprint of the building,
whichever is greater; and provided that if there are later additions,
any proposed dormers are set back further on the building
consistent with the purposes of these criteria;
5. The roof of the proposed dormer is as low as possible relative to
the existing main ridge height of the building, generally at least 1'0" lower than the main ridge, and in no instance higher than the
main ridge [note that, depending on the specific conditions, there
may be limited potential to achieve minimum code-required
interior ceiling heights];
6. The proposed dormer has a simple gable or shed roof, depending
on the dormer’s location, size and visibility, with an appreciable
slope and generally minimal overhangs;
7. The proposed dormer is sided with materials compatible with that
of the building, but, depending on its relative visibility, generally
also the color of the roofing material to further minimize visibility;
and,
8. The design and detailing of the proposed dormer is simplified.
The Committee asked that Historic Preservation staff further solicit Old
Triangle Association comments on these criteria.

335 W. Concord
(Old Town Triangle District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed rehabilitation of an existing 2-story, front-gabled masonry
cottage, including the addition of two new visible dormers and skylights

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

 1. Any structural repair work proposed to the existing roof above the
open 2nd-story living room shall maintain the existing ridge and eave
heights and roof slopes (i.e., by aligning the top of any new structural
member with the top of the existing structural member);
2. The plans shall be modified to provide a minimum 25 foot setback
from the front façade of the building to the front walls of the proposed
dormers. The configuration of the west dormer shall be modified to
eliminate the unused corner space at the front corner, thus further
reducing the size of the dormer. The plans shall be further studied to
investigate whether a similar reduction of the east dormer may be
possible;
3. The roof overhangs of the dormers shall be reduced as much as
possible to minimize the visibility of the dormers;
4. As proposed, the siding on the new dormers shall be fiber-cement
siding painted to match the color of the roofing material. The siding
shall have a smooth finish and otherwise match the existing wood
siding in size, profile, and finish; and,
5. The skylights proposed on the new dormers shall be low profile, and
the curbs shall match the color of the roofing material to further reduce
visibility.
The Committee also instructed the Historic Preservation staff to further
verify the height of the proposed dormers depicted in the submitted
photoshop renderings.

1300 N. Ritchie Court
(Astor Street District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed façade alterations to include both new and enlarged masonry
window openings on Ritchie Court, Goethe Street and alley facades of
corner 4-story masonry building; also, 4-foot-high metal gate at recessed
front entry, 6-foot-high metal fence and 1’-6” parkway fence

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
The proposed new window openings on the Ritchie Court (front)
façade would change the original fenestration pattern of the buildings
primary façade and require the removal of decorative carved-limestone
ornamental panels. No new masonry window openings are approved
on the Ritchie Court façade;
2. On the side (Goethe Street) façade, the plans shall be modified to
minimize the impact of the proposed new window openings to the
historic character and original fenestration pattern of the building:
• The 4 new masonry openings proposed in the middle of the
façade (labeled “A” on the attached key elevation) and the 4
new masonry openings proposed toward the rear (west end) of

the façade (labeled “B”) are not approved; the existing
conditions shall remain.
• The 3 new window openings proposed toward the front of the
building (labeled “E”) and the 3 toward the rear of the building
(labeled “C”), which would replace smaller window openings,
are approved, provided that the new openings are no wider than
the existing typical historic openings on the façade.
• As proposed, the new masonry openings shall be cut into the
existing limestone; however, to distinguish the new openings
from the historic, the stone returns at the newly cut openings
shall be smooth.
The proposed new masonry openings on the rear elevation shall be
restudied to be more compatible with the historic fenestration pattern
of the building, in terms of size, proportion and the width and amount
of masonry between and surrounding the openings (i.e., reducing the
new masonry opening width and height to match the typical historic
masonry window openings existing on the building);
As proposed, the new brick proposed for the rear façade shall match
existing. A brick sample shall be submitted to Historic Preservation
staff for review and approval;
The following shall be submitted with the permit plans:
• Entry gate attachment details;
• Window elevations with dimensions and brick mold detail;
• Details and specifications of how the new openings will be cut
into the stone façade. If any replacement masonry is needed it
shall match historic masonry in size, color, texture, finish and
joint profile; and,
The proposed 6’-0” tall metal fence and the 1’-6” tall parkway metal
fence both appear to be located in the public way. If so, the applicant
will need to obtain a public way permit for the fence from the
appropriate City department(s) and meet applicable City code
requirements.
