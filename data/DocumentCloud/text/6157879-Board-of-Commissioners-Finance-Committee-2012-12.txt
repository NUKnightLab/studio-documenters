PAGE 24

DEDICATION OF THE SPECIALTY CARE ATRIUM ENTRANCE
AT JOHN H. STROGER, JR. HOSPITAL IN THE NAME OF THE
HONORABLE RICHARD J. PHELAN

WHEREAS, in 1990, the residents of Cook County elected a political newcomer, Richard
J. Phelan, to the of?ce of President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and

WHEREAS, President Phelan accomplished a remarkable number of things during his
four (4) year term from 1990 to 1994, especially in the area of the County?s healthcare
system; and

WHEREAS, under President Phelan?s stewardship, the modernization and
professionalization of the County?s ?nancial management was successfully undertaken;
President Phelan created both the Of?ce of the Chief Financial Of?cer and the Of?ce of
Capital Planning; under President Phelan, Cook County received its ?rst independent audit
by an outside accounting ?rm in more than a decade and received its ?rst Certi?cate of
Achievement Award for Excellence in Financial Reporting from the Government Financial
Of?cers Association; President Phelan inaugurated the County?s ?rst 3% cent sales tax,
thereby reducing the County?s reliance on property taxes and diversifying the County?s tax
base; and

WHEREAS, under President Phelan?s watch, strides were made in the area of ethical
government; the ?rst Ethics and Human Resources Ordinances were signed; and Cook
County signed on to the Shakman Decree, which for the ?rst time explicitly prohibited
political hiring and ?ring; and

WHEREAS, under President Phelan?s leadership, a Human Rights Ordinance extended
employment and other protections to members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and
Transgender (LGBT) community, and Cook County?s Minority- and Women?Owned
Business Enterprise Ordinance was strengthened; and

WHEREAS, in the area of public safety, President Phelan successfully championed the
creation of the ?rst County-wide assault weapons ban and undertook expansion of the
capacity of the Cook County Jail; and

WHEREAS, certainly, President Phelan?s most signi?cant achievements were in the area
of healthcare and moving the County closer to the goal of achieving equality in healthcare
for all County residents; when President Phelan took of?ce, the elements of the Cook
County healthcare system were uncoordinated, the nearly 80?year-old Cook County
Hospital had just been disaccredited, and the replacement of the hospital was opposed by
the business community, hospital organizations, the newspaper editorial boards and a
sizable number of County Board Commissioners; under President Phelan?s leadership, a
new ?Bureau of Health Services? was established to coordinate the County?s acute care,
ambulatory care and long term care services under the command of its ?rst Bureau Chief,
Ruth M. Rothstein, accreditation was restored, the planning, sizing and budgeting for a
replacement hospital were established, the business, hospital and newspaper opponents of
the replacement hospital were won over, and the Cook County Board authorized the
commitment of funding, all of which culminated in the State?s award (on President
Phelan?s last day in of?ce) of a ?certi?cate of need? authorizing construction of the state of
the art Stroger Hospital of Cook County; and

321087

FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
DECEMBER 18, 2012
PAGE25

WHEREAS, also in the area of healthcare, President Phelan oversaw the establishment of
the CORE Foundation partnership with Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke?s Medical Center,
which led to the building of the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center, opened the renovated
Provident Hospital as a Cook County facility, authorized the expansion of women?s
reproductive health services at Cook County Hospital, and established the first Inter-
Governmental Transfer Agreement with the State of Illinois, which has resulted in more
than a billion dollars in extra Medicaid revenues for the County since its execution; and

WHEREAS, the Specialty Care Atrium Entrance of Stroger Hospital of Cook County is
being re?conceptualized and upgraded to create a more healing environment and 
utilizing the elements of water, vegetation, light, art and sound; and

WHEREAS, it is altogether fitting and appropriate that the many contributions of
President Phelan to the improvement of Cook County, but especially the healthcare system
of Cook County, be recognized in the building he worked so hard to see become a reality
during his term as Cook County Board President.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners hereby congratulates the Honorable Richard J. Phelan upon the dedication
of the Stroger Hospital of Cook County Specialty Care Atrium Entrance in his name,
thanks him for his years of outstanding leadership and service on behalf of the residents of
Cook County, and wishes him continued success and happiness in all his endeavors; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to the
Honorable Richard J. Phelan.

COMMISSIONER SILVESTRI, SECONDED BY VICE CHAIRMAN SIMS,
MOVED TO RATIFY THE POLL OF DECEMBER 7, 2012, BY WHICH
COMMUNICATION NO. 321086 WAS APPROVED. THE MOTION CARRIED.

BUREAU OF FINANCE, OFFICE OF THE COUNTY COMPTROLLER.

Transmitting a Communication, dated December 4, 2012 from Reshma Soni, Comptroller
and Juliana Stratton, Director, Justice Advisory Council.

Re: 2002 Grant Agreement between the Administrative Of?ce of the Illinois Courts and
Cook County Judicial Advisory Council - Approval of payment in the amount of
$599,532.99 to the State.

On May 21, 2002 the Cook County Board of Commissioners authorized the Judicial
Advisory Council to accept a grant award in the amount of $1,500,000.00 from
the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts for operational improvements
for the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center The 2002 Grant Agreement
(?Grant Agreement?) approved by the Cook County Board of Commissioners and executed
by Cook County started on June 14, 2002 and ended on June 13, 2004. A grant extension
was requested by Cook County in May of 2004; however, said request was formally denied
on June 1, 2004.

Per the Grant Agreement, JTDC submitted a Final Status Report in August of 2004 to the

FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
DECEMBER 18, 2012
PAGE 26

AOIC Court Services Division; the Final Status Report noted that $219,458.00 remained in
unexpended grant funds. As of this date, neither JTDC nor Cook County has refunded the
unexpended grant funds owed to the State of Illinois.

Following the Final Status Report, the Supreme Court Internal Audit Division conducted
an audit of the grant between JTDC and AOIC to determine if JTDC expended State grant
funds in compliance with the Grant Agreement. The scope of the audit was limited to
reviewing expenditures made under the grant award for the grant period beginning June 14,
2002 through June 13, 2004. Per the results of the audit, it was determined that
$301,502.54 remained unexpended and $298,030.45 was disallowed. (AOIC Audit
determined that $180,075.00 in expenditures were made outside the grant award period,
98,755.45 in expenditures were made without supporting documentation, and $19,200 in
expenditures were charged to other accounts/grants; said charges represent a total of
$298,030.45 is disallowed costs.) The total amount to be refunded to the State from the
Grant Agreement was determined to be $599,532.99.

JTDC attempted to address and refute the AOIC Audit findings on June 29 and August 7,
2006; however, on February 1, 2007 the AOIC auditors con?rmed to JTDC that the grant
award was not expended in compliance with the Grant Agreement and in accordance with
the Illinois Grant Funds Recovery Act, $599,532.99 was to be returned to the AOIC,
Administrative Services Division by March 5, 2007; additional attempts to recover said
funds had gone unanswered by Cook County.

In November of 2011, representatives of the AOIC met with County representatives to
address the outstanding funds owed to the State under the Illinois Grant Recovery Act.
For the time period of December, 2011 through February, 2012, representatives from the
Justice Advisory Council (formerly known as the Judicial Advisory Council), Budget,
Comptroller?s Of?ce and the President?s Of?ce engaged in research, reviewed documents
and met with AOIC representatives and auditors in an attempt to present documentation to
dispute some of the AOIC audit ?ndings from 2006.

In February of 2012, Cook County provided documentation in an attempt to support the
County?s 2006 position that $294,305.00 of the $599,532.99 in grant funds expended by
the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center represented allowable costs under the Grant
Agreement. Despite the materials provided by Cook County, in April of 2012, AOIC
con?rmed its prior conclusion that the total amount of grant funds not expended in
compliance with the Grant Agreement remained at $599,532.99.

During a second conference in August of 2012, Cook County sought reconsideration of the
position and offered supporting facts to justify the expenditure of certain items
from the 2002 Grant Agreement. Following an additional conference in August of 2012,
Cook County narrowed its request for review before the AOIC and requested additional
review of approximately $121,000.00 in expenditures that were charged to the Grant
Agreement.

On November 5, 2012 the AOIC noti?ed Cook County that it has reviewed Cook County?s
position and supporting documentation but confirmed its position that $599,532.99
remains due to the State.

Upon review of the decision and supporting documentation, authorization is

FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
DECEMBER 18, 2012
PAGE 27

hereby requested for the Comptroller to remit the unexpended grant funds to the State in
the amount of $301,502.54 from account 7700201.440400.300 and the $298,030.45 in
disallowed costs from the 4991619580030 account.
