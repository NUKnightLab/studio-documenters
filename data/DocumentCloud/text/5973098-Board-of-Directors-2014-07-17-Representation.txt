This representation letter is provided in connection with your audit of the financial statements of
Chicago Infrastructure Trust, which comprise the statements of financial position as of December
31, 2013, and the related statements of activities, functional expenses, and cash flows for the
period then ended April 24, 2012 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2013,
and the related notes to the financial statements, for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to
whether the financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP).
Certain representations in this letter are described as being limited to matters that are material.
Items are considered material, regardless of size, if they involve an omission or misstatement of
accounting information that, in light of surrounding circumstances, makes it probable that the
judgment of a reasonable person relying on the information would be changed or influenced by
the omission or misstatement. An omission or misstatement that is monetarily small in amount
could be considered material as a result of qualitative factors.

representations made to you during your audit.
