PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REQUESTING TO PRESENT A PUBLIC QUESTION VIA A COUNTYWIDE REFERENDUM
ABOLISHING THE OFFICE OF THE COOK COUNTY RECORDER OF DEEDS
WHEREAS, Cook County government continues to make concerted efforts to address current and future
budgetary constraints by rightsizing governmental operations, improving efficiency and eliminating
redundancy in operations, among other measures; and
WHEREAS, the County currently has 29 separately elected officials, some of whom oversee
administrative offices; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Recorder of Deeds is tasked with keeping accurate records of land
transactions for public and private review; maintaining official records of UCC, tax liens and lien
releases; and recording and maintaining other official records; and
WHEREAS, the key functions of the Cook County Clerk include maintaining vital records and other
official records, administering elections, and maintaining County tax maps and calculating tax rates; and
WHEREAS, functions that are narrowly drawn and administrative in nature provide an excellent
opportunity for consolidation with another office; and
WHEREAS, record-keeping is an administrative function shared by both the County Clerk’s Office and
the County Recorder of Deeds, with many of the Recorder’s duties aligning with already existing
divisions under the Clerk; and
WHEREAS, only 2 of the 10 largest counties in the United States have a separately elected Recorder of
Deeds and Clerk; and

BOARD AGENDA

October 28, 2015

WHEREAS, it is anticipated that a merger of the Cook County Clerk and Cook County Recorder of
Deeds could save the County over $1 million dollars annually through a more efficient provision of
services while also centralizing record-keeping and improving customer service; and
WHEREAS, Article VII, Section 4(c) of the Constitution of the State of Illinois states, “Any office may
be created or eliminated and the terms of office and manner of selection changed by county-wide
referendum”; and
WHEREAS, 10 ILCS 5/28-8.1(a) states, “Whenever a proposition required by law to be voted upon
before its adoption, other than a constitutional amendment, is submitted to the people, it is the duty of the
Secretary of State to prepare a statement setting forth in detail Section or Sections of the law sought to be
amended by the vote, together with statements and suggestions as may be necessary for a proper
understanding of the proposition. The statements and suggestions shall be submitted to the Attorney
General for his approval”; and
WHEREAS, it is a fundamental underpinning of our great country to provide taxpayers the opportunity
to have input as to the functioning of their government and use of their tax dollars; and
WHEREAS, allowing the voters of Cook County the opportunity to determine the propriety of the
proposed consolidation via a binding referendum is an opportunity to engage residents directly in our
democratic process; and
WHEREAS, in order to consolidate and improve services by merging the functions and responsibilities
of the office of the Recorder of Deeds into the office of the Cook County Clerk, the Cook County Board
of Commissioners seeks to place a question before the electorate via a referendum on the November 8,
2016, countywide ballot seeking to eliminate the office of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds and
merge its functions into those of the Cook County Clerk, as follows:
“Shall the Office of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds be eliminated and all duties and
responsibilities of the Office of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds be transferred to, and assumed
by, the Office of the Cook County Clerk by December 1, 2018.
[ ] Yes
[ ] No”
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that this
Board present the aforementioned question to the electorate via a countywide referendum on the
November 8, 2016 ballot.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Clerk notifies the Secretary of State, and the
Attorney General of this request for action.

PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: Krzysztof Wasowicz, Village President, Village of Justice
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location:

Village of Justice

Volume and Property Index Number:
084, 18-34-405-008-0000
Summary: The Village of Justice (the Village) hereby submits a No Cash Bid Request Package to
acquire the following parcel of real property located at 8801 West 84th Place, Justice, Illinois 60458 (the
Property). The Property is improved with a gasoline service station that has been abandoned and
remained unoccupied for at least two (2) years. The Village will file for tax exempt status once the
Property has been acquired. Once tax exempt status is obtained, the Village intends to demolish the
gasoline service station improvements, remediate environmental contamination, and possibly market the
same for redevelopment by a third-party. If the Property is sold and redeveloped by a third-party, it
would no longer be exempt from taxation. The Village initiates this request on its own, and there has
been no request by a third-party for the Village to acquire the Property or to convey the certificate of
purchase or the perfected tax deed(s) to said third-party purchaser.
The Village will retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all legal costs and other costs
associated with acquisition of the Property. The Village will submit annually to the Cook County
Department of Economic Development "No Cash Bid Reports" on the status of each parcel for five years,
or until the intended use and development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook
County No Cash Bid Ordinance.

PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: Marilynn J. May, Village President, Village of River Grove
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location: Village of River Grove
Volume and Property Index Number:
067, 12-26-311-010-0000; 067, 12-26-311-012-0000; 067, 12-26-416-010-0000
Summary: Three (3) properties located within the Village of River Grove are currently tax-delinquent
and unoccupied, and the Village would therefore like to secure ownership of these properties through the
Cook County No Cash Bid Program and the 2015 Scavenger Sale. A list containing the volume number

Page 4 of 48

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

October 28, 2015

and full 14-digit permanent index number (PIN) of each parcel requested is as follows. The total number
of PINs requested in the package is three (3). A statement of current and intended use for each PIN
follows, but, the Village intends on acquiring all three parcels for the development of public parking
facilities: Common Address 2620 Thatcher Avenue, River Grove, Illinois, 60171 Vol. 067 PIN
12-26-311-010-0000 currently contains multiple unoccupied, neglected commercial structures. Vol. 067
PIN 12-26-311-012-0000 currently contains two unoccupied, neglected structures, with one improvement
being commercial and the other residential. Both parcels have not been occupied for a period in excess of
three (3) years. As mentioned above, the intended use of these parcels is the development of public
parking facilities. These two parcels are located near the business district and across from the municipal
building of the village. Currently, the business district suffers from a profound lack of parking for
owners, businesses and customers within the district. For this reason, the village plans to build a public
parking lot for village employees and the public on these parcels, which in turn would free up space in
the village’s current public parking lot immediately adjacent to the business district. This plan expands
parking available to the owners, employees and patrons of the businesses in the business district. The
village believes that by increasing public parking facilities, the commercial activity of the business
district will be enhanced and greater sales-tax revenues will be generated for both Cook County and the
Village of River Grove. Common Address 8135 West Grand Avenue, River Grove, Illinois, 60171 Vol.
067 PIN 12-26-416-010-0000. This parcel currently consists of an obsolete, neglected unoccupied
restaurant structure, and the improvement consumes the entire parcel with no on-site parking facilities.
This parcel has not been occupied for a period in excess of three (3) years. As mentioned above, the
intended use of this parcel would be the development of public parking facilities. The parcel is situated in
the middle of the Grand Avenue Business Corridor and offers a great opportunity to create additional
public parking to serve the business district. As previously stated, the village believes that by increasing
public parking facilities serving the business district, the commercial activity of the business district will
be enhanced and greater sale-tax revenues will be generated for both Cook County and the Village Rive
Grove. Next, in accordance with the county ordinance, on behalf of the Village of River Grove, I make
the following representations and affirmations in support of the Village’s Request Package: The Village
shall file for tax exempt status on each parcel because the Village intends on retaining these three parcels
for municipal use. There is neither a Third Party Request nor a Third Party Requestor with respect to
these three parcels. The Village shall retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deeds and bear all legal and
other costs associated with acquisition of these three parcels. The Village agrees to submit to the Cook
County Department of Economic Development No Cash Bid Reports on the status of each parcel for five
(5) year or until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No
Cash Bid Ordinance.

Presented by: ZAHRA ALI, Director, Department of Revenue
PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Department: Cook County Department of Revenue
Request: Transfer of Funds
Reason: Funds will be used for equipment and computer supplies needed for the startup of the
Integrated Tax Processing System (ITPS) implementation. Additionally, the Department of Revenue
seeks to further extend exceptional taxpayer services by acquiring translation and interpretation services.
These services will allow the department contract with vendors that will translate tax notices in multiple
languages and provide interpretation support. Last, the department seeks to encumber funds for
LexisNexis Vitalcheck (the credit card processing vendor). Credit card payment processing has increased
due to a surge in taxpayers using credit cards to make payments.
From Account(s): 007-240, $35,000.00; 007-260, $20,000.00)
To Account(s): 007-388, $15,000.00; 007-260, $20,000; 007-249, $20,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $55,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
The Integrated Tax Processing System was approved at the September 9th Board meeting. Upon
approval of the project it became apparent that additional computer operation supplies would be
necessary to start implementation of the project. The request for translation and interpretation has
increased greatly in FY 2015. It became apparent at the end of Q3 that funding was needed to secure
these services. In Q3 the department recognized that there was surge in taxpayers paying with credit. To
accommodate the increase in credit card payments the department needs to encumber funds for
LexisNexis (the credit card processing vendor.)
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The department identified areas of efficiencies and process improvements that resulted in unused funds.

The primary account used for transferring was printing.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Originally, the Non Retailer tax was mailed by CCDOR, as of 6/1 the State of Illinois entered into an
agreement with CCDOR to take over the responsibly of collecting this tax. Therefore, CCDOR tax notice
mailings and printing expenses declined greatly.

Vendor: Panoramic Software, Inc., Dana Point, California
Request: Authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute
Good(s) or Service(s): Adult Guardianship Case Management Software Maintenance
Contract Value: $196,000.00
Contract period: 12/1/2015-11/30/2017, with two (2) one (1) year renewal options.
Potential Fiscal Year Budget Impact: FY 2016: $98,000.00; FY 2017: $98,000.00

Contract Number(s): 15-4881

The vendor has met the Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprises Ordinance.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: Panoramic Software, Inc. developed and installed the proprietary Adult Guardianship Case
Management System for the Public Guardian’s Office in 2012 and 2013 to modernize case management
and fiduciary accounting systems that had become outdated and inefficient. The system is web-based and
provides unlimited (24/7) electronic access to information on wards and their finances to 90 employees
both in the office and the field.
The current development contract approved by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, resulted from
a Request for Proposal process (12-28-028P), and included software maintenance and hosting services.
It is necessary to establish a new contract to continue these services and is proposed under the same
terms and conditions.
Panoramic owns all rights to the source code for the program "PG-Pro Web." Panoramic is sole owner of
the source code and for this reason is the only software vendor who can host and maintain the software.

PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Department: County Clerk
Request: Transfer of Funds
Reason: Purchase of electronic pollbook computer equipment to serve precincts larger than 1,000
registered voters
From Account(s): 524-267, $400,000.00
To Account(s): 524-388, $400,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $400,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
Upon finalization of the County Clerk’s 2016 budget it became apparent that funds would not be
available to purchase necessary electronic pollbook equipment. The balance at that time on 9/25/15 was
$65,973.00. Thirty days prior on 8/26/15 the balance was $90,152.00.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.

The electronic pollbook computer equipment will increase voter throughput in the precincts.
This has the value of both decreasing paper and personnel that would otherwise be necessary.
Therefore the election judge and printing funds were obvious choices.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

BOARD AGENDA

The election judge account was budgeted for an anticipated primary election size of up to 400 precincts.
In fact there were 36 precincts where a primary election was conducted. Those anticipated labor costs
never materialized. Similarly, the paper necessary to conduct a larger election weren't needed.
