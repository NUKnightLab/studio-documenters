NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING

A public hearing will be held by the Detroit City Planning Commission in the Committee of the
Whole Room, 13th Floor, Coleman A. Young Municipal Center, 2 Woodward Avenue, Detroit,
Michigan 48226, on

THURSDAY, 5. 2019 AT 7:30 PM

to consider the request of the Detroit City Planning Commission to amend Article XVII, District
Map No. 20 of the 2019 Detroit City Code, Chapter 50, Zoning, by showing a B3 (Shopping
District) zoning classi?cation where a M4 (Intensive Industrial District) zoning classi?cation
currently exists on ten parcels, commonly identi?ed as 8230, 8400, 8500, 8600, 10000, and
10100 E. Eight Mile Road, 20200, 20210, 20222, and 20280 Conner Avenue, generally bounded
by E. Eight Mile Road to the north, Hoover Road I Grosebeck Hwy. to the east, E. State Fair
Avenue to the south, and Veach Street to the west. The location of the proposed rezoning is
speci?cally indicated as the shaded area on the accompanying map.

The proposed map amendment is being requested to allow for the continued use of the Bel Air
Shopping Center for General Retail purposes and to bring the existing and future land uses into
conformance with the Master Plan of Policies which calls for the subject area to be zoned as
Shopping Center. The proposed general retail use would be permitted on a by-right basis in the
proposed B3 zoning classi?cation.

The pertinent zoning district classi?cations are described as follows:

B3 Shopping District

The BB Shopping District provides for a range of convenience and comparison shopping goods
stores, which are generally grouped into neighborhood and community shopping centers,
depending on the size of the area so mapped. Uses permitted are inclusive enough to allow for
the provisions of a broad range of goods and services for the consumer, and to allow for as
much ?'eedom and healthy competition in the commercial real estate market and commercial
activities as is commensurate with other community values.

M4- Intensive Industrial District

This district will permit uses which are usually objectionable and, therefore, the district is
rarely, if ever, located adjacent to residential districts. A broad range of uses is permitted in
this district. New residences are prohibited with the exception of loft conversions of existing
buildings and of residential uses combined in structures with permitted commercial uses. These
requirements are to protect residences ?om an undesirable environment and to ensure
reservation of adequate areas for industrial deveIOpment.

A Zoning Ordinance map amendment requires approval of the City Council a?er a public hearing
and a?er receipt of a report and recommendation by the City Planning Commission. This Zoning
Ordinance map amendment request is being considered consistent with the provisions of Article
111, Division 3 of Chapter 50 of the 2019 Detroit City Code, the Detroit Zoning Ordinance.

You may present your views on this proposal by attending this hearing, by authorizing others to
represent you, or by writing to this of?ce prior to the hearing; 2 Woodward Avenue, Room 208,
Detroit, Michigan 48226 (FAX: 313-224-4336). Because it is possible that some who are affected
by this proposal may not have been noti?ed, it is suggested that you kindly inform your neighbors
so that they too may express their positions if they so desire.

With advance notice of seven calendar days, the City of Detroit will provide interpreter services
at public meetings, including language translation and reasonable ADA accommodations. Please
contact the Civil Rights, Inclusion and Opportunity Department at 313-224?4950, through the
TTY number 711, or email crio@detroitmi.gov to schedule these services.
