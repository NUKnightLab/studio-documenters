As a public developer, the

PBC tracks project delivery

with an toward continuous
improvement. Since 2011, under the
leadership of former Chairman Rahm
Emanuel, the PBC has completed nearly
300 projects, Including 90 municipal
projects {police stations. firehouses,
park district facilities and libraries) and
195 education projects (public schools).
These projects represent nearly $2.7
billion in investments across the city.
For a full list ofthese accomplishments,

please check out page 7.

We have been able to achieve this suc-
cess because of the understanding that
the PBC holds a unique role in shaping
Chicago?s environment. Our work
reaches into every comer of this city:
. ., . the facilities we build or renovate act as
anchors for Chicago's diverse neighbor-
hoods, and our work presents tremen-
?.dous opportunities to transform the

spaces where residents of all ages play,
learn and grow.

Our accomplishments under Mayor
Emanuel are evident in the four Chicago
Public School ribbon-cutting events
[including Dore Elementary School, pic-
tured above) and the groundbreaking
of the second largest fire station in
the city that we feature in this issue of
Constructive News You Can Use.

As we welcome a new Chairman to the
PBC, rest assured that our commitment
to the city remains our top priority. We
have a solid foundation, and we con?
tinue to move in the right direction,
ensuring a sustainable future that is
invested not only in the communities
where we build but also in the people
who live in those communities.

PBC projects embody our commitment
to our clients and the communities we

lives, their families and their work.
The staff of the PBC is dedicated to
upholding our mission through the
construction of public facilities that
support business growth, lead to job
creation, and present ongoing oppor?
tunities for recreation, education and
public service.

As you read the 2019 Q2 newsletter,
I hope the news that we share illus-
trates our excellent stewardship of the
public fund and demonstrates how we
are creating quality spaces that every
Chicagoan can enjoy.
