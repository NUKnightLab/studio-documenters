·2· · · · · · · · ·But before I do that, I do have a
·3· ·background as an attorney.· I view myself as an
·4· ·advocate and I wanted to provide some
·5· ·resources.
·6· · · · · · · · ·Today I have brought, probably
·7· ·not enough, but I can share via e-mail if you
·8· ·want, some resources for you to look at.
·9· · · · · · · · ·The first is a referral list for
10· ·people who are considering the need to be
11· ·assessed by an immigration attorney.· The best
12· ·defense is offense, however that phrase goes,
13· ·because if you are someone who's undocumented
14· ·or mixed-status family, you're concerned about
15· ·the security and safety of your family, it's
16· ·really important that you be assessed by a
17· ·credible attorney.· So I'm providing a list of
18· ·agencies here in the City that you can go and
19· ·get assessed by.
20· · · · · · · · ·I'm also providing a
21· ·know-your-rights packet, so you know what you
22· ·can do if someone detains you, specifically
23· ·detains you, what your rights could be.

·2· ·children living in mixed-status families.· And
·3· ·I'm also providing information about the
·4· ·census.
·5· · · · · · · · ·One of the initiatives that we're
·6· ·doing through the office is the Census 2020.
·7· ·Making sure it's a success here in the City and
·8· ·everyone is accounted for and especially in all
·9· ·our communities.· And the census is very
10· ·important.· And right now there are
11· ·opportunities to apply for jobs with the
12· ·census, and we are really promoting at this
13· ·moment because we need to have community
14· ·leaders, people here in the audience who are
15· ·the ones spreading the message.· So I have
16· ·information on how you can apply for jobs
17· ·through the census so you can be out there
18· ·talking to the community, your neighbors as to
19· ·why the census is so important.

14· ·you said in your presentation about
15· ·undocumented, illegal people who are not
16· ·citizens.· These resources going to them when I
17· ·have a group, black legal Americans, who need

·3· ·resources, good jobs, contract and services.
·4· ·We need them, not undocumented, not -- and,
·5· ·Mr. Foreman, you don't take up for her.· You
·6· ·don't take up for her.· Now I'm finished.
·7· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Thank you.
·8· · · ·MS. WILLMAN:· I do want to mention that the
·9· ·black communities often (inaudible) of this
10· ·narrative, and there's over half a million
11· ·black undocumented immigrants living in the
12· ·United States.· So this is obviously an issue
13· ·that impacts all communities, not just one
14· ·demographic.
15· · · ·MR. CLEMENTS:· The concern that I have is
16· ·the Office of New America.
17· · · · PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Can you say your name
18· ·for the record.
19· · · ·MR. CLEMENTS:· I will.· My name is Mark
20· ·Clements.· I'm with Chicago Tortured Justice
21· ·Center.· And I would just like to know what
22· ·does that office represent and what it stands
23· ·for, because we've been in America all our

·1· ·the office of what Lori Lightfoot stated of
·2· ·individuals that are re-entering back into
·3· ·society from our prisons?
·4· · · · · · · · ·So I think people will take that
·5· ·as offensive.
·6· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· If I might, so, again
·7· ·this is the first of a series of meetings,
·8· ·right?
·9· · · ·MR. CLEMENTS:· I understand.
10· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· So we're going to have
11· ·a cross section of a lot of people coming.
12· ·This was relevant because of the ICE raids that
13· ·took place.· So we want to make sure that we're
14· ·bringing up issues that people in the community
15· ·are asking us about.· And so we invited Nubia
16· ·to come speak with us.
17· · · · · · · · ·But absolutely.· We're not trying
18· ·to -19· · · ·MR. CLEMENTS:· Mr. Foreman, I think also -20· ·and, you know, I'm just speaking.· But the
21· ·bottom line of it is, I think people are upset,
22· ·at least that attends these meetings, and when
23· ·we tell you sometimes it can be a little bit
24· ·disruptive, but I think they're upset because

·1· ·they don't understand the process of COPA.· And
·2· ·I think at these types of meetings, it will be
·3· ·a very great asset to the community if you can
·4· ·have someone from Mrs. Roberts' office to
·5· ·explain that office to the people, that way
·6· ·when they come here, they're not so up in arms.
·7· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· So you hit it on the
·8· ·head.· And the reason why we haven't started
·9· ·that way yet is because of the Consent Decree.
10· ·This is new for all of us, right?· We're trying
11· ·to make sure that -- we come and explain the
12· ·process to you today, the process changes
13· ·tomorrow, we have to come back and explain it
14· ·to you the next day.
15· · · · · · · · ·So we're trying to do this in a
16· ·way that we're getting used to it.· We're
17· ·running a little bit late because of that.
18· ·You're right.· And these process changes are
19· ·coming because of the feedback that we've been
20· ·getting from you all.
21· · · · · · · · ·So bear with us a little bit.· It
22· ·might not be starting exactly the way that you
23· ·want it to start.· We want this to be a good
24· ·dialogue.

·1· · · ·MR. CLEMENTS:· And I will go sit down after
·2· ·I say this.· But I think also, Mr. Foreman,
·3· ·that a lot of people in this room here is
·4· ·somewhat upset due to the fact that we have
·5· ·some police officers that receive 20, 25 and 30
·6· ·complaints of police misconduct and
·7· ·nothing -- at least that process is extremely
·8· ·too slow.· And it's like they're hoping that
·9· ·you die before the process is carried out.· And
10· ·even how you all may feel about Joseph Beal, we
11· ·believe that he's innocent.· Thank you.· Love
12· ·you all.

·2· ·constitutional?· Go back to some provision in
·3· ·the constitution, then come through the
·4· ·northwest ordinance to the Illinois
·5· ·constitution and connect up all the dots so we
·6· ·can see that this isn't something extra
·7· ·constitutional.· Thank you.· I don't want to
·8· ·take up my two minutes.
·9· · · ·MS. ROSE:· This is Natacki -- I'm Natacki
10· ·Rose.· And I definitely like to go on the
11· ·record.· I'm from the 7th Ward.· I definitely
12· ·stand with Civilian Police Accountability.· And
13· ·I think also if the Board actually -- well, I
14· ·don't want -- I believe that we should have
15· ·this board.· I believe in a democratic board,
16· ·that you all should be able to be selected by
17· ·the people for your positions first of all.
18· · · · PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Excuse me.· We'll get
19· ·to the comment section.
20· · · ·MS. ROSE:· Secondly, the Officer Ramos

·1· ·comment section.
·2· · · ·MS. ROSE:· For the lady about ICE.· Okay.
·3· ·That's what I'm about to get to but you
·4· ·interrupted me.
·5· · · · · · · · ·So when our police department
·6· ·spend so much money on officers like Officer
·7· ·Ramos and everything, it's hard for us to ask
·8· ·the young lady questions about ICE and the
·9· ·position that the police hold and the Police
10· ·Board hold because of the community and the
11· ·distrust between the community.
12· · · · · · · · ·So I would like to ask her like
13· ·how will we bridge these gaps because we have
14· ·no trust in you, and we have no trust in your
15· ·board, because you allow people like Officer
16· ·Ramos and stuff to, like, to come in.· So how
17· ·would she come in and help us as a community be
18· ·able to trust you all with ICE and everything?
19· ·Because I don't want ICE to take over our
20· ·communities either.
21· · · ·MS. WILLMAN:· I can speak a little bit to
22· ·the immigration component, which is what my
23· ·office really focuses on, and I also have a
24· ·chief of equity and racial justice who focuses

·1· ·on the broader context of social/racial justice
·2· ·with the Mayor's Office.
·3· · · · · · · · ·But as I mentioned before, I used
·4· ·to be an immigration attorney where I
·5· ·represented survivors of crimes, people who had
·6· ·been taken advantage of by their employers.· So
·7· ·one of my jobs is to bridge that gap, that
·8· ·mistrust.
·9· · · · · · · · ·One of the tools that I saw that
10· ·was very useful was the new visa.· I'm not sure
11· ·you are aware.· It's a special remedy through
12· ·immigration where you are a victim of a crime,
13· ·and you show that you cooperated with the
14· ·police, and they're able to then certify that
15· ·you cooperated and then you're able to apply
16· ·for a remedy.· So this is a tool that's really
17· ·helpful because it links both the communities
18· ·who may be often scared of reporting crimes and
19· ·allows the police also to build their trust in
20· ·their capacity within the communities so that
21· ·people are willing to report those crimes and
22· ·cooperate with them.· And so that remedy, I can
23· ·speak to the importance of it in the
24· ·immigration world, but certainly one of the

·1· ·tools that can be used where both people can do
·2· ·outreach to say this tool exists, victims of
·3· ·crime should be assessed, and that's one of the
·4· ·better examples I can give you.
·5· · · ·MS. ROSE:· The only thing I will say you
·6· ·probably should have got introduced within a
·7· ·better frame, because the community don't trust
·8· ·the Board, so that's why people coming up

·2· ·we'll get it at the end of September.· It will
·3· ·be out to the public shortly after that.
·4· · · · · · · · ·I also want to share our newest
·5· ·effort in transparency.· We've gone and created
·6· ·dashboards for the public that will focus on
·7· ·important aspects of the Chicago Police
·8· ·Department.
·9· · · · · · · · ·First dashboard focuses on
10· ·transparency around the gun offenders and
11· ·individuals that pose risk to our families and
12· ·communities.· So we're looking at how these
13· ·individuals are handled in the criminal justice
14· ·system, including the arrest initiated from the
15· ·Chicago Police Department.
16· · · · · · · · ·We'll also be rolling out a
17· ·series of transparency dashboards around police
18· ·use of force and internal investigations that
19· ·the public will be more knowledgeable about how
20· ·often use of force is being utilized and the
21· ·internal investigation that surrounds it.
22· · · · · · · · ·We're going to put these things
23· ·out for public comment to see what you all
24· ·think about it, so I'm eager to hear you all's

·1· ·Board meetings, and I surrounded myself with
·2· ·police officers, because I knew that every cop
·3· ·wasn't the cop that did that to me, and I
·4· ·wasn't going to allow myself to fear cops.· So
·5· ·I came here.· I came here, and I came here, and
·6· ·I came here, and I came here.· And what makes
·7· ·me the most upset -- please, please, folks.
·8· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Ms. Noel, hold on one
·9· ·second.· Can we please have -- audience, can we
10· ·give the speakers an opportunity to speak?
11· · · ·MS. NOEL:· Okay.· So when people came to
12· ·me, Martinez Sutton, Rekia's brother, Bettie
13· ·Jones' family, all these people, I knew that
14· ·they were going to experience the same thing
15· ·that I experienced.· I knew that because their
16· ·loved ones had been killed by cops, that they
17· ·were going to be afraid of them.· And so what I
18· ·did was I told them to come here and to speak
19· ·so that they, too, would have exposure therapy,
20· ·right?· They, too, would not fear police
21· ·officers.· Because good or bad, this guy
22· ·here -- I don't know.· Good or bad, good or
23· ·bad, if they put themselves in a situation, I
24· ·knew that they could recover faster.

·1· · · · · · · · ·So what bothers me, and I'll end
·2· ·with this, what bothers me is that I bring them
·3· ·here so you can trust and you look them up.
·4· ·You went and looked them up.· And that's on me,
·5· ·because I brought them here.· You look me up
·6· ·all you want.· As a matter of fact, I would
·7· ·have told you this story.· If Garry wanted to
·8· ·know anything about me, he could have called
·9· ·me.· I would have told him this.· But I brought
10· ·people here and they were exposed to that.· And
11· ·that makes me feel awful.· Awful.· Now let me
12· ·say this, they are afraid of police officers,
13· ·so this works.· But you did that -- this is my
14· ·work.· And you did that.· And if I didn't feel
15· ·betrayed by that police officer that did what
16· ·he did to me out in Westchester, I felt

18· ·just -- I cannot tell you how hurt I am that I

·7· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Good evening.· My name is

10· ·question is about my son Isaiah Jackson -11· ·deceased Isaiah Jackson murdered by CPD, shot
12· ·three times in his back on April the 24th,
13· ·2010.· Okay.· I have been working with COPA,
14· ·and COPA received -- as far as getting his DNA,
15· ·it's been a long road.· COPA received the DNA
16· ·and sent to the Illinois State Police
17· ·Department.· So now I'm just on hold.· I was
18· ·wondering what was taking so long after
19· ·speaking with a supervisor at the Illinois
20· ·State Police Department Synara Anderson, who
21· ·stated that a case that old in a police
22· ·shooting would get immediate attention.· So for
23· ·what reason it's taking so long for me to get
24· ·these DNA results, I don't know.

·3· ·phone how scared she was.· I can't say anything
·4· ·else.· I can't talk anymore.· You need to talk
·5· ·to the CPD.
·6· · · · · · · · ·I'm trying to figure out what's
·7· ·so important about this DNA sample that I've
·8· ·been fighting for this for nine years, and now
·9· ·that the Illinois State Police Department has
10· ·it in their possession, they still -- it still
11· ·hasn't been tested.
12· · · · · · · · ·Okay.· So August the 5th, 2019, I
13· ·spoke with another supervisor who they hadn't
14· ·had a chance to warn, Ms. Debra Dizinski,
15· ·stated that they been got these DNA samples in
16· ·June of 2010.· They got these DNA samples in
17· ·2010, nonstandard samples that was received
18· ·from the medical examiner and was sent back -19· ·the results was sent back to the CPD June the
20· ·21st, 2011.· There was nothing to compare these
21· ·nonstandard samples to.
22· · · · · · · · ·So I'm being put on hold for
23· ·nothing.· I'm being stalled for nothing because
24· ·you all know there was nothing there.

·1· ·think the police are taking our problem
·2· ·seriously.· It seems pretty much lawless on the
·3· ·11th and 12th.· We're having trouble -- it's a
·4· ·simple thing.· A business is -- it's becoming a
·5· ·hub of illegal activity because they're selling
·6· ·cigarettes to -- illegal cigarettes to many,
·7· ·many people, it's creating a whole hub, to shut
·8· ·down the business.· They're so open.· They're
·9· ·still so doing the same thing.
10· · · · · · · · ·I was told by Glen Brooks
11· ·probably a hundred times that this business
12· ·would be closed by now.· It was closed for two
13· ·weeks.· All right?· I first brought this to
14· ·Commander Chung almost two years ago when he
15· ·first started in the 12th.
16· · · · · · · · ·So I guess my question,
17· ·Superintendent, is, what are we going to do
18· ·next?
19· · · ·SUPERINTENDENT JOHNSON:· Okay.
20· ·Mr. Perryman, you want to give me the address

·4· ·My block was filled with police that night
·5· ·telling us that this would close and it would
·6· ·stop.· It never has.· What will the residents
·7· ·see the police doing to close down this drug

10· · · ·SUPERINTENDENT JOHNSON:· Mr. Barnhart, I
11· ·will look into your complaint.· I don't know
12· ·if -- you know, I will tell you this about drug
13· ·markets:· Often times we work on them, and you
14· ·won't see the undercover work going on over
15· ·there.· I'm not saying that's what's occurring.
16· ·That's why you don't always see what the police
17· ·are doing.· Sometimes we work with federal
18· ·partners depending how large the scale is.
19· · · · · · · · ·So I will look into it.· I will
20· ·get your number, and I will look into it and

·2· ·the next day the drug dealers at Springfield
·3· ·and Van Buren, and we've had no action since.
·4· ·So it appears that, Oh, we take away from here
·5· ·and we have to start over at the beginning

14· ·He suggested I read and review the 55-page
15· ·finding and decisions against Sergeant Franko,

17· ·and come back with an opinion for you.
18· · · · · · · · · ·After reading the entire
19· ·document, I've come to this conclusion.· Some
20· ·of the procedures regarding reporting and use
21· ·of audio equipment were lax.· I see nothing
22· ·that would have lended any other conclusion
23· ·that their actions did not warrant termination.

·8· · · · · · · · ·I applaud Mr. O'Malley's
·9· ·statement regarding Officer Sebastian.· Their
10· ·testimony was consistent with what she
11· ·believed.
12· · · · · · · · ·What I do suggest would be a
13· ·policy change.· Officers involved in a deadly
14· ·force shooting episode often describe one or
15· ·more alterations in perception, thinking and

·3· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Thank you.· David
·4· ·Dewar.
·5· · · ·MR. DEWAR:· My name is David Dewar.

I

·6· ·live in the 19th Ward.· I've been there 35
·7· ·years.· And I ran for alderman and I support
·8· ·good policing.· What happened to me was
·9· ·anything about good policing.
10· · · · · · · · ·In the year 2014, in front of my
11· ·house, I was arrested.· I was arrested because
12· ·somebody on my block, a William Hosty, he had
13· ·political pull.· He was in the union and the
14· ·police falsely arrested me.· I filed a federal
15· ·civil lawsuit.· Federal judge found on my
16· ·behalf that I won.· And through my discovery
17· ·process, I discovered a false arrest report.
18· ·And I can give you the specifics on how this
19· ·has been done to me, where they took my
20· ·original incident report with the RD and the
21· ·event number and switched them knowingly.· They
22· ·created a false incident report, and then they
23· ·created a false arrest report, thus creating a
24· ·false report on me.

·1· · · · · · · · ·They came over a year later in
·2· ·the year 2015 -- which I have this report, and
·3· ·they came over with six police officers in
·4· ·front of my house.· I had just left.· And they
·5· ·stayed for 30 minutes upon the request of the
·6· ·neighbor that had me arrested in the year 2014
·7· ·that has political favor and was able to get
·8· ·the police to do his bidding.· And I have this
·9· ·right here.· On this report it shows an arrest
10· ·was attempted to be made and it was coded out.
11· · · · · · · · ·So my question here is this, on
12· ·the Police Board it shows here the rules of
13· ·conduct, under item 14 it says, Making a false
14· ·or written report.· Now, we have the Jesse
15· ·Smollett trial coming up and Superintendent
16· ·Eddie Johnson says we want an apology from him
17· ·for doing that.· Where's my apology?· Where is
18· ·my apology from the police?· And how many more
19· ·other people have you done that to?
20· · · · · · · · ·I'm a middle-aged white guy and a
21· ·business owner, respected in the community and
22· ·this happened to me.· Where is the apology?
23· ·Where is the justice?· That's my question.· And

12· ·no breach of peace involved.
13· · · · · · · · ·You know, D'Anga and Votka

15· ·didn't have anything, she would have had a

18· ·she come up with nothing.
19· · · · · · · · ·You know, the fact is,

21· ·jeopardize the safety of this City for her

·4· ·This is part of a charter revocation project
·5· ·involved -- the City of Chicago, Cook County,
·6· ·State of Illinois, and there isn't place in the
·7· ·United States to get all these charters revoked
·8· ·because it's our opinion -- the learned opinion
·9· ·of all involved, that we can't do anything to
10· ·reinforce the continued existence in operation
11· ·of this nominal government because there's so
12· ·many breaches of God's law that it's more
13· ·conducive to the loss of souls than to the
14· ·salvation of souls.· So everything's got to be
15· ·scrapped.· We got to start from scratch.· Make
16· ·a correction.

·3· · · · · · · · ·Here's a question.· Can I get a

·5· ·of Chicago Police Department that some type of
·6· ·formula which binds both the City of Chicago
·7· ·and the Superintendent of the City of Chicago
·8· ·to stipulate components of knowledge in the
·9· ·possession of Superintendent of the Chicago
10· ·Police Department regarding the conveyances
11· ·postulated in these meetings, regardless of

16· ·civil liability, for the entirety of the
17· ·contents of any conveyance postulated in any
