 EXPLANATION
In March 13, 2013, the Board of Commissioners approved a contract award to Constellation
NewEnergy-Gas Division, LLC for the supply and delivery of natural gas to various CHA residential
sites and facilities for a base period of two (2) years for a not-to-exceed compensation amount of
$11,800,000, with three (3) one-year extension options reserved to the CHA. The base term of contract
is due to expire on March 31, 2015.
The Natural Gas Supply and Delivery Agreement offers CHA the opportunity to purchase its gas needs
at wholesale instead of retail, and enables the CHA to hedge against potential market price fluctuations
through the use of multi-tiered price/risk management options.
An extension of the agreement would allow the CHA to continue to purchase natural gas supplies from
non-utility sources and thereby reduce the CHA’s overall gas costs. The Department of Housing and
Urban Development has historically encouraged and offered incentives to housing authorities that
purchase their natural gas supplies at wholesale (wellhead) rates that are less than what the local gas
utility would ordinarily charge to retail gas customers. It is critical that the CHA continue to reduce its
energy costs through gas purchases made under the wellhead program.
This contract provides the supply and delivery of natural gas to all CHA family, senior and scattered
site properties in the CHA traditional public housing portfolio. The CHA continues to use People’s
Gas for the distribution of natural gas from the wholesale distribution point known as the Chicago
“Citygate” to actual CHA buildings; this local distribution cost is not included within the scope or
budget of this contract.
In recent years the decreases in the CHA’s natural gas consumption and costs were primarily due to
price/risk management strategies, building consolidations and closures, and energy-efficient retrofits.
The extension of this contract will allow the CHA to continue to purchase natural gas supplies
competitively in the wholesale market in an effort to continue reducing the CHA’s overall utility costs.
If authorized, this will be the first amendment of the existing contract, and the amount requested is
within the approved 2015 budget.
The CHA is recommending that the Board authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
execute an amendment extending Contract #11228 with Constellation NewEnergy-Gas Division, LLC
be extended for twelve (12) months by exercising the first one year option, from April 1, 2015 through
March 31, 2016, in the amount of $6,496,740.
