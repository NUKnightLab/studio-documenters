WHEREAS, on Tuesday, January 12, 2010, one of the most devastating natural disasters in recent
history occurred in Haiti, when an earthquake struck the nation, leading to mass destruction and the loss
of life; and

328

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 26, 2010

WHEREAS, hundreds of thousands of Haitians are feared dead, with the number expected to rise given
the lingering effects of the widespread devastation; and
WHEREAS, Haiti’s infrastructure has been severely damaged, with the collapse of religious institutions,
government offices, schools, homes and hospitals, leading to life-threatening shortages of food, water and
basic medical care; and
WHEREAS, this catastrophic event has caused acute distress, pain and suffering for the survivors in this
already poor country, resulting in an immediate need for food, clothing, shelter, medication and medical
services; and
WHEREAS, the long-term effects of a disaster of this magnitude are dire, and include a growing
incidence of starvation and malnourishment, epidemics and diseases, in addition to displacement and
devastation for upwards of two million people; and
WHEREAS, in the aftermath of this disaster, the County of Cook recognizes the need for combined
efforts of federal, state, and local governments to band together and provide aid to the Haitian community
and assist in coordinating ongoing relief efforts; and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook can assist in the recovery and humanitarian efforts in a number of
ways, including but not limited to coordination efforts and assistance from the Cook County Department
of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, the Health & Hospitals System, the Department of
Public Health, the Bureau of Administration and the Department of Facilities Management; and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook under the direction of President Todd H. Stroger is formulating
humanitarian efforts to assist the federal government and charitable organizations in response to this
devastating natural disaster, in part by coordinating efforts with the Cook County Homeland Security and
Emergency Management and with the Cook County Health & Hospitals System to provide necessary
health care professionals, services and supplies to aid the thousands of injured; and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook under the direction of President Todd H. Stroger will work with the
federal government to determine how Cook County departments and agencies may be of assistance in
Haitian rebuilding efforts; and
WHEREAS, Cook County employees, including nurses, physicians and others are making provisions to
travel to Haiti to assist in medical and humanitarian relief efforts, with some of them already on the
ground providing vital medical assistance; and
WHEREAS, to support putting medical professionals on the ground, the rebuilding of health clinics and
to provide ongoing assistance to the residents of Haiti, President Todd H. Stroger has launched an
employee fundraising drive and has requested that Cook County employees consider supporting Haitian
relief efforts by donating directly to Partners In Health at www.pih.org or at
www.standwithhaiti.org/haiti; the Haitian Crisis Relief Fund at www.haitiancongress.org and/or the
American Red Cross and its partners, including the global Red Cross and Red Crescent network and the
Haitian Red Cross, at www.redcross.org.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the various County agencies, including the Cook
County Health & Hospitals System, continue in their cooperative efforts to provide assistance in Haitian
relief efforts; and

329

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 26, 2010
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the various County agencies, Cook County Health & Hospitals
System and the separately elected officials continue to work together to determine what additional County

efforts; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners would
like to commend the employees who are volunteering their time and skills to aid in the relief efforts; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners, on

WHEREAS, the United States were founded by immigrants, who have traveled from around the world to
work hard, reunite with loved ones, flee danger and oppression, and seek a better life; and

330

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 26, 2010

WHEREAS, immigrants make up one out of every eight people living in the United States, one out of
every seven Illinoisans, and one out of every five residents of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the United States has an undocumented population of twelve million immigrants, including
half a million in Illinois, more than 300,000 of whom reside in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, immigrants, including the undocumented, make many contributions to our County,
including working, paying taxes, raising families, and involving themselves in our schools, churches,
neighborhoods, and communities; and
WHEREAS, these immigrants could contribute still more if given the opportunity to gain legal status,
which would enable them to gain more productive jobs, earn more, and pay more in taxes, and would in
particular enable immigrant youths to pursue education and serve our nation in the armed forces; and
WHEREAS, despite these contributions, undocumented immigrants are at risk of detention and
deportation, which would separate them from their spouses, children, and communities here in the United
States; and
WHEREAS, our current immigration system is broken, leading to long backlogs for legal immigration,
family separation, and workplace abuses that drive down wages and working conditions for all workers;
and
WHEREAS, any comprehensive reform must involve a path to citizenship for these hardworking
immigrants, as well as provisions to reunite families and meet our country’s labor needs while upholding
labor rights; and
WHEREAS, the recently drafted America’s Security and Prosperity Act (CIR ASAP) of 2009 (H.R.
4321), would provide comprehensive solutions to our nation’s immigration system, including a path to
citizenship; and
WHEREAS, enacting comprehensive immigration reform legislation like CIR ASAP would uphold our
nation’s basic values of fairness, equal opportunity, and respect for the law.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the President and the members of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners, do hereby support comprehensive immigration reform and memorialize the
Illinois Congressional delegation to urge the passage of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform for
America’s Security and Prosperity (CIR ASAP) Act of 2009 (H.R. 4321); and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be delivered to the President of
the United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President of the Senate, and the
Illinois Congressional Delegation.
Approved and adopted this 26th day of January 2010.

20 to 40 percent reduction in total vehicles; and
WHEREAS, the District of Columbia began a 6-month pilot program in a fleet management program in
October of 2009 with the goal of eliminating 150 vehicles from the city’s motor fleet; and
WHEREAS, at the end of the six-month pilot program, the District reduced the number of cars in its
passenger car fleet by 360 vehicles—17% of the original fleet—to yield an estimated savings of $6.6
million over five years; and

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CONSOLIDATION OF COOK COUNTY’S TECHNOLOGY
WHEREAS, Cook County has struggled for years to seek out the best approach to address the
technology requirements of all entities under the auspices of the County; and
WHEREAS, there has been resistance among some elected officials to consolidate into the County’s
main technology system due to concerns with privacy; and
WHEREAS, it has become evident that the County cannot continue financially to fund separate or
proprietary technology plans for different agencies and departments under the umbrella of the County;
and
WHEREAS, technology funding outside of the Bureau of Technology is significant: automation funding
is $30 million with 240 FTE’s; document storage costs are $26 million with 192 FTE’s; and technology
related to the 260 and 579 accounts is over $50 million annually; and
WHEREAS, it is clear that consolidation across all areas of technology will improve efficiencies and
save the County money, in 2010 the Bureau of Technology will save $700,000 by consolidating the
iSeries system into the mainframe and $450,000 by transitioning phone system maintenance to existing
staff; and

338

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 26, 2010
WHEREAS, of paramount importance in the consolidation process are privacy issues for independent
elected officials, and ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of important information. The Bureau of
Technology has already proven this can be accomplished as has been done in Maricopa, Los Angeles and
Miami Dade Counties in their IT consolidation programs; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board previously approved the consolidated approach to hardware,
software and technology related services, the County must now take the next step to consolidate all
technology investments, systems and applications.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Bureau of Technology will prepare to centralize
technology throughout the County by: preparing an Enterprise Architectural Plan for all County IT
operations; consolidate all IT spending including oversight of special purpose funds; continue to build a
disaster recovery site; convert historical paper records to electronic format along with other necessary
steps and present it to the President and Board of Commissioners prior to the 2011 budget process for
implementation into the 2011 budget.; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all departments, bureaus and agencies under the President, and all
office of County Elected Officials, are hereby directed to provide the Chief Information Officer, on or
before February 25, 2010, with detailed information identifying all county staff who are employed in
automation or technology related jobs, by job titles and position codes from the 2010 Executive Budget
and including the sources of funding for their salary (general funds, grant funds or special purpose funds)
and a description of their duties and responsibilities as they pertain to information technology; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Chief Information Officer will prepare a report containing an
analysis of the information collected under this directive, said report to be submitted to the President and
Board of Commissioners on March 16, 2010.

management system and preparedness capabilities in light of a recent scathing report from the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security on the state of emergency preparedness in the Chicago area; and
WHEREAS, due to the importance of this department and its goals to coordinate and prepare for
disasters it is incumbent upon this board to ensure the departments diligence in this vein and up to date on
its progress; and
WHEREAS, the best way to ensure the timely flow of information is to form a new committee to oversee

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII, Section 6 (a)
of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and perform any function
pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government has the responsibility for providing health care to the indigent
that no other County in the State has; and
WHEREAS, the demand for quality healthcare has increased over the years in addition to the State of
Illinois closing mental health hospital along with high unemployment rates and ex-offenders returning to
the community puts an overwhelming burden on Cook County to provide adequate healthcare; and
WHEREAS, the financial problems confronting Cook County and the County’s responsibility to fund
public safely makes it difficult to meet the needs of quality healthcare; and
WHEREAS, in an effort to ensure quality healthcare to every citizen it becomes necessary for the Cook
County Health & Hospitals System Board to become totally separate from the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, including financial independence; and

340

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 26, 2010
WHEREAS, the legislative body is the only authority that can create a taxing district to fund the Cook
County Health & Hospitals System Board in order that it become financially independent of the Cook
County Board; and
WHEREAS, such taxing districts as the Chicago School Board were afforded the opportunity to improve
education, similar authority would give the Health & Hospitals System Board a greater opportunity to
become independent of Cook County thus minimizing the politics and afford them an opportunity to bring
in revenue for the sole purpose of providing healthcare in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the tax levy shall not exceed the existing amount of taxes collected by the County Board for
the purpose of healthcare; and
WHEREAS, a permanent Health & Hospitals System Board with its own consistent revenue source
would be in the best interest of the citizens of Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners call upon the Governor and members of the General Assembly to grant authority to the
Health & Hospitals System Board to levy taxes for the sole purpose of providing healthcare in Cook
County.

THE HONORABLE EARLEAN COLLINS AND PETER N. SILVESTRI
COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE COMPLETION OF AN ECONOMIC IMPACT STUDY
AND CONSIDERATION OF THE CONFERENCES OF GOVERNMENT COMMENT BEFORE
ADOPTION OF THE COOK COUNTY WATERSHED MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD) assumed
authority for general supervision of stormwater management in Cook County pursuant to the passage of
Public Act 93-1049 (Act) by the Illinois State Legislature on November 17, 2004. The MWRD’s Board
of Commissioners adopted the Cook County Stormwater Management Plan (CCSMP) by ordinance on
February 15, 2007, as required per the Act as a first step in establishing the MWRD’s countywide
stormwater management program and the development of a stormwater management regulatory
ordinance; and

341

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 26, 2010

WHEREAS, the MWRD has proposed a Watershed Management Ordinance (WMO) which is intended
to protect Cook County citizens from increases in flooding, protect the county’s natural resources, and to
preserve and enhance water quality by fostering responsible development addressing stormwater
management; and
WHEREAS, our local governments are charged with planning for the future sustainability of the
community. Therefore, while the importance of proper storm water management is inherent, the
responsibility of local elected officials includes the protection of their residents and the protection of
opportunities for future economic development and redevelopment. Healthy, livable communities are
built and maintained with sustainable development activities which must include not only environmental
protection and enhancement but economic development and social benefits as well; and
WHEREAS, while the draft Watershed Management Ordinance addresses the environmental benefits, it
in no way addresses the economic or social impacts it mandates. The WMO as written could have
disastrous effects on suburban Cook County communities, especially those more disadvantaged than
others, where redevelopment is already stymied and for those communities that have little vacant land
available and redevelopment is their only hope of economic stimulus. The expertise of entities with
proven natural resource management capabilities and responsibilities, such as our municipalities and
watershed management organizations, must be utilized in the revision of the WMO; and
WHEREAS, it is imperative that the concerns of the Conferences of Governments (COGs) which include
the Southwest Municipal Conference (SMC), the South Suburban Mayors and Managers Association
(SSMMA), the Northwest Municipal Conference (NWMC), and the West Central Municipal Conference
(WCMC) be wholly addressed by the MWRD before the WMO is adopted. The following are the
recommendations and comments on the draft WMO shared by the COGs and the six Cook County
watershed planning councils: Lower Des Plaines, Poplar Creek, Upper Salt Creek, Little Calumet River,
Cal-Sag Channel, and the North Branch of the Chicago River.
1.

An economic impact study of the Watershed Management Ordinance should be
conducted.

2.

Review and permit authority should be delegated to qualified and willing municipalities.

3.

Establish permit review time benchmarks.

4.

Reexamine technical provisions of the draft WMO.

5.

Clearly delineate the responsibilities of co-applicants and examine the implications of the
WMO on them.

6.

Provide dual or multi-county municipalities with the option to adopt one ordinance.

7.

Revise and complete the Technical Guidance Manual to provide guidance on the
implementation of and compliance with the Watershed Management Ordinance.

8.

Include provisions that allow for a fee in lieu of detention.

9.

Provide a draft fee schedule for public review.

10.

Reexamine the absolute prohibition on stormwater detention facilities in the floodway.

342

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 26, 2010
11.

Revisit the definition of exempt projects related to “grandfathering” and local flood
control projects.

12.

Refrain from publishing or regulating by Detailed Watershed Plan (DWP) Inundation
Maps unless the District establishes administrative procedures and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) adopts the information contained therein as
Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMS); and

WHEREAS, the sustainability of our communities mandates consideration of the economic effects of the
Cook County Watershed Management Ordinance as proposed. Cook County cannot have an ordinance
that pushes even more development to surrounding counties with better taxing structures. An economic
impact study that captures the benefits and costs of the Ordinance is necessary before the WMO is
adopted.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does
hereby call upon the President and Commissioners of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of
Greater Chicago to seriously consider the concerns of our local governments and conduct an economic
impact study before the Cook County Watershed Management Ordinance is adopted; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to the President and
Board of the MWRD and let it also be spread upon the official proceedings of this Honorable Body.
Approved and adopted this 26th day of January 2010.

which has over 300 affiliates from 40 states; the Coalition works to dramatically increase access to tax
credits, benefits and asset-building opportunities for low-and moderate-low income individuals, families
and communities; and

resource.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does
hereby thank the Center for Economic Progress for its service to the people of Cook County; and

Cook County elected officials and all County officials make information about the Tax Counseling

THE HONORABLE TODD H. STROGER
PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
RECOGNIZING FEBRUARY AS NATIONAL SPAY AND NEUTER MONTH
WHEREAS, pet overpopulation results in an estimated 6-8 million animals entering shelters nationwide
each year; and
WHEREAS, tragically, only half of these animals find adoptive homes resulting in the euthanasia of 3-4
million animals per year across the nation; and
WHEREAS, spay/neuter is the only permanent, 100 percent effective method of birth control for dogs
and cats; and
WHEREAS, the spay/neuter procedure prevents various forms of cancer and bacterial infections thus
adding to the quantity and quality of the dog or cat’s life; and
WHEREAS, during the month of February, the Cook County Department of Animal and Rabies Control
conducts a spay/neuter rebate program that allows any citizen of Cook County with a valid rabies vaccine
to have their pet spayed/neutered at the veterinarian of their choice; and
WHEREAS, 5014 animals were spayed/neutered in the month of February 2009 in Cook County saving
the citizens of Cook County $190,000.00 through the Cook County Animal and Rabies Control Rebate
Program.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the month of February is recognized as Spay/Neuter
Month in Cook County; all residents and employees of Cook County are urged to have their pets spayed
or neutered to help stop pet overpopulation.

OFFICE OF THE COUNTY ASSESSOR
CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication, dated December 28, 2009 from
JAMES M. HOULIHAN, Cook County Assessor
by
JOHN M. FALLON, Special Assistant to the Assessor
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Cook County Suburban
Publishers, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, for publication of the state mandated publications, as follows: proposed
assessed values for the 2010 real estate triennial assessment of the North Townships outside the city of
Chicago; revisions made to the 2010 triennial assessment in North Townships outside the city of Chicago,
after publication of the initial triennial assessment publication; 2010 triennial assessment list in additional
newspapers for additional public notification as directed by the Assessor's office; revisions made to the
2010 real estate non-triennial assessment of South Townships outside the city of Chicago; and revisions
made as a consequence of the change in assessment practices to the 2009 real estate assessment of North
and South townships outside the city of Chicago.
Reason:

Cook County Suburban Publishers, Inc. has been the sole-source vendor for the publication of
Cook County's suburban townships assessment list since 2002. Prior to 2002, this same entity
published the assessment list for many years. During this time, prior to 2002, Cook County
Suburban Publishers, Inc. was the only vendor to submit a response when the annual contract
was sent out to bid. State statutes (35ILCS 200/12-20 and 715 ILCS 10/1 et seq.) impose
strict guidelines as to who may publish the assessment list for Cook County's suburban
townships. Therefore, due to the timely nature of publishing the assessment list, the
Assessor's Office requests that this contract be sole-sourced to Cook County Suburban
Publishers, Inc.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1,041,992.80. Contract period: May 1, 2010 through April 30 2011. (040240 Account). Requisition No. 00400008.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011 funds.
_________________________
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that request of the Cook County
Assessor be approved, as amended and that the County Purchasing Agent be authorized to enter into the
requested contract. The motion carried unanimously.

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY
PERMISSION TO ADVERTISE
Transmitting a Communication, dated December 30, 2009 from
BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to advertise for bids for the construction of the new
Residential Treatment Unit (RTU) - Reception Classification Diagnostic Center (RCDC) Building at the
Department of Corrections.
This project will provide a new facility to combine and house the Reception Classification Diagnostic
Center which processes admissions into the Department of Corrections (DOC), Cermak Health Services
of Cook County and the Residential Treatment Unit. The program includes new intake, holding, and
processing areas, clinics, medical services and associated administrative functions, dormitories and
auxiliary dormitory functions. In recent years, this system has had to respond to the demands of
increasing numbers of inmate admissions and mental health evaluations and treatment. The existing
RCDC and RTU facilities can no longer accommodate the volume of admissions, screenings and care
required. The facilities are overcrowded, basic amenities are inadequate, building systems are outdated
and in some cases non-functional.

396

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 26, 2010
The new facility will meet current ‘Essential Standards” set by the National Commission on Correctional
Health Care and the American Correctional Association and is required for maintaining accreditation and
will provide for an efficient and orderly intake process including, screening and provision of care.
Bond Issue (20000 Account).
This project was included in the 2009 Capital Improvement Program projects approved by the Board of
Commissioners on April 2, 2009.

Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved that the County Purchasing Agent be
authorized to advertise for bids. The motion carried unanimously.
