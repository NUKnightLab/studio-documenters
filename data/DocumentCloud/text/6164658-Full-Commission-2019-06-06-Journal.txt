REPORT FROM THE CHAIR
“A couple of items; one, I had an opportunity to meet with the chair of Oakland
County, Dave Woodward, and the chair of Macomb County, Bob Smith, on yesterday.
We were happy to finally meet, as Dave is the new chair of Oakland County and myself,
the new chair of Wayne County and we discussed having the Tri-County Summit
brought up again. I mentioned that earlier this year that I wanted to try to get that up and
running again, so we had a great meeting and we are looking to do that sometime in the
fall. We are going to meet with our respective bodies on topics. We threw out a lot of
different things yesterday. We want to narrow that down so please know in the next
coming days and weeks, I’ll be asking for your input or maybe your top three items that
you would like to discuss at the Tri-County Summit. Oakland County will host it and the
196

 location will probably be the Detroit Zoo in Oakland County so just be aware that I’ll be
asking for your input as we put that agenda together, and again, it will be sometime in
the fall, probably late October is what we were thinking. So just keep that in mind as we
move forward throughout this summer. Also, today, as many of you know, we
recognized the 75th anniversary of D-Day, the turning point, the fight to preserve
freedom during World War II. We honor the thousands of Allied troops who took part in
the extreme bravery and their valor in spite of grave danger that they faced on the
beaches of Normandy, France. We must always remember that the freedom that we
enjoy is a direct result of the sacrifices that they made 75 years ago and I am happy that
Commissioner Daub presented to us a resolution recognizing that and in under
resolutions she will discuss further the D-Day resolution that has been signed by all
Commissioners and we will have further discussion at that time.”

UNFINISHED BUSINESS
The Legislative Assistant advised that there was no Unfinished Business.
