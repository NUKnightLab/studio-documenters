HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: TERRY LEGGETT v. CITY OF DETROIT
CASE NO: 17-013615-NF
FILE NO: L17-00645

On September 17, 2018, a case evaluation panel evaluated the above-captioned lawsuit and
awarded Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars and No Cents in favor of the Plaintiffs in
the above referenced matter. The parties have until October 15, 2017, to either accept or reject the

case evaluation. Failure to file a written acceptance or rejection within this period constitutes a
rejection.

Based upon our review of the facts and particulars of this lawsuit, which are set forth in a
con?dential memorandum that is being separately hand?delivered to each member of Your
Honorable Body, it is our considered opinion that a settlement in the amount of Seventy-Five
Thousand Dollars and No Cents is the best interest of the City of Detroit.

We, therefore, request Your Honorable Body to authorize acceptance of the case
evaluation award; and, in the event Plaintiff accepts the award, to deem such acceptance as a
settlement and to direct the Finance Director to issue a draft in that amount payable to his

attorney, to be delivered upon receipt of a properly executed Release and Stipulation and Order
of Dismissal entered in Lawsuit 17-013615-NF.
