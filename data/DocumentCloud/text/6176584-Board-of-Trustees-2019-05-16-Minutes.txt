Delores Driver Appeal
Mr. Daniel J. Hurtado, Chief Legal Officer, reported that Ms. Delores Driver’s pension was recalculated
based on settlement information received from her employer and that Ms. Driver was present to appeal her
case before the Board. CTPF had determined that because Ms. Driver’s retirement date was moved forward,
she would need to repay the pension she had received prior to the new retirement date, which amounted to
$70,692.66. Mr. Hurtado addressed questions raised by the Board.
Speaking before the Board, Ms. Delores Driver appealed her case, contending that she had been doubletaxed, and that she had paid excessive health insurance premiums.
Mr. Hurtado informed Ms. Driver that her matter will be discussed in Executive Session and that the decision will be a final administrative decision. Mr. Hurtado explained the process to appeal the final administrative decision.

reported as part of Attucks' Total Market Value.

reported as part of Attucks' Total Market Value.

REPORT OF THE INVESTMENT COMMITTEE
Callan Associates
4th Quarter Real Estate Performance Report
Ms. Jan Mende of Callan Associates reviewed the fourth quarter real estate performance report ending
December 31, 2018. Ms. Mende reported that at the end of the fourth quarter the portfolio market value of
7.44% was below the 9.0% target. She stated that during 2018 there were multiple new commitments to the
non-core funds and the core portfolio was restructured. She reported that unfunded commitments include
Longpoint, Basis Investment Group Fund I, GreenOak US Fund III, Blackstone High Grade Debt Fund,
Oakstreet Real Estate Capital Fund IV, as well as the four non-core real estate funds selected in Q4 2018.
Ms. Mende stated that CTPF’s redemption request to fully redeem out of the UBS Fund was submitted and
CTPF received its first redemption distribution in October 2018. Proceeds from this sale will be reinvested
in Lion Industrial Trust, LaSalle Property Fund and PRISA SA. Ms. Mende addressed questions raised by
the Board.

FY 2019-2020 Real Estate Pacing Study
Ms. Mende reviewed the FY 2019-2020 Real Estate Pacing plan. She stated that the plan is developed with
the following assumptions (and updated annually): Target Core/Non-core mix of 75/25; Portfolio will be
diversified by property type and region via the Core portfolio; Dividends are reinvested in the Core portfolio; Non-core is expected to be return enhancer relative to Core; Portfolio will be diversified by manager;
Investments will continue to factor prominently into the portfolio; Investments will be made in primary
funds; MWDBE managers will continue to factor prominently into the portfolio; Investment is expected to
be predominately U.S. focused; and Non-U.S. exposure will be pursued opportunistically if the risk/return
is compelling relative to the U.S. Callan and staff recommended monitoring the Non-core market and considering allocating up to $50M for the 2019/2020 fiscal year, potentially adding new high-quality managers
to the list of partners and consider re-ups with strong, existing managers; to continue to monitor the market
for strong MWDBE managers; and to monitor the pace of funds in liquidation and review pacing in 2020 to
maintain real estate exposure. Ms. Mende addressed questions raised by the Board.

1st Quarter Performance Report
Ms. Angela Miller-May, Chief Investment Officer, and Mr. Angel Haddad, of Callan Associates, reviewed
the first quarter performance report ending March 31, 2019. They reported that the Fund was valued at
$10.6B at the end of the first quarter, representing an increase of approximately $800M from December 31,
2018. Investment gains of $859.4M more than offset negative net cash flow activity of $59.2M over the
period. They also reported that the Fund underperformed the Total Fund Benchmark by 37 basis points, net
of fees, but ranked in the 20th percentile of peers. They stated that overall, the portfolio’s asset allocation
was close to its strategic targets at quarter-end, reflecting a slight underweight to private equity and real
estate, and a slight overweight to fixed income. They addressed questions raised by the Board.

report ending September 30, 2018. They reported an overall net asset of $331M. They reported the distributed capital since inception is $870M. They also reported that the total private equity paid since inception is

DISCUSSIONS
Overpayment Report
Ms. Rosemary Ihejirika, Chief Benefits Officer, reviewed the report of pension overpayments. Ms.
Ihejirika stated that at the request of Chairperson Rodriguez, the “ongoing” tab title was changed to
“existing”, and that page numbers and titles were added to all reports. She reported that the
overpayment report is comprised of existing overpayments, overpayments due to death, overpayments
due to health insurance and overpayments due to return to work. She reported that there was an
addition to the “existing” tab in the overpayment report. She raised the issue of a particular
overpayment in which a minor survivor had been overpaid, and who age out before the overpayment

 MAY 16 771 2019

could be recouped by methods currently authorized under the Fund’s overpayment recoupment policy.
With regard to the reason for the overpayment, she stated that adjustments were recently sent to CTPF
by Chicago Public Schools (CPS), which caused CTPF to go back and look at their records.
With regard to death overpayments, Ms. Ihejirika noted that the largest overpayments have been
referred to Board counsel for possible legal action to attempt recovery. Ms. Ihejirika addressed
questions raised by the Committee.
Chairperson Rodriguez requested that a new column be added to the spreadsheet to indicate whether a
member had applied for a financial hardship.
Chairperson Rodriguez inquired about the process of how money is recouped by the Fund when an
overpayment has been made.
Ms. Ihejirika stated that in the event of death overpayment the Fund does an ACH reversal, and if all
money is not recouped by the ACH reversal, the Fund will deduct the balance owed from the death
benefit.
Chairperson Rodriguez inquired about the timeframe within which data adjustments can be sent from
CPS and what can be done to address the problem.
Ms. Ihejirika stated that CTPF cannot predict when and why CPS will submit adjustments, but that is
often the case. She stated that there are several initiatives in progress to resolve data issues and gave
examples of the CTPF and CPS weekly meetings as well as the AUP and Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU).
Chairperson Rodriguez inquired about the process of how data is received by CTPF.
Ms. Ketki Shah, Compliance Manager stated that data is sent and loaded to PGOLD/BradPen. The data is
processed by the system, which will issue exceptions and that the Data Quality team will then re-audit
the account. Once the account is re-audited, it is rerouted to the Benefits team and the benefit is
recalculated. When an account is re-audited, it can either be underpaid or overpaid.
Chairperson Rodriguez requested that a closing date be added to the Overpayment report. She noted
that there was a member on the report that should no longer be on the report due to Board action.
Preliminary Pension Audit Report
Ms. Ihejirika reviewed the Pension Audits Monthly Trend Analysis for March 2019 to April 2019. Ms.
Ihejirika reviewed Outstanding Pension Audits as of April 2019. Ms. Ihejirika addressed questions raised
by the Committee.
Ms. Ihejirika noted that descriptive titles and page numbers were added to all reports, as requested by
Chairperson Rodriguez.
Chairperson Rodriguez requested that the agenda reflect the name of the reports presented at the
meeting.
Trustee Padilla requested clarification on the time frame to finalize a pension.

 MAY 16 772 2019

Ms. Ihejirika stated that delays in finalizing a pension or processing a benefit are usually due to absence
of data or bad data. She noted that the reports reflect that the finalization of pension benefits can take
from 6 months to more than 3 years.
Chairperson Rodriquez requested that the report regarding pension audits include the date upon with
the audits were initiated.
Member Services Calls Report
Ms. Ihejirika reviewed the Member Services Calls report.
Chairperson Rodriguez inquired whether there were any holidays in the month of March.
Ms. Ihejirika stated that there were no holidays for the month of March.
Ms. Ihejirika addressed questions raised by the Committee.

reports created by Staff. She noted that after the manual reports were created, they were able to
generate reports from the call manager software. Hard copies of the reports that were distributed at

manager report was not uploaded to BoardDocs.

Communications Department: external communications, print/digital publications, and digital
communications. A summary of each category was provided.

printed newsletters, CTPF member forms, the CAFR/PAFR, Board of Trustees Meeting Minutes, health
insurance communications, election communications, and the Governor’s and Senate reports. Digital
publications include monthly E-News, E-lerts, webinars, social media, website (ctpf.org), employee
newsletters, and event and member information. Ms. Schroeder addressed questions raised by the
Committee.

agenda. They discussed in detail SB 1584 which amends the law to allow retired CTPF members to
return to work for 120 days beginning with the 2019-2020 school year. The current law allows for retired
CTPF members to return to work for 100 days. The lobbyists mentioned that the Chicago Teachers Union

and earn $36,000 instead of $30,000. The lobbyists discussed other legislation and addressed questions
raised by the Committee.

Report on Employer Delinquencies and Payroll Audit Adjustments
Mr. Roshan Muringothu and Ms. White presented and reviewed the Monthly Aging Report for employer

Recommendation Regarding Acero Waiver Request $227.33
Ms. White reported that Jill Morgan, who reports pension contributions to CTPF through the ERS, experienced
login troubles, which delayed reporting. After the User was able to log into the system, ERS displayed errors
when updating an employee’s status. The User was trying to update an employee status from active to
terminated but ERS was not accepting the change. Since the Employment status was not accepting the change
the member displayed active while uploading the payroll submission, which was incorrect. This delayed
reporting the payroll submission for 01/16/2019-01/31/2019. Ms. White stated that the compliance
department recommends waiving the fees and penalties for payroll period 01/16/2019-01/31/2019.
Motion to Adopt Staff Recommendation to Grant Acero Waiver Request and to Refer to the Full
Board, Approved
Mr. Redfeairn made a motion, seconded by Ms. Rodriguez, to accept staff’s recommendation to waive the fee
and to refer the same to the full Board. The motion passed unanimously.

Presentation by Patricia Kubistal
Ms. Patricia Kubistal, a retired member, asked the Board to consider changing the current enrollment and
eligibility policy for CTPF retiree health insurance plans.
Review of Health Insurance Consulting RFP Results
Ms. Rosemary Ihejirika, Chief Benefits Officer, stated that The Segal Company (Segal) has been CTPF’s
provider of Health Insurance Consulting Services since 2015. She noted that Segal’s contract is ending;
therefore a Request for Proposal (RFP) was issued for health insurance consulting services to include the
annual renewal process, ongoing compliance, as well as procurement and claims auditing optional
services.

 MAY 16 788 2019

Ms. Ihejirika reported that CTPF received two proposals from reputable vendors: Segal (the incumbent)
and Aon (our consultant during the term prior to the start of the Segal engagement). She stated that AON
and Segal will be presenting to the Committee.
Presentations by Health Insurance Consulting Finalists
Representatives from AON and Segal presented to the Committee. They reviewed organization, strategy,
performance, firm diversity and fees. They addressed questions raised by the Committee.
Ms. Ihejirika stated that based on final evaluation and scoring, the Staff Committee recommended
awarding the bid to the incumbent, Segal. As the current health insurance consultant, Segal has historical
knowledge and familiarity with CTPF’s current health insurance program. Segal has consistently provided
positive results and CTPF will retain the current high performing team, at a competitive price. Although
both respondents provided strong proposals and presentations, the Staff Committee finds that it will be
most beneficial to CTPF to retain Segal. Ms. Ihejirika addressed questions raised by the Committee.
Motion to Award Contract to Segal, Approved
Ms. Reilly made a motion, seconded by Mr. Blackwell, to accept staff’s recommendation to award the bid
to the incumbent, Segal. The motion passed unanimously.

RFP Selection for Master Service and Product Service Agreements (MPSA) covering
Information Technology Purchase
Representatives from Envision and MTM presented to the Committee. They reviewed
organization, strategy and products. They addressed questions raised by the Committee.
Ms. Vandana Vohra, Chief Technology Officer, stated that a committee of staff members was
created from the Information Technology and Internal Audit departments. This committee
worked together to compile the scope and technical requirements for the RFP that was issued
on February 27, 2019.
CTPF received two proposals that were reviewed, evaluated, and scored by the RFP committee
based on the following four categories of criteria: pricing (whether it is reasonable/acceptable),
reputable company (whether the respondent has a favorable background, experience, and
qualifications), comprehensive master agreement, and product offerings (whether they are of
potential value to CTPF). The scores were tallied and both respondents were promoted to the
oral presentation round. The RFP committee further evaluated the presenters on the above four
criteria.

 MAY 16 790 2019

Ms. Vohra stated that the RFP committee recommends entering into Master Product and
Services Agreements with both vendors for the following advantages:
•
•

•

Each vendor offers products and services that are specified and budgeted in the Fund’s
upcoming fiscal year.
The Gold and Platinum designations carried by each reseller attest to the competency
and qualifications recognized by their respective vendors. Although the Fund currently
acquires some of these products and services from other resellers, having a wider
selection of partners to work with affords the Fund the opportunity to leverage
competition for the best value and return on investment.
Each company is recognized by customers and peers as highly reputable and well
established serving small, medium, and large clients throughout the Chicagoland area.

Ms. Vohra addressed questions raised by the Committee.
The Committee agreed to make recommendation to the full Board at the May 16, 2019 Board
meeting to enter into a Master Product and Services Agreements with Envision and MTM.
Status Updates—Business Technology Projects
Ms. Vohra reviewed a PowerPoint presentation demonstrating progress on various technology
projects undertaken by IT staff. The Business Technology projects include the Enterprise
Pension Administration System Transformation, Employer Reporting Portal, Data Quality
Improvements, Member Self-Service Portal and Infrastructure Modernization.
Ms. Vohra stated that the RFI for Enterprise Pension Administration System replacement
initiative for an improved comprehensive integrated solution providing improved workflow and
data analytics has been posted for the Enterprise Pension Administration System and vendor
presentations are ongoing. She stated that a team of fifteen from various departments, benefits,
compliance, finance, member services, internal audit, and IT are seeing the vendor
presentations and learning about the product offerings. She informed that the team is seeing
that there are mature comprehensive modular application systems existing in the market that
the fund can benefit from. She stated that the new solution will determine long-term technology
profile and technology costs, the Fund would carry for 10+ years. She also mentioned that after
The Board of Trustees makes decisions for the future the next step would be to create a RFP
for the Pension Administration system. Ms. Mary Cavallaro stated that the RFP creation process
is an important step and system requirements need to be clearly defined. She also emphasized
the importance to utilize an external firm to help create a RFP for this engagement. Ms. Vohra
mentioned that she created a placeholder for RFP creation professional services in the FY2020
Budget.
Ms. Vohra updated the Committee on the Employer Reporting Portal. Ms. Vohra stated that
Release 4 is targeted for May 2019 implementation. She stated that Release 4 features include
Fiscal Year Calendar Setup, Enhanced Help Desk Functionality, ISBE Integration and Charter
Holder Data Collection. She stated that development for Release 4 has been completed and
user testing is in progress.
