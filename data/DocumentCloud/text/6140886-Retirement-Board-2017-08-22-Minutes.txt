Cash Needs
Mr. Walsh reported the cash needs for September 2017 and the source of the funds.

ADMINISTRATIVE REPORT
Updated 2018 Funding Resolution
Mr. Walsh reviewed the events that transpired following LABF’s adoption of a funding resolution at the June 20, 2017
Board meeting. Mr. Walsh reminded the Board that due to: (1) the introduction of the ordinance seeking to amend the
Municipal Code of the City of Chicago to authorize the City to make additional employer pension contributions, (2)
the enactment of Public Act 100-0023, and (3) a request from Trustee Brown at the July 18, 2017 Board meeting to
provide additional time to consider the matter, the Fund temporarily refrained from sending a funding request to the
City. Mr. Walsh asked the Board how they would like to proceed with respect to the request.
In light of the new legislation, the Board discussed whether certain financial obligations of the City were already
included in the actuarially-based funding that is included in Public Act 100-0023, which became law on July 6, 2017.
Trustee Brown recommended that the Fund draft a letter to Corporation Counsel seeking an opinion on the matter.
It was moved by Trustee LoVerde, seconded by Trustee Brown, to approve Draft 1 of the funding resolution and
simultaneously seek an opinion from Corporation Counsel regarding pension contributions associated with members
receiving duty disability benefits. See attached document.
Roll-call:

For-- Trustees Keane, LoVerde, Summers, Hamburger Capasso, Brown and Joiner.
Against -- None.

Legislative Matters/Discussion of Potential Administrative Rules
Mr. Walsh proposed adopting administrative rules over the course of the next several months to address administrative
challenges that the Fund faces as a result of Public Act 100-0023 (PA 100-0023) becoming law.
It was moved by Trustee LoVerde, seconded by Trustee Joiner, to adopt rules 1 and 2. See attached document.
Roll-call:

For-- Trustees Keane, LoVerde, Summers, Hamburger, Capasso, Brown and Joiner.
Against -- None.

Separately, Mr. Walsh discussed issues and ambiguities that exist concerning the determination of employer
contributions associated with members who have taken leaves of absence from the City to work for local labor
organizations.
Finally, Mr. Walsh informed the Trustees of an addition to Charter 65 of the Illinois Compiled Statues included in PA
100-0023 that allows the City to assign all or a portion of any revenues or taxes received by the City from the State to
a separate legal entity (corporation, trust, etc.) established for the sole purpose of issuing debt obligations for the
benefit of the City. Mr. Walsh explained that the assignment is irrevocable and that the City has no legal right to any
funds once assigned. Mr. Walsh expressed concern that this could interfere with the Fund’s new ability under PA
100-0023 (40 ILCS 5/11-169) to intercept State funds, if needed, and that it could result in fewer dollars available in
the City’s General Fund to meet the City’s future obligations to the pension funds and other creditors. Mr. Walsh
recommended that the Trustees seek clarification regarding the mechanics of these new provisions.
Trustee Brown, in her capacity as CFO of the City of Chicago, provided some clarification explaining that: (1) the
“intercept” language only referred to State grant money and no other types of revenue or tax payments, (2) the City
has always had the ability to pledge revenue streams for the purpose of issuing and making debt service payments on
debt instruments, (3) the sales tax money and personal property replacement tax (PPRT) money flowing through the
State to the City is currently used to back special revenue obligations and, therefore, do not flow into the City’s General
Fund and (4) no other taxes or revenues flow through the State into the City’s General Fund.
Questions remained as to the impact the law may have on the Fund. The discussion served to introduce the matter to
the Trustees and the matter will be discussed further at a later Board meeting.
LABF Staff/Annuitant Health Insurance
Mr. Walsh discussed the upcoming renewal dates for the two separate healthcare plans covering LABF employees
and retirees that will expire in December 2017 and January 2018. He explained that the Fund expects to have the exact
numbers by the upcoming Board meeting at which time the Board can discuss the matter in greater detail.

Miscellaneous
Payment Advices - The Trustees discussed changing the frequency at which payment advices are sent to annuitants
from the current 12 times per year to 3 times per year. This change could save the Fund approximately $21,000 per

Mesirow Insurance Services, Inc.,
an Alliant-owned company

 Executive Summary
Alliant/Mesirow Insurance Services, Inc. appreciates
the opportunity to present our Management Liability
insurance capabilities to Laborers’ and Retirement
Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of
Chicago.

We author articles on management liability and the
exposures faced by the public sector, we continually
keep abreast of public pension issues and consult
with our clients on those issues as it relates to
insurance exposures and risk management and
finally, we are regular speakers at conferences
regarding risk management for pension fund trustees
for both NASRA and NCPERS.

Alliant’s experience with large public entity
exposures and the development of group purchase
programs dates back to 1977 when our public entity
division was established. Over the past 40 years we
have become a nationally recognized leader in this
specialized market sector.

Below is a limited list of retirement system clients,
demonstrating our experience:

As we developed a variety of programs for the
public sector we knew that our model and concept
could be duplicated nationally for management
liability coverage of retirement systems.







As a result, we created the first ever fiduciary and
management liability program in the country
designed to allow systems to band together and drive
down the insurance marketplace in addition to
leveraging broader coverage than what typically can
be obtained as a standalone entity.








Our strategic alliance with both NASRA and
NCPERS allow their members to access our
exclusive program; resulting in significant savings to
some of the largest systems in the country.







We understand the complexity of retirement
exposures and are leading experts in designing
coverage that is specifically tailored for our clients’
needs. We have an entire claims division that
handles claim situations that arise.

 Waiver of Recourse
With the enactment of ERISA in 1974, Trustees of employee benefit plans became personally liable for their acts
on behalf of the participants of those plans. Fiduciary Liability Policies became very popular, but ERISA only
allowed the Trust Funds themselves to purchase insurance to protect the funds - not the respective trustees.
Therefore, a nominal fee was charged directly to the Trustees as a way to circumvent this provision.
Although Public Pension Funds are not subject to ERISA law, the various state pension codes often follow in the
“spirit of ERISA”. In addition, as the Fiduciary Liability policies were originally drafted to protect ERISA plans,
the waiver provision followed across Non-ERISA plans.
With that said, we have been successful in petitioning the carriers to waive their recourse to the trustees without
having to charge, unless there is a requirement within the respective governing code. As Public Pension Codes
typically have no such provision, we no longer need to charge the trustees for the waiver of recourse. The trustees
still retain the same full coverage as provided in the past.

Compensation
Alliant/Mesirow Insurance Services, LLC is compensated for our risk management, insurance placement,
marketing, policy issuance and other insurance services for this insurance program using a commission based
compensation plan.
As the different carriers provide distinct commission schedules, we have outlined the commission schedules from
carriers that we provide this insurance coverage. Please note that commissions paid do not influence our
recommendations for coverage placements:

 Fiduciary Liability Insurance
For Public Pension Funds
Trustees and staff members of governmental,
municipal and quasi-governmental pension plans
face increased exposure in their fiduciary roles.
Allegations of breaches of duty are costly to defend,
and may result in personal liability of the trustees.
Mesirow Insurance Services, Inc.’s Insurance
Service experts provide the following summary of a
typical State Pension Code, and offer a solution to
lessen your fiduciary exposure.

INSURANCE AUTHORIZATION &
INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS
Each board and pension fund is often authorized to
purchase insurance to protect against liability of
trustees, staff and employees which may arise as a
result of claims.
State Pension Codes generally permit, but do not
guarantee, the indemnification of trustees and
employees of the Fund – however, this
indemnification is provided for allegations other
than willful misconduct or gross negligence
(properly structured insurance programs will not
exclude allegations of willful misconduct or gross
negligence).

PENSION CODE STANDARDS & FIDUCIARY
DUTIES
The fiduciary duties under most State Pension Codes
mirror standards similar to those outlined in ERISA.
These duties include acting solely in the interest of
the participants & beneficiaries, adhering to the socalled “prudent investor” standard and other
provisions of the State Pension Code.

IN SUMMARY
State Pension Codes require fiduciaries to adhere to
many of the same standards outlined in ERISA.
Breaches of established fiduciary duties may
translate into personal liability for the trustees of
public pension funds. These same Pension Codes
allow for the purchase of insurance to protect the
plan, the trustees and the staff from such liability.

ENFORCING PROVISIONS & LIMITATIONS
ON LIABILITY
State Pension Codes normally provide that
participants, beneficiaries, fiduciaries and/or the
Attorney General may bring suits to enforce
fiduciary duties and other provisions of the
respective Pension Code.

Our professionals at Mesirow Insurance Services,
Inc. are experienced in prudently structuring
comprehensive fiduciary liability insurance
programs to provide trustees with added protection
in their roles as fiduciaries of public pension funds.

State Pension Codes often do not provide complete
limitations on liability and make clear that litigation
against fiduciaries is permissible. A fiduciary that
breaches his/her duty can be held personally liable to
make good to such Fund any losses resulting from
such breach.

All coverages and exclusions are not included on this page. Please refer to policy for all applicable terms and conditions. Additional limits and/or changes
may be available after review and acceptance by insurer.

 Public Act 97-0651 (House Bill 3813):
We reference the below as an example of changing legislation that can affect the responsibilities, and therefore
liabilities, of Trustees. The below is an amendment to the responsibilities imposed upon fiduciaries by the IL
State Pension Code. As the Fiduciary Liability policy is intended to cover board members (and employees) for
breaches of these stated responsibilities, defense coverage would be provided for alleged breaches of such
duties/responsibilities.
Public Act 97-0651 Further amends the Illinois Pension Code. Provides that any reasonable suspicion by any
appointed board member of a retirement system created under the Code of a false statement/record being
submitted or permitted by a person under the Code shall be immediately referred to the board of trustees or the
State's Attorney of the jurisdiction where the alleged fraudulent activity occurred. The board of trustees of this
retirement system or shall immediately notify the State's Attorney of the jurisdiction where any alleged fraudulent
activity occurred for investigation

 Claim Reporting
The ramification of the current insurance market
condition from the claims prospective is that
insurance carriers are much stricter in claims being
reported promptly. Therefore, we recommend all of
our clients inform us (or your appropriate carrier) as
soon as possible when first made aware of an
incident, accident, lawsuit, or circumstance which
could give rise to a claim.

These comprehensive forms along with Claim
Handling Tips and reporting instructions for your
insurer’s claims departments can be accessed by
visiting our website:
http://www.alliant.com/property/claimreporting/defa
ult.jsp
If you have difficulty reporting any claim, you can
also contact our claim department who will assist in
filing the matter with the insurance company. You
may call, fax or email your claim materials to our
office:

What could happen if you delay reporting a new
claim?



The carrier could reserve rights against you
and offer less than 100% of what is due.
The claim could be denied in its entirety.

Phone: 312.595.6200 (avalable 24/7)
Fax: 312.595.6506
Email: claimsreporting@alliant.com

Prompt claim reporting begins with the immediate
investigation into the facts and circumstances of an
accident, work related injury or allegation. Every
such incident, no matter how minor, should be
investigated as soon as possible. In order to assist
you in preparing and reporting claims, Mesirow
Insurance Services maintains a directory of accident
investigation forms and contact numbers for your
insurers claim departments.

Mesirow Insurance Services, Inc.,
an Alliant-owned company

 Executive Summary
Alliant/Mesirow Insurance Services, Inc. appreciates
the opportunity to present our Management Liability
insurance capabilities to Laborers’ and Retirement
Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of
Chicago.

We author articles on management liability and the
exposures faced by the public sector, we continually
keep abreast of public pension issues and consult
with our clients on those issues as it relates to
insurance exposures and risk management and
finally, we are regular speakers at conferences
regarding risk management for pension fund trustees
for both NASRA and NCPERS.

Alliant’s experience with large public entity
exposures and the development of group purchase
programs dates back to 1977 when our public entity
division was established. Over the past 40 years we
have become a nationally recognized leader in this
specialized market sector.

Below is a limited list of retirement system clients,
demonstrating our experience:

As we developed a variety of programs for the
public sector we knew that our model and concept
could be duplicated nationally for management
liability coverage of retirement systems.







As a result, we created the first ever fiduciary and
management liability program in the country
designed to allow systems to band together and drive
down the insurance marketplace in addition to
leveraging broader coverage than what typically can
be obtained as a standalone entity.








Our strategic alliance with both NASRA and
NCPERS allow their members to access our
exclusive program; resulting in significant savings to
some of the largest systems in the country.







We understand the complexity of retirement
exposures and are leading experts in designing
coverage that is specifically tailored for our clients’
needs. We have an entire claims division that
handles claim situations that arise.

 Waiver of Recourse
With the enactment of ERISA in 1974, Trustees of employee benefit plans became personally liable for their acts
on behalf of the participants of those plans. Fiduciary Liability Policies became very popular, but ERISA only
allowed the Trust Funds themselves to purchase insurance to protect the funds - not the respective trustees.
Therefore, a nominal fee was charged directly to the Trustees as a way to circumvent this provision.
Although Public Pension Funds are not subject to ERISA law, the various state pension codes often follow in the
“spirit of ERISA”. In addition, as the Fiduciary Liability policies were originally drafted to protect ERISA plans,
the waiver provision followed across Non-ERISA plans.
With that said, we have been successful in petitioning the carriers to waive their recourse to the trustees without
having to charge, unless there is a requirement within the respective governing code. As Public Pension Codes
typically have no such provision, we no longer need to charge the trustees for the waiver of recourse. The trustees
still retain the same full coverage as provided in the past.

Compensation
Alliant/Mesirow Insurance Services, LLC is compensated for our risk management, insurance placement,
marketing, policy issuance and other insurance services for this insurance program using a commission based
compensation plan.
As the different carriers provide distinct commission schedules, we have outlined the commission schedules from
carriers that we provide this insurance coverage. Please note that commissions paid do not influence our
recommendations for coverage placements:

 Fiduciary Liability Insurance
For Public Pension Funds
Trustees and staff members of governmental,
municipal and quasi-governmental pension plans
face increased exposure in their fiduciary roles.
Allegations of breaches of duty are costly to defend,
and may result in personal liability of the trustees.
Mesirow Insurance Services, Inc.’s Insurance
Service experts provide the following summary of a
typical State Pension Code, and offer a solution to
lessen your fiduciary exposure.

INSURANCE AUTHORIZATION &
INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS
Each board and pension fund is often authorized to
purchase insurance to protect against liability of
trustees, staff and employees which may arise as a
result of claims.
State Pension Codes generally permit, but do not
guarantee, the indemnification of trustees and
employees of the Fund – however, this
indemnification is provided for allegations other
than willful misconduct or gross negligence
(properly structured insurance programs will not
exclude allegations of willful misconduct or gross
negligence).

PENSION CODE STANDARDS & FIDUCIARY
DUTIES
The fiduciary duties under most State Pension Codes
mirror standards similar to those outlined in ERISA.
These duties include acting solely in the interest of
the participants & beneficiaries, adhering to the socalled “prudent investor” standard and other
provisions of the State Pension Code.

IN SUMMARY
State Pension Codes require fiduciaries to adhere to
many of the same standards outlined in ERISA.
Breaches of established fiduciary duties may
translate into personal liability for the trustees of
public pension funds. These same Pension Codes
allow for the purchase of insurance to protect the
plan, the trustees and the staff from such liability.

ENFORCING PROVISIONS & LIMITATIONS
ON LIABILITY
State Pension Codes normally provide that
participants, beneficiaries, fiduciaries and/or the
Attorney General may bring suits to enforce
fiduciary duties and other provisions of the
respective Pension Code.

Our professionals at Mesirow Insurance Services,
Inc. are experienced in prudently structuring
comprehensive fiduciary liability insurance
programs to provide trustees with added protection
in their roles as fiduciaries of public pension funds.

State Pension Codes often do not provide complete
limitations on liability and make clear that litigation
against fiduciaries is permissible. A fiduciary that
breaches his/her duty can be held personally liable to
make good to such Fund any losses resulting from
such breach.

All coverages and exclusions are not included on this page. Please refer to policy for all applicable terms and conditions. Additional limits and/or changes
may be available after review and acceptance by insurer.

 Public Act 97-0651 (House Bill 3813):
We reference the below as an example of changing legislation that can affect the responsibilities, and therefore
liabilities, of Trustees. The below is an amendment to the responsibilities imposed upon fiduciaries by the IL
State Pension Code. As the Fiduciary Liability policy is intended to cover board members (and employees) for
breaches of these stated responsibilities, defense coverage would be provided for alleged breaches of such
duties/responsibilities.
Public Act 97-0651 Further amends the Illinois Pension Code. Provides that any reasonable suspicion by any
appointed board member of a retirement system created under the Code of a false statement/record being
submitted or permitted by a person under the Code shall be immediately referred to the board of trustees or the
State's Attorney of the jurisdiction where the alleged fraudulent activity occurred. The board of trustees of this
retirement system or shall immediately notify the State's Attorney of the jurisdiction where any alleged fraudulent
activity occurred for investigation

 Claim Reporting
The ramification of the current insurance market
condition from the claims prospective is that
insurance carriers are much stricter in claims being
reported promptly. Therefore, we recommend all of
our clients inform us (or your appropriate carrier) as
soon as possible when first made aware of an
incident, accident, lawsuit, or circumstance which
could give rise to a claim.

These comprehensive forms along with Claim
Handling Tips and reporting instructions for your
insurer’s claims departments can be accessed by
visiting our website:
http://www.alliant.com/property/claimreporting/defa
ult.jsp
If you have difficulty reporting any claim, you can
also contact our claim department who will assist in
filing the matter with the insurance company. You
may call, fax or email your claim materials to our
office:

What could happen if you delay reporting a new
claim?



The carrier could reserve rights against you
and offer less than 100% of what is due.
The claim could be denied in its entirety.

Phone: 312.595.6200 (avalable 24/7)
Fax: 312.595.6506
Email: claimsreporting@alliant.com

Prompt claim reporting begins with the immediate
investigation into the facts and circumstances of an
accident, work related injury or allegation. Every
such incident, no matter how minor, should be
investigated as soon as possible. In order to assist
you in preparing and reporting claims, Mesirow
Insurance Services maintains a directory of accident
investigation forms and contact numbers for your
insurers claim departments.

All coverages and exclusions are not included on this page. Please refer to policy for all applicable terms and conditions. Additional limits and/or changes

Mesirow Insurance Services, Inc.,
an Alliant-owned company

 Executive Summary
Alliant/Mesirow Insurance Services, Inc. appreciates
the opportunity to present our Management Liability
insurance capabilities to Laborers’ and Retirement
Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of
Chicago.

We author articles on management liability and the
exposures faced by the public sector, we continually
keep abreast of public pension issues and consult
with our clients on those issues as it relates to
insurance exposures and risk management and
finally, we are regular speakers at conferences
regarding risk management for pension fund trustees
for both NASRA and NCPERS.

Alliant’s experience with large public entity
exposures and the development of group purchase
programs dates back to 1977 when our public entity
division was established. Over the past 40 years we
have become a nationally recognized leader in this
specialized market sector.

Below is a limited list of retirement system clients,
demonstrating our experience:

As we developed a variety of programs for the
public sector we knew that our model and concept
could be duplicated nationally for management
liability coverage of retirement systems.







As a result, we created the first ever fiduciary and
management liability program in the country
designed to allow systems to band together and drive
down the insurance marketplace in addition to
leveraging broader coverage than what typically can
be obtained as a standalone entity.








Our strategic alliance with both NASRA and
NCPERS allow their members to access our
exclusive program; resulting in significant savings to
some of the largest systems in the country.







We understand the complexity of retirement
exposures and are leading experts in designing
coverage that is specifically tailored for our clients’
needs. We have an entire claims division that
handles claim situations that arise.

 Waiver of Recourse
With the enactment of ERISA in 1974, Trustees of employee benefit plans became personally liable for their acts
on behalf of the participants of those plans. Fiduciary Liability Policies became very popular, but ERISA only
allowed the Trust Funds themselves to purchase insurance to protect the funds - not the respective trustees.
Therefore, a nominal fee was charged directly to the Trustees as a way to circumvent this provision.
Although Public Pension Funds are not subject to ERISA law, the various state pension codes often follow in the
“spirit of ERISA”. In addition, as the Fiduciary Liability policies were originally drafted to protect ERISA plans,
the waiver provision followed across Non-ERISA plans.
With that said, we have been successful in petitioning the carriers to waive their recourse to the trustees without
having to charge, unless there is a requirement within the respective governing code. As Public Pension Codes
typically have no such provision, we no longer need to charge the trustees for the waiver of recourse. The trustees
still retain the same full coverage as provided in the past.

Compensation
Alliant/Mesirow Insurance Services, LLC is compensated for our risk management, insurance placement,
marketing, policy issuance and other insurance services for this insurance program using a commission based
compensation plan.
As the different carriers provide distinct commission schedules, we have outlined the commission schedules from
carriers that we provide this insurance coverage. Please note that commissions paid do not influence our
recommendations for coverage placements:

 Fiduciary Liability Insurance
For Public Pension Funds
Trustees and staff members of governmental,
municipal and quasi-governmental pension plans
face increased exposure in their fiduciary roles.
Allegations of breaches of duty are costly to defend,
and may result in personal liability of the trustees.
Mesirow Insurance Services, Inc.’s Insurance
Service experts provide the following summary of a
typical State Pension Code, and offer a solution to
lessen your fiduciary exposure.

INSURANCE AUTHORIZATION &
INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS
Each board and pension fund is often authorized to
purchase insurance to protect against liability of
trustees, staff and employees which may arise as a
result of claims.
State Pension Codes generally permit, but do not
guarantee, the indemnification of trustees and
employees of the Fund – however, this
indemnification is provided for allegations other
than willful misconduct or gross negligence
(properly structured insurance programs will not
exclude allegations of willful misconduct or gross
negligence).

PENSION CODE STANDARDS & FIDUCIARY
DUTIES
The fiduciary duties under most State Pension Codes
mirror standards similar to those outlined in ERISA.
These duties include acting solely in the interest of
the participants & beneficiaries, adhering to the socalled “prudent investor” standard and other
provisions of the State Pension Code.

IN SUMMARY
State Pension Codes require fiduciaries to adhere to
many of the same standards outlined in ERISA.
Breaches of established fiduciary duties may
translate into personal liability for the trustees of
public pension funds. These same Pension Codes
allow for the purchase of insurance to protect the
plan, the trustees and the staff from such liability.

ENFORCING PROVISIONS & LIMITATIONS
ON LIABILITY
State Pension Codes normally provide that
participants, beneficiaries, fiduciaries and/or the
Attorney General may bring suits to enforce
fiduciary duties and other provisions of the
respective Pension Code.

Our professionals at Mesirow Insurance Services,
Inc. are experienced in prudently structuring
comprehensive fiduciary liability insurance
programs to provide trustees with added protection
in their roles as fiduciaries of public pension funds.

State Pension Codes often do not provide complete
limitations on liability and make clear that litigation
against fiduciaries is permissible. A fiduciary that
breaches his/her duty can be held personally liable to
make good to such Fund any losses resulting from
such breach.

 Public Act 97-0651 (House Bill 3813):
We reference the below as an example of changing legislation that can affect the responsibilities, and therefore
liabilities, of Trustees. The below is an amendment to the responsibilities imposed upon fiduciaries by the IL
State Pension Code. As the Fiduciary Liability policy is intended to cover board members (and employees) for
breaches of these stated responsibilities, defense coverage would be provided for alleged breaches of such
duties/responsibilities.
Public Act 97-0651 Further amends the Illinois Pension Code. Provides that any reasonable suspicion by any
appointed board member of a retirement system created under the Code of a false statement/record being
submitted or permitted by a person under the Code shall be immediately referred to the board of trustees or the
State's Attorney of the jurisdiction where the alleged fraudulent activity occurred. The board of trustees of this
retirement system or shall immediately notify the State's Attorney of the jurisdiction where any alleged fraudulent
activity occurred for investigation

 Claim Reporting
The ramification of the current insurance market
condition from the claims prospective is that
insurance carriers are much stricter in claims being
reported promptly. Therefore, we recommend all of
our clients inform us (or your appropriate carrier) as
soon as possible when first made aware of an
incident, accident, lawsuit, or circumstance which
could give rise to a claim.

These comprehensive forms along with Claim
Handling Tips and reporting instructions for your
insurer’s claims departments can be accessed by
visiting our website:

ult.jsp
If you have difficulty reporting any claim, you can
also contact our claim department who will assist in
filing the matter with the insurance company. You
may call, fax or email your claim materials to our
office:

What could happen if you delay reporting a new
claim?

The carrier could reserve rights against you

Phone: 312.595.6200 (avalable 24/7)
Fax: 312.595.6506
Email: claimsreporting@alliant.com

Prompt claim reporting begins with the immediate
investigation into the facts and circumstances of an
accident, work related injury or allegation. Every
such incident, no matter how minor, should be
investigated as soon as possible. In order to assist

Insurance Services maintains a directory of accident
investigation forms and contact numbers for your

The Retirement Board

Administrative Rules Related to Public Act 100-0023 (the “Act”)
Certain components of the Act amending the Illinois Pension Code (the “Code”), if taken literally, are ambiguous,
inconsistent with existing law and potentially unconstitutional. The LABF is in the process of pursuing a
legislative amendment to the Act to address these issues. In the meantime, LABF’s staff recommends that the
Board consider adopting certain administrative rules to address some of the more time-sensitive issues with
respect to the administration of the Act. Passage of these rules will allow LABF to administer the Act in a manner
it believes is consistent with the spirit of the new law and lessen the likelihood that the law be legally challenged.
If these issues cannot ultimately be addressed via a legislative amendment, or done so in a timely fashion, the
Board may be required to adopt additional administrative rules in the coming months.
Rules to be discussed and considered at the August 22, 2017 Board meeting:
1. Definition of Tier 3 Members. Each person who first becomes a member or participant of the LABF or
of any reciprocal retirement system or pension fund established under the Illinois Pension Code (the
Code”) other than a retirement system or pension fund established under Article 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 18 of the
Code, on or after July 6, 2017 will, for the purposes of Article 11, be considered a member subject to the
new tier of benefits created by the Act. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that individuals who became
“Tier 2” members of a reciprocal fund prior to July 6, 2017, but who become members of the LABF on or
after July 6, 2017, are not inadvertently treated as “Tier 3” members.
2. Irrevocable Election by Tier 2 Members. The irrevocable election that is to be made by certain current
LABF members (active and inactive) under 40 ILCS5/1-160(d-10) of the Code will be administered only
to each such person who first became a member or participant of the LABF or of any reciprocal retirement
system or pension fund established under the Code other than a retirement system or pension fund
established under Article 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 18 of the Code, on or after January 1, 2011 and prior to July 6,
2017. Furthermore, LABF will honor elections made by members of both LABF and the Municipal
Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago (“MEABF”). The purpose of this rule is to ensure that
“Tier 1” members of the LABF or a reciprocal Fund, who become members of the LABF on or after July
6, 2017, will continue to be treated as “Tier 1” members and are not inadvertently required to make the
irrevocable “Tier 2” or “Tier 3” election.
3. Credit toward Age and Service Annuities. LABF will ignore the portion of the Act that removed the
language contained in 40 ILCS 5/11-170(b), which specified the employer contribution levels for age and
service annuities, and continue to administer this section as it existed prior to the passage of the Act (i.e.
LABF will continue to credit each employee’s account for employer contributions at the rate of 6% of
salary).
Matters for which rules shall be developed for discussion and consideration at the September 19, 2017
Board meeting:
1. Contribution Increases. Manner in which to determine, collect and account for increased employee
contributions required under 40 ILCS 5/11-170, as amended by the Act, retroactive back to July 6, 2017.
2. Employer Contributions Associated with Members Working for Local Labor Organizations.
Manner in which to determine employer contributions related to employees subject to 40 ILCS 5/11215(c)(3) of the Code, which specifies the pension contributions made with respect to any member on a
leave of absence during which the member is employed full-time by a local labor organization that
represents municipal employees.
