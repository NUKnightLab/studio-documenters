PROPOSED RESOLUTION
TRUTH IN RESERVE SET ASIDES
WHEREAS, Cook County is once again faced with a massive budget deficit; and
WHEREAS, the amount of the deficit has generated controversy and debate; and

funds currently in the corporate, public health and public safety accounts, which as of
October 31, 2007 totaled approximately $130 million; and
WHEREAS, by statute the County is only permitted to set aside 3% of the total
appropriation for the corporate, public health and public safety funds; and
WHEREAS, currently the contingency funds are in excess of 3% of the total
appropriations for each fund, and as such are in violation of 55 ILCS 5/6-24002; and
WHEREAS, under this statute the maximum amount of money that can be held in
contingency accounts is approximately $60 million.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
does hereby direct the Department of Budget and Management Services to comply with
55 ILCS 5/6-24002, and revise the budget estimates to show the actual deficit amount
once the 3% maximum contingency is applied to the corporate, public health and public
safety funds; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners hereby
directs that in future budget years that the estimates be formulated in compliance with 55
ILCS 5/6-24002 in order to provide a more accurate impression of the state of county
finances.

TRANSPARENCY IN AUDITING
WHEREAS, it is incumbent upon governments to be good stewards of the taxpayers
money and trust; and
WHEREAS, the County Auditor is responsible for providing timely audits of the various
county agencies and departments; and
WHEREAS, in recent years the County has experienced substantial delays in the
release of Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (CAFR); and
WHEREAS, the CAFR for FY2002 was not released until March 31, 2004, the FY2003
CAFR was not released until February 17, 2005, FY2004 CAFR was not released until
November 2, 2005 and the FY2005 CAFR was not released until November 29, 2006;
and
WHEREAS, receiving these audits at such a late date makes it increasingly difficult for
the President and Board of Commissioners to make informed decisions and take the
appropriate action with regards to any shortfalls that may be discovered; and
WHEREAS, this is not consistent with the best practices and procedures of private
sector organizations.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
does hereby direct the County Auditor, Budget Director Chief Financial Officer and

statements within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year in order to provide greater

Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Anthony J. Peraica, County
Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR GENERAL
WHEREAS, it is incumbent upon governments to be good stewards of the taxpayers
money and to foster public trust; and
WHEREAS, the County Auditor is responsible for providing timely audits of the various
county agencies and departments; and
WHEREAS, financial statements should be audited within 6 months of the close of each
fiscal year; and
WHEREAS, the County Auditor alone cannot accomplish this task without sufficient
assistance and resources; and
WHEREAS, the Auditor position should be replaced with that of an Auditor General who
would preside over a legislative office that would be responsible for providing timely audits
of county agencies and programs; and
WHEREAS, it is essential that the individual selected for the Auditor General position be
independent from political influence, with a supermajority vote required to remove the
Auditor General from office; and
WHEREAS, it is essential that the Auditor General have sufficient personnel and
resources to perform the necessary audits in a timely manner; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois has an Auditor General’s office that is governed under 30
ILCS 5/2; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Auditor General’s office should serve as a model for the Cook
County Auditor General’s Office.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
does hereby move to establish an independent County Auditor General’s Office that is
similar in power, scope and duties to the Illinois Auditor General’s office, that shall be
granted sufficient personnel and resources to produce audits of county financial

CREATION OF A FIVE YEAR OPERATING BUDGET PLAN RESOLUTION (PROPOSED
RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Anthony J. Peraica,
County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CREATION OF A FIVE YEAR OPERATING BUDGET PLAN
WHEREAS, the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners are charged with
passing a budget each fiscal year; and
WHEREAS, the County is experiencing a substantial budget shortfall; and
WHEREAS, the current financial situation is caused, at least in part, by a failure to plan
ahead for future years; and
WHEREAS, the County employs many long-term planning techniques, which include the
projection of multi-year revenue trends; and
WHEREAS, the County should also develop a formal long term plan that is reviewed by
the Board of Commissioners and other elected officials; and
WHEREAS, this should take the form of the County Board President submitting revenue
and expenditure estimates for the next five fiscal years along with narrative explanations
of assumptions made in order to reach such projections.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
does hereby direct the President and the Department of Management and Budget
Services begin to develop long term formal financial plans complete with revenue and
expenditure projections for the next five fiscal years, which would be subject to input from

DEFINED

PENSION
PLAN
RESOLUTION
(PROPOSED
RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Anthony J. Peraica,
County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLAN
WHEREAS, employees of the County of Cook are covered by a pension plan which is
based on defined benefits rather than defined contributions; and
WHEREAS, the current pension plan is a rather generous one which often allows County
retirees to draw out a much greater amount than that which they have contributed; and

 FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
FEBRUARY 6, 2008
PAGE 56
WHEREAS, the current pension plan provides no incentive for County employees to
invest greater amounts in their own future; and
WHEREAS, the current pension plan is one which places a great financial burden on the
County taxpayers; and
WHEREAS, the pension benefits for current County employees and retirees are
guaranteed by the Illinois Constitution of 1970 and governed under 40 ILCS 5/9; and
WHEREAS, it is possible for the Illinois General Assembly to create a new retirement
system for new hires; and
WHEREAS, it is crucial that the County create an alternative retirement package in order
to reduce the burden placed on the taxpayers by the current system; and
WHEREAS, a defined contribution retirement system would encourage County
employees to contribute larger percentages to their salaries in order to yield greater
benefits; and
WHEREAS, any newly derived system should allow for greater employee involvement in
investment decisions; and
WHEREAS, such a system should be portable so that employees leaving County service
could roll their benefits over to another system; and
WHEREAS, the federal government adopted the Thrift Savings Plan, a portable, defined
contribution plan for their employees in 1986, which allows participants to choose from 6
alternative funds; and which currently covers more than 3 million participants; and
WHEREAS, the federal government’s Thrift Savings Plan allows employees to contribute
up to 10% of their salary to their retirement fund; and
WHEREAS, the Thrift Savings Plan has been a massive success, and currently has
approximately 3 million participants.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
does hereby urge the Illinois General Assembly to create a new defined contribution
pension system for new hires in Cook County modeled after the Thrift Savings Plan for
federal government employees in order to maximize County employee involvement in
their retirement programs and reduce the costs of the pension system for Cook County
taxpayers.
* Referred to the Committee on Finance on 01-09-08.
COMMISSIONER PERAICA, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER, MOVED THAT THE
RESOLUTION (COMMUNICATION NO. 291522) BE APPROVED AND ADOPTED.
COMMISSIONER SILVESTRI, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER GORMAN, MOVED TO AMEND
THE FINAL PARAGRAPH OF THE RESOLUTION BY INSERTING THE WORD “OPTIONAL”, AS
FOLLOWS: “NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
does hereby urge the Illinois General Assembly to create a new optional defined contribution pension
