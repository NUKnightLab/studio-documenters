PROPOSED RESOLUTION
OPPOSING THE PROPOSED RULE FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND
URBAN DEVELOPMENT REGARDING
THE
VERIFICATION
OF
ELIGIBLE
STATUS
WITHIN THE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1980
WHEREAS, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is tasked with addressing
the country’s housing needs through policy and programs, improving and developing communities, and
enforcing fair housing laws; and
WHEREAS, on May 10, 2019, HUD published a proposed rule in the Federal Register of the United
States Government that would amend the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 to require
verification of eligible status for persons receiving housing assistance; and
WHEREAS, the proposed rule would require the verification of the eligible immigration status of all
recipients of assistance under a covered program who are under the age of 62; and
WHEREAS, furthermore, individuals who are not in eligible immigration status may not serve as the
leaseholder, even as part of a “mixed status” family whose assistance is prorated based on the percentage
of members with eligible status; and
WHEREAS, according to the National Housing Law Project, this rule would target “mixed-status”
households, who based on their immigration status are eligible and ineligible for receiving financial
assistance from HUD but who, based on longstanding federal law, can still live together; and

Page 6 of 66

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

July 25, 2019

WHEREAS, Section 214 of the Act currently prohibits the Secretary of HUD from making financial
assistance available to persons other than United States citizens or certain categories of eligible
noncitizens in the Department’s public and specified assisted housing programs; and
WHEREAS, HUD has indicated that this rule is needed to better align with the requirements of Section
214 which prohibits making financial assistance available to persons other than U.S. citizens, nationals, or
certain eligible categories of noncitizens; and
WHEREAS, the Pew Charitable Trusts has reported the rule would ban every member of a household
from receiving a subsidy if just one family member is ineligible, including those over 62; and
WHEREAS, by evicting mixed-status units that are already prorated, HUD has indicated in its own
analysis of the proposal that administrative costs to cover all-eligible households would rise by
approximately $200 million; and
WHEREAS, HUD has stated that the increased costs would reduce the quantity and quality of assisted
housing which would include fewer households under the Housing Choice Voucher Program and
decreased quality of service and maintenance of units overall; and
WHEREAS, the #keepfamiliestogether campaign estimates that at the national level, 25,000 immigrant
families, including 55,000 children, would be harmed by the proposed rule; and
WHEREAS, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reports that the new documentation requirements
would primarily impact U.S. citizen tenants and applicants for HUD assistance such as people living on
low incomes, the elderly, people who have experienced homelessness, domestic violence survivors, and
people with disabilities, all who face barriers to accessing administrative records such as proof of U.S.
citizenship; and
WHEREAS, according to a 2017 analysis of 2017 HUD administrative data from the Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities, there are 4.5 million households throughout the country that receive financial
assistance from HUD, and 200,700 are within Illinois; and
WHEREAS, of the households receiving assistance in Illinois, 5,630 are considered “mixed status,” as
they have either eligible or non-eligible noncitizens; and
WHEREAS, the proposed rule to require verification of eligible status poses a risk to the housing stability
of thousands of Illinois households and increases the barriers faced by all persons on low incomes seeking
HUD assistance.
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does stand
for the right to housing for all people and opposes the proposed rule on verification of eligible status issued
by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development;

Page 7 of 66

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

July 25, 2019

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners encourages the
Housing Authority of Cook County to create a plan, if the rule is finalized, to ensure that the existing
families who receive assistance under these programs and who would have to either be evicted or
separate have alternative low-income housing options;
BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED, that Cook County remains a “Fair and Equal County for Immigrants”
as defined by 07-R-240 and stands against this most recent example of the coordinated attack on
immigrant families by this administration.

Summary: The Adult Probation Department is requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer
to enter into and execute a contract with WestCare Illinois, Inc. This contract with WestCare, Illinois, Inc.
a community behavioral health provider, will provide evidence based cognitive behavioral treatment to
reduce pretrial arrest and recidivism among pretrial defendants. This program focuses on assisting pretrial
defendants in altering their pro-criminal, antisocial thinking patterns, so that they embrace a prosocial,

anti-criminal lifestyle and thinking pattern.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has been shown to be effective with juvenile and adult offenders; substance
misusing and violent offenders; and probationers, prisoners and parolees. It addresses a host of problems
associated with criminal behavior. Participants are able to improve their social skills, problem solving,
critical reasoning, moral reasoning, cognitive style, self-control, impulse management and self-efficacy.
Studies have shown that broad-based approaches to behavioral health have the highest rates of success in
preventing relapse and recidivism. The program will be designed to facilitate success in community living
by offering a holistic program of services to include linkages to needed services based on intake
assessments and counselor referrals.
This contract was awarded through the Request for Proposal (RFP) process in accordance with Cook
County Procurement Code. WestCare was selected based on established evaluation criteria.
