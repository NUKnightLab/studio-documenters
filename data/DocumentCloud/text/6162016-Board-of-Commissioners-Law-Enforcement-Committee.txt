PROPOSED RESOLUTION

CONCERNING THE INIPLEMENTATION OF THE CONCEAL CARRY ACT IN COOK COUNTY

WHEREAS, the Illinois General Assembly was required by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to enact a conceal
carry law and did so passing the Firearm Concealed Carry Act, giving the Illinois State Police 180 days to
implement a license system, and

WHEREAS, under the Act, local law enforcement agencies may object to an application if their objection is
based upon a reasonable suspicion that the applicant is a danger to him/herself or others, or a threat to public
safety, and

WHEREAS, the license process is based on an already overburdened Firearm Owner Identi?cation Card system;
and

 

WHEREAS, there are already 300,000 FOID card holders in Cook County; and

WHEREAS, in Cook County alone, nearly 4000 revoked FOID card holders still maintain their FOID card and
?rearms compelling the Cook County Sheriff?s Of?ce to dedicate a gun team to recovering FOID cards from
revoked possessors to protect the safety and welfare of the citizens of Cook County; and

WHEREAS, the conceal carry license process as currently developed is likely to overburden local law
enforcement agencies and exacerbate an already devastating gun violence problem in Cook County; and

WHEREAS, the Cook County Sheriff?s Office seeks to educate the Cook County Board of Commissioners on the
?nancial and operational burden of the Act and establish a uniform procedure for identifying and objecting to
unsuitable concealed carry license applicants.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook County
hereby convene a meeting of the Cook County Board?s Law Enforcement Committee to consider the impact of

the Act on law enforcement agencies throughout Cook County.
