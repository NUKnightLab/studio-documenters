Other Business
Report on Permit Decisions for the Month of November 2009
Dijana Cuvalo presented the report of the staff to the Commission (see attached).
Regarding one of the approved permits, Ms. Cuvalo reported that on November 25, 2009,
Historic Preservation staff approved a demolition permit application for the former YWCA
building at 830 S. Michigan, within the Historic Michigan Boulevard District.
The Department of Buildings, after a recent inspection, had determined the building to be
“imminently dangerous and hazardous” pursuant to Sec. 2-120-780 of the Chicago Landmarks
Ordinance and ordered the building to be demolished. Under such circumstances, the
landmarks ordinance requires that the permit be approved. By way of background, the current
owner purchased the property less than a year ago in November 2008. The building had been
vacant for several decades, and prior redevelopment plans to save the building did not go
forward. The current owner did investigate over the past year various schemes to try to retain
and repair portions of the building, but the structural deterioration of the building greatly
limited the feasible options.

 7.

Adjournment
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 1:08 p.m.
