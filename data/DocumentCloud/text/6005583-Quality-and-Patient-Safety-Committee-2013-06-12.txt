Report from System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation
A. Committee Education – Approach to Adverse Events: CCHHS 2013 (Attachment #1)
Dr. Krishna Das, System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation, provided a
presentation regarding Approach to Adverse Events: CCHHS 2013. The Committee reviewed and discussed the
information.
Chairman Michael stated that, overall, the good news is that at the System, Sentinel Events or the very serious
kinds of adverse events are rare - but it raises the question, for those very serious and rare events, because they
occur so infrequently, does the System really have the ability to do checks of effectiveness to know that the
implementation of a corrective or preventive action really worked? Dr. Das responded that it is really important
to look at the corrective action and understand that there is not one action implemented per event; rather, it is a
whole series of actions that are implemented. Usually a variety of checks and balances are implemented, and a
variety of processes are changed. With regard to whether or how these are being monitored, she stated that staff
tries to do so; she noted that it is very labor intensive to do this. The System has reported a couple of events to
The Joint Commission; when this occurs, they require the System to monitor the corrective action. In these
cases, for each corrective action that has been outlined, data is collected and tracked; if the data does not meet a
certain standard, the administration goes back to the departments involved and either a re-education or training
is performed, and feedback from the department staff is received about whether the process modification is
working – if it is not working, sometimes the process has to be revised.

Report from System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation (continued)
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief of Clinical Integration, stated that the studies that have looked at these kinds of
errors in health systems systematically use very labor-intensive and rigorous review; this is not the kind of
information one can get from either simple reporting systems or from claims databases. When studies have
been done trying to quantify the frequency of these errors, they have also done analyses to see whether the
health system was aware of those errors. On average, in this country the health system’s awareness of those
serious adverse events is quite low - the number is usually around 7%.
Chairman Michael inquired regarding plans to help the System have a much better handle on really knowing
and being aware of all of the significant adverse events that are occurring in the System. Dr. Das responded that
there are several initiatives that have been considered and planned, which require staffing. She provided
examples of areas of interest for potential initiatives, and indicated that she has discussed the subject with Dr.
Bala Hota, System Chief Information Officer; she added that trigger tools are useful, but as Dr. Shannon alluded
to, it is very personnel-intensive to look through them.
Dr. Shannon stated that the System is in a good position as an organization to be able to make progress on this,
because of investments that have been already made in the electronic record; while the whole country is moving
to an electronic records system, the System is lucky in that it has the ability to probe these things in a much
better fashion than others. Secondly, Dr. Das is constructing a team of individuals that will be the Safety
Committee for the organization; this will include naming a patient safety officer - staff is currently in the
process of creating a job description and recruiting for that position. Thirdly, while the System is trying to
strive to receive more accurate reflections of the frequency of these events within the organization, one of the
ways that staff can understand how well the System does its adverse event reporting is to measure what the
culture of the organization is regarding reporting – is this a system that hides errors or is this a system that is
free to come forward to show those errors?
Chairman Michael inquired regarding any other enhancements to the systems that could be put in place to help
prevent some of those errors by catching things automatically, such as decision support tools to assist the
medical and nursing staff. Dr. Das stated that there are some very standard interventions that are recommended;
many are currently in place. There is a little bit of discussion of how much should be implemented in a blanket
way, because there is a suggestion that each individual site performs differently; there are process issues that are
site-specific or institution-specific. Sometimes it makes sense in complex systems that a starting point is
developed and then tweaked, based on the individual requirements; in those cases, pre-specification cannot be
determined too far in advance.
Dr. Shannon noted that this is a good opportunity to let the Committee know that today is National Time-Out
Day; this memorializes an important safety step that happened in operating rooms, where the time-out became
the standard communication tool at the beginning of a procedure. Literally every member of the team
introduces themselves and goes through a checklist to make sure that they are all very aware of what they are
doing before proceeding with a procedure on a patient; that simple act has substantially reduced the errors that
happen around procedures and operating room areas.

V.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees
i. Provident Hospital of Cook County
ii. John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
The report from Dr. Pierre Wakim, President of the Executive Medical Staff (EMS) of Provident Hospital of
Cook County, was deferred to the Committee’s meeting in July.
Dr. Ozuru Ukoha, President of the EMS of Stroger Hospital of Cook County, presented his report. He stated
that the EMS met yesterday. There were no major reports presented from committees or departments; most
of the matters discussed were housekeeping matters. He stated that the EMS held its usual standing
committee meetings. With regard to credentialing, there is an issue that will be brought forward to the Joint
Conference Committee later on today and again next month.
Dr. Ukoha stated that interpreter services are an indispensable part of the communication tools for a diverse
organization like the System. He expressed his appreciation that the Office of Multicultural Affairs is doing
everything they possibly can to maximize the utility of these services. He stated that he recently provided an
update to EMS members about all of the interpreter options that are now available. One of the services that
has been recently added is the over-the-phone interpreter services with a new vendor who provides
interpreter services for many more languages. Additionally, video interpreter services have been recently
made available. Therefore, the interpreter options available at this time are the services of those interpreters
physically located in the building, over-the-phone interpreter services and video interpreter services.
In response to Chairman Michael’s question regarding whether there is pretty good coverage for those
services when they are needed, Dr. Ukoha stated that they will have to have to get further into it to see if it
solves the simpler problems; for example, patients that are in the holding area who need an interpreter before
being taken to the operating room may need some physical presence of an interpreter. There are strategic
areas where an interpreter is needed to physically be present.

VII. Adjourn
Dr. Shannon stated that this is the last meeting of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee that Chairman
Michael will chair; he is moving on to a new and different role where he will continue to work helping to
address the needs of poor and uninsured and underinsured individuals in the County. Dr. Shannon thanked
Chairman Michael for his service; he stated that Chairman Michael has brought great accountability to the
quality and patient safety culture.
Chairman Michael stated that it has been a pleasure to be part of this organization for the last year. He noted
that it is very important in his new role that he continues to work with the System and its senior staff and
continue to focus on the improvements that are being made in the quality and patient satisfaction.

As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman Michael declared that the meeting was
ADJOURNED.

How Errors Occur: The ‘Person’ Approach
Errors arise from defective human processing
such as poor motivation,
motivation carelessness
carelessness,
recklessness
Countermeasures to prevent them: punish the offender
Careless people simply need reminders and re-education
Hypothesis: Error is a moral issue; in a ‘just world’
bad outcomes result from bad intent

How Errors Occur: The ‘Systems’ View
Hypothesis: humans are fallible and errors are
expected
Organizations contain ‘error traps’
Countermeasures: you cannot change the human
condition thus you must change the conditions under
which humans work
Use system defenses, build in checks and
redundancies

What are Sentinel Events?
A Sentinel Event is an unexpected occurrence involving
death or serious physical or psychological injury or the risk
thereof. Serious injury specifically includes loss of limb or
function. [They] signal the need for immediate investigation
