GENERAL BACKGROUND
The CHA originally entered into an IGA with the Chicago Police Department for supplemental
police services in 2000 after disbanding the CHA Police. Since that time, the CHA and continued
with this approach of providing supplemental police services through subsequent IGAs and
amendments.
The IGA allows CPD to continue to provide specialized policing programs at designated CHA
properties as assigned. These supplemental police services include:
 Dedicated watches for Cabrini Rowhouses, Henry Horner/Westhaven, Altgeld/Murray,
Lake Parc Place, Brooks/Roosevelt Square, Oakwood Shores, Jackson Square,
Wentworth Gardens, Trumbull Park, and/or other CHA communities as needed.
 Increased police services for the certain developments, including increased foot patrols.
 Customized policing strategy constructed by CHA, property managers, and CPD.
 Attendance at monthly community security meetings to increase visibility in the
community.
 Monitoring and prevention of gang activities.
 Monitoring of drug and other illegal activities and take appropriate action as necessary.
 Attendance at all court hearings for all arrests made by the police officers.
 Responding to acts of domestic violence.
 Responding to unauthorized or unlawful activities or entries into residences.
 Providing a dedicated CPD staff member for crime data analysis, statistics and crime
reports.
 Additional coverage for summer surge and lease enforcement actions, as needed.
CHA’s budget for 2015 for supplemental police coverage includes $6M for daily coverage,
summer surge, data analysis support, as well as police assistance related to lease enforcement
actions. This IGA permits an additional $2M annually in police coverage subject to approval by
the CEO and appropriate budget availability and authorization.
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
CHA policies and all applicable federal procurement laws and regulations.
The Chief Housing Officer concurs with this recommendation to execute an IGA with the
Chicago Police Department for FY 2015 and FY 2016.

 The CEO recommends the approval to enter into an IGA with the Chicago Police Department for
a two year period from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016 to provide supplemental
police services for CHA properties and programs in an amount not-to-exceed $6,000,000
annually with the ability to increase the amount not-to-exceed $8,000,000 annually, subject to
CEO approval and budget authorization.
