An external baseline, corporate compliance risk assessment is recommended as a component of a
corporate compliance plan by the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services. The assessment will consider the Bureau's posture under the Bureau's current bil ling
arrangements with Medicare and Medicaid as well as the posture if the Bureau were to move to
alternative, potentially more advantageous payment systems under those programs.
The KMZ consortium was selected following a Request for Proposal (RFP) process. RFPs were
distributed to a dozen finns with expertise in the area of corporate compliance risk assessments. Seven
vendors responded to the RFP and were evaluated under the criteria set forth in the RFP, including scope,
relevant experience (e.g., with public hospital systems) and the specific personnel who would be devoted
to the project. Following interviews with the three highest rated responders, the KMZ consortium was
identified as the best proposal by the members of the Bureau Corporate Compliance Office.
The KMZ consortium will work with the State's Attorney 's Office to ensure the attorney-client privileged
status of the work product of the assessment.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 2001

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Zoning and Building of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant
to notice on Tuesday, March 28, 2000 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County
Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois for the purpose of conducting a public hearing
regarding amendments to the Cook County Zoning Ordinance.
234498

COOK COUNTY ZONING ORDINANCE (PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT).
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 9, 2000 from James L. Eldridge, Jr., Chief
Administrative Officer, Bureau of Administration:
Respectfully submitting for your consideration and approval comprehensive amendments to
the Cook County Zoning Ordinance.
*Referred to the Zoning and Building Committee March 9, 2000.

Following the call of the meeting, Chairman Silvestri informed the members that the State's Attorney 's
Office and the Zoning and Building Committee began an extensive revision of the 1976 Zoning
Ordinance. Chairman Silvestri said the purpose of the meeting was to provide a general overview of the
proposed revisions and amendments to the Zoning Ordinance.
The Chairman reviewed the various Articles and their purpose. He indicated that some of the changes are
basically semantics, or written changes, as opposed to substantive changes. Chairman Silvestri asked
Assistant State's Attorney Bill Motto to address changes in Articles I, JI and Ill.
Mr. Motto stated that there have been no substantive changes to Articles I, II and Ill . He said that the
actual substance of the Zoning Ordinance begins with Article IV, residential districts and are reflected in
the summary.
The changes have been presented to each member and are the results of meetings held with Steve Lenet, a
consultant and land use planner who was commissioned by the Board to undertake a complete review of
the Cook County Land Use and Policies Plan. Assistant State's Attorney Motto said that Mr. Lenet
suggested authority for trailer parks and Special Use be expanded including R-6 Districts currently under
the existing Ordinance, and all general residential districts.
Mr. Motto said these changes have resulted in the creation of a new residential district R-6, to provide for
certain map plots in Stickney and Leyden Townships that have significantly less square footage than is
currently required in the most intense residential districts. The new district allows for a 5,000 square foot
lot minimum with respect to home occupation and group homes have been included as pennitted uses in
the new residential district.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked if the number of trailer courts in the county is being expanded under
Article IV.
Mr. Motto answered that the number of trailer courts is not being expanded.
Commissioner Lechowicz informed the committee that under the existing Zoning Ordinance in order to
have a trailer park in a residential zone requires a Special Use in the R-6 Di strict which is a general
residential district. He said the County has three general residential districts and pursuant to
recommendations by Steve Lenet the County authorized trailer parks as Special Use in all three general
residential districts rather than only the R-6 residential district.

3675

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDI NGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 2001

Cha irman Silvestri commented that it becomes more difficult to require a Special Use in a ll districts
rather than only in the R-6. He said trailers parks can be built currently in R-7, R-8 and R-9 without a
Special Use.
Commissioner Lechowicz continued to ask about the threshold of 5,000 feet in Stickney as far as a lot is
concerned.
Mr. Motto responded that there are existing lots in Stickney that abut areas of Chicago that have much
less square footage than the minimum. The most intense district, which is currently the R-5 district in
Cook County where the minimum is I 0,000 square feet. The 5,000 square foot lots that are currently
located in unincorporated Cook County , do not conform to any single family residential development and
are not consistent with the Land Use Planner's recommendation.
Commissioner Hansen stated that there appears to be changes in some Articles of the proposed ordinance.
There is a text change in Article II under purpose, text changes under Article 111 , and the changes continue
for several pages. The commissioner concluded by say ing that he was led to believe there were no
changes in Articles I, II and Ill.
C hairman Silvestri commented that the changes in Articles I, II and Ill are textual and not substantive.
He said the State 's Attorney's Office attempted to streamline the ordinance to make it a more efficient
document.
Commissioner Hansen referred to the paragraph on page 3.3 that shows "areas not subdivided into lots
and blocks, wherever a district is indicated." The commissioner asked where the information could be
found or was it taken out of the ordinance.
Mr. Motto answered in certain locations throughout the document, there have been language changes.
Paragraph 3, on page 3.3 was deleted and page 3.4 addresses boundaries and particular circumstances.
There is add-on language but there were no substantive changes. The format was changed to flow better
and the language was changed to read easier and make for a more understandable document. He
continued by saying that the Ordinance is from 1976 and contains a lot of legalese. It was very difficult
for many people to understand but in 1976, that was the way the Ordinances were drafted.
Commissioner Hansen asked the State's Attorney Office to prepare a memorandum listing substantive
textual changes and the reasons for the change, because some of the changes appear to be text changes
onl y and may not be.
Commissioner Hansen asked the advantage of adding trailer parks as a Special Use in R-7, R-8 and R-9.
The proliferation of trailer parks is the weakest and most substandard type of housing a llowed in terms of
strength, structure density which raises questions, he said.
Mr. Motto stated trai ler parks are not permitted uses and are not an enumerated permitted use, but must go
through the Special Use process.
Commissioner Hansen stated most of them have gone through the process, because there are fou r trailer
parks in his own township.
Mr. Motto responded that Steve Lenet recommended this addition.
Chairman Silvestri stated that points I and 4 of Article IV are the results of Mr. Lenet's recommendation.

3676

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 200 I

Comm issioner Daley asked about the adoption of the land use impact fees dealing with landscaping. He
further asked if this is contained in the ordinance.
Mr. Motto stated the county proposed ordinance does not contain a separate landscape like the C ity of
Chicago.
Commissioner Daley asked if this was adopted as part of the Land Use Plan. If not, it should be looked at
and adopted, because this is the only way the county will have an impact in the Ordinance.
Cha irman Si lvestri stated that Mr. Motto will respond to Commissioner Daley's concern.
Commissioner Sutker commented that it is imperative that the county have a current study of the
conditions of mobile home living in Cook County. He does not know if there is a report and he asked
Steve Lenet to provide an analysis of the growth of this industry and its fu ture. The commissioner also
asked the provis ions relating to the present status of group homes in unincorporated Cook County, the
City of Chicago and the other I 29 suburban areas. He said the county needs to know in which direction it
is going on these two very important issues. He concluded by saying it is imperative that Steve Lenet or
his staff be present at these hearings.
Chairman Si lvestri stated Mr. Lenet is not represented at the meeting. The Chairman than called upon the
Department of Building and Zoni ng for infonnation concerning trailer home parks and the number of
group homes in the entire County, including the unincorporated areas.
Mr. Wlodarksi, Commissioner, Cook County Department of Building and Zoning, said he will gather the
information and distribute it to the committee.
Chairman Silvestri stated that the Department of Building and Zoning will research the question offered
by Commissioner Sutker with respect to trailer parks and group homes in the unincorporated areas and in
the County as a whole.
Commissioner Sutker stated the industry is not using the characterization of trailer parks any longer
because they are prebuilt, conditi oned mobile home sites which are going to increase. He said he is not
s ure Commissioner Hansen is wrong when he says the county is encouraging further building by
expanding the categories in the districts where they can be constructed.
Chairman Silvestri stated that Mr. Motto will discuss the issue with Mr. Lenet and report back to the
committee.
Commissioner Sutker commented on the current status of home occupations as an expanding ind ustry in
the C ity of Chicago, suburban Cook County and the nation. He does not believe the county has done a
study on the home occupation category and the expansion of home-based businesses. The commissioner
fu rther commented that the county should be cooperating with the vi llages who have ordinances relati ng
to home occupations, group homes and mobile homes.
Chairman Si lvestri asked Donald Wlodarski for information on the number of home occupations and
permitted home occupations, currently in the County .
Mr. Wlodarski responded that the Department of Building and Zoning has the data for all of the home
occupations.

3677

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 2001

Chairman Silvestri said that each of the townships will receive a copy of the proposed Zoning Ordinance,
the public hearings schedule and when the ordinance will be available at their local township office.
Chairman Silvestri commented on the types of home occupations permitted in residential districts. He
asked if the current ordinance lists the types of home occupations that are penn itted.
Assistant State's Attorney Motto responded that the proposed ordinance does not enumerate them but
does defi ne home occupation. He said under the current ordinance, there are certain restrictions contained
in the definition under the current ordinance.
Commissioner Sutker stated that the committee should know all the areas and be in a position to advise
villages and townships of what the county is doing so there could be some kind of infrastructure as it
relates to home occupations.
Commissioner Schumann commented on the tenn of mobile homes and said that mobile homes are now
called modular homes where two or three can be put together and the result is a home site that is much
larger than a trailer pulled on a slab. A trailer home or a trailer park is much different than a modular
home park. The commissioner concluded by saying modular home parks are very popular, inexpensive
and can be designed differently than a trailer park.
Chairman S ilvestri stated that the county should not let unincorporated areas become havens for trailer
park homes because of the genera l development of the county. He said there must be some limitations.
Commissioner Schumann stated that modular home parks have a large senior citizen population and are
very popular. Everyone knows that senior housing is something that is being looked at and this is one of
the alternatives, but the county must know what it is creati ng.
Comm issioner Moreno asked if all 129 municipalities have been advised of the process of updating the
Zoning Ordinance so they will be consistent within every inch of the County. The Commiss ioner further
commented that he believes the objective here is to have one master document that is consistent w ith local
ordinances .
Chairman Silvestri stated all of the municipalities are being informed of the proposed ordinance. The
Chairman said he will communicate with the Suburban Municipal Conferences and ask them to submit
copies of their zoning provisions regarding trailer homes and group homes.
Commissioner Moreno stated that the municipalities probably would want to have some kind of
confonnity with the County Ordinance.
Chairman Silvestri said that thirty-eight Mayors of the West Central Municipal Conference were
contacted and results in about 20 different versions of the law. He concluded by say ing it is going to be
hard to conform to all of them.
Commissioner Daley expressed his concern regarding prefab homes and asked if this falls into the
definition. It is an issue that every Com missioner has brought up and there is a concern that the county
might be expanding in an area that should be looked into further.
Chairman Silvestri commented that there should be a better definition of prefab homes.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the heading of Article Y.

3678

 JO URNA L OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 200 1

Chairman S ilvestri answered commercial districts.
Commissioner Hansen asked about any changes in the Article.
Chairman Silvestri stated that "haberdashery stores" are being deleted and "beauty and barber shops" are
being added .
Commi ssioner Hansen asked what is excluded under the commercial code?
Assistant State's Attorney Motto responded that haberdasheries are covered under gentlemen's c lothing
store and there are other uses that are permitted that encompass that use. That is why it was removed and
much of what is e liminated is redundant or is just rephrased. He said the proposed ordinance now refers
to things in the nature of business machine shops and sales as computer sales and service.
Commissioner Hansen asked Assistant State's Attorney Motto if the existing definiti on of commercial use
adequately distinguishes that category from eithe r residential or industria l or whatever the other
categories a re.
Mr. Motto responded in the affi rmative and said he has never had a problem with that distinction.
Chairman S ilvestri stated Article IX is Planned Unit Developments and this is a major revision to the
ordinance and suggested before any discussion, the com mittee members should review it in addition to
the summary sheet.
Commissioner Sutker asked if Article IX is a recommendation from Steve Lenet?
Chairman S ilvestri stated this is a recommendation from the State's Attorney's Office.
Commissioner Sutker asked if Steve Lenet has seen the Planned Unit Development changes in Article
IX?
Ms. Pat Shy manski, Special Assistant to President, stated that she is not certain that Mr. Lenet has seen
them. She sa id the County has a professional staff in both the Planning and the Highway Departments to
review proposals while the Building and Zoning Department also has professional sta ff. However, the
proposed ordinance did not accommodate a staff review process.
Ms. Shymanski said that the county worked with Mr. Lenet in reviewing the existing ordinance and
where he saw room for maj or revisions. These sections are not a direct product of his direction, but are a
product of his philosophy on where the county needed to thin k about making major revisions. Ms.
Shy manski commented that she does not believe Mr. Lenet has seen the specific language changes being
presented. However, she said the changes Mr. Lenet discussed extensively w ith the various County
departments that would be involved in the review processes are inherent in these recommendations.
Commissioner Sutker asked if the changes made in the Planned Unit Development Article are the result
of any litigation.
Ms. Shy manski answered that many of the changes involved Zoning litigation and every maj or case has
involved the Planned Unit Development process. In most instances, the litigation arose as a product of
the County Board rejecting the Zoning Board's recommendation fo r an approval of a Planned Unit
Development. T he litigation followed from a deve loper' s lawsuit because they were denied the
opportunity to develop as they wanted.

3679

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 200 1

Ms. Shymanski continued that as part of the process of developing appropriate language, the county
talked to a number of municipal zoning authorities. In response to Commissioner Moreno's question,
copies of various municipal zoning ordinances were reviewed. She said model ordinances from the
American Planning Association, professional planning entities, ordinances from around the country,
counties and developing urban counties were also reviewed.
Ms. Shymanski commented that many municipalities have a Plan Commission model. Rather than insert
another bureaucracy in the process, the county tried to work with the current Zon ing Board of Appeals
model to provide a more intensive review process on that model where there would be an opportunity fo r
comments and review from both inside and outside interests.
Chairman Silvestri commented on page 9.6 regarding the distribution of the application to the County
Commissioners in whose districts the project is located. The Chairman further said he thinks this is a
good step, plus the fact that Environmental Control and the Forest Preserve District are also being
notified.
Commissioner Goslin thanked the responsible parties for the development of this Article. He also said a
pre-application review is w idely used as a professional approach to development, bringing a ll of the
interested parties to one table.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked Pat Shymanski about the timetable on this three-step procedure?
Ms. Shymanski stated the timetable on the pre-application process is not specified because it is really an
opportunity for the developer to come in and hear what kind of concerns and issues wi ll be rai sed. There
is no fi xed timetable and nothing would prohibit a developer from immed iately filing an appl ication. She
concluded by saying that the process is really one of a voluntary undertaking.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked ifthere is a definite time to review all of the Step I procedures?
Ms. Shymanski stated that historically the county would have about five applications a year and the staff
is prepared to handle the volume. The proposed ordinance contemplates a schedule, special appointment
with the developer, where the developer would actually come in and make a presentation to a collective
body of County agencies and outside governments.
Commissioner Lechowicz continued to ask who is responsible for Step I in the Planning Department.
Ms. Shymanski stated the County Department of Planning is responsible.
Commissioner Lechowicz re iterated his question regarding a set time schedule for Step I.
Ms. Shymanski stated there is no set schedule, but as this becomes routi ne, a set schedule will be
developed.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked about Step II ?
Ms. Shymanski stated Step II is more time critical and has built in time limits that are typically geared
towards the conclusion of hearings. If you have a complicated development, the developer may control
how long the hearings last and the developer may have a number of experts to offer testimony. There is a
fixed period of time for staff review, following the close of the hearings, followed by the submission of
required documentation.

3680

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 2001

Commissioner Lechowicz asked Ms. Shymanski if the Planning Department is involved.
Ms. Shymanski stated the Zoning Board of Appeals is involved and other departments will have
contemporaneous review of the developer's proposal at that time. She said county departments should
already be familiar with the project because they will have seen it in its predevelopment or its preapplication phase.
Commissioner Lechowicz continued to question the time frame involved in the Step II and Step Ill phase.
Ms. Shymanski stated 60 days or 30 days post-hearing.
Assistant State's Attorney Motto stated there may be an additional 30 days built into this for additional
reviews by County agencies. Under the new ordinance, there will be much more disclosure, more
information provided in the early stages. Also, under the current ordinance, any problems will surface
during the hearing stage. The developer or applicant will then ask for an extension and the matter will
come before the Cook County Board of Commissioners on the recommendation of the Zoning Board of
Appeals.
Assistant State's Attorney Motto continued stating under Step Ill, these matters will be completely
resolved. All required agencies and governmental entities will have opinions in their reports, and as a
result, the Cook County Board of Commissioners will to be well-informed on the issues concerning the
proposal.
Chairman Silvestri stated the time prior to coming before the Cook County Board of Commissioners
might be longer and it is designed so continuances will not have to be granted from meeting in order to
negotiate the fine points. Those points should have been negotiated under the new process at the
beginning of Step I and II.
Commissioner Sutker stated the proposed ordinance will conserve time and reduce litigation.
Vice Chairman Steele stated her concerns with the entire document. She said the process is clear cut for
anyone who wants a planned unit development in Cook County. Once the Board approves the new
document will it be made available to all applicants, so they will know the process up front rather than
having to enter into the process and later find they have missed a step.
Chairman Silvestri stated the final document will be available in every courthouse.
Vice Chairman Steele asked if the document will be available once an applicant registers with the
Department of Planning.
Chairman Silvestri stated yes the document will be available.
Commissioner Hansen asked about lands and drainage. The Commissioner inquired about a diagram
reference to the Sanitary District and the Department of Transportation with regard to drainage and said it
may impact the planned unit development.
Ms. Shymanski stated the Highway Department routinely does not include the Sanitary District as part of
the review process, but added that the Sanitary District w ill be included as noticed parties.
Comm issioner Schumann asked were comparisons done with surrounding counties on variances and map
amendments.

proposed ordi nance.
Assistant State's Attorney Bill Motto explained that the R-6 is the new residential classification for

are in city townships. He said there are a numbe r of lots that back in to the city and are only 5,000 square
feet.

minimum size for a single family is 10,000 square feet.

Vice Chairman Steele requested the Secretary, Sandra K. Williams, to call the first witness.
Mark Liset, resident of Lemont Township stated concern for the heavy industrial development along the
canal that runs through Lemont Township. The reason that these companies continue to locate in Lemont

County reconvened the recessed meeting on Tuesday, August 28, 200 I, at the hour of 7:00 p.m. in the
Second District Courthouse, 5600 Old Orchard Road, Courtroom 201 , Skokie, Illinois, for the purpose of
conducting public hearings on ltem 234498 - Cook County Zoning Ordinance (Proposed Ordinance
Amendment).
Following the call of the meeting, Chairman Silvestri stated the purpose of the meeting is to introduce
various elements of the proposed amendments to the Zoning Ordinance and to e licit testimony from the
public. The Chairman stated that the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance will be mailed in CD form to
various townships, municipalities, courthouse libraries in Cook County. Chairman Silvestri stated that
the format of the meeting would open with a presentation from Steve Lenet of Linden/Lenet Design who
would give hig hlig hts of the major changes to the ordinances from the original amendments that were first
introduced.
Steve Lenet stated he would introduce two principal areas that have been substantially changed. The first
change is the R-5-A classification which is a residential transition district and accommodates a smaller lot
size of 5,000 square feet. A number of townships had lot sizes that are substantially smaller than I 0,000
square feet and the Zoning Board of Appeals received requests to reduce the I 0,000 square feet limitation.
The R-5-A accommodates special use, two family dwellings, duplexes, townhomes and some limited
commercial buildings in a form that was traditional for older neighborhoods. He further said this district
would accommodate an alley to remove cars and garages off the main street and to be consistent with the
older neighborhoods. The classification a lso has a Planned Unit Development that would permit limited
commercial development up to thirty-five percent and if approved could be devoted to nonresidential land
uses to serve the development.

3687

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 2001

Steve Lenet continued that the second substantive change is to the Planned Unit Development Ordinance
that would make it more responsive to the policies that the County Board has adopted to control land use,
which has been problematic. The recommendation is the elimination of the concept plan provision.
Another provision authorizes the County to retain outside experts in the field of engineering, architecture,
landscape architecture and planning. It now requires the plans to be submitted prior to the public hearing;
whereas, under the current PUD Ordinance, plans were submitted at the first meeting. The new provision
allows the county and its administrative staff, professional staff and consultants considerable leverage and
the plan is consistent with the adopted policies of the County Board. The Ordinance requires the plan to
be consistent with the adopted Comprehensive Plan of the county and where it is not consistent, a request
to amend the Comprehensive Plan maps must be submitted.
Steve Lenet continued to state the revised Ordinance now requires that certain developments be processed
under the Planned Unit Development provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. This includes all lands deemed
by the Comprehensive Plan to be environmentally sensitive and lands where there are wetlands, flood
plains, significant topographic relief, and significant areas of mature hardwood vegetation, on those sites
must be processed under the Planned Unit Development provisions. This w ill allow the County Board
and staff greater flexibility, leverage and authority to save environmental features of the sites and to
rework the plan.
C hairman Silvestri asked Mr. Lenet about three areas of specific concern: i.e., cell phone towers, signs
and billboards and the zoning designation of trailer parks.
Mr. Lenet responded that in all three cases, it was jointly decided to present stand-a lone ordinances that
will be addenda to the Zoning Ordinance and will give the County Board substantially greater control.
These ordinances will allow for substantial control over the placement, height and size of billboards and
cell phone towers.
The following person offered testimony during the hearing:
1). Eric Strobel

Resident

Chairman Silvestri asked for further comments, and hearing none, the Chairman said the
Committee will recess until the hour of 7:00 p.m., Thursday, August 30, 2001 in the Fifth District
Courthouse, Village of Bridgeview.

Pursuant to notice, your Comm ittee on Zoning and Building of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County reconvened the meeting on Th ursday, October 3, 200 I, at the hour of I 0:00 a.m. in the 11 8 North
Clark Street, Board Room-Room 569, Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose of conducting public hearings on
Item 234498 - Cook County Zoning Ordinance (Proposed Ordinance Amendment).
Following the call of the meeting, Chairman Silvestri stated that this is the final public hearing to discuss
scheduled comprehensive zoning amendments to the Cook County Zoning Ordinance. He then said the
Committee, consultants and vari ous members of the adm ini stration have worked diligently fo r several
years to create th is document.
Chairman Silvestri introduced consultant Steve Lenet - Linden/Lenet Land Design, Ltd. who worked on
the project and helped with the Comprehensive Land Use Plan. The Chai rman stated that Mr. Lenet
would briefly summarize the following proposed ordinances: the Proposed Wire less Communication
Facilities Ordinance, Proposed Landscape Regulation Ordinance and the Outdoor Advertising Licensing
Regulations.
Steve Lenet commented on the proposed telecommunications ordinance and indicated the primary
purposes are twofold: one, to ensure any new telecommunication facility does not encroach or im pact on
existing or planned single-family residential areas and that telecommunication facilities can be placed in
reasonable locations to provide services to the residents of Cook County. Mr. Lenet continued to state the
new ordinance describes locations that are permissible under the new ordinance which are required
setbacks from residential areas, requirements that a faci li ty be set back not just from a residential
structure, but from the residenti al lot line to ens ure that it does not encroach anywhere into a residenti al
area. The proposal also would permit a number of these structures to be erected in industrial areas. The
other restri ctions are in terms of structure, building permits, licensing fees and inspection fees that the
County may impose under th is ordinance. They are permitted to a lesser degree in commercial districts
and in some multifamily districts. They are not permitted in the single-family residential districts with

3689

 JO URNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEM BER 6, 2001

one exception. That exception would be institutional-type use such as forest preserve maintenance
faciliti es and cemeteries that might be zoned residential. In that case they would be permitted, but only
w ithin that part of the institutional use that is a lready devoted to maintenance facilities. Mr. Lenet
concluded by saying that his comments reflect the intent, purpose and restrictions regarding erecting new
telecommunication facilities. Mr. Lenet also said that representatives of the telecommunications industry
had input into the ordinance.
Chairman Silvestri requested an introduction of the Landscaping Regulation Ordinance.
Steve Lenet stated the Landscape Ordinance is entirely a new document and initially included several
elements that were very applicable to urbanized areas. Precursors from Commissioner Goslin and
Commissioner Daley were submitted and an attempt was made to make the proposal as applicable as
possible to suburban areas. He said the proposed regulations require buffer areas between nonresidential
and residentia l uses. It contains detailed landscaping provisions that must be placed in those areas. It
gives wide authority to the Department of Building and Zoning and allows outside expertise to review the
required landscaping plans. There are requirements for the submission of a tree survey indicating existing
vegetation on the site, restricti ons as to the removal of trees from certain sites, stringent provisions for
landscaping and internal landscaping of parking lots. There are requirements fo r commercial landscaping
and industrial landscaping that require tree surveys to be conducted by a registered arborist or a registered
landscape architect in the State of Illinois. The Department of Bui lding and Zoning is given the authority
to retain an outside arborist or landscape architect to review submissions and to be reimbursed fo r the cost
of these outside services by the applicant.
Chairman S ilvestri requested comments on the Outdoor Advertising Licensing Regulations.
Steve Lenet stated the Outdoor Advertising Licensing Regulations take a different approach currently
utilized by the County. This licensing ordinance is similar to granting a liquor license. There would be a
cap placed on the number of permitted licenses for billboards and licenses would have an initial life of
five years. There is no inherent ri ght under the ordinance for renewal and would be considered on a
case-by-case basis assuming there is a license available. The Department of Building and Zoning
believes there are one hundred and fo ur off-premise billboards currently in uni ncorporated Cook County
and the proposed regulations would cap the number oflicenses. One of the purposes and intents of
the proposal is to encourage the annexation by the local municipality of those sites containing billboards
and allow them to have a window of opportunity to work with those billboard companies pursuant to their
zoning ordi nances and sign regulations, so the County would not have created a number of legal
nonconforming uses or structures upon annexation.
The speakers are as follows:
I). Timothy Teddy
2). Chairman Alex Seith
3). Cynthia Rogers

Community Development Director for the Village of Lemont
The Zoning Board of Appeals

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 2001

Following the call of the meeting, Chairman Silvestri stated the backup material includes notice and
Amendments # I through #20. He said material also included an accompanying ordinance that defines
implementation of the Zoning Ordinance. The accompanying ordinance states that all applications
received prior to the implementation date of the Zoning Ordinance will be governed under old rules and
al l new applications would be considered either December 1, the beginning of the fi scal year, or January
I, which is the beginning of the calendar year.
The Chairman stated that the billboard and sign ordinance is a separate ordinance that will not be
addressed today because there are iss ues that need to be resolved.

AMENDMENTS #1 - #11
Sponsors:

President John H. Stroger, Jr. and Commissioner Peter Silvestri

Chairman Silvestri stated the introduction of Amendments# I through # 11 contain corrective language to
the Ordinance.
Vice Chairman Steele inquired about the footnote in Amendment #3.
Steve Lenet responded the concern was if proper notice is not provided, what ramifications would occur.
Mr. Lenet said that the ordinance has been amended to require that a certified notice be sent to all parties.
He said the green cards turned in at the public hearings ensure that proper notice has been provided and
will be a record of who was actually g iven notice. If proper notice was not given then a new public
hearing with proper notice will then be required.
Cha irman Silvestri stated co-sponsors to the Amendments # I - 11 are Comm issioners Daley, Sims,
Butler, Maldonado, Lechowicz and Vice Chairman Steele.
Commissioner Hansen asked the impact of Amendment #4.
Chairman Silvestri responded the original version considered the Comprehensive Land Use Plan for
municipalities located within one and half miles from the proposed PUD. The Comprehensive Land Use
Plan governs and not necessarily the municipality of the many communities around the PUD.
Chairman Silvestri then gave a brief explanation of the impact of each Amendment.
Chairman Silvestri stated Amendment #7 is to increase the number of members of the Zoning Board of
Appeals members by adding two ex-officios because a quorum will be required at all the public hearings.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved to defer Amendment# 9 until
Amendment #20 is discussed.
Chairman Silvestri continued to Amendment # 10.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked if the Zoning Board of Appeals had an opportunity to review these
Amendments?
Chairman Silvestri stated some of the changes to the Amendments are due to meetings with the Zoning
Board of Appeals.

3691

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 200 I

Commissioner Lechowicz moved approval of Amendments #1 through #11, seconded by
Commissioner Daley. The motion carried.
AMENDMENT #12
Sponsor:

Commissioner Moran

Chai rman Silvestri asked the sponsor of Amendment # 12 to give an explanation of the intent of the
proposed amendment.
Commissioner Moran stated that the purpose of the Amendment is to provide an urban environment of
medium density residential development that would be limited to single-family detached dwellings, twofam ily dwellings and town-homes. The Amendment would protect the quality and ambience of singlefamily neighborhoods.
In response to Comm issioner Moran's explanation of his Amendment, Steve Lenet said that a number of
the townships that were relatively close in proximity to the City of Chicago have similar Jot sizes and
zoning within the incorporated areas. The Cook County Zoning Ordinance of 1976 had the smallest
single-fami ly lot size of I 0,000 square feet at the time of the adoption of the Comprehensive Plan. As a
result, very large variations were granted to residential zoning districts so developments in unincorporated
Cook County would be closer in nature and lot s ize to those in the city nearby. Under the county home
rule power, areas could be identified where this lot size was appropriate. The County believes it is not
appropriate to allow these lot sizes in Barrington, Palos, Schaumburg, Palatine, Orl and and Lemont
Townships because these townships are not in close proximity to urban areas with smaller Jots.

Amendment #12 was withdrawn at the request of the sponsor.
AMENDMENT #13
Sponsor:

Commissioner Moran

Chairman Silvestri asked the sponsor of Amendment # 13 to give an explanation of the intent of the
proposed Amendment.
Commissioner Moran stated that the intent of the proposed Amendment is the ensure that any future
landfills are located at least one mile away from any other landfill in operation at the time the landfill is
approved by the Zoning Board. Additionally, the Amendment would require that the area in and around
the landfill should be maintained and c leaned by the owner or operator of the landfi ll. The commissioner
also commented on the significant number of landfi lls located in the south s uburbs.
Commissioner Quigley commented that while the Amendment is good, the county should have a
comprehensive landfill ordinance. He further said that there isn 't a landfi ll in the nation that doesn' t leak
and creates airborne toxins and there isn ' t a landfill around that is healthy to those that live around them .
The Commissioner said the county needs a comprehensive system of cutting the flow of materials,
particularly by household hazard waste. He further commented that no more landfills should be a llowed
and the county should look at a comprehensive system of cutting the flow so the need for landfills is
eliminated.
Commissioner Sims agreed with Comm issioner Moran on the need to address the number of landfills
located in the southern suburbs but said that more recycling of materials should be done. She concl uded
by saying that the location of the landfills should be left to the mayors and municipalities.

3692

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 200 I

Commissioner Hansen suggested that Section B of Amendment # 13 be removed.
By leave, Section B was deleted from Amendment #13.
Commissioner Steele commented that the local municipalities should have power to say what goes on in
their communities.
Commissioner Quigley asked the number of landfills located in unincorporated Cook County, within the
last five years.
Commissioner Donald Wlodarski, Cook County Department of Building and Zoning, stated that presently
there are no active or proposed landfills located in unincorporated Cook County. He concluded by stating
that two or three landfills have been recently capped.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked if Amendment # 13 would affect the City of Chicago's landfill
procedures?
Commissioner Moran responded that the amendment would affect only areas in unincorporated Cook
County .
Commissioner Lechowicz then commented that the word ' ·unincorporated" should be added to the
amendment.
Chairman Silvestri stated that Amendment# 13 may be counter-productive inasmuch as Article 14 defines
landfills.

Commissioner Hansen called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays being as follows:
ROLL CALL ON MOTION TO APPROVE AS AMENDED AMENDMENT #13
Yeas:

Commissioners Hansen, Moran, Quigley, and Schumann (4)

Nays:

Chairman Silvestri, Commissioners Butler, Daley, Lechowicz, Maldonado, Sims, and
Steele (7)

Absent:

Commissioners Carr, Collins, Goslin, Moreno, Sutker and President Stroger (6)

The motion to approve Amendment #13 as amended FAILED.
Amendment #14
Sponsor:

Commissioner Moran

Commissioner Schumann commented that Commissioner Moran has a point on reviewing special uses
over time, but said he does not agree with his one year time frame because there are some special uses in
the south suburbs that have not been reviewed nor been addressed. He said there is going to be a problem
and these ord inances need to be enforced.
Commissioner Sims stated the County should allow the municipalities to find remedies and some of these
matters come under the authority of the EPA.

3693

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 200 I

Chairman Silvestri referred to page 34 of the October version of the proposed ordinance. T he C ha irman
said under Special Use Section 13.8 I0, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has required evidence
and guarantees to insure that the applicant complies to the conditions and restrictions that can be done at
any time.
Steve Lenet stated that conditions to Special Uses imposed by the County Board and the passage of the
ordinance can be enforced by the Bureau of Administration and its departments any time a violation is
found.
Assistant State's Attorney Bill Motto commented on the Tri- State Industry parcel solid waste landfill
which authorizes that the 1980 applicant obtain a Special Use for a solid waste landfill to put in inorganic
materials such as asphalt and concrete on the site. Mr. Motto said by definition of a solid waste landfill,
the company was permitted to bring the excavated parcel up to the average height of the adjacent parcels.
The current applicant has gone in excess of the average elevation of the surrounding properties, and
through the Department of Building and Zoning, a violation was written and the matter is currently in
1itigation and scheduled for trial on December 13 and 14, 200 I.

Commissioner Moran, seconded by Commissioner Schumann, moved approval of Amendment #14.
The motion FAILED.
AMENDMENT #15
Sponsors:

President Stroger and Commissioner Silvestri

Chairman Silvestri stated the inclusion of the underlying sentence Uses similar and compatible to those
allowed in this district, wi ll allow the Zoning Administrator and the Zoning Board to interpret the
ordinance to include as a Special Use uses that may not have been anticipated at the time the ord inance
was written. Chairman Silvestri stated that the language reads "The Cook County Comprehensive Zoning
Ordinance regard ing Zoning Districts R-1 through R-8, C-1 through C-7 and 1-1 through 1-3." The
language should read R-1 through R-8, C- 1 through C-8 and 1-1 through 1-4.

LEGISLATION REGARDING ANNEXATION AND THE FUTURE USE OF LAND
LOCATED WITHIN COOK COUNTY (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a
Proposed Resolution sponsored by William R. Moran, Cook County Commissioner:
WHEREAS, according to Jllinois Statute (65 ILCS 5/7-1-47), when a municipality annexes an
area of land the territory is automatically zoned as the highest restrictive zoning classification
providing principally for residential use under the municipality ' s zoning ordinance; and
WHEREAS, this land can be rezoned when it is annexed by the municipality and is
automatically changed if the municipality's zoning ordinance does not match the County's
current zoning classification for the property; and
WHEREAS, the current process of zoning does not consider the best use of the land within
the County as set by the County zoning classification; and
WHEREAS, the County puts forth a great deal of effort in order to set the zoning
classifications for county land, however once this land is annexed by a municipality the
County's zoning ordinance and classification is ignored; and
WHEREAS, the County zoning classification should be respected and considered by the
annexing municipality in deciding the possible use of the land; and WHEREAS, at the very
lease notification should be provided to a County when a portion of that County ' s land is
being annexed, and
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOL YEO, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
urges the Illinois General Assembly to review the current legislation regarding annexation and
the future use of land located within Cook County taking special care to include the issues
mentioned in this Resolution.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be sent to The

69 West Washington Management Company, L.L.C.'s Operation of the 69 West Washington
Street Building, Review for the year ended November 30, 1999, by Laura A. Burman, C.P.A.,
County Auditor, dated May 25, 2001.
Submitted to the Committee on Audit July 27, 2001.

In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding who approved the month-to-month lease and
whether this was to the County 's advantage, John Davis stated his office (the Cook County Real Estate
Management Division) authorized the assignment of lease and estoppel certificate on January 28, 1999.
He stated he took this action after being contacted by the Building's management company regarding
their intention to extend the lease on a month-to-month basis, with an increased rate, while negotiations
for a long-term lease with Lason Systems were underway. Mr. Davis stressed that the extended and
increased month-to-month payments were to the advantage of the county from a revenue standpoint.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on the original lease's expiration date, Mr. Davis stated
the original contract with AIMS expired in December of 1998.
Commissioner Hansen expressed his concern with this action since no one has the authorization to
terminate, extend or change conditions of a lease without first bringing it to the County Board for
discussion and approval. To assure that this situation does not occur again in the future, Commissioner
Hansen stressed the importance of negotiating leases at least four to six months prior to their expiration
dates. He said this practice should allow the Board sufficient time for discussion of any changes and
approval of new lease contracts before the original leases expire.
In response to Commissioner Sutker's question regarding if the Board approved the lease with a
' holdover' provision, Keith Thomas stated the County Board did approve a holdover as part of the
original lease with AIMS Service, Inc. He went on to explain that shortly thereafter, on October 31 ,
1998, Lason Systems acquired AIMS and when AIMS 's lease expired an estoppel certificate was
obtained that allowed Lason (formerly AIMS) to occupy the space on a month-to-month tenancy with an
increased rental rate during negoti ations for a long-term lease. Mr. Thomas stated the purpose of this
action was to keep the space occupied with revenue continuing to come in to the County while talks
continued with AIMS's new owner, Lason Systems.

3768

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 200 1

In response to Vice C hairman Goslin's question on whether rent continued to be collected from Lason up
until the time they vacated the building, Keith Thomas stated that about $77,000 in additiona l renta l
income was collected for the County until October 30, 2000 when Lason info rmed management of their
intention to close their location with a notice of cancellation. He said Lason vacated the building on
November 15, 2000 without ever reaching a new lease agreement. He stated the space is currently being
leased by a governmental entity, the Illinois Secretary of State.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the current lease rate the Secretary of State is
pay ing for the space, Keith Thomas stated the tenant pays $3000 per month fo r approximately 1500 sq.
feet of space.
Chairman Da ley noted for the record that to date all lease agreements in the 69 West Washington building
are acti ve and have been approved by the Cook County Board.

Commissioner Lechowicz, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to receive and file Item No. 6.
The motion carried.
7.

Liquor Control Commission, License Fee and Advertising Fund, Financ ial Report for the year
ended Novem ber 30, 2000, by Laura A. Burman, C.P.A., County Auditor, dated June 18, 200 1.
Submitted to the Committee on Audit October 9, 2001.

Jack Weinrauch gave a brief statement on the statutory provisions that govern the Cook County Liquor
Commission's authority to regulate establishments in the unincorporated areas of Cook County through
licenses, inc luding Dancehalls and Roadhouses.
In response to Commissioner Hansen' s question on the number of Roadhouses the County has, Mr.
Weinrauch stated there are c urrently thirty-eight roadhouse licenses attached to liquor establishments in
Cook County.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding if any of these roadhouse licenses were in
taverns, Mr. Weinrauch expla ined the licenses a re adjoining and stated he did not believe there were any
roadhouse licenses not attached to a liquor license.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on the defi ni tion of a roadhouse, Mr. Weinrauch stated
' Roadhouses' are a statutory designation by the lllinois Genera l Assembly, which orig inated to regulate
dancehalls in 1925, under 55 I LCS 5/5-1000 I. He went on to explain the Cook County Board, in 193 1,
enacted an enabling ordinance which matched the State of Illinois legislation to regulate
roadhouses/dancehalls to allow liquor establishments to expand their businesses by offering music and
dancing.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on when the roadhouse license fee was established and
last adj usted, Mr. Weinrauch stated the current $500 fee was last increased by the Board in 199 1 and has
not been adj usted upward since that time.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's inquiry on whether the Department of Revenue had any
recommendation with regard to this fee, John Leonard stated the department had not analyzed this fee.
He said the Revenue Departments primary responsibility is to ensure collection and deposit of such a fee
in the appropriate fund.

3769

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 2001

Comm issioner Hansen then reiterated his question to the Deputy Liquor Commissioner, asking if the
county' s roadhouse license fee was reasonable or should it be increased based on inflation? Jack
Weinrauch responded that probably all the county's liquor license fees should be raised, including the
roadhouse fee.
Chairman Daley commented that recommendations on this fee or any other county fee might be submitted
by any Commissioner, in the form of an amendment, for discussion during the budgetary process.
Commissioner Goslin commented that during last year's budgetary process he had offered an amendment
for all county fees to be examined and stated he hoped that during this year's budgetary process certain
fee increase recommendations will be offered by the Administration based on a countywide fee analysis.

Commissioner Lechowicz, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to receive and file Item No. 7.
The motion carried.

Financial Report for the year ended November 30, 1999, by Laura A. Burman, C.P.A., County
Auditor, dated September 26, 200 I.
Submitted to the Committee on Audit October 9, 2001.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to receive and file Item No. 9.
The motion carried.
OTHER MATTERS- OLD BUSINESS:
Commissioner Hansen requested consideration of old business from prior meetings of the Audit
Comm ittee, specifically to follow up on the status of previous audit recommendation and management
responses: I) by the Recorder of Deed's Office relating to the need for a new cashiering system ; and 2)
by the Highway Department relating to miscellaneous collection of fees.
I.

Old Business - Recorder of Deed's Office.

Commissioner Hansen stated that he had received a letter from Darlena Williams-Burnett in the Recorder
of Deeds Office that mentioned a request for proposal on a new cashiering system being ready for the
Board's review by October 29, 200 I and hopefully submitted for approval by the Board at the next
regular Board Meeting.
Commissioner Hansen asked ifthe Chief Information Officer had signed off on this request?
The Chairman recognized Cathy Maras-O' Leary and called upon her to respond to the Commissioner' s
inquiry.

3770

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 6, 200 1

Ms. O'Leary stated that the Bureau of Information Technology and Automation had been meeting with
representatives of the Recorder's Office for approximately three months o n the request for proposal for a
new cashiering system and have been happy with the draft proposal since it called for leveraging
hardware resulting in a cost reduction. She stated since she had not received a copy of the material the
Commissioner was referencing, she was not prepared to comment or sign-off on the request.
Chairman Daley stated a copy of the material from the Recorder's office relating to the Unisys system
assessment and the final request for proposal (RFP) on a new cashiering system would be given to Ms.
O'Leary. He requested that she review it before the item comes before the Board.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the material given to the Commissioners was the RFP?
Chainnan Daley asked if a representative from the Recorder of Deeds office was present to respond to the
Commissioner question.
Ray Wolverton, Director of Technical Services for the Recorder of Deeds, responded that the packet of
information recently given to the Commissioners was the Unisys assessment of the system currently in
place in the office. He said the RFP would be seeking to replace that system, which is what the office has
been discussing with the C.1.0., her staff in the Bureau of Information Technology and Automation and
the State's Attorney's Office. Mr. Wolverton stated that a final draft of the RFP had just been completed
and would be distributed to the Board members prior to its submission to the Board for approval at the
November 6, 200 I regular meeting.
In response to Chairm an Daley' s question regarding if this will be a uniform system with the Clerk 's
Office, which had previous ly been discussed, Cathy Maras-O' Leary stated that part of the information
technology strategy is to have one cashiering system for all county entities who collect revenue. She
noted other county offices and departments are looking to acquire a new cashiering sy stem (i.e. the Clerk
of the Court and the Department of Revenue). She stated the goal is to have each county office and
department that collects money move to a table-driven system that would be back-ended by the county 's
new JD Edwards financial system and general ledger. She said this would a llow an easier and more
timely reconciliation of accounts/funds to occur between the Treasurer and the Comptroller.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the new system included functions for money received through the Web
system? Ms. O ' Leary responded yes, the plan envisions all monies or data being captured and processed
in a similar manner and reconciled using the JD Edwards general ledger financial system.
In regards to web security, Commissioner Hansen asked what protections are needed w ith the system?
Ms. O ' Leary responded that the County uses an IT-firewall, a highly secure environment checked and
monitored daily. She noted there are issues that threaten the integrity of the firewall (such as e-mail
infected with computer viruses) which have been addressed by purchasing s urveillance software to ensure
the system is not corrupted by such things.
2.

O ld Business - Highway Department

In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on the status of a previous audit recommendation
regarding the miscellaneous collection of fees, Laura Burman stated that the response from the Highway
Department was not as clear as she had hoped. She recommended that her office readdress this issue by
meeting with the Hig hway Superintendent and the Chief Administration Officer to discuss all of the
issues in hopes of coming to some kind of resolution. Ms. Burman stated she wou ld report back to the
Committee on the results of these discussions.

377 1

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEM BER 6, 200 I

In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on the amount of fees collected by the Highway
Department, Ms. Burman stated the Department collects approximately $ 15 thousand in miscellaneous
fees annually.
Commissioner Hansen asked for clarification from the Auditor on what problem was found with the fee
collection?
Laura Burman responded the problem found was not with the collection -- the county is receiving the
money; however, she said the Board never initially authorized the fees.
Commissioner Hansen asked who should have made that recommendation to the Board for basic fee
authori zation?
Tom Glaser responded that he was not aware that this fee required enabling legislation from the Board
and would review this issue in tenns of any necessary recommendations that may need to be made as part
of the budgetary process.
Commissioner Hansen commented that this issue goes back to April and hoped that information or
recommendations on this fee, as well as previously mentioned fee issues would be resolved prior to the
Committee's next meeting.

Commissioner Lechowicz moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Butler. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.
Respectfully submitted,
