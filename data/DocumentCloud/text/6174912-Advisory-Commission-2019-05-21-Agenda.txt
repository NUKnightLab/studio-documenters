Guidelines for Public Input:
• The goal of public input is to ensure that all voices of the community are heard on matters pertaining to the work of the
Uptown SSA. The commission is not required to provide immediate response to questions nor concerns presented.
• Public input will be available at the start of each Uptown SSA meeting.
• The opportunity to speak during public input will be available for all those in attendance; however, speaking time may
be limited depending on the number of attendees wishing to speak. The Commission will aim to limit this portion of the
meeting to no more than 15 minutes.
• All those wishing to speak during the public input portion of the meeting must complete an information form including
name, address, phone number, stake in the SSA and topic to be addressed and present the completed form to the
secretary prior to the start of the meeting.
• The public forum portion of Uptown SSA commission meetings, as with all portions of the meeting, will proceed
according to Robert’s Rules of Order, most importantly:
o No attendee may speak twice until everyone else wishing to speak has spoken once.
o All remarks must be directed to the Chair.
o Remarks must be courteous in language and deportment avoiding all personal
remarks and never alluding to others by name or to motives.
o One person may speak at a time, if not the presiding officer can call them out of order.
