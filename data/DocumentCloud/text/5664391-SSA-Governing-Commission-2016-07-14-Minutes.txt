Opening remarks
Commission chair opened the meeting by thanking everyone for attending this meeting
and for their safety concerns within the SSA#14 area. In addition, the chair informed attendees
that at this moment quorum of the Commissioners is not present, however, one more
Commissioner is on the way. Thus, in order to save time, informational items will be addressed
first.
The main objective of this meeting is to review and approve Marquette Park SSA#14
2017 budget. This is the reason why the previously planned meeting of August 17 was moved
up to July 14, 2016. Budget has to be submitted to the Department of Planning and
Development by July 15, 2016 together with a copy of the minutes. During the meeting we will
need to approve the 2017 budget, work plan and sole service provider.
Commission chair informed attendees, that minutes of previous meetings will not be read
as was done previously. Copies are available as part of the meeting distributions. Approval of the
minutes will be done by Commissioners, however attendees can read them at their leisure, Also
they will be posted on Marquette Park SSA#14 website (www.mp-security.org)
Incident Report
Incident Report was read by Danga Ilginis. It covered the time period from April 1,
2016 to June 30th, 2016. During this period, the Illinois Homeland Security addressed 631
security events of varied nature. Requests for assistance came from the SSA#14 Dispatch central
(118), the CPD (Chicago Police Department) (407) and rowing patrol cars (107). Disturbance is
still the most prevalent incident (293 or 46%).The same three zones required the greatest amount

 of effort: zone 3 (156), zone 4 (165) and zone 5 (106). In most instances, these disturbances
were resolved by rowing patrols without escalation, thus preventing a more serious incident.
Weapons offenses occurred 23 times. Persons shot -2 in April, 3 in May and 3 in June.
Monthly incident activity data reports are posted on the Marquette Park security website
www.mp-security.org In addition, copies of these reports were distributed to all attendees.
Financial Report as of 7/13/2016
Financial report was presented by Joe Polikaitis. Marquette Park SSA#14 has two bank
accounts. Tax revenues are transferred from Cook County Assessors Office to SSA#14 Money
Market account. As of 7/13/2016 Money Market account has $56,540.76. In addition, SSA#14
has a checking account. Checking account is used to cover daily operating expenses. Funds for
the checking account are transferred from Money Market account to the checking account. As of
7/13/2016 checking account had $25,416.17 for a total of $81,956.93. Financial status is good
and we are able to continue with the same patrol hours of 168 hours/week.
Significant discussion ensued after the financial report. Some attendees expressed their
desire to get operating expense details on a monthly or quarterly basis. Some expressed their
desire to participate in the budgeting and budget management process.
Approval of 4/27/2016 minutes
The 4/27/2016 Marquette Park SSA#14 meeting minutes were emailed to all
Commissioners prior to the meeting. In addition, copies of the minutes were made available to
all meeting attendees. Thus, reading of minutes was suspended in order to save time. Still, these
minutes had to be approved by the Commissioners. Patricia Nelson made a motion to accept the
minutes as written. Jonas Miglinas seconded. The motion was carried unanimously.
Status of the Security Firm bidding proposals.
Security contract with Illinois Homeland Security expires on December 10, 2016.
Therefore, a new RFP (request for proposals) process was initiated on April 27, 2016.
Commissioners approved the bidding protocol, including proposal format, guidelines and
requirements. Bidding packages were prepared and were made available on June 1, 2016 to
those desiring to bid. Bids are to be submitted no later than July 15, 2016. Three bid packages
were picked up and two proposals have been submitted. Once all of the proposals are received,
copies will be given to all Commissioners for their independent evaluations. Review and
selection of security firm for 2017-2018 calendar years will be done during the next
Commissioners meeting scheduled for October 26, 2016.
Expiration of SSA#14 Ordinance
Every City of Chicago Special Service Area (SSA) has a “sunset” clause. It means that
every Ordinance has an ending. Marquette Park SSA#14 Ordinance expires at the end of 2017.
If a new Ordinance is not passed by the City Council, SSA#14 will terminate. If a new
Ordinance is passed, new Commissioners will need to be approved as well as budget and
working plan. The reestablishment process will need to start by December of 2016. In order for
the Ordinance to be passed by the City Council, every SSA needs to secure approval signatures
from 20% of property owners within the SSA. Marquette Park SSA#14 has a total of 3,933
PIN’s, thus we will need to obtain at least 800 property owner signatures that can withstand
challenges. It will be especially difficult, since at least 25% of SSA#14 owners do not live in the
area. Verification of ownership will need to be obtained prior to their signature. We anticipate
that signatures will need to be secured by June 2017. In order to prepare the application and
subsequent Ordinance proposal, Marquette Park market study will have to be completed. This

 will have to be done by a consultant at a cost of approx.. $70,000.00 The term of an Ordinance
can very from 2 years to 20 years. In the past, Marquette Park SSA#14 Ordinances have been
approved either for four or five years. It is so, because of a residential nature of SSA#14..
Approval of Marquette Park SSA#14 2017 budget
Marquette Park SSA#14 2017 budget draft copy has been submitted to each
Commissioner for their independent review. During the July 14, 2016 meeting Commissioners
are to discuss, review and approve the proposed 2017 budget. After a brief discussion no
changes were recommended and thus Jonas Miglinas made a motion to approve SSA#14 2017
budget as submitted. The motion was seconded by Patricia Nelson. Motion was unanimously
approved by the Commissioners.
Approval of Marquette Park SSA#14 2017 work plan
The 2017 work plan was submitted to each Commissioner with the 2017 budget. No
modifications or corrections were made. Work plan consists of four parts: customer attraction,
economic development, safety and administration. Some clarification on the budgeting process,
development of work plan and selection of sole service provider was made by Ald. David
Moore. Jonas Miglinas made a motion to accept the proposed Marquette Park SSA#14 work plan
for 2017. It was seconded by Cynthia Young. Motion was unanimously approved by
Commissioners.
Approval of Marquette Park SSA#14 Sole service provider for 2017
Jonas Miglinas made a motion to approve Lithuanian Human Service Council of the
USA,Inc. as sole service provider for Marquette Park SSA#14 for the year 2017. It was
seconded by Cynthia Young. The motion was approved unanimously by Commissioners.
Community Input
During the community input, Jennifer Kirmes of AMANDLA Charter School informed
that a new school will be opening in the SSA#14 area. It will be located in the Nativity BVM
parish school building at 6820 S. Washtenaw Ave. During the community input segment most
of the discussion centered around the security issues, request for greater Chicago Police
presence, and a question of personal responsibility and individual initiative in combating
negative activities in the area. It was evident that residents are very passionate about their
neighborhood security. This discussion was very beneficial to all that were present at the
meeting.
