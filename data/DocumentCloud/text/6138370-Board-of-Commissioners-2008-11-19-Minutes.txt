 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
MEMORANDUM REGARDING CONTRACT NO. 07-53-562
The following item was deferred at the November 5, 2008 Board Meeting:
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 5, 2008 from
ELIZABETH “LIZ” DOODY GORMAN, County Commissioner
Item 20 on the Cook County Board Agenda of November 5, 2008 is information supplied by Betty
Hancock Perry, Director of the Office of Contract Compliance regarding Contract No. 07-53-562. There
are a number of inaccuracies in this document which I would like to address. Please review the
following:
Utilization Plan
Madison indicated the bid they submitted did not meet the “Specified Goals,” however, a note was
included at the bottom of the Utilization Plan which stated, “see good faith efforts, we will continue to try
to meet the goals.” This response was not sufficient for this bid to be deemed responsive. The
compliance section of the bid document defines good faith efforts for the respondents must be exercised
prior to the bid submission, and supporting documentation must be included which validates the
respondents actions taken for them to be deemed responsive.
See attached page PE-6 from the bidder bid which clearly indicates that the good faith efforts will
be followed. The bidder did exercise good faith efforts prior to bid submission however a
statement was added that the bidder would continue to try to achieve the goals even though the
good faith option was exercised.
Madison’s Utilization Plan indicated the direct participation of ERA Valdivia (“Valdivia”) as an MBE
participant with the dollar amount of participation listed as $200,000.00 (7%) of the bid amount.
Additionally, while the MBE/WBE Utilization Plan states that the Letter(s) of Certification must be
attached to the bid, the Letter of Certification for Valdivia was not attached to the bid and was later faxed
to this office and received on August 21, 2008.
The bidder clearly executed the good faith efforts clause of the contract which does not require
letters of certification. After several calls to the compliance department by the bidder, the bidder
was requested to supply the letter on August 20, 2008. The bidder supplied the letter within 24
hours of the request.
This was the only vendor listed on the Utilization Plan submitted by Madison, and no where in the
documentation did they request a reduction of MBE participation, which stated reasons as to why they
were unable to meet the full 24% goals.
Please see the bidders bid form page PE-6 with the appropriate box checked indicating the bidder
was utilizing good faith efforts. Also see the bidders documents PE-6b checklist for MBE/WBE
Good Faith Efforts. Also see bidders document PE-6c checklist for good faith efforts. There is
no portion of the bid application that allows the bidder to state a reason to why they were unable
to meet the goals.

7878

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
Another area of deficiency in the Utilization Plan was surrounding the work to be performed by the MBE.
The description of work fro Valdivia was listed as “Carpentry, Demolition.” The bid document states “A
bidder my count only the participation of MBEs and WBEs for the scopes of the work which they are
certified on or before the date of the submission.” The Certification Letter from the City of Chicago
listed Valdivia as certified in the following areas:
“Painting, Drywall and Sandblasting Contractor; Terrazzo, Tile Resin and Vinyl Flooring;
Waterproof Membrane Systems Installation; locker Installation.”
Contract Compliance considers drywall installation as a form of carpentry work and accepted this vendor
for the provision of the service however they were not certified to provide demolition services which
meant that Madison would not have received MBE credit for these services and thus not meet the 7%
participation as stated in the submitted Utilization Plan.
Additionally, there were no other
Minority/Woman Owned Business Enterprises listed on the Utilization Plan.
Please see the bidder’s letter of intent between the prime contractor and ERA Valdivia. The letter
lists demolition, Drywall, ceilings and painting. The project contains what is commonly called
“demolition” this is removal of existing drywall and drywall studwall commonly called
“carpentry.” This work is routinely performed by ERA Valdivia, and covered by ERA Valdivia’s
Letter. This is the exact same work that was found to be acceptable by compliance for the bidder
that was $161,000 higher than Madison Construction.
Overall the Utilization Plan did not sufficiently meet the MBE/WBE goals of Cook County Government
and did not show proof that Madison exercised good faith efforts to meet the stated goals.
The bidder did exercise its good faith efforts to meet the MBE/WBE goals; however because of
the type of work requested the bidder was unable to meet the goals. The bidder submitted the
proper documentation and when Cook County requested further information responded
expeditiously.
Letter of Intent
The Letter of Intent between the Prime Contractor (Madison) and the MBE/WBE subcontractor supplier
(Valdivia) was submitted blank. The General Conditions, Section GC-52, Section II – Required PreAward Submittals reads as follows:
“To be responsive, A bidder shall either (1) meet the project specific MBE and WBE goals by
submitting with the bid a Utilization Plan, supported by Letters(s) of Intent and Letter(s) of
Certification Failure to submit the documents in accordance with these requirements will cause
the bid to be considered non-responsive and shall be cause for the bid to be rejected.”
The paraphrasing of this portion of the document completely excludes the second avenue a bidder
can utilize to be considered compliant. The portion of the statement that is left out includes:
Or (2) if the bidder cannot achieve the project specific MBE and/or WBE goals, by submitting
with the bid documentation its Good Faith Efforts to meet the project specific MBE and or WBE
Goals.

7879

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
This was the avenue in which the bidder utilized to be considered compliant. By utilizing this
submittal process, it is impossible to submit a Letter of Intent or Utilization Plan because these
documents are to be filled out to identify compliance with the MBE/WBE compliance. A bidder
would be falsely representing their intention if submitting this documentation while conforming
to the Good Faith Efforts process.
Good Faith Efforts Checklist
Included in all Bid Packages is a Good Faith Efforts Checklist which is used as a guide for bidders to
ensure that they have complied with all areas of the M/WBE compliance portion of the bid. Madison
checked all items on the Good Faith Efforts Checklist and indicated for item number five (5) ("made
efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or insurance as may be
required for performance of the contract"), while it was checked as a good faith effort; it was "not
applicable. "
The bidder identified that it was “not applicable.” There is no basis for this grievance.
The Good Faith Efforts Contacts Log was submitted with the bid. However, Madison did not, at the time
of the bid opening, provide any documentation supporting the purported contacts made in an effort to
meet the M/WBE.
According to the bid instructions there is no requirement to provide any additional documentation
indicating the efforts to reach out to MBE/WBE companies.
1. City Lights: Work solicited was for Electrical. The reason stated in the document as to why
agreement was not reached was indicated as "not enough time to bid project." The date of contact
was listed on the document as July 7, 2008.
1. Kingdom Community Work solicited was for Carpentry and Demolition. The reason stated in
the document as to why agreement was not reached was indicated as "not enough time to bid
project." The date of contact was listed on the document as July 7, 2008.
1. S Mechanic: Work solicited was for HV AC. The reason stated in the document as to why
agreement was not reached was indicated as "not interested." The date of contact listed on the
document was July 7, 2008.
The Office of Contract Compliance contacted the subcontractors listed on the Contact Log to verify the
reasons included in the document and the following was noted:
Juan Candelaria of City Lights stated they were contacted too late to provide a bid. They were
given two (2) days notice.
John Abercrombie of Kingdom Community did not return calls to the Office of Contract
Compliance.

contact log remains disconnected.
Juan Candelaria was contacted in the required 10 days prior to the bid due date.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
John Abercrombie is a pastor of Kingdom Community church and his construction company goes
by the same name. He had an extensive conversation with compliance exceeding thirty minutes
on September 2, 2008.
S Mechanicals number was disconnected.
Note: While there were three (3) vendors listed as "Good Faith" there are forty seven (47) vendors listed
in the County's directory in the area of construction.
The General Conditions Section GC - 52, Section II, bidder must notify MBEs and WBEs of
subcontracting opportunities at least ten (10) business days before submission of the bid. The MBEs listed
on this bid were notified eight (8) business days prior to bid opening, not ten (10) as stated in their letters
(exhibit 2).
On August 21, 2008, the Office of Contract Compliance received via fax, the signed Letter of Intent
between Madison Construction and ERA Valdivia signed and notarized on July 15, 2008. This document
which is to be included at the time of bid opening was received thirty four (34) days after the bid opening.
(see submitted letter)
By utilizing the Good Faith Efforts submittal process, according to the bid instructions, it is not
necessary to submit a Letter of Intent or Utilization Plan because these documents are to be
provided when attempting to represent compliance with the MBE/WBE goals. An issue is made
here that information was submitted 34 days after the bid was presented. Why then did Contract
Compliance request this information on the 33rd day.
The Office of Contract Compliance's procedure is not to communicate with bidders our findings until the
Board has voted on the bid. The Office of Contract Compliance may determine a bidder is nonresponsive, however; the Board of Commissioners have the authority to override this recommendation.
Upon award of a contract, we will provide any bidder with reasons as to why their bid was non
responsive.
The bid documentation states that “If a Utilization Plan is denied because the Good Faith Efforts
requirements have not been met, the County shall inform the bidder in writing for the basis for the
denial. To protest such a decision, the bidder shall follow the purchasing protest process
described in Cook County’s Purchasing office Solicitation instructions.”
On September 12, 2008, the Office of Contract Compliance having completed the analysis and
investigation of the bid and all documentation received for Contract No. 07-53-562, sent a letter to the
Purchasing Agent indicating Madison Construction as being non-responsive.
Shortly thereafter, on September 17, 2008, the Compliance Officer received a telephone call from Martin
McCarthy, Director of Performance Contracting, Madison Construction, requesting a reason as to why
they had been found non-responsive. When Mr. McCarthy was not satisfied with the answer he received,
he proceeded to call the Compliance Administrator, requesting a written explanation as to why their bid
was non-responsive.
The explanation given to Mr. McCarthy was that this Office does not provide a letter to bidders until such
time as a recommendation has been voted upon by the Board of Commissioners.

7881

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
On September 19, 2008, the Office of Contract Compliance received a letter from Mr. McCarthy of
Madison Construction indicating they were now willing to meet or exceed the MBE/WBE participation
goals. This communication was received after the bid opening, therefore, it could not be considered at that
time. (see submitted letter)
This statement attempts to misrepresent the intention of Mr. McCarthy’s statement. The bidder
was unable to provide the goals at the time of the bid. This is a fact that the bidder did not
attempt to keep undisclosed. The bid suggested that they attempted to meet the goals through
good faith efforts. Mr. McCarthy’s letter indicated that the bidder will continue to attempt to meet
or exceeded the MBE/WBE goals.
On September 22, 2008, Commissioner Gorman's Administrative Assistant telephoned our office to speak
to the Administrator regarding the Madison file. She was told the Administrator was away from the
office.
A staff member from Ms. Hancock-Perry’s office called back that day, Monday, and stated that
Ms. Hancock-Perry was well aware of this bid but would be unavailable to speak with me until
Thursday, September 25, 2008
As a result of the call from the Commissioner's Office, Staff of the Office of Contract Compliance
telephoned the Administrator about the request for information on Madison Construction and was
directed to take the file and review it with Commissioner Gorman. When they arrived at Commissioner's
office, they were told she was not in. My staff however, reviewed the information in the file with
Commissioner Gorman's staff.
On September 25, 2008, the Administrator telephoned Commissioner Gorman and asked if she had
received the information the staff shared with her staff and whether or not the explanation answered her
concerns. She stated she had received the information; however, she was not satisfied with the
explanation.
No, I wasn’t satisfied with the information as the answers changed almost on an hourly basis. For
example, Ms. Hancock-Perry told me during one conversation that a bidder could protest being
found non-responsive on the Contract Compliance website. I looked at that website and could not
find anywhere to level such a protest. Also note that no bid recommendations were presented to
the County Board for approval at the October 1, 2008 board meeting.
On October 15, 2008 at the Cook County Board Meeting, Commissioner Butler provided the
Administrator with a copy of the letter Commissioner Gorman distributed to the County Board Members.
The Administrator had no knowledge of the document prior to Commissioner Butler sharing it.
After reviewing the letter submitted by Madison, it should be noted that attachment Exhibits 1 and 2
which denotes the MBE bidders solicited and supporting letters documenting their good faith efforts,
were received after the bid opening. Please note that they are dated September 24, 2008, well after the
July 17, 2008 bid opening date. These documents were not a part of the bid as required by GC-52, II
paragraph one. We do not concur with Madison's assertion that the Office of Contract Compliance did not
confirm Madison's good faith efforts. As noted above, we made every attempt to do so with the
information that was provided to us at the time of bid submission.
The letters supplied by the bidder to Commissioner Gorman were not intended to be submittals
for the Bid as the above paragraph attempts to assert, however were provided to acknowledge the
bidders continuing participation and support for MBE/WBE Companies.

7882

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
Further, it should be noted that Contract Compliance did not state that Valdivia was not certified to do the
work in the bid package. Our finding was and it was stated, "Valdivia was not certified in the area of
Demolition" as listed on the Utilization Plan, and later listed on the Letter of Intent received thirty-four
(34) days late to this office.
If compliance found “Valdivia not certified in the area of Demolition,” why then was it
acceptable for the second bidder John Burns Company?
In conclusion, the Office of Contract Compliance followed standard operating procedures as it reviewed
the bid response for the "build out of the pharmacy" within the Bureau of Health Services. It is my hope
that this chronology answers any questions regarding the decision to deem Madison non-responsive. I
would be happy to answer any additional questions that may arise.
The Office of Compliance has consistently made statements that are not consistent with the bid
application. The “standard operating procedures” of the Office of Contract Compliance along
with the bid material may need be reviewed to determine if the information is consistent. This
document acts to refute, yet again, the statements made by the Office of Compliance regarding
why Madison Construction’s bid was considered non-responsive. Cook County must be losing
significant revenue because of such inconsistencies and would have lost $161,000 if this bid
would have been assigned to the second bidder.

bond;

c.

Not accompanied by the affidavits, certifications or economic disclosure
statements required to be submitted pursuant to this article; or

d.

Which in any other way fails to fully comply with the terms and
conditions as stated in the advertisement for bids.

No bid may be changed, amended, or supplemented in any way after the exact

that cancels, withdraws or modifies its bid after the bid opening will result in the
bidder being deemed unqualified and will prohibit said bidder from receiving a

certified check, bid deposit, or bid bond may be accepted after the exact time for
submission of bids specified in the advertisement for bids.

(j)

the County Board to preside and witness the conduct of the reading and announcing in public of all bids
before all who desire to attend. The bids shall then be reported to the County Board at the next meeting
after the opening thereof. If it is evident that only one qualified bid has been submitted with respect to a
particular contract, no bid envelope is opened and any sealed bid(s) shall be returned to the bidder(s) via
certified mail unopened. The Clerk announces this fact and that the Purchasing Agent will thereafter
determine whether to reissue the solicitation of competitive bids as a result. If it is determined that an
error was made in announcing the bid or there was a failure to read all bids into the record, the Purchasing
Agent shall notify the Commissioner who presided over the Bid Opening and the Clerk of the Board of
the need to reconvene the Bid Opening to correct the record. As soon as reasonably possible, the Bid

the Bid Opening, a post-bid meeting is scheduled wherein the Department and Contract Compliance
reviews bids for technical specifications and minority business enterprise/women business enterprise
requirements. Upon notification of a recommended vendor from the Department and Contract
Compliance, the Office of the Purchasing Agent prepares the pre-award bids report and posts said report
on the County's website and on the bulletin board outside the Purchasing Agent's Office. The time
intervals required to evaluate bids are not always predictable. Bidders are responsible for monitoring the
website or, if they lack web access, for calling the Office of the Purchasing Agent on Mondays after 12:00
noon at (312)603-5370, to determine whether a recommendation for award will be posted during the
upcoming week.
(l)
Purchases and Contracts of $100,000.00 or more; Bid protest procedure. Any bidder
who has reason to believe that the bidder identified in the posted recommendation for award is not
entitled to be awarded the contract, or who has a complaint about the bid process, may submit a written
bid protest, in writing, directed to the Purchasing Agent. Such protest may be submitted at any time prior
to the announcement of the recommended bidder, but no later than three business days after the date upon
which the recommendation for award is posted on the County's website and on the Purchasing Agent's
bulletin board. The bid protest must state with specificity the basis upon which the bidder believes that
the recommendation for award is erroneous, or the basis upon which the bidder believes the bid procedure
was unfair, including a statement of how the alleged unfairness prejudiced the protesting bidder. A bidder
who could have submitted a request for exception, clarification or information prior to bid opening but
failed to do so shall not be entitled to protest a bid on the basis of insufficient information or clarity after
the bids have been opened.

7886

DIVISION 6. MINORITY-AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES
Subdivision I. General Provisions
Sec. 34-275.

Short title.

This division shall be known and may be cited as the Cook County Minority- and
Women-Owned Business Enterprise Ordinance.
Sec. 34-276.

Purpose; policy and findings.

(a)
It is the public policy of the County to ensure the full and equitable participation of
minority and female owned businesses in the County's procurement process as both prime and
subcontractors.

7887

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
(b)
The County is committed to a policy of preventing discrimination in the award of or
participation in County contracts and eliminating arbitrary barriers to full participation in such contracts
by all persons, regardless of race, sex, or ethnicity.
(c)
Minority and women's businesses have contributed significantly to the economic
development of the community, and played a similar role in increasing employment, including that of
minorities.
(d)
Various Federal, State and local legislative bodies and governmental agencies have
adopted affirmative action programs in order to eradicate the practice of racial, ethnic and sexual
discrimination in the award of public contracts.
(e)
The County has heretofore adopted a Minority Business Enterprise Ordinance to ensure
that minority and women's businesses are provided full and equal opportunity to participate in County
contracts.
(f)
The Supreme Court of the United States in City of Richmond v. Croson, 488 U.S. 469
(1989), has enunciated certain standards which are necessary to maintain effective affirmative action
programs in compliance with constitutional requirements.
(g)
The County is committed to implementing its affirmative action program in conformance
with the United States Supreme Court's decision in City of Richmond v. Croson.
(h)
In furtherance of this commitment, the Cook County Board directed the County staff and
its outside consultants to conduct an investigation into the scope of any discrimination in the award of and
participation in County contracts as well as in the metropolitan Chicago economy, the extent to which
such discrimination or the effects thereof has denied and continues to deny minority and women's
business enterprises equal opportunity to participate in County contracts and to recommend the
appropriate affirmative action steps to be taken to eliminate any such discrimination and its continuing
effects.
(i)
Pursuant to the County Board's direction, the County staff and its outside consultants
conducted such an investigation.
(j)
The County Board, having reviewed the report of the County's staff and its outside
consultants and having conducted public hearings and received the testimony of witnesses, makes the
following findings:
(1)

Minority and women's businesses continue to be awarded prime contracts and
subcontracts in dollar amounts that are disproportionately lower than the
availability of such businesses willing and able to perform County contracts.

(2)

The County's procurement practices in the past have contributed to the above
identified underutilization of minority and women's businesses on County
contracts.

(3)

Minority and women's businesses continue to be disadvantaged by
discriminatory practices in the local construction industry and economy when
competing for County contracts and in seeking subcontracting opportunities on
such contracts.

7888

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008

Sec. 34-277.

(4)

The County was a passive participant in the discriminatory practices of
businesses which discriminate against minority and women's businesses by
entering into contracts with such businesses.

(5)

Despite its good faith efforts and implementation of previous affirmative action
programs, minority and women's businesses remain at a competitive
disadvantage in competing for County contracts and subcontracts.

(6)

Race and gender neutral measures or affirmative action programs without
numerical goals have not and are not likely to eliminate the competitive
disadvantage of minority and women's businesses in participating in County
contracts due to discrimination in the local economy.

(7)

The numerical goals for the participation of minority and women's businesses in
County contracts are commensurate with the availability of minority and
women's businesses willing and able to perform County work.

Sec. 34-280.

Program goals.

(a)
In fulfillment of its policy to promote equal opportunity in its procurement process, the
County establishes the goal that Protected Class Enterprises shall participate in not less then 35 percent of
the annual aggregate value of all contracts awarded by the County. County procurement personnel will
make their best efforts to recruit and solicit bids and make purchases from qualified Protected Class
Enterprises.

7893

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
(1)

Not less than 25 percent of the annual total dollar amount of County contracts
and 30 percent of the annual total dollar amount of construction contracts will be
established as a goal to be awarded to Minority Business Enterprises.

(2)

Not less than ten percent of the total dollar amount of County contracts, will be
established as a goal to be awarded to Women's Business Enterprises.

(3)

The above stated percentages relate to the total dollar amount of County
contracts during each fiscal year calculated by examining independently each
type of contract.

(b)
The County shall comply with all applicable Federal and State policies requiring
affirmative action to increase the employment opportunities of minority and female workers on its
construction projects.
(c)
No goal shall be treated as a quota nor shall it be used to discriminate against any person
or business enterprise on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion or sex.
Sec. 34-281.
(a)

(b)

Implementation.
Contract goals.
(1)

To achieve the goals stated in Section 34-280, the Purchasing Agent, except as
provided in Subsection (a)(2) of this section, shall include in the bid
specifications a requirement that each contractor commit that Minority Business
Enterprise and Women's Business Enterprise participation in the contract will
equal at least 25 percent (30 percent in the case of construction contracts) and ten
percent, respectively, of the total dollar value of the contract.

(2)

The Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent shall evaluate the
applicability of the Minority Business Enterprise and Women's Business
Enterprise goals to a specific contract. Where the Contract Compliance
Administrator Purchasing Agent, in consultation with the Purchasing Agent and
the user Departments, determines that the established goals are not appropriate
for a specific contract because of its particular requirements, the Contract
Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent shall set an appropriate goal for the
contract, based upon the availability of Protected Class Enterprises which are
capable of providing the goods and/or services required by the particular
contract, the past level of Protected Class Enterprise participation in similar
contracts, the specifications of the contract and any other criteria adopted by the
Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent.

(3)

The applicable goals for a specific contract shall be designated in the contract
specifications.

Contractor responsibility and requirements.
(1)

As a precondition to selection, each contractor shall submit with its bid a
completed and signed utilization plan which lists the names, addresses and
contact persons of businesses intended to be used as Protected Class Enterprises
on the contract, the type and scope of work or service each business will perform
and the dollar amount to be allocated to each Protected Class Enterprise. Such
listing shall not be duplicative (e.g., two or more entities each listed as
7894

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
performing 100 percent of the same work or service). Within three business days
following submission of bids, a bidder shall submit its letters of intent to
Protected Class Enterprises listed on its utilization plan, provided that no
substitutions shall be permitted prior to bid award. Each contractor's utilization
plan shall commit to Protected Class Enterprise participation equal to or greater
than each of the applicable Protected Class Enterprise goals, unless the contractor
requests a partial or total waiver of the requirement that it file a utilization plan or
achieve a particular goal for Protected Class Enterprise participation by
submitting with the filing of its bid a signed waiver request form.
(2)

Notwithstanding its compliance with any other requirement of County ordinances
and contract specifications, no bidder or offer shall be awarded an eligible
contract unless the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent has
approved its utilization plan or granted a waiver on the contract. Such utilization
plan shall be designed to meet the applicable Minority Business Enterprise and
Women's Business Enterprise goals set for such project and shall be incorporated
into the contract.

(3)

A contractor may achieve the applicable Protected Class Enterprise goals by its
status as a Protected Class Enterprise or by joint venture with one or more
Protected Class Enterprises or by subcontracting a portion of the work to one or
more Protected Class Enterprises or by purchase of materials or services from
one or more Protected Class Enterprises or by the indirect participation of
Protected Class Enterprises in other aspects of the contractor's business such as
through a Mentor/Protégé agreement as provided herein (in accordance with
applicable guidelines and provided that such Protected Class Enterprise indirect
participation may not be credited toward goal attainment on more than one
contract subject to this article) or by any combination of the above, subject to the
following guidelines:
a.

Joint ventures. Where a contractor engages in a joint venture to satisfy
its affirmative action commitment, the Contract Compliance
Administrator Purchasing Agent shall review the profits and losses,
initial capital investment, actual participation of the joint venture partners
in the performance of the contract, and other pertinent factors to
determine the amount of credit to be granted for the joint venture toward
attainment of the applicable Minority Business Enterprise and Women's
Business Enterprise goals. The Contract Compliance Administrator
Purchasing Agent may review all records pertaining to joint venture
agreements before or after the award of a contract in order to assess
compliance with this article. A contractor shall receive credit towards
achievement of the applicable goals in proportion to the percentage of
the contract to be performed by the Protected Class Enterprise, provided
that the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent may deny
or limit Protected Class Enterprise credit to a contractor where the
Protected Class Enterprise joint venture partner is found not to be
performing a commercially useful function or not to have duties,
responsibilities, management control or risk with respect to the joint
venture commensurate with or in proportion to its joint venture
ownership.

7895

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
b.

Subcontracts. A contractor may count toward its Protected Class
Enterprise goals only expenditures to Protected Class Enterprises that
perform a commercially useful function in the performance of a contract
for work actually performed or materials supplied by the Protected Class
Enterprise. To determine whether a Protected Class Enterprise is
performing a commercially useful function, the Contract Compliance
Administrator Purchasing Agent may evaluate the amount of work
subcontracted, industry practices, whether the Protected Class Enterprise
has the skill and experience to perform the work for which it is being
utilized and other relevant factors. Consistent with normal industry
practices, a Protected Class Enterprise subcontractor may enter into
second tier subcontracts. However, if a Protected Class Enterprise
contractor or subcontractor subcontracts a significantly greater portion of
the work of the contract than would be expected on the basis of normal
industry practices, the Minority Business Enterprise or Women's
Business Enterprise shall be presumed not to be performing a
commercially useful function.

c.

Manufacturers and suppliers. Where a contractor utilizes one or more
suppliers to achieve its Protected Class Enterprise goals, such Protected
Class Enterprise supplier participation may be 100 percent credited
toward goal attainment where the Protected Class Enterprise supplier
manufactures the goods supplied or where such Protected Class
Enterprise supplier owns or operates a store, warehouse or other
establishment (and related distribution equipment) in which it maintains,
consistent with industry standards, an inventory of the materials or
supplies required for performance of the contract for sale in the normal
course of business. The participation of a Protected Class Enterprise
supplier who acts as a broker (i.e., who performs no manufacturing or
warehousing) shall be credited toward the applicable Protected Class
Enterprise goals at a rate equal to ten percent of the payments to such
Protected Class Enterprise broker.

d.

Protected Class Enterprise prime contractors or joint venturers. A
Minority Business Enterprise or Women's Business Enterprise contractor
may count its own participation toward the achievement of the
applicable Minority Business Enterprise or Women's Business Enterprise
goal, respectively, but such a contractor will be required to meet all other
applicable goals by joint ventures, subcontracting or purchase of
materials or services. Where a contractor is a business owned and
controlled by minority women ("M/WBE") or where the contractor
utilizes a M/WBE in a joint venture, as a subcontractor or a supplier, the
contractor may count the M/WBE participation either toward the
achievement of its Minority Business Enterprise or Women's Business
Enterprise goal but not both.

7896

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
e.

(c)

Mentor/protégé agreements. Where a contractor enters into a written
agreement ("mentor/protégé" agreement) with a Protected Class
Enterprise to improve or develop certain aspects of the business of the
Protected Class Enterprise, such an agreement may be evaluated by the
Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent to assess
appropriate credit toward the Protected Class Enterprise goals of the
contractor. The contractor and Protected Class Enterprise shall remain
separate and independent business entities under the agreement. The
mentor/protege agreement may provide for the contractor to assist the
Protected Class Enterprise in such areas as technical aspects of its
business, improving financial management, or providing on-the-job
training. No such credit shall be available unless:

1.

The Protected Class Enterprise provides a commercially useful function in the
performance of its agreement with the contractor;

2.

The agreement is in writing and is submitted to the Contract Compliance
Administrator Purchasing Agent before the award of the contract; and

3.

The agreement clearly defines the respective responsibilities of the contractor and
the Protected Class Enterprise and includes specific, measurable goals to be
attained by both parties through the performance of the agreement. Upon
recommendation by the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent,
the Contract Compliance Committee shall determine the amount of credit to be
counted toward the applicable goals of this division. The Contract Compliance
Administrator Purchasing Agent shall require the contractor to submit periodic
reports summarizing the progress of the execution of the mentor/protégé
agreement, and shall notify both parties of any deficiencies in performance. In
order to qualify for credit, the mentor/protégé agreement must coincide in
duration with, or not be for a shorter length of time than, the contract between the
contractor and the County.

(4)

Where a contractor seeks relief from all or part of a contract's goals, the
contractor shall submit with its bid a proposal or request for a waiver.

(5)

A contractor's submission of a utilization plan which commits to a Protected
Class Enterprise participation goal equal to or greater than the applicable goals
shall not provide a basis for a higher bid, an increase in contract price or later
change order.

Review of bid or offer.
(1)

The Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent shall review each bid
or offer to determine if the contractor has included in its submission a completed
and signed utilization plan which meets the Protected Class Enterprise goals for
the contract, and approve or reject the plan.

(2)

The Purchasing Agent, at the direction of the Contract Compliance
Administrator, shall declare the bid or offer nonresponsive where the Contract
Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent determines that a contractor:

7897

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008

(3)

a.

Failed to submit with its bid a completed utilization plan;

b.

Failed to identify in its plan sufficient Minority Business Enterprises
and/or Women's Business Enterprises by name, scope of work and dollar
value of work to meet the applicable goals for the contract; or

c.

Failed to submit with its bid a request for a total or partial waiver of the
applicable goals.

Where a partial or total request for waiver of a goal is made, the Contract
Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent shall determine whether a bidder or
offerors has made good faith efforts to meet the applicable Protected Class
Enterprise goals and whether a total or partial waiver of a goal should be granted.
Good faith efforts, as defined herein, shall include, but are not limited to, the
following:
a.

Attend any prebid conference conducted by the County to acquaint
contractors with Protected Class Enterprises available to provide relevant
goods and services and to inform Protected Class Enterprise's of
subcontract opportunities on the contract;

b.

Review lists of available Protected Class Enterprises maintained by the
County and other State and local governments and agencies prior to the
bid opening to identify qualified Protected Class Enterprises for
solicitation for bids;

c.

Advertise, not less than 15 calendar days before the bid opening date, in
one or more daily newspapers and/or trade publications, for bids by
Protected Class Enterprises for subcontracts or the supply of goods and
services on the contract;

d.

Make timely written solicitations of available Protected Class
Enterprises identified on the County's list as providing relevant services
for bids for subcontracts or the supply of goods and services; and
provide Protected Class Enterprises with a convenient and timely
opportunity to review and obtain relevant plans, specifications or terms
and conditions of the contract to enable such Protected Class Enterprises
to prepare an informed response to a contractor solicitation;

e.

Divide total contract requirements into small tasks or quantities and
adjust performance bond and insurance requirements or otherwise assist
Protected Class Enterprises in obtaining the required bonding, insurance
or financing, where economically feasible, to encourage participation of
Protected Class Enterprises;

f.

Follow up initial solicitation of Protected Class Enterprises by contacting
Protected Class Enterprises to determine if the enterprises are interested
in making bids;

7898

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
g.

Negotiate in good faith with Protected Class Enterprises prior to the bid
opening and do not reject as unsatisfactory any bids submitted by
Protected Class Enterprises without justifiable reason;

h.

Establish delivery schedules, where the requirements of the work permit,
which will encourage participation by Protected Class Enterprises;

i.

Establish joint ventures with Protected Class Enterprises;

j.

Use the services and assistance of the Contract Compliance
Administrator's staff, the Small Business Administration, the Office of
Minority Business Enterprises of the U.S. Department of Commerce and
where the contractor seeks a waiver, make timely notice of the need for
Protected Class Enterprise subcontractors to an appropriate community
and minority and women's business organization identified as an assist
agency with respect to this article.

(4)

A contractor seeking a total or partial waiver shall, in accordance with guidelines
issued by the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent, be required
to submit evidence of its good faith efforts to achieve the applicable Protected
Class Enterprise goals and in support of its reasons for seeking a waiver.
Performance of all the actions set out in Subsection (c)(3) of this section by the
contractor shall create a rebuttable assumption that the contractor has made good
faith efforts to meet the applicable Protected Class Enterprise goals. The
determination of the adequacy of a contractor's good faith efforts will be
evaluated on the basis of the contractor's actions as of the date of the bid opening.

(5)

The Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent may grant the waiver
request of a contractor based upon the following criteria:

(6)

a.

Sufficient qualified Protected Class Enterprises capable of providing the
goods or services required by the contract are unavailable despite the
good faith efforts of the contractor;

b.

The specifications of and the reasonable and necessary requirements for
performing the contract make it impossible or economically infeasible to
divide the contract into sufficiently small tasks or quantities to enable the
contractor to utilize Protected Class Enterprises in accordance with the
applicable utilization goals;

c.

The price quoted by any potential Protected Class Enterprise source of
goods or services is more than ten percent above competitive levels; and

d.

Any other factor determined to be relevant by the Contract Compliance
Administrator.

Where a partial waiver is granted, the Contract Compliance Administrator
Purchasing Agent shall specify the amount of the applicable goal.

7899

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
(7)

Where the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent determines that
a contractor has not made a good faith effort to meet the applicable goals and/or
comply with the provisions herein, including, but not limited to, failing to timely
submit the required letters of intent or other information request and/or has not
otherwise met the requirements for a total or partial waiver, the Purchasing Agent
may declare the contractor nonresponsive and reject the bid and reject any waiver
request which may have been filed.

(8)

Where the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent determines that
the utilization plan submitted by a contractor is false or fraudulent, the
Purchasing Agent shall reject the bid or, if such a determination is made after the
bid award, the contract may be forfeited and canceled.

(d)
Subcontract requirements. Within 30 days after demand, the prime contractor shall
furnish fully executed copies of all protected class subagreements and these shall be reviewed by the
Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent and submitted to the Contract Compliance
Committee of the County Board. Subsequently, the prime contractor shall obtain and submit a copy of all
Minority Business Enterprise or Women's Business Enterprise related subtier contracts on demand.
(e)

Review of contract performance.
(1)

The Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent shall review the
contractor's efforts during the performance of the contract to achieve its Protected
Class Enterprise commitments as stated in its utilization plan. If the contractor
meets or exceeds its stated goals, it shall be presumed to be in compliance.
Where the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent finds that the
contractor has failed to achieve its stated goals or otherwise has failed to comply
with the requirements of the division, including failure to provide any
documentation required by the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing
Agent, has not satisfactorily demonstrated good faith efforts, and/or has deviated
without authorization from the compliance related portions of the contract as
originally approved, the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent
shall report findings to the Contract Compliance Committee.

(2)

The Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent may establish such
requirements for periodic contractor reporting on the fulfillment of its goals and
its utilization of Protected Class Enterprises as the Contract Compliance
Administrator Purchasing Agent determines appropriate and necessary for
effective enforcement of this division. A contractor also shall be required to
provide the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent any additional
requested compliance documentation within 14 days of such request.

(3)

If the Contract Compliance Committee determines that the contractor has failed
to comply with its contractual commitments or any portion of this division, the
Contract Compliance Committee will notify the contractor of such
noncompliance and may take any of the following actions:

7900

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
a.

Instruct the Comptroller to withhold 50 percent of the current progress
payment due the prime contractor.

b.

Withhold up to 100 percent of further progress payments until the
contractor demonstrates that it is in compliance with the requirements of
this division.

c.

Debar the contractor from future bids or offers until the contractor
demonstrates that it is in compliance with the requirements of this
division.

(f)
Protected Class Enterprise bid and target market programs. To address more
specifically the barriers to Protected Class Enterprise participation as prime contractors in County work,
the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent may direct the Purchasing Agent to institute
the following special Protected Class Enterprise bidding provisions, following determination of the
appropriateness of such provisions.
(1)

(2)

In connection with the award of a contract subject to competitive bidding on
which a Protected Class Enterprise has bid and where the Protected Class
Enterprise meets the following criteria:
a.

It is bidding on the item in question for the first time; and

b.

It never has successfully bid on a Cook County purchasing contract, the
Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent may, at the
opening of the bids on the item, compare the Protected Class Enterprise
bid with the lowest bid, and, if the Protected Class Enterprise's bid is
closely competitive as defined by guidelines to be established by the
Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent with that of
lowest actual bids, direct the Purchasing Agent to declare the Protected
Class Enterprise the successful bidder. A Protected Class Enterprise may
use this procedure only once to become the successful bidder on any
particular item. Thereafter, the Protected Class Enterprise must be totally
competitive in terms of price to be the successful bidder.

The Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent shall develop and
coordinate a target market program as follows:
a.

The Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent shall review
the availability of Protected Class Enterprises providing various goods
and services and shall identify for inclusion in a potential program for
bidding among Protected Class Enterprise firms certain commodity areas
with sufficient Protected Class Enterprise availability to ensure that the
County receives a competitive price. The Contract Compliance
Administrator Purchasing Agent shall report his/her findings and
recommendations to the Contract Compliance Committee;

b.

Upon a determination by the Contract Compliance Committee that such a
program is advisable for any particular commodity procurement, the
Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent will institute the
following procedures:
7901

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
1.

The Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent will notify the
Purchasing Agent of identification of those commodity codes appropriate for a
target market program;

2.

To the extent practicable, the Purchasing Agent, with the aid of the Contract
Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent, shall divide procurement in the
designated commodity areas into economically feasible sizes to facilitate bids or
offers from Protected Class Enterprises and shall designate contracts to be
offered under the target market program;

3.

The Purchasing Agent shall offer Protected Class Enterprises the opportunity to
bid on such contracts in a limited competition;

4.

All standard County rules for bidding will then become effective and, provided
that at least three Protected Class Enterprises bid or make an offer on the
contract, the lowest responsive and responsible bidder among the Protected Class
Enterprise firms will receive the contract;

5.

In the event less than three Protected Class Enterprises bid or make an offer on
the contract or if there is no responsive bid or offer received from a responsible
Protected Class Enterprise, the Purchasing Agent shall rebid the contract not
subject to the target market program.
c.

Participation in the target market program shall be limited to Minority
Business Enterprises, Women's Business Enterprises and joint ventures
consisting exclusively of Minority Business Enterprises, Women's
Business Enterprises or both. The Protected Class Enterprise contractor
on a target market contract may subcontract up to 50 percent of the dollar
value of the target market contract to subcontractors who are not
Minority Business Enterprises or Women's Business Enterprises.

(g)
Fifty percent Protected Class Enterprises required for informal bid solicitations. All
buyers shall solicit 50 percent PCEs in their informal bid solicitations for materials under $10,000.00,
which are not bid by formal advertising.
(h)
Buyers to use Protected Class Enterprises in requisitions. All buyers will make every
effort to use Protected Class Enterprises whenever possible in their requisitions for materials under
$10,000.00, which are not bid.
(i)
Division of large contracts to facilitate offers from Protected Class Enterprises. With
respect to large contracts for which subcontracting possibilities are impracticable, all buyers will, to the
extent practicable, divide such contracts into economically feasible sizes to facilitate bids or offers from
Protected Class Enterprises.
(j)
Technical assistance. The contractor is bound by all the requirements, terms, and
conditions of this article. Subsequent to the acceptance of an awarded contract, there will be no waiver of
the requirements, terms and conditions. The County Board, through its Contract Compliance Committee
and the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent, will make technical assistance in meeting
the terms and conditions of this article available to all interested bidders.

7902

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
(k)

Finance; measures for reduction of cash flow problems of protected class contractors.
(1)

As needed, the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent shall assist
Protected Class Enterprises with training seminars in the technical aspects of
preparing a bid for a County contract.

(2)

All prime contractors shall be urged to follow the County's example by making
prompt and timely payments to Protected Class Enterprise subcontractors
working on Cook County projects. The timeliness of such payments shall be
monitored by the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent on a
regular basis, and an investigation shall be made of every complaint or charge of
excessive delay in payment. Reports of these investigations shall be made to the
Contract Compliance Committee and to the County Comptroller.

(3)

If at any time during the progress of the work, the contractor shall fail or neglect
to pay a Protected Class Enterprise subcontractor for any labor performed,
furnished, or tools, machinery, appliances, fuels, provisions or supplies of any
sort or kind used or consumed upon, in or on account of the work for ten days
after payment for same shall become due, then the County shall have the power
and authority to pay such indebtedness, and the amount so paid shall be retained
out of the money due or to become due the contractor. The County Comptroller
may refuse to make the payment hereinafter specified to the extent of such
indebtedness, until satisfactory evidence in writing has been furnished that the
indebtedness has been discharged. In any such case, the Purchasing Agent is
hereby authorized and empowered by the contractor to ascertain the amount due
or owing from the contractor to any laborer or laborers, or to any person or
persons, or corporation, for labor, equipment, material, tools, machinery,
appliances, provisions, fuels, or supplies of any sort or kind consumed upon, in
or on account of the work covered by this contract in such manner and upon such
proofs as may be deemed sufficient.

(4)

The County Board shall encourage major prime contractors to make available to
Protected Class Enterprise subcontractors working on their projects their sources
of financial assistance.

(l)
Contract award considerations. Where the lowest responsive contractor submits a
bid/offer which exceeds by ten percent or more the bid/offer of the lowest PCE nonresponsive contractor
["PCE nonresponsive" for purposes of this subsection means nonresponsive pursuant to Subsection (c)(2)
of this section, but otherwise responsive to the contract specifications], the County shall have the right to
reject all bids/offers and rebid or request further offers.
Sec. 34-282.

Professionals and consulting services and sole source agreements.

All Department heads who may employ the professional services of accountants, attorneys,
physicians, dentists, statisticians, data analysts, engineers, and other such personnel or who require goods
or services procured through sole source agreements shall implement this article and compliance
programs in a "best effort" manner. In lieu of the requirements set forth in Section 34-281(b), all
providers of such professional services or goods or services are to be notified that:
(1)

In the case of term contracts (annually or for more than six months), they are to maximize
the use of Protected Class Enterprises or individuals as subconsultants or subcontractors.

7903

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
(2)

In the case of contracts instituted on an as-needed basis or lasting less than six months,
they are to submit to the County affirmative action plans and goals and maximize the
number of women and minority professionals in their firm who participate in various
County projects.

(3)

In both of the above cases the internal affirmative action plans and goals of the providers
shall be submitted to the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent and shall
be reviewed against the provider's actual affirmative action achievements and shall
become a part of the provider's protected class compliance review; this twice yearly
review by the Contract Compliance Administrator Purchasing Agent shall become a
factor in the County's continued use of the services of providers.

(4)

The County sets a "best efforts" goal of 35 percent Protected Class Enterprise
participation for the total professional services and consulting services utilized by the
County. The County must be able to call upon those professionals whose particular
training and experience most closely fit our needs. The County shall endeavor to increase
utilization of protected class firms. Because use of such services is not programmed or
predictable, a "best effort" standard shall be used for attainment of the goal amounts.

Sec. 34-283.

Other Federal and State regulations.

Nothing in this division shall be interpreted to diminish or supplant equal employment
opportunity requirements contained in Federal or State grant funded contracts.
Sec. 34-284.

Preference to residents of County.

In addition to the goals established pursuant to Section 34-280, there is established as a goal that
on any contract approved by the County Board there will be utilization of at least 50 percent bona fide
County residents and 30 percent minorities in each trade for each project awarded by the County and in
the aggregated workforce in each project five percent will be females.
Sec. 34-285.

Reporting and review.

The County Board directs the Contract Compliance Administrator to report to the County Board
on an annual basis with respect to the following:
(1)

The level of Protected Class Enterprise participation achieved in each year in County
contracts subject to this division;

(2)

The then current estimated availability of Protected Class Enterprises to perform County

Subdivision II. Construction Interim Ordinance
Sec. 34-286.

Title.

This subdivision shall be known as the "Minority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprise
Construction Interim Ordinance" and may be cited as such.
Sec. 34-287.

Recitals.

The President and the Board of Commissioners of the County of Cook find that all of the recitals
contained in the preambles to Ordinance No. 06-O-48 are full, true and correct and do incorporate them
into this subdivision by this reference.
Sec. 34-288.

Findings of discrimination.

The President and the Board of Commissioners of the County of Cook, after considering (i)
evidence presented at trial in Builders Association of Greater Chicago v. City of Chicago, 298 F.Supp.2d
725 (N.D. Ill. 2003) and Northern Contracting, Inc. v. Illinois Department of Transportation, 2005 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 19868 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 8, 2005); (ii) County statistical evidence of continuing discrimination
against Blacks, Hispanics, Asians and women in the County's contracting awards; (iii) the Report title,
"Review of Compelling Evidence of Discrimination Against Minority- and Women-Owned Business
Enterprise in the Chicago Area Construction Industry and Recommendations for Narrowly Tailored
Remedies for Cook County, Illinois;" as well as (iv) anecdotal evidence of discrimination against
minorities and women in the County's construction marketplace; and (v) receiving and considering
written reports, adopts the following findings as a strong basis in evidence supporting a narrowly tailored,
remedial affirmative action program in County construction contracting:
(a)
The County of Cook seeks to provide a level playing field and equal access for all prime
contractors and subcontractors to participate in County construction contracting opportunities;
(b)
Since the County's affirmative action program as it relates to construction projects was
declared unconstitutional in 2000, the County has witnessed a drastic reduction in M/WBE construction
prime contract and subcontract participation;
(c)
The County has engaged in committee hearings in which the County has heard anecdotal
evidence of discrimination in the construction industry, has commissioned a study on the levels of
M/WBE participation in County contracts, has reviewed the report prepared indicating evidence of
discrimination in County construction contracts and has considered the evidence in relevant case law;
(d)
In the absence of M/WBE participation goals the County has witnessed a drastic decline
in M/WBE participation in its construction contract below the availability of such firms and thus would
be a passive participant in a discriminatory marketplace without the use of such M/WBE goals;

7905

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
(e)

The County has a compelling interest in preventing discrimination; and

(f)
The County desires to reaffirm its commitment to full and fair opportunities for all firms

Public purpose.

It is hereby found, determined and declared that the purpose of this Interim Ordinance is to take
steps to ensure the full and equitable participation of Minority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprises
in the County's procurement process as both prime and subcontractors in the County's construction
contracts. The County is committed to a policy of preventing discrimination in the award of or
participation in construction contracts and has recommended appropriate affirmative action steps to be
taken to eliminate any such discrimination.
Sec. 34-290.

Applicability.

This subdivision shall apply to all construction contracts funded in whole or in part by County
funds, regardless of the sources of other funds; provided that any contract with respect to which a goal for
Minority-Owned Business Enterprise or Women-Owned Business Enterprise participation is inconsistent
with or prohibited by State or Federal law shall be exempt from the goals included in this subdivision.
Sec. 34- 291.

Severability.

If any section, subsection, clause or provision of this subdivision is held to be invalid by a court
of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the subdivision shall not be affected by such invalidity.

in the Program. The applicant has the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence.
(b)
Only a firm owned by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person(s) may be
certified as a MBE or WBE.

7911

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
(1)

The firm's ownership by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person
must be real, substantial, and continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of
the firm as reflected in ownership documents. The owner(s) must enjoy the
customary incidents of ownership and share in the risks and profits
commensurate with that ownership interest.

(2)

The contributions of capital or Expertise by the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) to acquire the ownership interest must be real and
substantial. If Expertise is relied upon as part of a Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner's contribution to acquire ownership, the Expertise must be
of the requisite quality generally recognized in a specialized field, in areas
critical to the firm's operations, indispensable to the firm's potential success,
specific to the type of work the firm performs and documented in the firm's
records. The individual whose Expertise is relied upon must have a
commensurate financial investment in the firm.

(c)
Only a firm that is managed and controlled by a Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged person(s) may be certified as a MBE or WBE.
(1)

A firm must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions that limit the
customary discretion of the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s).
There can be no restrictions through corporate charter provisions, by-law
provisions, contracts or any other formal or informal devices that prevent the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s), without the cooperation or
vote of any non-Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person, from making
any business decision of the firm, including the making of obligations or the
dispersing of funds.

(2)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the power
to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the firm and to
make day-to-day as well as long-term decisions on management, policy,
operations and work.

(3)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) may delegate various areas
of the management or daily operations of the firm to persons who are not
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged. Such delegations of authority must be
revocable, and the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must
retain the power to hire and fire any such person. The Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) must actually exercise control over the firm's operations,
work, management and policy.

(4)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have an overall
understanding of, and managerial and technical competence, experience and
Expertise, directly related to the firm's operations and work. The Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have the ability to intelligently and
critically evaluate information presented by other participants in the firm's
activities and to make independent decisions concerning the firm's daily
operations, work, management, and policymaking.

7912

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
(5)

If federal, state and/or local laws, regulations or statutes require the owner(s) to
have a particular license or other credential to own and/or control a certain type
of firm, then the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must
possess the required license or credential. If state law, County ordinance or other
law regulations or statute does not require that the owner posses the license or
credential, that the owner(s) lacks such license or credential is a factor, but is not
dispositive, in determining whether the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the firm.

(6)

A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside
employment or other business interests that conflict with the management of the
firm or prevent the owner from devoting sufficient time and attention to the
affairs of the firm to manage and control its day to day activities.

(d)
Only an independent firm may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An independent firm is
one whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another firm. Recognition of an applicant as
a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is
independent and non-Affiliated. In determining whether an applicant is an independent business, the
Director will:
(1)

Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Firms in such areas as personnel,
facilities, equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.

(2)

Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and nonCertified Firms or persons associated with non-Certified Firms compromise the
applicant's independence.

(3)

Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Firms to determine
whether a pattern of exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Firm
compromises the applicant's independence.

(4)

Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and nonCertified Firms with normal industry practice.

(e)
An applicant shall be certified only for specific types of work in which the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and Expertise to manage and control the firm's
operations and work.
(f)
The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or WBEs and
non-Certified Firms.
(g)
In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the Director by rule may accept formal
certifications by other entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if the Director determines that
the certification standards of such entities are comparable to those of the County.
(h)
The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the
Office of Contract Compliance the Purchasing Agent. Failure of the firm to seek recertification by filing
the necessary documentation with the Director as provided by rule may result in decertification.

7913

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
(i)
It is the responsibility of the Certified Firm to notify the Director of any change in its
circumstances affecting its continued eligibility for the Program. Failure to do so may result in the firm's
decertification.
(j)

The Director shall decertify a firm that does not continuously meet the eligibility criteria.

(k)
Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by the
County. The challenged firm shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be
maintained.
(l)
A firm that has been denied certification or recertification or has been decertified may
protest the denial or decertification as provided by rule.
(m)
A firm found to be ineligible may not apply for certification for six (6) months after the
effective date of the final decision.
(n)
A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for certification or a Certified
Firm as provided by rule. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the individual challenging the
eligibility of an applicant for certification or a certified form. The burden of proof shall rest with the
complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The director shall be the final
arbiter of all challenges. The presumption that the challenged firm is eligible shall remain in effect until
the County renders a final decision.
Sec. 34-296.

Annual aspirational goals.

The Annual Aspirational Goals for the utilization of MBEs and WBEs on County construction
contracts and subcontracts shall be 24 percent for MBEs and four percent for WBEs.
Sec. 34-297.

Project specific goals.

The Director, in consultation with the User Department shall establish Project Specific Goals for
construction Contracts based upon the availability of at least three MBEs and three WBEs to perform the
anticipated subcontracting functions of the project and the County's utilization of MBEs and WBEs to
date.
Sec. 34-298.

Counting MBE and WBE participation.

(a)
The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the MBEs or WBEs
own forces shall be counted, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the MBE or WBE
for the work of the contract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the MBE or WBE (except
supplies and equipment the MBE or WBE purchases or leases from the prime Contractor or the prime
Contractor's Affiliate).
(b)
The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a MBE or WBE for providing a
bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing
bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of a contract, shall be counted, provided the
fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar services.

7914

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
(c)
When a MBE or WBE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of the
total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the Joint
Venture's contract that is performed by the MBE or WBE with its own forces and for which it is
separately at risk, shall be counted.
(d)
Only expenditures to a MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function
shall be counted. To determine whether a MBE or WBE is performing a Commercially Useful Function,
the County will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the
MBE or WBE is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing
and other relevant factors. To perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be
responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining
quality and quantity, ordering the material, installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself.
A MBE or WBE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra
participant in the contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or
WBE participation. If a MBE or WBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would
be expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful
Function. When a MBE or WBE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the
Certified Firm may present evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e)
One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from a MBE or
WBE Manufacturer or Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of the fees or transportation
charges for the delivery of materials or supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the
payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and are commensurate with fees customarily
charged for similar services.
(f)
If a firm ceases to be a certified during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of
work performed under a contract with that firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted.
(g)
In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of a MBE or
WBE shall not be counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-299.

Contract pre-award compliance procedures.

(a)
For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all
subcontractors from which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have
been established, its achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan
shall be due at the time the bid proposal is due.
(b)
Any agreement between a Contractor and a MBE or WBE in which the Contractor
requires that the MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c)
Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the Director will
determine whether the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). In making this
determination, the Director will consider, at a minimum, the Contractor's efforts to:
(1)

Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid
meetings, advertising and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs
certified in the scopes of work of the contract. The Contractor shall provide
interested MBEs and WBEs with timely, adequate information about the plans,
specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow MBEs and WBEs to
respond to the solicitation. The Contractor must follow up initial solicitations
with interested MBEs and WBEs.

7915

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
(2)

Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to
increase the likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This
includes, where appropriate, breaking out contract work items into economically
feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBE participation, even when the
Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own
forces. It is the Contractor's responsibility to make a portion of the work
available to MBEs and WBEs and to select those portions of the work or material
needs consistent with the availability MBEs and WBEs to facilitate their
participation.

(3)

Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such
negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and
WBEs that were contacted; a description of the information provided regarding
the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and why
agreements could not be reached with MBEs and WBEs. The Contractor may not
reject MBEs and WBEs as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a
thorough investigation of their capabilities. That there may be some additional
costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEs is not in itself sufficient
reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as
such costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the
work of a contract with its own organization does not relieve it of the
responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all subcontractable scopes of work.

(4)

Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of
credit, or insurance as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where
appropriate.

(5)

Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary
equipment, supplies, materials, or related assistance or services, where
appropriate.

(6)

Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance the Purchasing Agent,
available minority/women community organizations, minority/women
contractors' groups, government sponsored minority/women business assistance
offices and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the
recruitment and placement of MBEs and WBEs.

(e)
In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of
other Contractors in meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the
apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be
reasonably questioned whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor
could have met the Project Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet
the Project Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBE participation obtained by
other Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.
(f)
A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the work, materials,
equipment or services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE and the agreed upon dollar value

timely access to the Contractor's books and records, including without limitation payroll records, tax
returns and records and books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its commitment
to MBE and WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion of the
contract. This provision shall be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision allowing
inspection of the Contractor's records by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.
(c)

subcontractor to begin work until both the Director, Purchasing Agent and the
User Department have approved the substitution.

(2)

The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably
should have been known by either party before the submission of the Utilization
Plan. Bid shopping is prohibited. The Contractor must negotiate with the MBE or
WBE subcontractor to resolve the problem. Where there has been a mistake or
disagreement about the scope of work, the MBE or WBE can be substituted only
where an agreement cannot be reached for a reasonable price for the correct
scope of work.

Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the
satisfaction of the County, the Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to fulfill
the Utilization Plan. The Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of

the Project Specific Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have been
made, the Contractor may substitute with a non-Certified Firm.

(6)

the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall undertake Good Faith Efforts to fulfill
the Utilization Plan. The Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of

disclosed in the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of the Director to modify the
Utilization Plan and must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure that MBES and WBEs have a fair
opportunity to bid on the new scope of work.
(e)
Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User Department at the time
they arise, to establish the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the MBE or WBE
goal.
(f)
Prior to contract closeout, the Director shall evaluate the Contractor's fulfillment of the
contracted goals, taking into account all approved substitutions, terminations and changes to the contract's
scope of work. If the County determines that Good Faith Efforts to meet the MBE or WBE commitments
were not made, or that fraudulent misrepresentations have been made, or any other breach of the contract
or violation of this subdivision, a remedy or sanction may be imposed, as provided in the contract.

in a new educational environment.”; and
WHEREAS, with the enactment of the law, these students were given the option, although voluntary on
the part of the school district, to transfer into the Regional Safe Schools Program, established in 1996 to

OFFICE OF CONTRACT COMPLIANCE
MEMORANDUM REGARDING CONTRACT NO. 07-53-562
The following item was deferred at the November 5, 2008 Board Meeting:
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 5, 2008 from
ELIZABETH “LIZ” DOODY GORMAN, County Commissioner
Item 20 on the Cook County Board Agenda of November 5, 2008 is information supplied by Betty
Hancock Perry, Director of the Office of Contract Compliance regarding Contract No. 07-53-562. There
are a number of inaccuracies in this document which I would like to address. Please review the
following:

8054

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
Utilization Plan
Madison indicated the bid they submitted did not meet the “Specified Goals,” however, a note was
included at the bottom of the Utilization Plan which stated, “see good faith efforts, we will continue to try
to meet the goals.” This response was not sufficient for this bid to be deemed responsive. The
compliance section of the bid document defines good faith efforts for the respondents must be exercised
prior to the bid submission, and supporting documentation must be included which validates the
respondents actions taken for them to be deemed responsive.
See attached page PE-6 from the bidder bid which clearly indicates that the good faith efforts will
be followed. The bidder did exercise good faith efforts prior to bid submission however a
statement was added that the bidder would continue to try to achieve the goals even though the
good faith option was exercised.
Madison’s Utilization Plan indicated the direct participation of ERA Valdivia (“Valdivia”) as an MBE
participant with the dollar amount of participation listed as $200,000.00 (7%) of the bid amount.
Additionally, while the MBE/WBE Utilization Plan states that the Letter(s) of Certification must be
attached to the bid, the Letter of Certification for Valdivia was not attached to the bid and was later faxed
to this office and received on August 21, 2008.
The bidder clearly executed the good faith efforts clause of the contract which does not require
letters of certification. After several calls to the compliance department by the bidder, the bidder
was requested to supply the letter on August 20, 2008. The bidder supplied the letter within 24
hours of the request.
This was the only vendor listed on the Utilization Plan submitted by Madison, and no where in the
documentation did they request a reduction of MBE participation, which stated reasons as to why they
were unable to meet the full 24% goals.
Please see the bidders bid form page PE-6 with the appropriate box checked indicating the bidder
was utilizing good faith efforts. Also see the bidders documents PE-6b checklist for MBE/WBE
Good Faith Efforts. Also see bidders document PE-6c checklist for good faith efforts. There is
no portion of the bid application that allows the bidder to state a reason to why they were unable
to meet the goals.
Another area of deficiency in the Utilization Plan was surrounding the work to be performed by the MBE.
The description of work fro Valdivia was listed as “Carpentry, Demolition.” The bid document states “A
bidder my count only the participation of MBEs and WBEs for the scopes of the work which they are
certified on or before the date of the submission.” The Certification Letter from the City of Chicago
listed Valdivia as certified in the following areas:
“Painting, Drywall and Sandblasting Contractor; Terrazzo, Tile Resin and Vinyl Flooring;
Waterproof Membrane Systems Installation; locker Installation.”
Contract Compliance considers drywall installation as a form of carpentry work and accepted this vendor
for the provision of the service however they were not certified to provide demolition services which
meant that Madison would not have received MBE credit for these services and thus not meet the 7%
participation as stated in the submitted Utilization Plan.
Additionally, there were no other
Minority/Woman Owned Business Enterprises listed on the Utilization Plan.

8055

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
Please see the bidder’s letter of intent between the prime contractor and ERA Valdivia. The letter
lists demolition, Drywall, ceilings and painting. The project contains what is commonly called
“demolition” this is removal of existing drywall and drywall studwall commonly called
“carpentry.” This work is routinely performed by ERA Valdivia, and covered by ERA Valdivia’s
Letter. This is the exact same work that was found to be acceptable by compliance for the bidder
that was $161,000 higher than Madison Construction.
Overall the Utilization Plan did not sufficiently meet the MBE/WBE goals of Cook County Government
and did not show proof that Madison exercised good faith efforts to meet the stated goals.
The bidder did exercise its good faith efforts to meet the MBE/WBE goals; however because of
the type of work requested the bidder was unable to meet the goals. The bidder submitted the
proper documentation and when Cook County requested further information responded
expeditiously.
Letter of Intent
The Letter of Intent between the Prime Contractor (Madison) and the MBE/WBE subcontractor supplier
(Valdivia) was submitted blank. The General Conditions, Section GC-52, Section II – Required PreAward Submittals reads as follows:
“To be responsive, A bidder shall either (1) meet the project specific MBE and WBE goals by
submitting with the bid a Utilization Plan, supported by Letters(s) of Intent and Letter(s) of
Certification Failure to submit the documents in accordance with these requirements will cause
the bid to be considered non-responsive and shall be cause for the bid to be rejected.”
The paraphrasing of this portion of the document completely excludes the second avenue a bidder
can utilize to be considered compliant. The portion of the statement that is left out includes:
Or (2) if the bidder cannot achieve the project specific MBE and/or WBE goals, by submitting
with the bid documentation its Good Faith Efforts to meet the project specific MBE and or WBE
Goals.
This was the avenue in which the bidder utilized to be considered compliant. By utilizing this
submittal process, it is impossible to submit a Letter of Intent or Utilization Plan because these
documents are to be filled out to identify compliance with the MBE/WBE compliance. A bidder
would be falsely representing their intention if submitting this documentation while conforming
to the Good Faith Efforts process.
Good Faith Efforts Checklist
Included in all Bid Packages is a Good Faith Efforts Checklist which is used as a guide for bidders to
ensure that they have complied with all areas of the M/WBE compliance portion of the bid. Madison
checked all items on the Good Faith Efforts Checklist and indicated for item number five (5) ("made
efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or insurance as may be
required for performance of the contract"), while it was checked as a good faith effort; it was "not
applicable. "

8056

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
The bidder identified that it was “not applicable.” There is no basis for this grievance.
The Good Faith Efforts Contacts Log was submitted with the bid. However, Madison did not, at the time
of the bid opening, provide any documentation supporting the purported contacts made in an effort to
meet the M/WBE.
According to the bid instructions there is no requirement to provide any additional documentation
indicating the efforts to reach out to MBE/WBE companies.
2. City Lights: Work solicited was for Electrical. The reason stated in the document as to why
agreement was not reached was indicated as "not enough time to bid project." The date of contact
was listed on the document as July 7, 2008.
2. Kingdom Community Work solicited was for Carpentry and Demolition. The reason stated in
the document as to why agreement was not reached was indicated as "not enough time to bid
project." The date of contact was listed on the document as July 7, 2008.
2. S Mechanic: Work solicited was for HV AC. The reason stated in the document as to why
agreement was not reached was indicated as "not interested." The date of contact listed on the
document was July 7, 2008.
The Office of Contract Compliance contacted the subcontractors listed on the Contact Log to verify the
reasons included in the document and the following was noted:
Juan Candelaria of City Lights stated they were contacted too late to provide a bid. They were
given two (2) days notice.
John Abercrombie of Kingdom Community did not return calls to the Office of Contract
Compliance.
S Mechanic's telephone was disconnected. As of today's date the telephone number listed on the
contact log remains disconnected.
Juan Candelaria was contacted in the required 10 days prior to the bid due date.
John Abercrombie is a pastor of Kingdom Community church and his construction company goes
by the same name. He had an extensive conversation with compliance exceeding thirty minutes
on September 2, 2008.
S Mechanichals number was disconnected.
Note: While there were three (3) vendors listed as "Good Faith" there are forty seven (47) vendors listed
in the County's directory in the area of construction.
The General Conditions Section GC - 52, Section II, bidder must notify MBEs and WBEs of
subcontracting opportunities at least ten (10) business days before submission of the bid. The MBEs listed
on this bid were notified eight (8) business days prior to bid opening, not ten (10) as stated in their letters
(exhibit 2).

8057

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
On August 21, 2008, the Office of Contract Compliance received via fax, the signed Letter of Intent
between Madison Construction and ERA Valdivia signed and notarized on July 15, 2008. This document
which is to be included at the time of bid opening was received thirty four (34) days after the bid opening.
(see submitted letter)
By utilizing the Good Faith Efforts submittal process, according to the bid instructions, it is not
necessary to submit a Letter of Intent or Utilization Plan because these documents are to be
provided when attempting to represent compliance with the MBE/WBE goals. An issue is made
here that information was submitted 34 days after the bid was presented. Why then did Contract
Compliance request this information on the 33rd day.
The Office of Contract Compliance's procedure is not to communicate with bidders our findings until the
Board has voted on the bid. The Office of Contract Compliance may determine a bidder is nonresponsive, however; the Board of Commissioners have the authority to override this recommendation.
Upon award of a contract, we will provide any bidder with reasons as to why their bid was non
responsive.
The bid documentation states that “If a Utilization Plan is denied because the Good Faith Efforts
requirements have not been met, the County shall inform the bidder in writing for the basis for the
denial. To protest such a decision, the bidder shall follow the purchasing protest process
described in Cook County’s Purchasing office Solicitation instructions.”
On September 12, 2008, the Office of Contract Compliance having completed the analysis and
investigation of the bid and all documentation received for Contract No. 07-53-562, sent a letter to the
Purchasing Agent indicating Madison Construction as being non-responsive.
Shortly thereafter, on September 17, 2008, the Compliance Officer received a telephone call from Martin
McCarthy, Director of Performance Contracting, Madison Construction, requesting a reason as to why
they had been found non-responsive. When Mr. McCarthy was not satisfied with the answer he received,
he proceeded to call the Compliance Administrator, requesting a written explanation as to why their bid
was non-responsive.
The explanation given to Mr. McCarthy was that this Office does not provide a letter to bidders until such
time as a recommendation has been voted upon by the Board of Commissioners.
On September 19, 2008, the Office of Contract Compliance received a letter from Mr. McCarthy of
Madison Construction indicating they were now willing to meet or exceed the MBE/WBE participation
goals. This communication was received after the bid opening, therefore, it could not be considered at that
time. (see submitted letter)
This statement attempts to misrepresent the intention of Mr. McCarthy’s statement. The bidder
was unable to provide the goals at the time of the bid. This is a fact that the bidder did not
attempt to keep undisclosed. The bid suggested that they attempted to meet the goals through
good faith efforts. Mr. McCarthy’s letter indicated that the bidder will continue to attempt to meet
or exceeded the MBE/WBE goals.
On September 22, 2008, Commissioner Gorman's Administrative Assistant telephoned our office to speak
to the Administrator regarding the Madison file. She was told the Administrator was away from the
office.

8058

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
A staff member from Ms. Hancock-Perry’s office called back that day, Monday, and stated that
Ms. Hancock-Perry was well aware of this bid but would be unavailable to speak with me until
Thursday, September 25, 2008
As a result of the call from the Commissioner's Office, Staff of the Office of Contract Compliance
telephoned the Administrator about the request for information on Madison Construction and was
directed to take the file and review it with Commissioner Gorman. When they arrived at Commissioner's
office, they were told she was not in. My staff however, reviewed the information in the file with
Commissioner Gorman's staff.
On September 25, 2008, the Administrator telephoned Commissioner Gorman and asked if she had
received the information the staff shared with her staff and whether or not the explanation answered her
concerns. She stated she had received the information; however, she was not satisfied with the
explanation.
No, I wasn’t satisfied with the information as the answers changed almost on an hourly basis. For
example, Ms. Hancock-Perry told me during one conversation that a bidder could protest being
found non-responsive on the Contract Compliance website. I looked at that website and could not
find anywhere to level such a protest. Also note that no bid recommendations were presented to
the County Board for approval at the October 1, 2008 board meeting.
On October 15, 2008 at the Cook County Board Meeting, Commissioner Butler provided the
Administrator with a copy of the letter Commissioner Gorman distributed to the County Board Members.
The Administrator had no knowledge of the document prior to Commissioner Butler sharing it.
After reviewing the letter submitted by Madison, it should be noted that attachment Exhibits 1 and 2
which denotes the MBE bidders solicited and supporting letters documenting their good faith efforts,
were received after the bid opening. Please note that they are dated September 24, 2008, well after the
July 17, 2008 bid opening date. These documents were not a part of the bid as required by GC-52, II
paragraph one. We do not concur with Madison's assertion that the Office of Contract Compliance did not
confirm Madison's good faith efforts. As noted above, we made every attempt to do so with the
information that was provided to us at the time of bid submission.
The letters supplied by the bidder to Commissioner Gorman were not intended to be submittals
for the Bid as the above paragraph attempts to assert, however were provided to acknowledge the
bidders continuing participation and support for MBE/WBE Companies.
Further, it should be noted that Contract Compliance did not state that Valdivia was not certified to do the
work in the bid package. Our finding was and it was stated, "Valdivia was not certified in the area of
Demolition" as listed on the Utilization Plan, and later listed on the Letter of Intent received thirty-four
(34) days late to this office.
If compliance found “Valdivia not certified in the area of Demolition,” why then was it
acceptable for the second bidder John Burns Company?
In conclusion, the Office of Contract Compliance followed standard operating procedures as it reviewed
the bid response for the "build out of the pharmacy" within the Bureau of Health Services. It is my hope
that this chronology answers any questions regarding the decision to deem Madison non-responsive. I
would be happy to answer any additional questions that may arise.

8059

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2008
The Office of Compliance has consistently made statements that are not consistent with the bid
application. The “standard operating procedures” of the Office of Contract Compliance along
with the bid material may need be reviewed to determine if the information is consistent. This
document acts to refute, yet again, the statements made by the Office of Compliance regarding
why Madison Construction’s bid was considered non-responsive. Cook County must be losing
significant revenue because of such inconsistencies and would have lost $161,000 if this bid
would have been assigned to the second bidder.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 24, 2008 from
THOMAS J. DART, Sheriff of Cook County
by
ALEXIS A. HERRERA, Chief Financial Officer
requesting authorization to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the County of
Cook and the City of Chicago to provide for the governance of the Public Safety Interoperable
Communications Grant (PSIC). This MOU will provide capital funds to upgrade the County's radio
system infrastructure. This upgrade will include increase capacity, and connectivity to the statewide
Starcom Communication System. In addition the system will provide for a high performance data
solution to connect City of Chicago and Cook County mobile units.
Once deployed, this system will make it possible for the City of Chicago, Cook County and Sub-Agencies
to communicate on a unified system. This system is compliant with the United States Department of
Homeland Security and the Federal Communications Commission guidelines.
As part of this MOU the County will be required to provide a $2,024,430.00 match. The funds for this
project were approved by the Cook County Board of Commissioners with the passage of the Fiscal Year
2008 Annual Appropriation Bill for the Cook County Sheriff's Office. The City of Chicago will be the
lead agency partnering with Cook County on the project. The City of Chicago will also be required to
provide a match of $2,024,430.00.
This MOU was drafted by both the Cook County State's Attorney and the City's Corporation Counsel.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $2,024,430.00. (715/211-570 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request and will necessitate the issuance of capital
bonds and order for payment to be made to the City of Chicago.

AMOUNT
$197,555.22
(Deduction)

The quantities as shown on the contract documents were estimated for bidding purposes only. This
change represents the difference between the estimated quantities and actual field quantities of work
performed with a substantial savings due to less usage of Class D Patches, elimination of Polymerized
Leveling Binder and contract extra work items.
New items were created for regular Leveling Binder and repair of stone trenches on driveways due to site
conditions.
I respectfully recommend approval by your Honorable Body.

OFFICE OF THE SHERIFF
CONTRACT ADDENDUM
Transmitting a Communication from
THOMAS J. DART, Sheriff of Cook County
by
ALEXIS A. HERRERA, Chief Financial Officer
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to amend and extend for three (3) months, Contract No.
04-54-618 with Aramark Correctional Services, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia. The vendor has agreed to an
extension but has requested a price adjustment from .82 per meal to .96 per meal. The contractor is
making this request based upon significant increases in food commodity prices over the last three years.
Reason:

This amendment will allow for the continuation of food services at the Department of
Corrections, Cook County Boot Camp, Department of Women’s Justice Services and the
Department of Community Supervision and Intervention and for sufficient time to bid,
evaluate and award a new contract. Due to the essential nature of this contract and its level of
importance, the Sheriff’s Office conducted a top to bottom review of the Food Service
Program. The results of this review necessitated revisions to our specifications to meet the
current needs of the detainee populations. This has resulted in a delay in finalizing the
specifications. No increase to the current contract is required. There are sufficient funds
remaining in the contract to cover the price adjustment. Approximately $4,676,739.00
remains on this contract.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract extension: December 1, 2008 through February 28, 2009.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the County Purchasing Agent
be authorized to amend and extend the requested contract. The motion carried.
Commissioners Maldonado, Peraica and Suffredin voted "no".
