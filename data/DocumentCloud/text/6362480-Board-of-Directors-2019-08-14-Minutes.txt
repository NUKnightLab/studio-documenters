Project Introduction
As the Board is aware, FCA US LLC (“FCA”), the City of Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority

the following investment proposed by FCA in the city of Detroit (the “Project”):
•

•

Construct a new assembly plant at the site of its current Mack Engine Plant located at Mack and
St. Jean, with an estimated investment of $1.6 billion and creation of approximately 3,850 net new
full-time jobs; and
Invest approximately $900 million at its Jefferson North Assembly Plant, located at Jefferson and
St. Jean, creating approximately 1,100 net new full-time jobs.

In connection with the Project, FCA requires additional parcels of land to provide adequate employee
parking at a leased facility in the I-94 Industrial Park, to be owned by Crown Enterprises (“Crown”). DBRA
staff have identified thirteen (13) parcels of land identified on Exhibit A attached hereto located within the
I-94 Industrial Park which are currently owned by the City and the Detroit Land Bank Authority (“DLBA”).
Upon the DBRA’s acquisition of the parcels of land from the City and DLBA, the DBRA will transfer the
parcels to Crown. Upon such transfer, Crown will provide the City with a credit against any purchase price
to be paid by the City to Crown for the sale of land in connection with the Project. Thereafter, Crown will
lease these parcels of land to FCA, allowing FCA to provide employee parking. The transaction
contemplated herein shall be subject to the approval of the Detroit City Council.
DBRA staff is seeking this Board’s approval authorizing DBRA staff to (i) enter into an agreement or
amendment with the City and DLBA for the acquisition of parcels identified in Exhibit A; and (ii) enter into
an agreement or amendment with Crown or FCA for the transfer of such parcels. A resolution approving
the transaction contemplated herein was attached for the Board’s consideration.
Mr. Scott asked if Crown is leasing the parking to FCA. Ms. Bridges confirmed that Crown is leasing the
parking to FCA and Crown will own the property.
Mr. Scott asked if the DBRA considered purchasing the property from Crown. Ms. Bridges stated that
purchasing the property from Crown was considered and that there would be a credit given to the DBRA
by Crown against the purchase price should the DBRA purchase the property from Crown.

 Ms. DeSantis asked if Crown is receiving land in the land swap and also continuing to receive revenue
through the lease with FCA for parking on the property. Ms. Navin stated that Crown has an agreement
with FCA to lease the property to FCA for parking.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the Industrial Land Assembly Project: Acquisition of Additional
Parcels, as presented. The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Ms. Washington, seconded by Mr. Scott, DBRA Resolution Code 19-08-262-26

Amended and Restated Book Cadillac Hotel Brownfield Plan: Recommend Abolishment
Ms. Capler presented the recommendation to abolish the Amended and Restated Book Cadillac Hotel
Brownfield Plan to the DBRA Board.
Section 14(8)(a) of Act 381 of 1996, as amended, states:
“A brownfield plan or plan amendment may be abolished or terminated according to this subsection
subject to all of the following:
(a) The governing body may abolish a brownfield plan when it finds that the purposes for which
the plan was established are accomplished.
(b) The governing body may terminate a brownfield plan or plan amendment for an eligible
property if the project for which eligible activities were identified in the brownfield plan or
plan amendment fails to occur with respect to the eligible property for at least 2 years
following the date of the resolution approving the brownfield plan or plan amendment,
provided that the governing body first does both of the following:
(i)
(ii)

Gives 30 days' prior written notice to the developer at its last known address by

Over the years, the DBRA has approved Brownfield Plans which describe projects that have been
completed or have failed to come to fruition (the “Plan(s)”). These Plans, particularly Plans that involve TIF
revenue, create an administrative burden for the City and the DBRA with multiple annual accounting and
reporting requirements for each Plan. Additionally, a stalled Plan prevents a new proposed development
from being able to use and/or take full advantage of Brownfield TIF. Terminating or abolishing a Plan allows
new proposed developments to make full use of Brownfield TIF financing through a new Brownfield Plan
that is in line with the new proposed development.

accomplished. Section 14(8)(b) of Act 381 of 1996, as amended, allows City Council to abolish the plan as
a result.

via certified mail to the developer no less than 30 days before the date City Council is scheduled to abolish
the Plan.

 2. Issue a certified letter notification to the Developer of the intent to abolish the Plan in no less than
30 days as well as the opportunity to be heard at a public meeting.

Over the years, the DBRA has approved Brownfield Plans which describe projects that have been
completed or have failed to come to fruition (the “Plan(s)”). These Plans, particularly Plans that involve TIF
revenue, create an administrative burden for the City and the DBRA with multiple annual accounting and
reporting requirements for each Plan. Additionally, a stalled Plan prevents a new proposed development
from being able to use and/or take full advantage of Brownfield TIF. Terminating or abolishing a Plan allows
new proposed developments to make full use of Brownfield TIF financing through a new Brownfield Plan
that is in line with the new proposed development.
Lombardo Heritage L.L.C. is a Plan approved by Council on November 30, 2001. The project, developed
by Lombardo Heritage L.L.C. proposed the redevelopment of approximately 10.6 acres of property located
on the south side of East Jefferson Avenue between Newport and Drexel in the Jefferson Chalmers
neighborhood of Detroit. The project has been completed and the purposes for which the Plan was
established have been accomplished. Section 14(8)(b) of Act 381 of 1996, as amended, allows City Council
to abolish the plan as a result.
It is the opinion of DBRA staff that the Lombardo Heritage L.L.C. Plan should be abolished due to the fact
that the project described in the Plan has been completed and the purposes for which the Plan was
established have been accomplished. DBRA staff, upon DBRA Board approval, will send a notice via
certified mail to the developer no less than 30 days before the date City Council is scheduled to abolish the
Plan.
A resolution recommending the following actions for the Plan is attached for your review and approval:

 1. Recommendation to abolish the Plan to City Council.
2. Issue a certified letter notification to the Developer of the intent to abolish the Plan in no less than
30 days as well as the opportunity to be heard at a public meeting.
3. Authorization to the DBRA to terminate any other agreements or contracts between Developer and
the DBRA executed in conjunction with the Plan upon abolishment of the Plan by City Council.
The Plan will be formally abolished upon adoption of a Resolution for the Plan by City Council and following
the signing of the Resolution by the Mayor.
