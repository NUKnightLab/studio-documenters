time before the Participant’s earliest retirement eligibility, and
WHEREAS, the Board’s policy is to require that the cost for the actuary’s calculations are to be
borne by the parties to the domestic relations proceedings and the EDRO states that the
Participant and the Alternate Payee shall be responsible for the additional actuarial costs, and
that the Alternate Payee’s share of said costs shall be in proportion to her share of the
Participant’s retirement allowance awarded to her under the EDRO, and
WHEREAS, said matter had been discussed with legal counsel who has opined that the

Resolution Moved By: Trustee Cowan Supported By: Trustee Szymanski

WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees is in receipt of an Eligible Domestic Relations Order
(the “Order”), dated November 18, 2016, wherein Delphine Ogletree, the Alternate

Fund, and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Order, the Alternate Payee is entitled to a
portion of the Participant’s retirement allowance payable from the Retirement System,
and

applicable terms of said court order are consistent with the provisions of the Retirement
System and applicable law and regardless of the order being titled an Eligible Domestic

RESOLVED, that the Board acknowledges receipt of said court order and the Board will

 GENERAL RETIREMENT SYSTEM
CITY OF DETROIT

MEETING NO. 4174
JANUARY 18, 2017

Statement from Trustee Cowan: I am voting No on the Joint Personnel Committee
Charter motion. My decision was based on the following reasons: I believe for those
Trustees who don’t sit on the Joint Personnel Committee, rights are being taken away
from them. I don’t mind that the Committee make decisions but those decisions should
come back to the Board for a vote. My understanding of what a committee does is for
the members to gather all facts and to present their recommendations to the Board for
approval. Since May of 2013 being a Trustee, I have not seen this process followed.
The lack of transparency is what I disapprove of. I feel all Police & Fire and General
Trustees should be included in voting on all matters pertaining to personnel issues.
Also, during my tenure, the Joint Personnel Committee members have not followed the
procedure in posting schedule meetings for the public. I research other Boards such as
in Michigan and in other states and found that they didn’t need to set up a charter to
handle issues like we are doing. Also, I don’t agree with the language in the charter that
speaks to the members giving an oral report. It should be a written report. I became a
Trustee to follow the policies and procedures. I plan on upholding the integrity of this
Board and serve with an attitude of being fair and just in making decisions for our
members and retirees.
The Board discussed the matter at more length.
