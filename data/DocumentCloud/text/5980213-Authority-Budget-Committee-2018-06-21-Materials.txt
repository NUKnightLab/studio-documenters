1. Minutes of the December 13, 2017, Budget Committee Meeting
Motion: Ms. Campanelli moved to approve the minutes of the December 13, 2017,
Budget Committee Meeting. Ms. Kramer seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
Executive Director’s Remarks
Executive Director Maki discussed recent media attention focused on ICJIA regarding a
grant the Kane County State’s Attorney’s Office (SAO) applied for but did not receive.
He said ICJIA staff released a notice of funding opportunity for the grant and conducted a
competitive grant awarding process compliant with the Grant Accountability and
Transparency Act (GATA), the results of which did not produce a recommendation to
fund the Kane County SAO’s proposal. Executive Director Maki noted ICJIA policy of
not commenting on unsuccessful grant applications. ICJIA has been forthcoming and
transparent regarding the shift in recent years from a practice of funding legacy programs
to the adoption of a competitive process for awarding grant funds, but some organizations
that have been accustomed to the older legacy system have not come to fully understand
the new GATA environment, he said. He added that in his capacity as executive director,
he does not become personally involved in determining which applicant receives funding;
ICJIA staff makes those determinations in accordance with GATA and other established
policies and procedures. Executive Director Maki said the Kane County SAO appealed

3

 2/28/18 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 3

the rejection of its application, but the appeal was denied because ICJIA adhered to
GATA requirements and guidelines. Further discussions between ICJIA and the Kane
County SAO are anticipated and it is reasonable to assume that in the future similar
situations might arise regarding other rejected applications.
2. SFY18 Prescription Pill and Drug Disposal Fund
Associate Director Givens referred to a memo dated February 28, 2018, regarding the
SFY18 Prescription Pill and Drug Disposal (PPDD) Fund. He said that the Illinois
General Assembly passed Public Act 097-0545, which established the PPDD Fund. The
Act states, “Monies in the Fund shall be used for grants by the Illinois Criminal Justice
Information Authority to local law enforcement agencies for the purpose of facilitating
the collection, transportation, and incineration of pharmaceuticals from residential
sources that are collected and transported by law enforcement agencies.” ICJIA asked
the Illinois Sheriff’s Association (ISA) to consider procuring approximately 70 drug
disposal kits/lock boxes with grant funding on behalf of its agencies. Staff recommends
designating $150,000 in SFY18 PPDD funds to the ISA to support this effort.
Motion: Ms. Vollen-Katz moved to approve the recommended designation. Ms. Kramer
seconded the motion.
Executive Director Maki said the PPDD program was a mandate and that developing it
has consumed considerable staff time.
Associate Director Givens said the PPDD program needed to be coordinated with the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency to ensure regulated materials are properly
disposed.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
3. FFY17 Violence Against Women Act Plan Introduction
Associate Director Givens referred to a memo dated February 28, 2018, regarding the
FFY17 Violence Against Women Act Plan Introduction. He said the FFY17 VAWA
award to Illinois is $5,160,091 with an expiration of June 30, 2019. Staff recommended
designating the award’s formula service provider funds to the Illinois Coalition Against
Domestic Violence (ICADV) and Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA) in
equal amounts of $696,613.
Motion: Ms. Kramer moved to approve the recommended designations. Ms. Kramer
seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.

4. FFY15 and FFY16 Victims of Crime Act Plan Adjustments
Associate Director Givens referred to a memo dated February 28, 2018, regarding FFY15
and FFY16 Victims of Crime Act Plan Adjustments.
1. Designation Reductions
Associate Director Givens called attention to a chart describing $279,908 in FFY15 and
FFY16 funds recently returned to ICJIA. He said staff recommended reducing the
original designations by their respective returned amounts and making those funds
available for other programming.
Motion: Ms. Dunne moved to approve the recommended designation reductions. Ms.
Campanelli seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote, with a recusal by Ms. Kramer.
2. Recommended Designations
A. Transitional Housing
Associate Director Givens called attention to a chart describing $1,070,954 in FFY15
funds recommended for designation to transitional housing programs. He said the funds
would allow the programs to operate until August 31, 2018.
Motion: Ms. Kramer moved to approve the recommended designations. Ms. VollenKatz seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
B. Lead Entities
Associate Director Givens said that staff recommended the following designations of
FFY16 funds to Lead Entities:
Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV): $17,300,000
Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA): $16,300,000
Children’s Advocacy Centers of Illinois (CACI): $7,100,000
Motion: Ms. Barnes moved to approve the recommended designations. Ms. Dunne
seconded the motion.
Executive Director Maki said that ICJIA has historically used these Lead Entities as passthrough agencies for grant funding. They provide subject-matter expertise that is beyond
the scope of ICJIA’s work, he said.

5

 2/28/18 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 5

ICJIA Program Manager Ron Reichgelt said staff works with the Lead Entities to
structure their policies and procedures to reflect those of ICJIA. Staff also reviews their
requests for proposals and approves funding recommendations, he said. ICJIA also serves
as a final tier of appeal in the event that an applicant to a Lead Entity request for
proposals is denied funding, he said.
Further discussion produced the proposal of the creation of a statewide interactive victim
services resource list that identifies which programs provide what services and in what
locations.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
C. Trauma Recovery Centers
Associate Director Givens said Trauma Recovery Center (TRC) hospital-based model
programs support comprehensive direct services for historically underserved or
marginalized victims of violent crime and their families through implementation of a
TRC. This model borrows greatly from the University of California-San Francisco’s TRC
model, he said. Staff recommended two designations of $1,100,000 in FFY16 funds; one
to Advocate Christ Medical Center and one to OSF Health Care System, dba St. Francis
Medical Center to develop and implement the TRC program for 15 months. He said three
months will be intended for development of mandatory protocols and 12 months of direct
services would then be supported.
Executive Director Maki said TRC pilot programs intended to address underserved
victims.
ICJIA Strategic Policy Advisor Reshma Desai said staff have received technical
assistance from the founder of the TRC model, and technical assistance will also be
provided to the grantees.
General Counsel Weis said the funding at this point is intended to set up and establish the
pilot programs. Even though the two programs are in different settings with different
populations, the numbers of persons entering these programs at their respective locations
will be very similar, as both programs will have the same numbers of staff.
Executive Director Maki said working with hospitals has presented unique challenges
because they are structured very differently than the victim service agencies or
government agencies.
Motion: Ms. Barnes moved to approve the recommended designations. Ms. Dunne
seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.

5. Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA)
Associate Director Givens referred to a memo dated February 28, 2018, regarding Sex
Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) designations. At the September 28,
2017, Budget Committee meeting, the committee approved a notice of funding
opportunity for SORNA penalty funds to purchase equipment that would allow electronic
submission of sex offender documents to Illinois State Police. He called attention to a
chart describing $203,001 in FFY16 funds recommended for the purchase of scanning
and storage equipment to facilitate electronic transmission of sex offender documentation
between local registration agencies and ISP and acquisition of Livescan stations that
capture and transmit sex offender palm prints.
Associate Director Givens also called attention to a chart describing recommended
designations of FFY16 pending fund availability and FFY17 funds pending approval
from the U.S. Department of Justice.
ICJIA Program Manager Shai Hoffman said that colleges and universities that have their
own police departments and sworn officers were eligible to receive funds. He said that 13
of 19 grant applicants were recommended and in most cases the funds would be used to
replace equipment that is between five and 15 years old. He said in three cases, grantees
would be making initial equipment purchases.
Mr. O’Grady said that he was surprised to not see more grants to entities downstate,
where many small agencies are still processing information on paper.
Executive Director Maki said that there are many challenges in reaching out to smaller
under-funded agencies that lack grant-writing ability and/or capacity. ICJIA disseminates
information about funding opportunities to various statewide associations and in other
ways, but staff is open to suggestions about ways to share information.
General Counsel Weis said that many smaller entities do not have staff who are dedicated
to grant writing and that is a structural issue.
A discussion ensued around outreach on funding opportunities and problems agencies
have in responding to such opportunities. Executive Director Maki said that the issues
might be better addressed by the Strategic Opportunities Committee.
Motion: Ms. Barnes moved to approve the recommended designations. Ms. Vollen-Katz
seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
Public Comment
None.

MEMORANDUM

TO:

Budget Committee Members

FROM:

Greg Stevens, Acting Associate Director, Federal and State Grants Unit

DATE:

June 21, 2018

RE:

State Appropriated Programs:
A. SFY 2019 CeaseFire / Chicago Project for Violence Prevention
B. SFY 2019 Community-Based Violence Prevention and
Intervention
C. SFY 2019 Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Councils
D. SFY 2019 Safe From the Start

This memo describes proposed designations for SFY19 CeaseFire / Chicago Project for
Violence Prevention, Community-Based Violence Intervention and Prevention, Illinois
Family Violence Coordinating Councils, and Safe from the Start funds.
CeaseFire / Chicago Project for Violence Prevention
The mission of CeaseFire Illinois, a unit at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of
Public Health, is to: a) work with community and government partners to reduce violence
in all forms; and b) help design interventions required to better define what should be
included in a community or city anti-violence plan. CeaseFire is an evidence-informed
public health approach to reduce violence. CeaseFire reverses the spread of violence by
using methods and strategies associated with disease control: identification and detection
of potentially violent events, individuals, and groups; interrupting transmission of
violence and risk reduction; and changing behaviors and social norms of the communities
where violence occurs. Data collection and ongoing evaluation (internal & external) help
to inform and enhance program impact.
A total of $5,484,870 has been made available via state appropriation to support
CeaseFire (Chicago Project for Violence Prevention - CPP) in SFY19. Staff recommends
designating $5,484,870 in SFY19 CPP funds to the University of Illinois at Chicago
School of Public Health to support this program. Further details are provided in the
attached Grant Recommendation Form.

 SFY 2019 State Appropriations
June 21, 2018
Page 2 of 5

Community-Based Violence Prevention and Intervention
Staff had expected Illinois’s SFY19 State budget to include $7,805,000 for CommunityBased Violence Prevention and Intervention (CB-VIP) grants and administration. Staff
originally recommended designating approximately $7,219,716.70 toward continuing
CB-VIP programs for a second year as described in the attached Grant Recommendation
Report. Staff now anticipates that budgets will be reduced by approximately four
percent to reflect a lower appropriation than anticipated.
The target population will be youth and young adults, including, but not limited to, those
who are identified as being at heightened risk or those who engage in high risk behavior
or violence.
Program Design: ICJIA is interested in funding community-based violence prevention
initiatives. Completed applications must be reflective of the following mandatory
elements:
 Convene or expand an existing community coalition to engage service providers,
governmental agencies (local and/or statewide agencies), law enforcement, faithbased, and general community members. The purpose of the coalition is to ensure
that service providers and all potential participants are aware of violence
prevention resources available in community; to develop collaborative
partnerships to ensure that client’s immediate needs are met; and to provide prosocial activities for the community.
 Educate public about program services through wide distribution and various
types of program materials, public presentations, and awareness events.
 Implementation of at least one of the following direct service categories
(additional points will be given for applications that reflect more than one
category):
o Street Intervention/Interruption-Active Outreach and Engagement –
Programs that target at-risk youth and young adults to provide crisis
intervention and de-escalation of high stress situations. Examples of
promising programs include Richmond Comprehensive Homicide
Initiative, CureViolence, Operation Ceasefire, and Safe Streets.
o Counseling and Therapy - Developmentally and culturally appropriate
therapeutic services provided by a mental health professional. Effective
programs incorporate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and/or include
contingency management approaches. These programs are often individual
or family-based, such as Multisystemic Therapy, Functional Family
Therapy, Multidimensional Family Therapy, Aggression Replacement
Training, Assisted Outpatient Treatment, and Coping Power Program,
CBT for Trauma in Schools, and Good Behavior Game.
o Case Management - Supporting youth and their families in identifying and
accessing resources. Individuals at risk for involvement in street-level
violence can be difficult to engage in services. Case management
approaches that actively engage youth and families (i.e., active reaching
out, meeting youth/families in the home, community engagement) are
10

 SFY 2019 State Appropriations
June 21, 2018
Page 3 of 5





more effective at long-term client retention and developing trust than more
passive case management approaches (i.e., requiring youth/families to
meet in office locations).[1]
o Youth Development - Engaging young people to develop their emotional,
physical, social and intellectual selves. Program provides opportunities for
youth to practice conflict resolution and prosocial life skills. Promising
programs include the Life Skills Training (LST).
Staffing Requirements - Any staff (or volunteers) that work directly with
participants must be able to document they have received trauma-informed
training. Any staff that provide counseling or therapy must be a licensed
counselor, licensed social worker, or equivalent.
Applicant must budget for one ICJIA-coordinated one full-day meeting in
Chicago.

Applicant must comply with all prescribed assessment tools and reporting requirements.
Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Councils
The Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Councils (IFVCC) comprises 13 local family
violence coordinating councils that offer local forums to share and discuss information
promoting a coordinated response to family violence in communities. Annually, up to
15,000 professionals from across Illinois participate in council trainings and projects.
These include family violence training and education of criminal justice and community
professionals; development of criminal justice procedures, protocols, and services related
to family violence; and the facilitation of coordinated community response to family
violence in local areas. Local councils provide opportunities for communication between
criminal justice professionals and community service providers and encourage
information sharing and resources to develop a network of safety and assistance for
family violence victims.
Funds are used to support a part-time local council coordinator for each council and
coordination of committee work, training, travel, and other related activities as
determined by the local council planning/steering committees. The planning/steering
committee and local council coordinator establish the goals and objectives for the
upcoming year. All local council activities are approved by the Illinois Family Violence
Coordinating Council.
Recommended Designation
Staff recommends designating a maximum of $439,950 in SFY19 IFVCC funds to
entities as described in the table. Further detail is provided in the attached Designation
Recommendation Report.

Line Item Appropriation

Program Description
CeaseFire, a partner of Cure Violence, is an evidence-informed public health approach to reduce violence. The
Chicago Project for Violence Prevention/CeaseFire (hereinafter referenced as CeaseFire) was first implemented
by the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) School of Public Health in West Garfield Park in 2000 which led
to a 67 percent reduction in shootings. CeaseFire reverses the spread of violence by using methods and
strategies associated with disease control: identification and detection of potentially violent events, individuals,
and groups; interrupting transmission of violence and risk reduction; and changing behaviors and social norms
of the communities where violence occurs. Data collection and ongoing evaluation (internal & external) help to
inform and enhance program impact.
Program Activities
CeaseFire’s work revolves around the efforts of hospital responders, violence interrupters, case managers and
outreach workers who are professionally-trained and streetwise individuals who are familiar with street violence
in the communities where CeaseFire and its Community Partners/Sub-contractors are active. Hospital
responders (at local trauma centers) and violence interrupters (on the streets) interact with individuals involved
in violence at critical moments to prevent retaliations and influence behavior change. Both roles coordinate
referrals to case management staff, case managers in the hospital setting, and outreach workers in the
community setting. Case managers and outreach workers help with on-the-spot problem solving and exploring
nonviolent means to address problems while simultaneously connecting participants with resources and
supports (employment, continued education, social service, healthcare or housing resources, etc.). In addition to
work focused on individuals, CeaseFire staff also conduct group level events, such as focus groups and peace
summits. Focus groups are small events that provide opportunities for participants from a range of communities
to have deeper conversations about issues connected with violence while peace summits are larger events in
which the planning stage is the main force for community-level behavior change
For the purposes of this grant period, Cure Violence will directly implement the intervention in several high
need communities. This includes expansion of existing efforts and new implementation sites. This funding will
allow for continuation of the South Shore community site, West Englewood, and Greater Grand Crossing
community area, as well as supporting hospital response services to trauma patients treated at Advocate Christ
Medical Center, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, John H. Stroger Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital,

Communities served will include Hermosa, Humboldt Park, South Lawndale (Little Village), Rogers Park,
Uptown, Auburn-Gresham, Chatham, Chicago Lawn, West Lawn, North Lawndale, Roseland, Washington
Heights, Grand Crossing, South Shore and West Englewood.
Goals
Goal 1: Reduce the number of shootings and homicides in targeted areas by 10 percent, as compared to
SFY18.
Goal 1a: Reduce the number of shootings in targeted areas by engaging highest-risk individuals to interrupt
and change violent behavior compared to FY2018 and a three-year average for shootings in target area during
timeframes when community-based sites are up and running. The Chicago Police Department’s City Portal
website will be accessed to monitor shooting data in Chicago.
Goal 1b: Reduce the number of homicides in targeted areas by engaging highest-risk individuals to interrupt
and change violent behavior compared to FY2018 and a three-year average for homicides in target area during
timeframes when community-based sites are up and running. Chicago Police Department’s City Portal website
will be accessed to monitor homicide data in Chicago.
Goal 2: Change group and community norms associated with violent behavior.
Goal 3: Develop a professionalized staff to effectively implement the Cure Violence Model.
Goal 4: Disseminate descriptive and analytical information on the Cure Violence program and its clients.
Goal 5: Monitor program implementation to ensure fidelity to the model
Priorities
CeaseFire stops the spread of violence in communities by using the methods and strategies associated with
disease control, detecting and interrupting conflicts, identifying and treating the highest risk individuals, and
changing social norms to help young people avoid involvement in the criminal justice system.

Program Description
Community violence includes a wide range of crimes, such as murder, gun violence, interpersonal and domestic
violence, sexual violence, robbery, and aggravated or simple assault and battery. Violence is important to
address because experiencing or witnessing this type of violence can increase fear and distrust among
community members, and often leads to a feeling that communities are unsafe. It can also result in posttraumatic stress disorder and other short- and long-term negative outcomes for individuals and communities.
Locations that experience high levels of violence also often experience high concentrations of other social
inequalities, including poverty and low social capital. Social capital is important to neighborhood cohesion as it
represents the networks individuals depend on to help them meet basic needs, such as employment and model
civil engagement. These networks are where norms of reciprocity are communicated
Over the last 40 years, great advancements have been made in the field of violence prevention. Violence is now
seen as a learned behavior that can be addressed through focused attention on increasing protective factors and
reducing risk factors. Protective factors, such as positive connections to family and friends, can foster resilience
to violence, while risk factors, such as exposure to violence, create a vulnerability to violence both risk and
protective factors exist within the individual, peer, family, community, and societal domains.
Goals
Each program must complete the following:





Convene or expand an existing community coalition to engage service providers, governmental
agencies (local and/or statewide agencies), law enforcement, faith-based, and general community
members to ensure that service providers and all potential participants are aware of violence
prevention resources available in community; develop collaborative partnerships to ensure that
clients’ immediate needs are met; and provide pro-social activities for the community.
Educate the public about program services through wide distribution and various types of program
materials, public presentations and awareness events.
Provide at least one of the four following direct services:
o Street Intervention/Interruption-Active Outreach and Engagement – These programs provide
crisis intervention and de-escalation of high stress situations to at-risk youth and young
adults.

o Counseling and Therapy – These developmentally and culturally appropriate therapeutic
services are provided by a mental health professional.
o Case Management – Case management approaches that are more effective at long-term client
retention and developing trust between agency and youth/families require actively engaging
participants (i.e., active reaching out, meeting youth/families in the home, community
engagement).
o Youth Development – Engaging young people to develop their emotional, physical, social,
and intellectual selves provides opportunities for youth to practice conflict resolution and
prosocial life skills.
Priorities
In 2012, ICJIA’s enabling statute was expanded to include additional responsibilities related to violence
prevention. These responsibilities include distributing grants to community and statewide organizations, other
units of local and state government, and public school districts that address violence prevention in a
comprehensive and collaborative manner.
Funding Prospectus
ICJIA anticipates recommending funding past one year contingent on future state fiscal year appropriations and
satisfactory performance.

Alternatives, Inc., will work to reduce the risk of violence by building conflict resolution skills and
employment experience while fostering a more supportive surrounding environment. The program will use
restorative justice trainings and practices to building the knowledge and skills of its youth leaders and its youth
constituents across the dispersed network of homeless shelters and transitional living centers.
The target population is young adults ages 16 to 25 who are homeless or unstably housed and living in
transitional living centers and shelters in the City of Chicago.

* Note on current performance: The grantee reported that program start-up was slow due to lack of capacity
that came about as a direct result of major changes to their service provision that was required during the
transition to the new Coordinated Point of Entry system mandated by the City of Chicago. Despite those
challenges, the grantee enlisted 14 of 15 collaborative partners and had two coalition meetings.
* Changes Requested: Restorative Justice will take a much more prominent role in the program in FY19,
leading to more of a focus on youth development with ongoing participants.

$303,490.10
Big Brothers Big Sisters will provide community-based mentoring and site-based mentoring programs.
Mentoring programming provides youth with positive adult relationships. Positive relationships with adults
and peers are vital to the development of youth, helping them to overcome trauma and empowering them to
navigate life's decisions in an effective manner. Protective factors supported by programming include but are
not limited to: development of effective negotiating, conflict resolution, problem solving, and anger
management skills; development of empathy for others and connection to the community through focus on
improved peer relations and community improvement projects; encouraging strong development of relations
with parents and other adults.
The target population is youth ages 7 to 19 with moderate to high exposure to external risk factors (which
include poverty, children with an incarcerated parent, previous exposure to violence, and/or children living in
single-parent homes) and moderate to high personal need (poor family relationships, poor academic progress,
or misconduct).

Bright Star Community
Outreach, Inc.
Chicago (Bronzeville)

$730,937.90
Bright Star will provide case management through the Truancy Education and Mentoring (TEAM) program,
which serves youth ages 13 to 18 that are chronically truant, suspended, or expelled from school, or are at
especially high risk for violent behavior or victimization. TEAM provides a safe, productive environment for
youth to receive help completing assignments missed during their suspensions and counseling services aimed
at addressing issues that resulted in suspension or expulsion. TEAM is intended to improve student attendance,
increase academic performance, strengthen families, and reduce truancy. Counseling will also be provided to
high-risk and justice-involved youth. The GREAT Schools and Families program was developed for middle
school youth and their families to decrease violence by promoting youth academic and social competence and
improve parental skills, support, and involvement with the schools. The program includes 16 sessions and is
delivered through multiple family groups (4-6 families per group). The intervention was found to have positive
effects for participating youth and families, and a positive ecological effect on school-level aggression because
the decreasing aggressive behavior among youth participating in the program had an impact on the behavior of
other students in the same grade. Multisystemic therapy (MST) is offered to youth ages 12-17 who exhibit
criminal and non-criminal violent, delinquent, and antisocial behaviors. MST provides services, delivered by
therapists to youth and their families to restructure the home, school, and community environments. The aim
of MST is to decrease problem youth behaviors and promote the development and utilization of productive and
prosocial youth behaviors. Randomized controlled trial results show MST reduces short- and long-term
criminal behaviors and out-of-home placements for serious juvenile offenders.
The target population is chronically truant, suspended, or expelled youth in middle and high school and their
families.

Through the Supporting Successful Transition Program, Cabrini Green Legal Aid will serve at-risk youth
leaving the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice to provide ongoing legal services (representation at parole
hearing and criminal records relief), social supports, accompaniment, and intensive case management through
successful completion of aftercare and the end of their involvement with the juvenile justice system. Through
interdisciplinary teams of lawyers and social workers, CGLA works with clients to address not only the
presenting legal issue, but simultaneously support them in stabilizing key domains of wellness that mitigate
risk for future system involvement. CGLA’s stability and self-sufficiency assessment tool allows them to
identify needs and interventions required to strengthen clients’ legal outcomes and address instability in five
key domains: legal standing, economic opportunity, housing stability, social and family connections, and
behavioral health. CGLA engages with collaborative partners to provide critical services that impact these
stability domains.
The target population is youth who are returning home to Cook County from IDJJ, whose host sites are
primarily in the City of Chicago.

Catholic Charities will provide case management, supportive counseling, and therapy services to individuals
and their families. Case management services help clients and their families obtain resources in the
community, links the clients to resources in the community, helps with locating and maintaining stable
housing, and employment education/placement services. Supportive counseling is designed for the case
manager to provide brief counseling services to the client and their family. Supportive counseling helps with
parenting education, understanding the circle of violence, and cognitive barriers to a healthy lifestyle. Therapy
utilizes a strength-based trauma focused approach. The therapist works with the client to identify his/her own
strengths that will help them with areas of their life that have been identified as problematic. The therapists use
cognitive behavioral therapy, didactic behavioral therapy, pyschodynamic approaches, and play therapy as
interventions with their work with clients. Each service can be provided in the community, at a Catholic
Charities location, or in the home if the environment is identified as a safe location for services.
The target population is youth and young adults, specifically those who are identified as being at heightened
risk for committing violent acts, those who engage in high-risk behavior or violence, and those who have been
victims of street-level violence.

Children’s Home + Aid will provide a therapeutic response with intervention and outreach to address the
problem of community violence in Englewood and West Englewood. The program will target youth most
likely to be involved with violence as a perpetrator or a victim: those who have prior justice system
involvement, youth who are disconnected from school and work, and youth who are coping with symptoms of

symptoms of trauma and pro-social learning to help them fully participate in school and out of school
activities. They also need help resolving crises and persistent support to engage with school, so this program

challenges. Once engaged, participants can receive up to two years of intensive CBT and other supportive
services - including 18 months in a subsidized transitional job – plus six months of follow-up support to
promote more lasting pro-social behavior, attachment to the workforce, and access to opportunity. Continued
support is critical to sustaining behavior changes, offering support during difficult experiences, and helping
participants transition and stabilize in unsubsidized employment. Additional group sessions will focus on
career pathing, parenting, asset building, and conflict management, among others. Lastly, a clinician and a
READI coach or outreach worker will co-facilitate group CBT sessions using the University of Cincinnati’s
CBT-IMT curriculum and Seeking Safety.

of the six entities providing direct services for counseling/therapy and case management will provide services
during Q4. Youth development services will not occur during FY18 because the subcontract for this service
was completed a few weeks before school was dismissed, which didn’t leave enough time to complete the
programming. Accomplishments to date include enlisting collaborative partners and completing trauma-related
training for contractual staff. Public awareness activities occurred in four of the six counties, and events are
scheduled in June for the other two counties. These activities have reached 500 of the projected 1,000 people.

$209,253.70
Rockford Metropolitan Agency for Planning will implement a trauma-focused approach targeting criminal
justice-involved youth and youth identified as high risk for future justice-involvement who have experienced
trauma due to violence. The proposed service delivery system will feature principles of positive youth
development. Youth will receive trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy, a hybrid treatment model that
utilizes both cognitive-behavioral and social learning theory principles to help traumatized youth more
effectively manage their thoughts and feelings related to their trauma experience, examine and change
inaccurate or unhelpful cognitions, and build skills to relax, regulate emotions, and enhance safety. The
program will also work with youth’s non-offending parent or caregiver on building parenting skills, enhancing
safety, growth, and family communication and increasing supportive parent-child communication.
Comprehensive case management services will be offered to youth and family on site in the community at
home, school, or a location of their choice to encourage improved engagement with staff. Team members will
have a presence in client homes, schools, and neighborhood Strong Houses, and will accompany them to court,
medical appointments, and anywhere else they may go where they can serve as an advocate or support system
to help youth succeed. The project addresses cultural competence for youth with special needs, including those
who are pregnant and parenting; gay, lesbian, transgender, or questioning their sexual orientation, and;
physically, emotionally or developmentally challenged. Employment assistance and educational goal setting
also will be provided to participants. Opportunities for youth development services include: Rockford Police
Department’s Police Athletic Club, a youth crime prevention program that utilizes mentorship and educational,
athletic, and recreational activities to foster trust and understanding between police officers and youth; Center
for Nonviolence and Conflict Transformation (CNCT), a movement to help transform inner-cities that have
been affected by gang and drug-related violence that will allow interested youth to participate in the Mobile
Tech Lab Project, a program that teaches at-risk youth skills in computer literacy, music education and
recording, entrepreneurship development, and nonviolence leadership development; Leadership Development,
which includes Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Six Aspects of Nonviolent Leadership Development; and Youth
Services Network life skills program and financial literacy program to help youth develop the tools needed to
transition to self-sufficiency and to prepare for post-secondary education or vocational training.

Engage high-risk youth and young adults in the public places where they congregate, build a rapport
with them, and recruit them to participate in the program.
Refer participants for case management, youth development, and supportive services.
Identify potential violent incidents.
Facilitate conflict mediation.
Contribute to changing group norms related to violence.

Three types of events will be offered: community block parties, designed to build relationships with the target
population, recruit participants, interrupt violent street activity, substitute peaceful activities for the duration of
the event, and facilitate relationship-building among neighbors who seldom interact due to fear and
resentment; Safe Haven monthly events that occur during late-night hours when violence is most prevalent and
offer an opportunity to meet representatives from social service agencies, gather information about the services
they provide, sign-up for on-site sessions about a variety of topics such as anger management, conflict
resolution, employment, education, and/or substance use; and Peace Summits, where members of rival groups,
emerging gang factions, and gang leaders are invited to focus groups and small group sessions. Outreach
workers will provide case management services to assess the baseline needs and strengths of individuals
referred to the program and engage participants using Motivational Interviewing, an evidence-based, clientcentered counseling style that has been shown to be effective in eliciting behavior change by helping
individuals explore and resolve ambivalence. Outreach workers will also refer participants to supportive
services within the agency and/or at other agencies. Participants in the street intervention program will have
the opportunity to participate in the following youth development activities: Educational (tutoring, homework
assistance, academic enrichment, alternative school, GED preparation); Restorative Justice/Community
Service/Service-Learning projects; Workforce Development (occupational skills training leading to a
credential, workforce readiness classes, job coaching, employment placement); Personal Development
(financial literacy classes, healthy relationships classes, goal-setting, communication skills, leadership skills,
computer literacy classes). One-on-one and group mentoring will also be provided.  The mentoring curriculum
consists of six components: 1) time commitment; 2) pro-social behavior; 3) communicating effectively; 4)
conflict resolution 5) family engagement; and 6) job training. Mentors will also help their mentees practice
impulse control and emotional self-regulation.
The target population is youth and young adults ages 14 to 26 who have a history of violent behavior,
substance abuse, and/or gang involvement.

South Shore Drill Team will provide twice-weekly performing arts training, a core curriculum of discussion
groups and special speakers, and counseling. South Shore Drill Team instructors help young people direct their
ambition towards developing short-term and long-term goals for performing and beyond. The core curriculum
includes empirically-tested elements (communication skills, actively listening, decision making) and traditional
team discussion topics (teamwork, conflict resolution, goal-setting, self-discipline, self-esteem, and overcoming
adversity.) Team instructors use a repeating 12-month curriculum which is both age-appropriate and genderbased to facilitate discussions at rehearsals and when the group travels. Mentors build on the core curriculum with
additional activities and one-on-one mentoring. If necessary, the community outreach director or social worker
will consult with school authorities at the participant’s school and link youth to tutoring services. Using the Think
First curriculum, participants will receive cognitive behavior therapy to increase self-awareness and increase
social and emotional skills. The counseling sessions should lead to participants having an improved view of
themselves as active agents in personal achievement.
The target population is youth ages 8 to 18 who are at risk for involvement in gangs, drugs, and violence.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council

Funding Source:

State Fiscal Year 2019 General Revenue Funds - $439,950

Agency Budget:

N/A

Request Type:

State Appropriation

Program Description
The Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council comprises 13 local family violence coordinating councils
that offer local forums to share and discuss information promoting a coordinated response to family violence in
communities. Illinois is one of the few states with a systematically organized, statewide infrastructure that
operates at both the state and local levels. Since the 1970s, a comprehensive, coordinated approach to
preventing family violence has been promoted as the most efficient and effective way to penetrate systems and
mobilize them for the greatest change.
Program Activities
Established in 1993, the councils work to improve criminal justice institutional and professional responses to
family violence issues. The councils engage in prevention, education, and the coordination of intervention and
services for victims and perpetrators of domestic abuse, child abuse, teen dating violence, and abuse against
people with disabilities and older adults.
Goals
Family Violence Coordinating Councils, at both the state and local/circuit level, establish a forum to improve
the institutional, professional and community response to family violence including domestic abuse, child
abuse, teen dating violence, and abuse against people with disabilities and older adults; to engage in education
and prevention; the coordination of intervention and services for victims and perpetrators; and to contribute to
the improvement of the legal system and the administration of justice.
Priorities
ICJIA brings together key leaders from the justice system and the public to identify critical issues facing the
criminal justice system in Illinois, and to propose and evaluate policies, programs, and legislation that address
those issues. The agency also works to ensure the criminal justice system in Illinois is efficient and effective.
Funding Prospectus
ICJIA anticipates recommending funding past one year, contingent on future state fiscal year appropriations and
satisfactory performance.

Past Performance
Annually, up to 15,000 professionals from across Illinois participate in council trainings and projects. These
include family violence training and education of criminal justice and community professionals; development of
criminal justice procedures, protocols, and services related to family violence; and the facilitation of
coordinated community response to family violence in local areas. Local councils provide opportunities for
communication between criminal justice professionals and community service providers and encourage
information sharing and resources to develop a network of safety and assistance for family violence victims.
Due to state budget impasses in SFY16 and SFY17, the number of active and funded local councils decreased
from 23 to 13. The program director will work with inactive local councils to reinstate programming for SFY
2020.

Program Description
The Safe from the Start (SFS) grant program is designed to assist in the development, implementation, and
evaluation of comprehensive and coordinated community-based models to identify, assess, and serve children,
primarily ages 0 to 5, who have been exposed to violence in their home and/or community.
Program Activities
1: Providing assessment, direct services, and evaluation to children and their families who have been
exposed to violence in their home and/or communities.
2: Ensuring social service and community engagement in the SFS program through collaboration and
training.
3: Providing public awareness regarding children exposed to violence via presentations and
community events.
Goals
SFS consists of three major components: coalition and collaboration building, direct services, and public
awareness. SFS programs focus on collaborating with state and community agencies to provide individual,
family, and community level supports. SFS is a unique, multi-disciplinary, research-driven and targeted
intervention that reaches urban, suburban, and rural Illinois families.
Priorities
The financial burden of children’s exposure to violence on other public systems, including child welfare, social
services, law enforcement, juvenile justice, and education is staggering when combined with the loss of
productivity over children’s lifetimes.1 Without intervention, young children exposed to violence are at risk for
cognitive delays and emotional and social difficulties that can lead to additional victimization and later juvenile
justice involvement.

Past Performance
Matched pre and post-intervention assessment data from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) show a
significant decrease in symptoms post-intervention. Pre-intervention, 43 percent of SFS child clients scored in
the borderline or clinical range of problem behaviors on the CBCL. Post-intervention, only 29 percent of the
children scored in the borderline or clinical range, representing a 33-percent CBCL score improvement.
Following services, the percentage of caregivers scoring at or above the borderline-clinical range on the total
stress subscale of the Parental Stress Inventory (PSI) dropped from 42 percent to 33 percent, representing a 21
percent improvement on PSI scores.

RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent Crime
At its August 18, 2017, and September 16, 2017, meetings, the Budget Committee
designated funding to four jurisdictions selected through the competitive Partnerships and
Strategies to Reduce Violent Crime Request for Proposals.
The Year One designations supported research-informed planning to identify the drivers
of violent crime in each jurisdiction through the formation of local multi-disciplinary
teams (MDTs) and the use of community surveys, the Scanning, Analysis, Response and
Assessment (SARA) process, and other analytical tools. The Year Two designations
supported completion of planning activities and the beginnings of the implementation of
focused deterrence strategies that closely target offenders at highest risk of reoffending,
offer social supports, and impose swift, certain, and fair sanctions for non-compliance.
Staff recommends designating FFY16 funds as described in the table below to support
training needs identified during the research-informed planning activities. These
designations will support trainings in evidence-based practices and build upon skills
needed to further implement the core components of the focused deterrence (FD) model.
The trainings will build the social service component of FD by providing case managers
with a validated evidence-based tool for assessing the needs and services to be delivered
for call-in participants. Case managers also will receive evidence-based moral reconation
training relevant to the target population. The law enforcement component of FD will be
built by providing officer training in evidence-based practices aimed at reducing implicit
bias. The community engagement component of FD will be built by training outreach
workers in gang outreach and intervention skills to diffuse and de-escalate situations
within the community that may result in gun violence. In addition, outreach workers will
be trained in youth diversion strategies to divert and deflect youth from violent crime.
Lastly, training in the Michigan State University Violence Reduction Tool will allow
grantees to evaluate their capacity to implement FD pre- and post-trainings and
implementation.

Notice of Funding Opportunity: JAG Operations
At the November 16, 2017, Budget Committee meeting, the budget committee approved
the use of $1.35 million in available FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16 JAG funds to issue a
competitive notice of funding opportunity in the first quarter of 2018 for a three-pronged
strategy for court, prosecution, and defense programs. The strategy was designed to offer

With the delay in the receipt of the FFY17 JAG award to the state of Illinois, the funding
opportunity was limited to continuing support of the Operational Effectiveness funding
category and only open to the nine court, public defense, and prosecution programs
currently operating with ICJIA-administered JAG funds. Applicants were required to
demonstrate effectiveness of and the ongoing need for their program. Funding minimum
and maximum values were based on the population served.
The other two categories (Planning & Plan-based EBP Projects) were not offered because
staff did not want to designate funding to new programs and exhaust all JAG funds that
may be needed by continuing programs. It is anticipated that the categories will be
opened for funding once the FFY17 award is received.
Eight applications were received and reviewed by five-person teams of ICJIA staff and
subject matter experts following the ICJIA Grant Accountability and Transparency Act
(GATA)-compliant merit-based review process. Each application was independently
scored based upon the criteria outlined in the notice and ranked by score. Programs were
then awarded funding until the available $600,000 was exhausted.
Of the $600,000 earmarked for Operational Effectiveness, staff recommends making
$587,513 in designations of FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16 funds as described in the table
below. The remaining $12,487 will be added to the set-aside for the remaining two
categories. The attached Designation Recommendation Forms provide detailed

Program Description
Winnebago County Youth Recovery Court provides mental health services to a minimum of 25 youths aged 1017 and their families each year. The youths have committed criminal offenses and have a mental illness, or a
mental illness and co-occurring substance use disorder. Unfortunately, they are underserved by private
insurance, and thus are at risk for recidivism without proper mental health care. The program focuses on filling
the gaps in judicial oversight for youth with mental illness; addressing the lack of alternative dispositions for
these youth, such as specialized intensive services for youth with mental illnesses or co-occurring disorders
involved in the juvenile justice system; screening adjudicated youth with mental health needs and co-occurring
disorders; and coordinating services to families of the youth.
Program Activities
Grant funding will provide court-supervised treatment to juveniles within the justice system who have major
mental health disorders. The program includes an outreach case manager (100% FTE), a home-based therapist
(FTE 100%), an addictions counselor (50% FTE), and a clinical program coordinator (15% FTE).

Goals:
1) Provide coordinated case management services to youth.
2) Provide mental health treatment to youth to improve overall functioning.
3) Provide substance abuse treatment to youth.
Objectives
1. A.) Maintain (3) integral positions to
provide services to a minimum of (25) clients
per year.

1.B.) Provide transportation services to
(100%) of clients that demonstrate a need.

1.C.) Provide education case management
services to youth.
2.A.) Monitor medication compliance and
psychiatric appointments.
2.B.) Conduct Columbia Scale mental health
assessments on youth entering our program
and at 6-month intervals during enrollment.

Progress to-date
We have maintained the three clinical team member positions
resulting in a continuation of services to the clients. There
have been staff changes to the Substance Abuse Counselor,
however during that transition there was not a lapse in
substance abuse services to the program.
During the program period of October 1, 2016 through December
31, 2017 the YRC program served 41 participants.
All participants had transportation provided to them when
requested to ensure that transportation issues were not a barrier
to attending court or treatment services. Team members also
arranged for public transportation passes and transportation
through insurance for clients as appropriate.
Education case management was provided to the 24
participants.
YRC participants were referred to psychiatric care and
medications as recommended following assessment.
Columbia Scale scores were collected on the youth in the
program at 6-month intervals and compared to their prior
assessments to examine the areas of improvement and the areas
that required additional focus.

JAG Goal/Priorities
Court Program Goal: To support problem solving, specialty, and other courts by providing resources for court
programs that provide offender rehabilitation without endangering public safety and afford crime and victims’
their constitutional and statutory rights.
Funding Prospectus
ICJIA anticipates funding this program for 36 months. Funding in the second and third year will be with 12month grant agreements and funding is contingent on program performance.
Past Performance

Program Description
The caseload numbers indicate a growing number of indigent residents of Cook County face prosecution based
on forensic evidence. Since 2014, the number of cases involving forensic evidence has increased year-to-year,
including DNA cases, fingerprint cases, and ballistic cases (which make up the vast majority of the caseload).
The combination of inaccurate claims by forensic examiners and/or forensic fraud has resulted in numerous
wrongful convictions based on faulty forensic analyses. In this context, where the results of forensic analyses
require careful investigation by defense attorneys, a lack of forensically-trained defense attorneys is a threat to
the criminal justice system. The DNA & Digital Evidence Program will provide cutting-edge forensic training
to attorneys who represent indigent residents of Cook County and much of northern Illinois.
Program Activities
This program funds targeted forensic training of the highest caliber within the Forensic Science Division of the
Cook County Public Defender’s Office. Training will be provided to the division as follows:






Small-group intensive forensic training for the eight attorneys in the division.
Large-group forensic conference, planned and organized by the division, which will provide two days of
forensic training for 100 indigent defense attorneys.
Participation by division attorneys in a two-week-long forensic training conference.
Small-group trainings taught by trained division attorneys to other defense attorneys.
Consultation by division attorneys in 250 cases where indigent citizens of Cook County face criminal
prosecution based on forensic evidence. This program-targeted training followed by case consultations,
directly and effectively addresses the problem of insufficient forensic training leading to wrongful
convictions based on faulty forensic evidence.

Goals
The goal of the program is to protect indigent residents of Illinois and the criminal justice system from the
tremendous costs (monetary and otherwise) associated with wrongful convictions based on faulty forensic

Template Revision Date: 04/11/2018

evidence. The strategy to achieve this goal includes two complementary approaches: training and consultation.
By training attorneys in cutting-edge forensic science techniques, the program will arm indigent defense
attorneys with the knowledge and resources to identify faulty forensic evidence. Through direct case
consultations in hundreds of cases involving indigent residents, these specially trained attorneys will be
deployed to review pending cases and litigate instances of faulty forensic evidence.
Priorities
To support public and appellate defenders by providing resources and training necessary to assist public and
appellate defenders in protecting the fundamental rights, liberties, and due process of the accused and to assist
public and appellate defenders in connecting defendants with community-based services when possible and
appropriate in order to reduce recidivism.

Program Description
The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office Community Justice Centers (CJC) were founded on the principle
that prosecutors have a responsibility to not only prosecute cases but to solve public safety problems, prevent
crime, and improve the quality of life for communities. The community justice centers collaborate with police,
businesses, faith-based organizations, elected officials, schools, government entities, social service agencies,
and community groups for the purposes of prevention, problem-solving, and prosecution.
Program Activities
The grant funds will support two prevention coordinators and two administrative assistants at the West and
Central CJCs. The prevention coordinators are responsible for helping the neighborhood offices facilitate crime
prevention and education programs. The coordinators work with the staff of the neighborhood offices and
community stakeholders to identify, develop, and implement programs that addressed the unique needs of each
neighborhood. The coordinators also work on countywide initiatives that targeted crime issues addressed by the
community prosecutors. The administrative assistants are responsible for the day-to-day administrative duties of
the office including supporting prosecution efforts, answering phones, working with walk-ins, assisting with
prevention and education programs, and keeping and preparing stats for progress reports.
CJC staff work with law enforcement and citizens to respond to a range of concerns that include quality of life
issues and targeted local concerns. They work to solve the cases in a way that will keep the matter from
becoming a major court concern. Each CJC utilizes steering committees that are convened to work directly with
the Office to identify community-based problems and concerns. These committees draw their membership from
the communities they serve, the Chicago Police Department, and various city agencies. The committees work to
advise the Office as well as help identify and implement community-based alternative sentences when
appropriate. The CJCs are founded on the idea that prosecutor offices have a responsibility not only to prosecute
cases but to solve public safety problems, prevent crime, and improve the quality of life for the communities
they serve.

Program Description
Multi-disciplinary team collaboration is a best practice for combatting human trafficking. The Human
Trafficking Outreach Coordinator Program is a part of the larger Cook County Human Trafficking Task Force
that works to provide comprehensive services for victims and provide training to a wide variety of stakeholders.
Through a victim-centered approach, the program can flourish between partners in the investigation and
prosecution of human trafficking cases. This approach focuses on the concerns and needs of victims by working
to minimize re-victimization during the criminal justice process. The human trafficking coordinator provides
support and help to empower victims to be active participants in the process to ensure that defendants are
brought to justice. Human trafficking cases routinely take more time to prosecute than other types of cases. It is
the responsibility of the victim service provider, law enforcement agency, and other members of the task force
to provide an environment and feeling of security for the victims throughout the process.
Program Activities
This program funds one full-time human trafficking outreach coordinator responsible for providing services to
human trafficking victims as well as educational presentation and training to outside agencies. The coordinator
is the point of contact for victims in human trafficking cases as proceedings are often confusing and can last for
years. After the trial is completed, the coordinator will keep in contact with service providers who may be
caring for human trafficking victims to monitor the victims’ well-being.
The coordinator also works as a liaison between many local law enforcement agencies and the State’s
Attorney’s Office, helps to identify potential human trafficking victims, and will help overcome cultural and
language barrier between victims and other members of the Human Trafficking Task Force. The trainings will
enhance the ability of those who may come into contact with traumatized human trafficking victims to be able
to identify these victims and to use a victim-centric approach in needs management.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Cook County Public Defender’s Office - Mitigation Initiative

Program Agency DUNS:

005525829

Funding Source:

FFY14 Justice Assistance Grant; $133,514

Agency Budget:

$56,806,753

Request Type:

JAG Operations Notice of Funding Opportunity #1469-467

Program Description
The Cook County Public Defender’s Office Mitigation Initiative provides counsel for its indigent clients who
are charged with crimes. One of the office’s key duties of the office is to provide mitigation evidence at the
sentencing hearing or mitigation information at a Supreme Court Rule 402 pre-trial conference. A 402 pre-trial
conference is a plea-bargaining meeting that includes the judge, the prosecutor, and defense counsel. While the
death penalty is not a sentencing option in Illinois, a sentence of natural life imprisonment is still available for
certain defendants who have been found guilty of first-degree murder. In addition, for certain felony convictions
in Illinois, probation is an alternative to imprisonment. Presenting mitigation evidence and information is a core
responsibility of office.
Program Activities
This program would fund two full-time experienced mitigators who provide assistance to attorneys and clients.
As a result, the office will be able to maintain the mitigation internship program, which has allowed effective
mitigation for a higher number of clients without requiring additional funds beyond the grant. Ideally, with local
and federal funding, the office would employ six full-time mitigators that would aid in the various divisions and
suburban courts. However, due to budget restraints and attrition, the office only has two full-time mitigators to
provide support to felony and homicide attorneys.
Goals
The main goal of the program is to provide client-centered and holistic care with/for our clients. Effective
representation requires mitigation reports and/or testimony are provided for the thousands of indigent Cook
County residents who have been charged with a felony. The principal approach that informs this project is to
maintain the mitigation specialists so that they can continue to train interns so that the office can provide more
information to the court. The more information the court has before it at sentencing and the more evidence it
considers about the specific defendant to be sentenced, the better the position the court will be in to fashion a
sentence appropriate to both the crime charged and the defendant who has been convicted of the crime.

trafficking each year. While many have their needs met through brief services and consultations, CAASE
attorneys provide comprehensive representation—with a typical duration of between 6 and 16 months—to those
who need extended legal aid, whether they are seeking investigation of the crime done to them and investigated
and pursuing prosecution, or there is some other crisis or instability in their lives tied to sexual victimization
that civil law has the capacity to address.
Goals
Please see Past Performance section for description of goals.
Priorities
This program meets the following ICJIA VOCA/VAWA priorities: #2 Fundamental Needs, #3 Core Services,
#4 More advocates in more places, and #5 Underserved.

Goals
Erie Neighborhood House proposes to serve at least 60 victims of sexual assault or domestic violence in FY19
through legal consultation or representation in immigration cases.
Priorities
This program meets the following ICJIA VOCA/VAWA priorities: #2 Fundamental Needs, #3 Core Services,
#4 More advocates in more places, and #5 Underserved.
Funding Prospectus
Staff expects to fund this program an additional two years: After the second year of funding, ICJIA will analyze
the grantee to ensure it is meeting its goals and objectives prior to determining whether the grantee will receive
an additional/remaining 12 months of funding.
Past Performance
This fiscal year, Erie House is on track to meet or exceed most of its performance measures. During Erie
House’s first three quarters, legal staff provided 43 victims of domestic violence or sexual assault with
immigration legal services. These 43 individuals also were offered counseling and case management services to
help support them throughout their immigration application and 12 individuals took advantage of these services.
Counseling services were provided by the victim advocate/bilingual social worker who was hired thanks to
VOCA funding to provide socio-emotional support to our clients. The victim advocate and immigration
attorneys developed a referral process that allowed easy access to counseling services by the immigration legal
service clients. Roughly half of individuals who were served had limited English proficiency and accessed
translation services.

GOAL: To provide victims comprehensive legal assistance services.

Notice of Funding Opportunity Program Continuation: #1395-217

Program Description
The mission of the Highland Park-Highwood Legal Aid Clinic (HPHLAC) is to provide legal services to lowincome individuals that live or work in Highland Park or Highwood. The clinic was created in response to a
needs study in 2013 that found that those most vulnerable in its community had no access to justice in the areas
of housing, immigration and domestic violence.
According to clinic case statistics, the majority of cases to date are on people who live in Highland Park,
Highwood, and other towns in southern Lake County. Another 6 percent of clients are from Cook County.
While there are other low- or no-cost legal service providers in Lake and Cook counties, they are, at a
minimum, 20 minutes away by car, and even further by public transportation. The distance is far enough to be
burdensome to HPHLAC’s client population.
Program Activities
To provide civil legal assistance to individuals for a variety of services including:
Emergency Legal Assistance
 Filing for emergency restraining or protective orders
 Obtaining emergency custody orders and visitation rights
Victims’ Rights Enforcement
 Assisting victims in asserting their rights as victims or otherwise protecting their safety, privacy, or
other interests as victims, in a criminal proceeding directly related to the victimization
Civil Legal Assistance
● Proceedings for protective/restraining orders /stay-away orders
● Family, custody, support, respite care, or dependency matters
● Contract, housing, or employment matters
● Immigration assistance
● Intervention with creditors, law enforcement (e.g., to obtain police reports), and other entities

● Intervention with administrative agencies, schools/colleges, or tribal entities and other circumstances
where legal advice or intervention would assist in addressing the consequences of a person's
victimization
● Filing a motion to vacate or expunge a victim’s conviction, or similar action, based on his/her status of

Goals
Please see Past Performance section for description of goals.
Priorities
This program meets the following ICJIA VOCA/VAWA priorities: #2 Fundamental Needs, #3 Core Services,
#4 More advocates in more places, and #5 Underserved.
Funding Prospectus
Staff expects to fund this program an additional two years: After the second year of funding, ICJIA will analyze
the grantee to ensure it is meeting its goals and objectives prior to determining whether the grantee will receive
an additional/remaining 12 months of funding.
Past Performance
Number Served: The HPHLAC Domestic Violence project began in May 2017, two months before the grant
began, with a goal of 10 cases/month. While it did not hit this goal in the first two quarters (34 cases), it
exceeded that goal in the 3rd quarter (34 cases). The agency reports the increase in cases was due to expanding
service area to West Deerfield Township and continued outreach efforts to local police and partners, resulting in
becoming a better-known resource in the community.
Family Law Assistance: Family law assistance was a huge need for agency clients and the agency reacted by
hiring a domestic violence staff attorney to focus on family law matters. Prior to hiring the staff attorney, pro
bono attorneys with an expertise in family law assisted our clients. HPHLAC will continue collaborating with
them on more complex cases. Duties include:
 Preparing a Petitioner for an Order of Protection in a divorce case.
 Finalizing parental responsibilities between an abuser and a client.
 Assisting with calculating and obtaining child support
Training: Every staff member has either received the 40-hour Domestic Violence Training or will participate in
the training before the end of Year 1. Trauma training was provided to the entire staff, and much of the staff
attended the Victim Rights Training. While the agency did not set a goal for technical training, the immigration
attorney attended an immigration law training on U-Visas and VAWA self-petitions, and asylum, our BIA
accredited representative attended a U-Visa, VAWA self-petition training, and our domestic violence staff
attorney will be attending a family law conference/training in April.
Assistance with English Translation: All clients were served who needed English translation. Staff members
speak Spanish, Korean, Polish, and Russian and translation was provided in all four languages.

Program Description
Land of Lincoln is the sole provider of the full range of civil legal services in 65 counties in central and
southern Illinois, providing services through five regional offices, three satellite offices and a centralized intake,
advice, and referral center. The agency’s service area is comprised of more than 32,500 square miles and
represents approximately 60 percent of the entire area of Illinois. Demand is extremely high for order of
protection assistance, family law cases, and other areas of civil law on behalf of victims. After an order of
protection is entered, litigation over custody, child support, visitation, and property issues is often protracted
because abusers use the legal system as one last attempt to control their victims. Advocacy on legal issues that
promote safety and stability, including public benefits, housing, and consumer issues, may be necessary to
ensure the protection and well-being of the victim and the victim’s family.
Program Activities
To provide civil legal assistance to individuals for a variety of services, including:
Civil Legal Assistance
● Proceedings for protective/restraining orders or campus administrative protection/stay-away orders
● Family, custody, support, or dependency matters
● Contract, housing, or employment matters
● Immigration assistance
● Intervention with creditors, law enforcement (e.g., to obtain police reports), and other entities
● Intervention with administrative agencies, schools/colleges, or tribal entities and other circumstances
where legal advice or intervention would assist in addressing the consequences of a person's
victimization
● Filing a motion to vacate or expunge a victim’s conviction, or similar action, based on his/her status of
being a victim, where permitted under Illinois law

Priorities
This program meets the following ICJIA VOCA/VAWA priorities: #2 Fundamental Needs, #3 Core Services,
#4 More advocates in more places, and #5 Underserved.
Funding Prospectus
Staff expects to fund this program an additional two years; however, with renewal at the end of each 12-month
period. ICJIA will analyze each grantee within this program to ensure that each is meeting its goals and
objectives, to decide if each grantee will receive the funding for the additional/remaining 12 months.
Past Performance
At the end of this grant period, Land of Lincoln will have met or exceeded all objectives regarding civil legal
assistance services to clients, as well as staff training. During the first three quarters of Year One, the program
aided 1,110 victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking, including 840 clients who received
assistance with plenary orders of protection and civil no contact orders and 270 clients who received assistance
with family matters including divorce, custody, and support.
Continued were long-standing collaborations with 18 domestic violence support agencies in the agency’s
service territory to ensure it was reaching those victims with the most critical legal needs and providing
seamless, comprehensive services to victims. Land of Lincoln has been collaborating with local domestic
violence agencies for more than three decades. It receives daily referrals from many of them, who provide
victims with emergency shelter, counseling, and other supportive services, as well as assistance in obtaining
emergency orders of protection. Domestic violence support advocates are often able to assist victims in
obtaining an emergency order of protection because the hearings are ex parte, with no one appearing for the
abuser. The agencies refer victims to Land of Lincoln to provide representation and assistance in plenary order
of protection hearings because the hearings are held after the abuser has been served and are often contested.
The domestic violence agencies also refer clients to Land of Lincoln for representation in divorce, custody, and
child support matters. Although most victims are referred from the domestic violence support agencies, the
agency ensures that victims are referred to partner agencies for supportive services. Additionally, VOCA staff
members hold quarterly meetings with each domestic violence agency to discuss challenges and evaluate the
referral process between agencies to ensure seamless provision of services to victims.
Land of Lincoln partnered with Illinois Legal Aid Online (ILAO), Prairie State Legal Services, and LAF to
expand the online access system in more areas of law. With VOCA funding, Land of Lincoln also partnered
with ILAO to enhance services to domestic violence victims. ILAO created a Victims of Crime Portal through
its website, where victims can get legal information and apply for services. By typing in their zip code and
answering a few questions about the type of crime, victims can apply online for assistance from Land of
Lincoln. They can choose to either complete an intake online or to call their local regional office for immediate
assistance.

Meadows and Skokie courthouses, b) add an attorney to its Des Plaines office for complicated family law cases,
and c) expand immigration services in its Chicago and Des Plaines offices.
Program Activities
Funding in the second and third year will enhance outreach efforts toward immigrants to promote and direct
clients to Life Span’s services. Life Span will do so through collaborations with agencies who serve specific
populations such as KAN-WIN, Arab American Family Services and Apna Ghar. Life Span will engage in
culturally and linguistically specific outreach in partnership with these agencies that includes community
education.
Goals
Please see Past Performance section for description of goals.
Priorities
This program meets the following ICJIA VOCA/VAWA priorities: #2 Fundamental Needs, #3 Core Services,

the grantee to ensure it is meeting its goals and objectives prior to determining whether the grantee will receive
an additional/remaining 12 months of funding.
Past Performance
Life Span was unable to meet some goals in FY18 due to some staffing issues. Life Span does not anticipate
other barriers, such as high turnover, in the future.

children in common with their abusers through the criminal case in which the victim is a complaining witness.
These remedies, include, but not limited to, child support, physical custody, structured parenting time, and
assisting victims who have children in common with their abusers in maintaining separation. Prior to the start of
this program, these remedies were not readily available to complaining witnesses in conjunction with criminal
cases at the Centralized Domestic Violence Courthouse.
Goals

FROM:

Greg Stevens, Acting Associate Director, Federal & State Grants Unit

DATE:

RE:

FFY18 Violence Against Women Act Sexual Assault Service Program Plan
Introduction

This memo describes the FFY18 Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Sexual Assault Service
Program (SASP) Plan Introduction.
VAWA SASP FFY18 INTRODUCTION
The FFY18 VAWA SASP award to Illinois was $530,390 and $26,520 of that was set aside for
administration purposes. The designations recommended in this memo and future designations
will be consistent with the priorities set forth in the FFY17-FFY20 VAWA Multi-Year Plan.
RECOMMENDED DESIGNATION
On January 10 and 11, 2017, ICJIA convened an Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee to review
past priorities and define new ones for the use of STOP VAWA funds. The committee
recommended that FFY17-FFY20 VAWA funds be used principally to continue to support
successful programs previously funded through VAWA.
The following continuation designation is for a previously funded VAWA program deemed
successful by staff.
Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA): The Sexual Assault Services Formula Grant
Program directs grant dollars to states and to assist them in supporting rape crisis centers and
other nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations that provide core services, direct intervention,
and related assistance to victims of sexual assault. Rape crisis centers and other nonprofit
organizations such as dual programs providing both domestic violence and sexual violence
intervention services play a vital role in assisting sexual assault victims through the healing
process, as well as assisting victims through the medical, criminal justice, and other social
support systems. As in previous years, staff recommends designating FFY18 VAWA SASP
funds in the amount of $503,870 to ICASA to be subgranted to ICASA’s partner agencies
through a request-for-proposals process.
Staff will be available at the meeting to answer any questions.

Program Description
The Sexual Assault Services Program (SASP) was created by the Violence Against Women and Department of
Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 and is the first federal funding stream solely dedicated to the provision of
direct intervention and related assistance for victims of sexual assault. Women and men of all ages, as well as
children, can be victims of sexual assault. The perpetrator can be a relative, acquaintance, or a stranger. Nearly
half of all women and one in five men have experienced some form of sexual violence in their lifetime. Also,
nearly one in five (18.3 percent) women and one in 71 men (1.4 percent) in the United States have been raped at
some time in their lives.
For many victims, it may take years to recover from the physical and psychological trauma caused by rape and
other forms of sexual violence. To heal from the trauma, survivors often need support from family and friends,
as well as critical direct intervention and related assistance from victim-centered social service organizations,
such as rape crisis centers, through 24-hour sexual assault hotlines, crisis intervention, and medical and criminal
justice accompaniment.
SASP directs grant dollars to states to assist them in supporting rape crisis centers that provide core services,
direct intervention, and related assistance to victims of sexual assault. Rape crisis centers and other nonprofit
organizations such as dual programs providing both domestic violence and sexual violence intervention services
play vital roles in assisting sexual assault victims through the healing process, as well as assisting victims
through the medical, criminal justice, and other social support systems. Funds provided through the SASP
program are designed to supplement other funding sources directed at addressing sexual assault.
In Illinois, VAWA SASP funds are distributed to local sexual assault service providers through an interagency
agreement between ICJIA and the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA). Under the SASP
program, ICASA will make funds available to 32-member agencies for the provision of hotline, advocacy,
counseling, and outreach services to adults and children. The funded agencies will be selected through a
competitive application process in which applicants will be evaluated based on demonstrated need in the service
area, previous and proposed performance, reasonableness of program plan, consistency of budget and program
plan and compliance with ICASA’s service standards.

Program Activities
In-person Counseling – Services must include sexual
assault crisis intervention and sexual assault
counseling. Centers may provide sexual assault
therapy.
Information and Referral – The center will respond to
telephone or in-person requests for information about
sexual assault. The center will share additional
sources about sexual assault or explain services
which may be helpful to a victim, significant other or
interested individual.
24-hour Hotline or 24-hour Accessibility to
Telephone Crisis.
Intervention – The center will maintain a telephone
line or other access to 24-hour telephone crisis
intervention for victims, significant others and other
individuals needing assistance. 24-hour access means
that a person (not a pager, answering machine or
voice mail system) must answer the phone to respond
to the caller; this may be a center staff person,
volunteer or answering service worker.
