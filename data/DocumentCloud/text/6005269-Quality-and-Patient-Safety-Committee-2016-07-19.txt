Report from Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates (Attachment #1)
B. Metrics (Attachment #2)
Dr. Krishna Das, Chief Quality Officer, reviewed the metrics and provided an update on regulatory and
accreditation matters. During the discussion of the metrics, Dr. Das noted that metrics relating to Cermak
Health Services will be presented in the near future.
With regard to the subject of immunization rates, Ms. Merryweather stated that she was recently at a meeting
with representatives from the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA), the Chicago Department of Public Health and
other partners, regarding a project where they will be going out to the senior housing within CHA to administer
immunizations. She stated that Walgreens and Blue Cross Blue Shield are providing the immunizations, and for
those who are not covered by insurance or who cannot afford it, Walgreens is funding it through their
foundation. On the South and West sides of Chicago, that is where low immunization rates are being seen; that
is also where high hospitalization rates are seen. She stated that 90% of all hospital emergency room visits were
made by African-Americans from the South and West sides of Chicago; she added that, every year, about 3,500
people die from flu and pneumonia complications in Illinois. CCHHS needs to put a push on this, as the
immunization rates are low in comparison to other hospitals. Dr. Das concurred; she stated that staff should
definitely reach out for more information on this project, as it sounds like it has good resources.

III.

Report from Chief Quality Officer (continued)
Board Chairman Hammock stated that, with the upcoming new fiscal year beginning December 1, and the
approval of the new Strategic Plan, he suggested that the administration may want to freshen up some of the
metrics, in ways that would highlight the strategic objectives in the quality category to reflect progress made
toward them. Director Lerner noted that it would be sensible from a System point of view, since that is the way
the Strategic Plan is moving the organization, to include quality measures from CountyCare, Cermak, and any
of the other arms of the organization, to look at it from an integrated point of view.
It was noted that the Committee would be receiving another detailed review relating to Operating Room
performance improvement in September.

C. Report - Illinois Surgical Quality Improvement Collaborative (ISQIC) (Attachment #3)
Dr. Richard Keen, Chairman of the Department of Surgery, reviewed the presentation on the ISQIC Report.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Included in the presentation was information on the following subjects:
•
•
•

•
•

National Surgical Quality Improvement
Program (NSQIP) Background, Benefits
and History;

•
•

•
•

With regard to the subject of data abstraction of the information used for projects like this, Director Lerner
stated that there is historically a heavy dependence on the labor pool to do this. He inquired whether
America’s Essential Hospitals (AEH) has talked to the administration about a project involving working
with IBM Watson to use artificial intelligence to move some of this activity forward. Dr. John Jay
Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, responded that the subject has come up at the national level, but CCHHS
has not been individually approached regarding the project.

 ACHN Survey Updates
• Joint Commission requires that sites with a single CCN* be
accredited as one entity
• Recognition that ACHN is certified under the same CCN as
Stroger
• Therefore ACHN and Stroger are viewed as one entity by
Medicare and the Joint Commission
• ACHN has been continually accredited by the Joint
Commission
• Stroger recently completed a successful accreditation visit
• Therefore ACHN will undergo an ‘extension’ survey
• Going forward, ACHN and Stroger will be surveyed at the
same time as a single entity

 NSQIP Case Selection
• Systematic Sampling Process
– Cases are selected based on the NSQIP
inclusion/exclusion criteria
• Inclusion based on CPT® codes of major cases
• General exclusion criteria
– Pediatrics
– Trauma and Transplant
– ASA class 6
• An 8 day cycle yields on average 250 surgical procedures
– Once exclusion criteria are applied to about 30% of the cases,
there are enough cases remaining to fulfill the 30 cases per cycle
NSQIP requirement

 Surgical site infections (SSIs): what are they
and why are they important?
• Second most common type of healthcare-associated
infection (HAI) in U.S. Hospitals (290,000 per year)
• Estimated cost: $3.5-10 billion per year
• Patient with SSI is:
– 5 times more likely to be admitted after discharge
– 2 times more likely to spend time in intensive care
– 2 times more likely to die after surgery
