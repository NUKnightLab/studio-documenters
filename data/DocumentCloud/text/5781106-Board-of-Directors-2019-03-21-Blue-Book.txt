Policy Regarding the Attendance of and Participation by
the Public at Board Meetings

(Adopted 15 December 2005)

The Police Board values the attendance of the public at its meetings and the opportunity
to receive comments and questions on matters concerning the Board or the Police
Department. The Board will treat members of the public with courtesy and respect, and
expects that the public will treat Board members and Department members in a similar

manner.

Toward that end, the Board has adopted the following rules governing conduct at Board
meetings:

1.

An individual wishing to address the Board must sign-up in advance by
contacting the Board?s of?ce by phone, fax, or in person no later than 4:30 pm.
of the day before the meeting.

When called upon to address the Board, each speaker is to identify him/herself
and speak clearly so that all in attendance may hear and so that the court reporter
may make an accurate record of the proceedings.

Due to time constraints, each speaker is limited to two minutes and must
conclude when asked to do so by the Board member acting as parliamentarian.

Personal attacks, obscene language, ?ghting words, threats, conduct intended to
disrupt or interfere with the meeting, and comments not related to matters within
the Board?s or the Department?s jurisdiction, by a speaker or any person in
attendance, are strictly prohibited.

Violation of any of the above rules may result in the removal of the violator from the
meeting room, or in the immediate adjournment of the meeting; in addition, repeated
violations may result in the violator not being permitted to attend or participate in future
Board meetings.
