Audit Committee did not hold its regular meeting on Wednesday, July 13th. While Committee
members were briefed on items appearing on the agenda and on the following seven resolutions,
no items were voted on.
(Items A1)
The FY2011 budgeted expenditures have been revised from $886,694,403 to $879,609,217
resulting in a $7,085,186 decrease. The major changes by funding source are as follows: General
Fund - total revenues and associated expenditures decreased by 10,204,625 for a fund total of
$771,473,557. The overall reduction reflects the deferral of several capital related projects to
FY2012; Section 8 Non-MTW Fund - total revenues and associated expenditures increased by
$1,884,682 for a fund total of $8,614,018. The increase represents Veterans Affairs Supportive
Housing (VASH) vouchers awarded for FY2012. Other Funding - the total revenues and
associated expenditures increased by $1,234,757 for a fund total of $59,866,472. The increase
primarily reflects funding for the Chicago Community Trust “Find Your Place” campaign, and
additional stimulus monies allocated for surveillance camera work at various CHA sites.
Accordingly, the resolution for Item A1 approves the revised 2011 Comprehensive Budget.
RESOLUTION NO. 2011-CHA-82

economical operation of the Chicago Housing Authority for the purpose of
serving low-income families;
that the financial plan is reasonable in that it indicates funding sources
adequate to cover all proposed expenditures, and does not provide for use
of Federal funding in excess of that payable under the provisions of the
applicable Federal regulations; and

(Item A2)
HUD uses the Performance Funding System (PFS) to determine a public housing authority’s
eligibility for an operating subsidy. The CHA is required to submit a PFS Calculation detailing
the total operating subsidy for fiscal year 2011. Based on the formula established by HUD as a
part of the Amended and Restated Moving-to-Work Demonstration Agreement the CHA
requests the operating subsidy in the amount of $175,166,784. Upon release of the final proration amount, the CHA’s FY2011 Comprehensive Budget will be adjusted. Accordingly, the
resolution for Item A2 approves submittal of the PFS Calculation to HUD.

Calculation and authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute
and submit the Performance Funding System Calculation and all necessary related
documents to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

(Items A3)

Annual Plan – Plan for Transformation Year 12. The document represents CHA's FY2011
MTW Annual Plan and details CHA’s anticipated activities for FY2011. CHA determined the
need to amend the FY2011 MTW Annual Plan to reflect additional anticipated activity in
FY2011. A key activity includes non-dwelling demolition and disposition activity which should
be incorporated in the FY2011 Plan Amendment per HUD. Prior to submission of the
Amendment to the FY2011 MTW Annual Plan to the Board, a 30-day public comment period
was conducted wherein both residents and the public alike were able to submit comments orally
and in writing, regarding the information contained in the proposed Plan. The public comment

(Items A4)
The City of Chicago received grant awards from the U.S. Department of Commerce and the
State of Illinois for the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (commonly known as
SmartChicago). The SmartChicago technology program is designed to bring technology
resources to low income neighborhoods across the City that are disproportionately and adversely
affected by the lack of technology resources. The City is partnering with its Department of
Family and Supportive Services, the Chicago Housing Authority, and City Colleges of Chicago,
Chicago Public Libraries to close the “digital divide” by expanding technology resources to
underserved neighborhoods through enhancement of technology skillsets. The City entered into
a subgrant agreement with the Chicago Community Trust to install new computer labs at seven
CHA sites including ABLA Homes, Bridgeport Homes, Dearborn Homes, Lake Parc Place,
Lawndale Gardens, Trumbull Park Homes and Wentworth Gardens and enhance one existing
computer lab at Altgeld Gardens. The $1,715,664 grant award will provide the wages to hire 32
CHA residents and the equipment for the 8 computer labs covered by the grant. The additional
$1,885,250 funding will allow TEC to supervise and train the staff, coordinate programming for
CHA residents utilizing the computer labs and provide additional supplies to maintain the
computer labs during the two-year project. It will also be used to pay TEC to oversee and
manage 4 other existing labs at the FIC, Lowden Homes, Lincoln Perry Apartments and Annex
and Minnie Riperton Apartments. Accordingly, the resolution for Item A4 approves acceptance
of grant award from the City and approval of a grant agreement with Chicago Community Trust
for the development of computer labs in CHA developments.
RESOLUTION NO. 2011-CHA-85
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the

AN AWARD AND EXECUTE A GRANT AGREEMENT WITH CHICAGO
COMMUNITY TRUST FOR THE SMART CHICAGO BROADBAND

CENTER PROJECT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EIGHT COMPUTER
LABS IN CHA DEVELOPMENTS AND ENTER INTO A SUBCONTRACT
AGREEMENT WITH TEC SERVICES, INC.”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners (“Board”) authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or
his designee to accept a grant award and execute a grant agreement with the
Chicago Community Trust Foundation, as a sub grantee of the SmartChicago
Public Computer Center project, for an amount of $1,715,664 and to increase the
FY2011 comprehensive budget by the same amount. The Board also authorizes
the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to enter into a sub-grant agreement
with TEC Services, Inc. for a 2-year term utilizing the grant award and additional
funding not to exceed $1,885,250 for a total contract amount not-to-exceed
$3,600,914 to implement eight Public Computer Centers, hire 32 CHA residents

the Charles Hayes Family Investment Center, Lincoln Perry Apartments and
Annex and Minnie Riperton Apartments.

(Item A5)
The resolution for Item A5 approves acceptance of grant award from HUD for the Family
Unification Program (FUP). On June 15, 2011, the CHA received official written notice of being
selected to receive $923,232.00 from HUD’s Fiscal Year 2010 FUP Program to support 100
vouchers. This grant will provide vouchers to CHA for families for whom the lack of adequate
housing is a primary factor in the separation of children from their families. The FUP program
allows local public housing authorities to work closely with local child welfare agencies to
identify families with children in foster care or who are at risk of being placed in foster care and
youth at risk of homelessness. These vouchers, like HUD’s Housing Choice Vouchers, allow
families and youth to rent housing from private landlords and generally pay 30 percent of their
monthly income towards rent and utilities.

(Items A6)

received official written notice of an award of $57,962.00 from HUD’s FSS Program to continue
the Family Self-Sufficiency Program. The grant agreement had to be immediately signed and
returned to HUD. CHA’s Public Housing FSS program includes 350 residents in mixed-income
and family developments. FSS services for both public housing and Housing Choice Voucher
participants are now provided by FSS coordinators by each of CHA’s 6 FamilyWorks providers.
The purpose of the Public Housing FSS program is to promote the development of local
strategies to coordinate the use of accessible services under the FSS program with public and
private resources, enable participating families to increase earned income, reduce or eliminate
the need for welfare assistance, and make progress toward achieving economic independence
and housing self-sufficiency. The anticipated outcome of the program is a transition from
dependency on social services and public housing to self-sufficiency.

There being no questions or discussion, the Chairman thereupon declared said Motion carried
and said resolutions adopted.
Commissioner Young, Chairman of the Tenant Services Committee then presented a report for
the Joint Operations and Tenant Services Committee Meetings. Per Commissioner Young, the
Joint Committees held a meeting on Wednesday, July 13, 2011 at the CHA Corporate Offices.
While Committee members were briefed on items appearing on the agenda no items were voted
on.
Commissioner Young then presented an Omnibus Motion for adoption of the Resolutions for
Items B1 thru B4.
(Item B1)
As part of a Voluntary Compliance Agreement between the CHA and HUD, the CHA is to
increase the percentage of accessible units for persons with mobility impairments and the
percentage of sensory-accessible units in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
To accomplish this task, the CHA solicited bids for general contractors to perform ADA/504
conversion work in and around fifteen units in the Scattered Sites Program. The IFB was
advertised in area newspapers and on the CHA website and on BuySpeed Online.. The CHA
received and opened six. This Bid was initially awarded to the lowest bidder at the May 17, 2011
Board meeting in the amount of $182,970.00. However, in light of the lowest bidder’s inability
to satisfy certain award conditions, staff recommends that the second lowest bidder, All Chicago,
Inc., be awarded the contract. All Chicago has increasingly worked with the CHA in the past
three years and has already been awarded Bid Group 1 under this solicitation. Accordingly, the
resolution for Item B1 approves award of contract to All Chicago, Inc. for ADA/504 conversion
work at various scattered sites units.
RESOLUTION NO. 2011-CHA-89
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated July 13, 2011,
entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH ALL
CHICAGO, INC. FOR ADA/504 CONVERSION WORK AT VARIOUS
SCATTERED SITES – PACKAGE 9 (BID GROUP 2)”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a contract for ADA/504 conversion work in and around two
(2) units in the Chicago Housing Authority’s Scattered Sites Program with All
7

 Chicago, Inc. in the amount of $215,067.00 for Package 9 – Bid Group 2. Work is
to be performed at 2117 W. Giddings St. and 2527 W. Foster Ave., Chicago, IL.
Work for Bid Group 2 is to be completed within ninety (90) calendar days from
the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance
requirements.
(Item B2)
The CHA retains private security services at Administrative locations throughout its portfolio
The current security contract that covers these locations expires July 31, 2011. As CHA will
continue to conduct business at these locations upon expiration of the current contract, the need
for continued security services is still required. The CHA released and advertised a Request
For Proposal (RFP) in area newspapers and on the CHA Website and BuySpeed Online. The
CHA also directly solicited 73 firms, including 45 MBE/WBE/DBE firms, and sent notification
to 70 Assist Agencies. After an extensive RFP evaluation process, the staff determined that
Skytech was the highest ranked and most responsive and responsible firm. Skytech has agreed to
a schedule of hourly rates that will remain fixed for the base term of the contract, and has agreed
to fixed hourly rates that increase approximately 6% for each of the option terms. Each option
year will be exercised at the CEO’s discretion subject to satisfactory performance and funding
availability. Accordingly, the resolution for Item B2 approves award of contract to Skytech
Enterprises, Ltd for Security Services at various CHA administrative offices.
RESOLUTION NO. 2011–CHA-90
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated July 13, 2011,
entitled “Authorization to Enter into a Contract with Skytech Enterprises, Ltd., for
Security Services at the Various CHA Administrative Offices”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

it is recommended that the Board of Commissioners authorize the Chief
Executive Officer (“CEO”) or his designee to enter into a two (2) year base term
contract in the amount not-to-exceed $1,256,466. It is also recommended that the
Board authorize the CEO, at his discretion, to exercise the first 1-year option in an
amount not-to-exceed $665,917, subject to funding availability and the second
one year option in the amount not-to-exceed$705,872, subject to funding
availability. The total aggregate not-to-exceed contract amount will be
$2,628,235 for the 2-year base term and the 2 one-year options for the provision
of security services at the following CHA Administrative locations: CHA Client
Service Center located at 60 East Van Buren, 1st and 9th floors; the three (3) HCV
Satellite Office locations at 3500 South State Street, 5th fl, 1741-49 East 75th /
1755-57 East 75th Street, and 2750 West Roosevelt Road; and the Family
Investment Center (FIC), located at 4859 S. Wabash.

(Item B3)
The CHA currently uses rental copiers provided by several vendors governed by a variety of
contracts. These multifunctional devices provide Copy/Print/Scan/Fax functionality at the CHA’s
headquarters and Family Investment Center sites. Maintaining the existing copier stock is
neither cost effective, nor is it capable of meeting current and future business needs.
Accordingly, the CHA released a Request for Proposal (RFP) in December 2010. The RFP was
advertised on area newspapers and on the CHA’s Website and on BuySpeed online. Thirty-six
vendors were directly solicited. Seven proposals were received and deemed responsive and
were evaluated by an evaluation committee. Based upon the evaluations of the written
proposals, oral presentations, negotiations and best and final offers, it was determined that Xerox
Corporation will provide the best value to the CHA. The resolution for Item B3 therefore
approves the award of contract to Xerox Corporation for the purchase of multifunctional copiers.
RESOLUTION NO. 2011-CHA-91
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated July 13, 2011,
entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO PURCHASE AND PROVIDE SUPPLIES
AND MAINTENANCE FOR TWENTY-FIVE MULTIFUNCTIONAL
COPIERS FROM THE XEROX CORPORATION”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
8

 THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a contract with Xerox Corporation for the purchase of 25
Multifunctional Copiers in the not-to-exceed amount of $168,000.00 and provide
Supplies and Maintenance for those 25 Multifunctional Copiers for a not-toexceed amount of $347,000 for a base term of two (2) years with two (2) one-year
options, for a total not-to-exceed amount of $515,000.

(Item B4)
The resolution for Item B4 approves the FY2010 Amended Administrative Plan for the Housing
Choice Voucher Tenant Based and Project Based Programs. Federal regulation requires Public
Housing Authorities (PHA) to maintain and update the Administrative Plan that outline the rules
and policies necessary to administer the voucher programs. The purpose for this request is to
revise the following activities: allow domestic partners to be added as new family members,
deny assistance of applicants if they have been involved in criminal activity in the past five
years, deny assistance if applicant has been terminated from any federal assisted housing
program within the last ten years, remove double denial process, add a new selection preference
to support 10 Year Plan to End Homelessness, clarify that live-in aides qualify for an additional
bedroom, clarify that assets are considered for initial eligibility, allow “pass” HQS inspections to
be used for the move in of a new family into the same unit, implement mandatory direct deposit
participant of owners to receive Housing Assistance Payments, deny assistance in units of
foreclosed properties, change the period to request hearing of HCV participants from 10 days to
30 days, require participants (if deemed necessary) to attend an in-person interview at regular reexaminations where all adult members must be present, disallow elective moves if the family’s
next regular re-examination is within 120 days, terminate a family’s assistance if any household
member (including 17 years old) are currently engaged or have been engaged in criminal
activity, enhance screening criteria for owners, cap the use of tenant-based voucher properties
where the number of assisted units exceeds 40%, allow payments for vacant units during initial
lease-up, post PBV notices on website, deny PBV units in homeownership program, rely on
subsidy-layering reviews by City or IHDA, limit rent decreases to initial contract rent, provide
monitoring of PBV property management, allow PBV residents to participate in Family SelfSufficiency and Homeownership programs. CHA hosted a public comment period allowing
residents, program participants, and members of the public to submit comments on the proposed
amendments and also held two CHA public comment hearings. Responses to comments
submitted during the public comment period and public hearings were considered before
finalizing the FY2010 Administrative Plan.

housing units in mixed-income/mixed-financed communities unless the site-specific
tenant/resident selection plans state otherwise. This policy does not apply to the three “CityState” properties, which are governed by their own Tenant Selection Plans. The CHA created

 the FY2011 ACOP and Residential Lease Agreement to ensure that the language conforms to
federal and state law. The CHA presented key changes to the ACOP and Residential Lease
Agreement to the Central Advisory Council (CAC) Executive Board and the council at large and
their legal representatives on April 15, 2011. The public comment period for the draft FY2011
ACOP and Residential Lease Agreement was held May 17, 2011 through June 16, 2011. Copies
of the draft ACOP and Residential Lease Agreement were made available at the CAC Office; the
Local Advisory Council Offices; property management offices; Latino Site Offices; and CHA
Administrative Office located at 60 E. Van Buren Street, 10th Floor Lobby, as well as on the
CHA website. Notice to residents and the public about the public comment period appeared in
news ads. A public comment hearing was held on June 2, 2011, at the Charles A. Hayes Family
Investment Center. In finalizing the ACOP and Residential Lease Agreement, the CHA gave
consideration to comments received during the public comment period and public comment
hearing.
