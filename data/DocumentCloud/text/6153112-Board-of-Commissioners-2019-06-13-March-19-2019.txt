session and discussed, voted and recommended for approval the following three items.
(Item 1)
The resolution for Item No. 1 approves the FY2018 Moving to Work (MTW) Annual Report and
authorizes the submittal of the Report to HUD. Submission of the FY2018 MTW Annual Report fulfills
CHA’s annual MTW reporting requirements and supports CHA’s goal of successful continued
compliance with the obligations of HUD’s MTW Demonstration Program. As part of the MTW
Agreement, CHA is required to submit an Annual Report to HUD, due 90 days after the end of CHA’s
fiscal year. The MTW Annual Report provides information necessary for HUD to assess CHA’s
performance in FY2018 in its operations as well as activities authorized by the MTW Program. CHA
continues to work with HUD for technical guidance and feedback on MTW reporting processes and
requirements to ensure compliance. CHA has complied with the requirements of the Amended and
Restated MTW Agreement and HUD regulations regarding the submission of annual reports.
WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-11
The Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 19, 2019,
requesting approval of the FY2018 MTW Annual Report and authorization to submit
the FY2018 MTW Annual Report to HUD attached hereto;

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:

1

 THAT,

The Board of Commissioners hereby approves the FY2018 Moving to Work Annual
Report and grants authorization to the Chief Executive Officer, the Board
Chairperson, or their designee to make any final updates as deemed necessary; such
approval shall constitute conclusive evidence of the Board’s approval of any and all
such changes.

THAT,

This approval of the FY2018 MTW Annual Report supersedes any and all
conflicting language found in prior CHA MTW Annual Reports;

THAT,

The Board of Commissioners grants authorization to submit the FY2018 MTW
Annual Report to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development upon
Board approval.

(Item 2)
In February 2015, the CHA replaced its legacy document management solution by implementing a
new Enterprise Content Management System (known as iFile Phase I). This effort included the migration
of over ten million documents from the legacy system into iFile. The solution increased customer
service delivery and operational efficiencies by providing rapid, intuitive records search and retrieval
capability as well as providing an integrated means to scan, capture, store, manage and retain
information assets across departments in the Authority. To further expand the use of the central
document repository and improve business processes, CHA will further enhance its current SharePoint
Enterprise Content Management System (ECMS). The requested enhancement of the current ECMS is
referred to as iFile Phase II. With iFile Phase II, CHA will upgrade the software and expand the use and
capabilities of CHA’s iFile system, identify and create new document types and document libraries for
selected departments, and optimize existing business process into electronic workflows. Accordingly,
the resolution for Item 2 approves the award of a contract to Electronic Knowledge Interchange
Company to provide services for the upgrade and expansion of the CHA’s Enterprise Content
Management System for a two year base term with compensation in the not-to-exceed amount of
$2,799,240.00, plus three one-year options for staff augmentation and support with compensation for
each option term in the not-to-exceed amount of $466,782.00, resulting in total compensation for the
cumulative base and option terms in the not-to-exceed amount of $4,199,586.00.
WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-12
the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
Letter dated March 19, 2019 entitled “RECOMMENDATION TO AWARD
CONTRACT FOR AN UPGRADE AND EXPANSION OF THE ENTERPRISE
CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.”

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
execute a contract with Electronic Knowledge Interchange Company in the aggregate
not-to-exceed amount of $4,199,586 to provide services for the upgrade and expansion of
the CHA’s Enterprise Content Management System for a two (2) year base term, and
with three (3) one-year options for staff augmentation and support services reserved to
the CHA.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE/
Section 3 hiring and insurance requirements.

(Item 3)
The resolution for Item 3 approves the purchase of insurance coverage for CHA's Property Managers
Insurance Program (PMIP) through its insurance broker of record, Arthur J Gallagher & Company
(AJG), for the period of April 1, 2019 through March 31, 2020 for an aggregate amount of $894,992.00.
The Property Managers Insurance Program (PMIP) was created in 1999 to provide liability protection
for the Authority and its property management firms. In 2001 the CHA received an exemption from
HUD allowing it to purchase insurance through a licensed insurance broker. This is the fourth PMIP
insurance placement conducted by Arthur J Gallagher, the CHA’s current broker of record. The process
included submitting insurance specifications, claims data, and resident demographics to underwriters to
formulate pricing for insurance coverage. The specifications were submitted to 44 insurers, some of
which quoted multiple lines of coverage. By purchasing insurance, the Authority and its Property
2

 Managers are granted coverage for certain liabilities associated with the operation of the portfolio that
exceed $250,000.00.
RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-13
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
letter dated March 19, 2019 entitled:
AUTHORIZATION TO PURCHASE
INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR PROPERTY MANAGERS INSURANCE
PROGRAM (PMIP).
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
purchase the insurance coverage for CHA's Property Managers Insurance Program
(“PMIP”) through its insurance broker of record, Arthur J Gallagher & Company
(“AJG”), for the period of April 1, 2019 through March 31, 2020 for an aggregate amount
of $894,992.00 based on a fixed-rate contract as follows: (1) Primary General Liability
coverage written through First Specialty/Swiss Re American Holding in an amount of
$445,712.00; (2) Umbrella Liability coverage written through General Star Indemnity
Company in an amount of $341,280.00; and (3) Excess Liability written through Allied
Word Assurance Company (“AWAC”) in an amount of $108,000.00.
This award is not subject to the Vendor’s (broker) compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE/ Section 3 hiring and insurance requirements.

The Motion to adopt resolutions for Items No. 1 through 3 was seconded by Commissioner Matanky and
the voting was as follows:
Ayes:
Matthew Brewer
Craig Chico
Dr. Mildred Harris
Meghan Harte
John Hooker
James Matanky
Cristina Matos
Bill Thanoukos
Debra Parker
Francine Washington
Nays:

None

There being no questions or discussion, Chairman Hooker thereupon declared said Motion carried and
said resolutions adopted.
Committee Chair Meghan Harte, then presented the report for the Tenant Services Committee. Per
Commissioner Harte, the Tenant Services Committee held its monthly meeting earlier today.
Commissioner Harte chaired the meeting and the following committee members were present as well:
Commissioners Brewer, Harris, Parker and Washington. Although Chairman Hooker and
Commissioners James Matanky, Cristina Matos and Bill Thanoukos were also present they were not
counted toward the quorum. Committee member then discussed, voted and recommended for approval
the item appearing on the Tenant Services Committee agenda.
On behalf of the Tenant Services Committee, Commissioner Harte presented a Motion for approval of
Item 4.
(Item 4)
CHA issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) requesting qualified firms to provide Resident Service
Coordination (RSC) program services for CHA senior residents. Seven proposals were submitted and
scored by the evaluation committee; four were determined to be in the competitive range. Based on the
recommendation of the Evaluation Committee and Best and Final Offers, Catholic Charities of the
Archdiocese of Chicago total score was significantly higher than all other Respondents, and they offered
a competitive price in line with the cost estimate for this project. Accordingly, the resolution for Item 4
approves a contract award to Catholic Charities in an aggregate amount of $9,062,645 for a one-year
base term and one (1) one-year option term. The three remaining additional one-year options are subject
3

 to future Board authorization. The RSC program links CHA senior residents to the social services and
opportunities necessary to maintain a stable and high quality of life and fosters an environment
conducive to aging in a place that is welcoming to active seniors, as well as those needing more support.
Historically, the Resident Service Coordination program was imbedded in CHA private property
management firm contracts based on a model of blended management. However, based upon internal
review of programs, the RSC program is better aligned with the mission of Resident Services and should
be supported by agencies whose core business and experience includes providing high quality senior
services. This separation of property management and services would enable senior residents to receive
specific services based on their needs. All 56 senior buildings in CHA’s north, central and south regions
will receive customized services. There are approximately 9,400 senior designated units throughout
CHA’s service area, which approximately 54 RSCs will serve.

RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-14
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
Letter dated March 19, 2019 entitled “RECOMMENDATION TO AWARD A
CONTRACT FOR THE RESIDENT SERVICE COORDINATOR PROGRAM”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
execute a contract with Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Chicago in an aggregate
amount of $9,062,645 for a one-year base term and one (1) one-year option term. The
Board delegates authority to the Chief Executive Officer to use his discretion to exercise
the option year term. There are three (3) remaining additional one-year options subject to
future Board authorization.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE/
Section 3 hiring and insurance requirements.

 (Item 5)
The resolution for Item 5 approves the renewal of a Preliminary Commitment Letter for 5150 Northwest
Apartments approved by the Board of Commissioners at the June 20, 2017 meeting. Initial contract

applications. 5150 Northwest Apartments is a new construction, 7-story masonry, elevator building
located in an Opportunity and General area in Chicago’s Jefferson Park community. The building will
offer 75 total units. Property Rental Assistance will assist 30 units: 4 studios, 9 one-bedroom, 7 twobedroom, and 10 three-bedroom units.
5150 has received approval from the US Department of
Veteran’s Affair (VA) to utilize 10 VASH vouchers as part of the PRA voucher commitment. The
target population for the 10 VASH units will be homeless veterans that have been approved by the VA
and meet VASH requirements. The target population for the remaining 20 PRA units will be families
from the CHA waitlist, with a preference for veterans and persons with disabilities. 5150 Northwest LP
is a subsidiary of Full Circle Communities Inc. (FCC). FCC is the Managing Agent and General
Partner and will contribute 75% of the project’s cash flow and developer fee to provide supportive
services to tenants of 5150 Northwest Apartments. FCC will provide an on-site service coordinator and
will link residents to area programs that support education, health, financial awareness, insurance, and

residents for the period of April 1, 2019 through March 31, 2022, for an amount not‐to‐exceed

April 1, 2022 through March 31, 2024. CHA’s Admissions and C o n t i n u e d Occupancy Policy
(ACOP) provides a Grievance Procedure for tenants whose occupancy rights are terminated for
various violations of HUD regulations. The Grievance Procedure does not extend to Tenants
terminated because of criminal violations. Under the Grievance Procedure, a tenant’s grievance is
initially heard by CHA’s Private Property Manager on an informal basis. If the tenant is dissatisfied
with the outcome, that tenant has a right to file for a formal grievance hearing. The average cost of an
administrative hearing through DoAH has been approximately $375 based on five (5) hours for the
hearing officer at $60.00 per hour plus a $75.00 filing fee for each case. Over the past 5 years, CHA has
averaged approximately 40 ‐ 60 formal grievance hearings with DoAH per year.

(Item 7)
The resolution for Item 7 approves an inducement resolution for preliminary approval for the issuance of
multifamily housing revenue bonds to finance the acquisition, construction, and rehabilitation of 1221
W. Sherwin Avenue. The issuance of the Bonds at a later date will be subject to further action and
approval by the Authority following the negotiation of terms and the documentation of the transaction as
mutually agreed upon by the Authority and an entity to be determined by the Authority or one of its
affiliates. No funding from CHA is required for this action. The Bonds, when and if issued in the
future, will be subject to a final approving resolution of the Authority and the Bonds when and if issued
will be special limited obligations and will not be a general obligation of the Authority. This Resolution
shall be deemed to constitute a declaration of the Authority’s official intent pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.150-2 to permit the Borrower to be reimbursed from proceeds of the Bonds for all
qualified expenditures for the Project paid during the period beginning sixty (60) days prior to the date
hereof until the date of issuance of the Bonds.
WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-17
the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 19, 2019
entitled “Recommendation to approve an inducement resolution for preliminary approval
for the issuance of multifamily housing revenue bonds to finance the acquisition,
construction, and rehabilitation of 1221 W. Sherwin Avenue.”

WHEREAS, the Chicago Housing Authority (the “Authority”) is organized and validly existing under
and by virtue of the laws of the State of Illinois, including without limitation the Housing
Authorities Act, 310 ILCS 10/1 et seq., and all laws amendatory and supplemental
thereto, including in particular the Local Government Debt Reform Act, 30 ILSCS 350/1
et seq. (the “Act”), is authorized by the laws of the State of Illinois, including without
limitation in the Act, to issue its revenue bonds for the purposes set forth in the Act and to
permit the expenditure of the proceeds thereof to finance the costs of the development,
rehabilitation, and renovation of multifamily rental housing located in the jurisdiction of
the Authority.
WHEREAS, The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and the regulations
promulgated thereunder (the “Regulations”) provide that bonds may be issued by state
and local governmental entities for the purpose of financing qualified residential rental
housing and, assuming compliance with the provisions of the Code and the Regulations,
interest on such bonds is excludable from gross income for purposes of federal income
taxation.
WHEREAS, Regulation Section 1.150-2 provides, among other things, that certain capital
expenditures made prior to the issuance of bonds may be later reimbursed from the
proceeds of a subsequent issuance of bonds if, within 60 days of such expenditure, the
issuer adopts an “official intent” as prescribed in Regulation Section 1.150-2.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

An entity to be determined by the Authority or one of its affiliates (the “Borrower”) will
be the Borrower under a loan by the Authority of the proceeds from the issuance of its
Multifamily Housing Revenue Bonds, in one or more series, in an aggregate amount not
to exceed $15,000,000 (the “Bonds”), for the acquisition, construction, rehabilitation and
equipping of an eight-story multifamily building located at 1221 West Sherwin Avenue in
Chicago, Illinois 60626, which will consist of approximately 57 residential rental
dwelling units for low-income families (the “Project”) to be owned by the Borrower, and
the Borrower or the Authority or its affiliate have made or anticipate making certain
expenditures of its own funds in connection with the acquisition of the Project that they
would like to have reimbursed from the proceeds of the Bonds, when and if the Bonds are
subsequently issued.

6

 The Authority is willing to adopt this Resolution for the purpose of expressing its
“official intent” pursuant to the Code and the Regulations, to issue the Bonds for
purposes of financing the Project, subject to the Authority and the Borrower agreeing to
the terms and conditions necessary to issue the Bonds. Should the Authority and the
Borrower agree to such terms and conditions satisfactory to the Authority and consistent
with applicable law, the issuance of the Bonds would be subject to the adoption by the
Authority of one or more final bond resolutions.
At the time of the adoption of this Resolution, it is the Authority’s intention consistent
with prior practices and discussions with bond counsel to keep open all options for
permanent financing, including the reimbursement of costs spent through a future
issuance of tax-exempt bonds.
Based upon the foregoing, the Authority has the reasonable expectation that the Bonds
will be issued and a portion of the proceeds from such Bonds will be used to reimburse
eligible capital expenditures made by the Borrower or the Authority or its affiliate in
connection with the Project. As a result, this Resolution expresses the “official intent” of
the Authority pursuant to Regulation Section 1.150-2.
Implementation. This Resolution does not constitute any contractual or other obligation
of the Authority to finance costs of acquisition, construction, rehabilitation and equipping
of the Project.
Severability. The provisions of this Resolution are declared to be severable and if any
section, phrase or provision shall for any reason be declared to be invalid, such
declaration shall not affect the validity of the remainder of the sections, phrases and
provisions.
Repeals. All resolutions or parts of resolutions in conflict with this Resolution are
repealed to the extent of such conflict.
Effective Date. This Resolution shall take effect immediately upon its adoption.
(Item 8)
As part of CHA’s unit delivery strategy, the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for Pre-Qualification for
Development Teams (PDTs) was created. The unit delivery strategy builds on CHA’s experience
working with private development teams and owners to supply quality housing that enables low-income
families to maximize their potential for long-term economic success. CHA refined the scope for PDT’s
to engage development partners for the acquisition, development and management of both mixedfinance housing and mixed-use developments. The RFQ provides a method to pre-qualify developers
and creates opportunities for CHA to provide capital loans and operating funds for new construction and
rehabilitation of multi-family, mixed-income and mixed-use projects that directly benefit CHA residents.
Accordingly, CHA released an RFQ for PDTs for mixed-finance housing and mixed-use development
delivery. The RFQ was advertised in area newspapers and on the CHA website. Proposals were
evaluated and scored based on the evaluation criteria published. A total of eight proposals were received
in response to the RFQ. Based on the technical scores and to ensure full and open competition, seven
firms met or exceeded the acceptable minimum threshold. The resolution for Item 8 approves the seven
respondents as listed below in the resolution.
RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-18
