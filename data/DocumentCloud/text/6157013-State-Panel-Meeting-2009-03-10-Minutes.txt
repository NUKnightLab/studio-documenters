BOARD ACTIONS
1.
Case No. S-CA-07-155
Service Employees International Union, Local 73/Illinois State Toll Highway Authority

Chairman Gallagher called the case and summarized its background. Acting General Counsel Brosnan
reviewed the issues presented by the exceptions to Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Wells' Recommended
Decision and Order (RDO), and recommended that the Board accept the ALJ's recommendation that under
the circumstances of this case, there was no violation of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act (Act), 5 ILCS
315 (2006), as amended, in connection with Respondent's tape recording of investigatory interviews; no
violation of the Act in connection with Respondent obtaining Murray to represent Williams in her
investigatory interview; and no violation of the Act in connection with Respondent's failure to provide Reilly
or the Union with information as to the subject matter of his investigatory interview. However, the acting
general counsel further recommend that the Board find that Respondent's failure to provide information as to
the subject matter of Williams' investigatory interview violated her rights under Weingarten, and thereby,
violated Section 10(a)(1) of the Act. He also recommended that the appropriate remedy should be a posting,
as there was no evidence Williams' discharge was due to retaliation for asserting her right to union
representation, or "predominantly dependent" upon information obtained through the unlawful interview, as
Williams apparently admitted no wrongdoing during it. Finally, the acting general counsel recommended
that as neither party filed exceptions to the ALJ's determinations regarding Reilly's retaliation claim, the
Board decline to take that issue up on its own motion. After a discussion of the merits, Member Hade moved
to accept the acting general counsel's recommendation. Member Washington seconded the motion, and the
Board passed it unanimously, by a voice vote.

4.
Case No. S-CA-07-075
Int'l Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 714/Lincolnway Police Communications Center
Chairman Gallagher called the case, noting that no party filed exceptions to ALJ Clifford's RDO, and asked

VI.

OTHER BOARD MATTERS

Chairman Gallagher observed that the governor's budget message was scheduled for April 18; she updated
the Board as to the status of legislation that could affect the agency, and distributed the text of the pending

concluding it was not necessary at this time.
