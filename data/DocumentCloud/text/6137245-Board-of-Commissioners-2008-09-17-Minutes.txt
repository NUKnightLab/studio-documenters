 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 17, 2008
RESOLUTION SEEKING MORATORIUM ON FORECLOSURES,
RECOGNIZING NACA, AND URGING THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY TO
HELP HOMEOWNERS “SAVE THE DREAM”
WHEREAS, national and local foreclosure rates are staggering and have become more than a crisis for
homeowners across the country; nationally, foreclosures increased by 121% in the Second Quarter of
2008 as compared to 2007; locally, statewide foreclosures increased by 58% in the Second Quarter of
2008 as compared to 2007, and one out of every 193 homes in Illinois is in foreclosure; and
WHEREAS, in Cook County, foreclosures increased by 57% in May of 2008 as compared to 2007;
nearly 6,000 foreclosures were filed in Cook County, Illinois in May of 2008; and, one out of every 362
homes in Cook County, Illinois is in foreclosure; and
WHEREAS, the foreclosure crisis does not discriminate based upon gender, race or income; foreclosures
are occurring everywhere in Cook County, from Robbins in the South to Kenilworth in the North; and
WHEREAS, the negative effects of foreclosure include the decline in property values, loss of home
equity for both a foreclosed homeowner and neighboring homeowners; an increase in crime, vandalism,
insurance rates; and disinvestment of commercial retailers; and
WHEREAS, the stress of foreclosure can take an emotional toll and lead to serious physical and mental
health issues, such as high blood pressure, depression, feelings of worthlessness, lack of motivation, and
embarrassment; and
WHEREAS, the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America (NACA), a non-profit community
advocacy and HUD certified counseling agency which has been in the forefront of fighting discriminatory
and predatory lending for over 20 years, appreciates the current mortgage and foreclosure crisis and has
been proactive in answering our nation and communities’ prayers for relief and action; and
WHEREAS, just two months ago, in July of 2008, NACA successfully hosted its “Save the Dream”
massive loan restructure event in Washington, D.C. which attracted over 25,000 people and assisted
approximately 7,000 homeowners in renegotiating and restructuring their existing mortgages with their
current lenders to fixed interest rates and affordable payments; in many instances, mortgages were
renegotiated to fixed interest rates as low as 3.25% for the remaining term of the loan; and
WHEREAS, NACA has expanded its “Save the Dream” massive loan restructure campaign to Cook
County, Illinois, and on October 18, 2008 will begin hosting a two day mortgage restructure event at
McCormick Place; and
WHEREAS, President Stroger believes in the mission of NACA and has partnered Cook County with
NACA in an effort to provide assistance and relief to Cook County homeowners in mortgage distress; and
WHEREAS, Cook County, Illinois and NACA will host fourteen orientations for the “Save the Dream”
loan restructure event between Saturday, September 13, 2008 and Sunday, October 26, 2008; the
orientations have been scheduled in all areas of Cook County, Illinois; and
WHEREAS, the mortgage and foreclosure crisis cannot be addressed by homeowner relief non-profits,
like NACA, alone; all units of governments, which are duty bound to provide for the public welfare, must
do their part and be proactive in answering our nation and communities’ prayers for relief and action; and

7248

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 17, 2008
WHEREAS, governments like the states of Massachusetts, Michigan, New York and Ohio have been
proactive in addressing the mortgage foreclosure crisis and are attempting to provide homeowner
assistance through various forms of relief; and
WHEREAS, the mortgage and foreclosure crisis cannot be addressed by non-profits and governments
alone; the financial community, specifically mortgage lenders, predatory and otherwise, who have
contributed to the mortgage and foreclosure crisis, must also do their part and be proactive in answering
our nation and communities’ prayers for relief and action.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
Board of Commissioners hereby recognizes, appreciates, and supports the work of NACA and wishes
NACA great success in its “Save the Dream” massive loan restructure event at McCormick Place; and,
further wishes NACA great success in assisting Cook County, Illinois homeowners in realizing dearly
needed mortgage relief; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners supports Cook County, Illinois’
partnership with NACA and Cook County, Illinois’ participation in the “Save the Dream” loan restructure
event orientations and the McCormick Place workshop; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners, in encouraging government to do its
part and be proactive in answering our nation and communities’ prayers for relief and action, calls upon
the Executive and Legislative branches of the government of the State of Illinois to enact a moratorium on
foreclosures in the State of Illinois; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and the Board of Commissioners, in encouraging
other government agencies to assist the County in doing its part, calls upon any and all Cook County
elected officials who are directly or indirectly involved in the foreclosure process to provide homeowners,
in jeopardy of foreclosure, information regarding their options; and, respectfully requests that said Cook
County elected officials distribute information provided by the President and the Board of Commissioners
regarding the President and NACA’s orientations and the McCormick Place “Save the Dream” loan
restructure event, and information listing non-profits whose missions are to assist homeowners in
jeopardy of foreclosure; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners, in encouraging the financial
community, specifically mortgage lenders, to do their part and be proactive in answering our nation and
communities’ prayers for relief and action, shall consider divesting all Cook County funds from any and
all mortgage lenders who have not committed themselves to the mission of homeowner relief; and, further
calls upon the financial community to do its part in helping homeowners “Save the Dream”.
Approved and adopted this 17th day of September 2008.

County for which its full faith and credit is pledged. Nothing contained in this
Section shall limit or restrict the authority of the President or the Chief Financial
Officer to enter into similar agreements pursuant to prior or subsequent
authorization of the Corporate Authorities.

County nor the Trustee shall have any responsibility or obligation with respect to (a) the accuracy of the

7300

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 17, 2008
records of the Depository, the Book Entry Owner, or any Depository Participant with respect to any
ownership interest in the Bonds; (b) the delivery to any Depository Participant or any other person, other
than a registered owner of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register or as expressly provided in the
Representations Letter, of any notice with respect to the Bonds, including any notice of redemption; or
(c) the payment to any Depository Participant or any other person, other than a registered owner of a
Bond as shown in the Bond Register, of any amount with respect to principal of or interest on, or Maturity
Amount of, the Bonds. No person other than a registered owner of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register
shall receive a Bond certificate with respect to any Bond. In the event that (x) the County determines that
the Depository is incapable of discharging its responsibilities described herein or in the Representations
Letter, (y) the agreement among the County and the Depository evidenced by the Representations Letter

County or of the beneficial owners of the Bonds that they be able to obtain certificated Bonds; the County
shall notify the Depository of the availability of Bond certificates, and the Bonds shall no longer be
restricted to being registered in the Bond Register to the Book Entry Owner. The County may determine
at such time that the Bonds shall be registered in the name of and deposited with a successor depository
operating a book entry only system, as may be acceptable to the County, or such depository’s agent or
designee, but if the County does not select such successor depository, then the Bonds shall be registered
in whatever name or names registered owners of Bonds transferring or exchanging Bonds shall designate,
in accordance with the provisions hereof.
Sec. 5.

Redemption.

A.
Mandatory Redemption. If so provided in the relevant Bond Order or Indenture, any
Bonds may be issued as Term Bonds and be subject to mandatory redemption by operation of the Bond
Fund, in the case of Current Interest Bonds or Variable Rate Bonds, at a price of par, without premium,
plus accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption, and in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds at a
price of Compound Accreted Value calculated to the date fixed for redemption, on November 15 (or such
other date as s may be provided in the relevant Bond Order) of the years and in the amounts as shall be set
forth in the relevant Bond Order. The County covenants that it will redeem Term Bonds pursuant to the
mandatory redemption requirement for such Term Bonds and provide Pledged Taxes accordingly.
In connection with any mandatory redemption of Bonds as authorized above, the principal
amounts of such Bonds to be mandatorily redeemed in each year may be reduced through the earlier
optional redemption thereof, with any partial optional redemptions of such Bonds credited against future
mandatory redemption requirements in such order of the mandatory redemption dates as the Chief
Financial Officer may determine. In the absence of such determination, partial optional redemptions of
such Bonds shall be credited against future mandatory redemption requirements in inverse chronological
order of such payments beginning with the amount scheduled to become due at Stated Maturity, then the
amount subject to mandatory redemption in the year preceding Stated Maturity, and so on. In addition, on
or prior to the sixtieth (60th) day preceding any mandatory redemption date, the Trustee may, and if
directed by the Chief Financial Officer shall, purchase Bonds of such maturities in an amount not
exceeding the amount of such Bonds required to be retired on such mandatory redemption date and at a
price not exceeding par plus accrued interest. Any such Bonds so purchased shall be cancelled and the
principal amount thereof shall be credited against the payment required on such next mandatory
redemption date.
The County shall provide the Trustee with written notice of such reduction, which notice shall be
given within thirty (30) days after such redemption or purchase, and the Trustee shall promptly give
written notice of the same to the Bondholders, in the manner hereinafter provided.

7301

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 17, 2008
B.
Optional Redemption. If so provided in the relevant Bond Order or Indenture, any Bonds
may be redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the County, in whole or in part on any date, at such
times and at such redemption prices (to be expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of Current
Interest Bonds or Variable Rate Bonds to be redeemed and as a percentage of the Compound Accreted
Value of Capital Appreciation Bonds to be redeemed) not to exceed one hundred three percent
(103.00%), plus, in the case of Current Interest Bonds or Variable Rate Bonds, accrued interest to the date
of redemption, as determined by the Chief Financial Officer at the time of the sale thereof. If less than all
of the Outstanding Bonds of a Series are to be optionally redeemed, the Bonds to be called shall be called
from such Series, in such principal amounts and from such maturities as may be determined by the
County and within any maturity by in the manner hereinafter provided. The terms and provisions for any
redemption of Variable Rate Bonds shall be as determined by the Chief Financial Officer at the time of
sale of the Bonds and as set forth in a relevant Indenture, provided that such terms shall be within the
limitations set forth in this Section.
C.
Redemption Procedure. The Bonds subject to redemption shall be identified, notice
given, and paid and redeemed pursuant to the procedures as follows.
1.

Redemption Notice. For a mandatory redemption of Term Bonds, unless otherwise
notified by the County, the Trustee shall proceed to redeem the Term Bonds without any
further order or direction from the County hereunder or otherwise. For an optional
redemption, the County shall, at least forty-five (45) days prior to any optional
redemption date (unless a shorter time period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify
the Trustee of such redemption date and of the principal amount and maturities of Bonds
to be redeemed.

2.

Selection of Bonds within a Maturity. Current Interest Bonds shall be redeemed only in
the principal amount of $5,000 each and integral multiples thereof, and Capital
Appreciation Bonds shall be redeemed only in amounts representing $5,000 Maturity
Amount and integral multiples thereof. For purposes of any redemption of less than all of
the Bonds of a single maturity, the particular Bonds or portions of Bonds to be redeemed
shall be selected by lot by the Trustee for the Bonds of such maturity by such method of
lottery as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate; provided, that such lottery shall
provide for the selection for redemption of Bonds or portions thereof so that each $5,000
principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) of such Bond shall be as likely to
be called for redemption as any other such $5,000 Bond or $5,000 portion. The Trustee
shall make such selection (a) upon or prior to the time of the giving of official notice of
redemption, or (b) in the event of a refunding or defeasance, upon advice from the
County that certain Bonds have been refunded or defeased and are no longer Outstanding
as defined.

3.

Official Notice of Redemption. The Trustee shall promptly notify the County in writing
of the Bonds or portions of Bonds selected for redemption and, in the case of any Bond
selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Unless
waived by the registered owner of Bonds to be redeemed, official notice of any such
redemption shall be given by the Trustee on behalf of the County by mailing the
redemption notice by first class U.S. mail not less than thirty (30) days and not more than
sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for redemption to each registered owner of the
Bond or Bonds to be redeemed at the address shown on the Bond Register or at such
other address as is furnished in writing by such registered owner to the Trustee. All
official notices of redemption shall include the name of the Bonds and at least the
information as follows:

7302

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 17, 2008
(a)

the redemption date;

(b)

the redemption price;

(c)

if less than all of the outstanding Bonds of a Series and of a particular maturity
are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of
Bonds of a Series within such maturity, the respective principal amounts) of the
Bonds to be redeemed;

(d)

a statement that on the redemption date the redemption price will become due
and payable upon each such Bond or portion thereof called for redemption and
that interest thereon shall cease to accrue from and after said date; and

(e)

the place where such Bonds are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption
price, which place of payment shall be the office designated for that purpose of
the Trustee.

4.

Conditional Redemption. Unless moneys sufficient to pay the redemption price of the
Bonds to be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee prior to the giving of such
notice of redemption, such notice may, at the option of the County, state that said
redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt of such moneys by the Trustee on or
prior to the date fixed for redemption. If such moneys are not received, such notice shall
be of no force and effect, the County shall not redeem such Bonds, and the Trustee shall
give notice, in the same manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such
moneys were not so received and that such Bonds will not be redeemed.

5.

Bonds Shall Become Due. Official notice of redemption having been given as described,
the Bonds or portions of Bonds so to be redeemed shall, subject to the stated condition in
paragraph 4. immediately preceding, on the redemption date, become due and payable at
the redemption price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the County
shall default in the payment of the redemption price) such Bonds or portions of Bonds
shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of such Bonds for redemption in accordance
with said notice, such Bonds shall be paid by the Trustee at the redemption price. The
procedure for the payment of interest due as part of the redemption price shall be as
herein provided for payment of interest otherwise due.

6.

Insufficiency in Notice Not Affecting Other Bonds; Failure to Receive Notice; Waiver.
Neither the failure to mail such redemption notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed,
to any particular registered owner of a Bond, shall affect the sufficiency of such notice
with respect to other registered owners. Notice having been properly given, failure of a
registered owner of a Bond to receive such notice shall not be deemed to invalidate, limit
or delay the effect of the notice or redemption action described in the notice. Such notice
may be waived in writing by a registered owner of a Bond entitled to receive such notice,
either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.
Waivers of notice by registered owners shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing
shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such
waiver. In lieu of the foregoing official notice, so long as the Bonds are held in book
entry form, notice may be given as provided in the Representation Letter, and the giving
of such notice shall constitute a waiver by the Depository and the book entry owner, as
registered owner, of the foregoing notice. After giving proper notification of redemption
to the Trustee, as applicable, the County shall not be liable for any failure to give or
defect in notice.

7303

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 17, 2008

Sec. 6.

7.

New Bond in Amount Not Redeemed. Upon surrender for any partial redemption of any
Bond, there shall be prepared for the registered owner a new Bond or Bonds of like
Series and tenor, of Authorized Denominations, of the same maturity, and bearing the
same rate of interest in the amount of the unpaid principal.

8.

Effect of Nonpayment upon Redemption. If any Bond or portion of Bond called for
redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, in the case of
Current Interest Bonds, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from the redemption
date at the rate borne by the Bond or portion of Bond so called for redemption; in the case
of Variable Rate Bonds, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest as provided in a
relevant Indenture; and, in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, the Compound
Accreted Value at such redemption date shall continue to accrue interest from such
redemption date at the Yield to Maturity borne by such Capital Appreciation Bond, or
portion thereof, so called for redemption.

9.

Bonds to Be Cancelled; Payment to Identify Bonds. All Bonds which have been
redeemed shall be cancelled and destroyed by the Trustee and shall not be reissued.
Upon the payment of the redemption price of Bonds being redeemed, each check or other
transfer of funds issued for such purpose shall bear the CUSIP number identifying, by
issue and maturity, the Bonds being redeemed with the proceeds of such check or other
transfer.

10.

Additional Notice. The County agrees to provide such additional notice of redemption as
it may deem advisable at such time as it determines to redeem Bonds, taking into account
any requirements or guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board, the Government Accounting Standards Board, or any other
federal or state agency having jurisdiction or authority in such matters; provided,
however, that such additional notice shall be (a) advisory in nature, (b) solely in the
discretion of the County (unless a separate agreement shall be made), (c) not be a
condition precedent of a valid redemption or a part of the Bond contract, and (d) any
failure or defect in such notice shall not delay or invalidate the redemption of Bonds for
which proper official notice shall have been given. Reference is also made to the
provisions of the Continuing Disclosure Undertaking of the County with respect to the
Bonds, which may contain other provisions relating to notice of redemption of Bonds.

11.

Trustee to Advise County. As part of its duties hereunder, the Trustee shall prepare and
forward to the County a statement as to notices given with respect to each redemption
together with copies of the notices as mailed.
Registration of Bonds; Persons Treated as Owners; Bonds Lost, Destroyed, Etc.

The County shall cause the Bond Register to be kept at the office maintained for the purpose by
the Trustee, which is hereby constituted and appointed the Registrar of the County. The County is
authorized to prepare, and the Trustee shall keep custody of, multiple Bond blanks executed by the
County for use in the transfer and exchange of Bonds.

7304

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 17, 2008
Subject to the provisions hereof relating to the Bonds in Book Entry Form, any Bond may be
transferred or exchanged, but only in the manner, subject to the limitations of and upon payment of the
charges as set forth in this Ordinance. Upon surrender for transfer of any Bond at the office maintained
for the purpose by the Trustee, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments
of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and duly executed by, the registered owner or his or her
attorney duly authorized in writing, the County shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate, date and
deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees (i) in the case of any Capital Appreciation Bond, a new
fully registered Capital Appreciation Bond or Bonds of the same Series and of the same Stated Maturity
of Authorized Denominations, for a like aggregate Original Principal Amount or (ii) in the case of any
Current Interest Bond or Variable Rate Bond, a new fully registered Bond or Bonds of the same Series of
the same tenor, of the same interest rate and Stated Maturity, of Authorized Denominations, for a like
aggregate principal amount. Subject to the provisions of this Ordinance relating to Book Entry Form any
Capital Appreciation Bond or Bonds may be exchanged at said office of the Trustee or its proper agent for
a like aggregate Original Principal Amount of Capital Appreciation Bond or Bonds of the same Series and
maturity of other Authorized Denominations; and any fully registered Current Interest Bond or Bonds or
Variable Rate Bond or Bonds may be exchanged at said office of the Trustee or its proper agent for a like
aggregate principal amount of such Bonds of the same tenor, of the same Series, interest rate and Stated
Maturity, of other Authorized Denominations.
The Trustee shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Bond during the period from the
close of business on the Regular Record Date for an interest payment to the opening of business on such
interest payment date or during the period of fifteen (15) days preceding the giving of notice of
redemption of Bonds or to transfer or exchange any Bond all or a portion of which has been called for
redemption.
The execution by the County of any fully registered Bond shall constitute full and due
authorization of such Bond, and the Trustee or its proper agent shall thereby be authorized to authenticate,
date and deliver such Bond in accordance with the terms of this Ordinance and of any Indenture;
provided, however, the principal amount of Bonds of each Series and maturity authenticated by the
Trustee shall not at any one time exceed the authorized principal amount of Bonds for such Series and
maturity less the amount of such Bonds which have been paid.
The person in whose name any Bond shall be registered shall be deemed and regarded as the
absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and payment of the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on
or any Maturity Amount of any Bond shall be made only to or upon the order of the registered owner
thereof or his or her legal representative. All such payments shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and
discharge the liability upon such Bond to the extent of the sum or sums so paid.
No service charge shall be made for any transfer or exchange of Bonds, but the County or the
Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Bonds exchanged in the case of the issuance of
a Bond or Bonds for the outstanding portion of a Bond surrendered for redemption.
If any Bond, whether in temporary or definitive form, is lost (whether by reason of theft or
otherwise), destroyed (whether by mutilation, damage, in whole or in part, or otherwise) or improperly
cancelled, the Trustee or its proper agent may authenticate a new Bond of like Series, date, maturity date,
interest rate (or, in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, Yield to Maturity), denomination and Original
Principal Amount (in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds) or principal amount (in the case of other
Bonds) and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding; provided that (a) in the case of any
mutilated Bond, such mutilated Bond shall first be surrendered to the Trustee, and (b) in the case of any
lost Bond or Bond destroyed in whole, there shall be first furnished to the Trustee evidence of such loss

7305

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 17, 2008
or destruction, together with indemnification of the County and the Trustee, satisfactory to the Trustee. In
the event any lost, destroyed or improperly cancelled Bond shall have matured or is about to mature, or
has been called for redemption, instead of issuing a duplicate Bond, the Trustee shall pay the same
without surrender thereof if there shall be first furnished to the Trustee evidence of such loss, destruction
or cancellation, together with indemnity, satisfactory to it. Upon the issuance of any substitute Bond, the
Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that
may be imposed in relation thereto.
Sec. 7.

Security

The full faith and credit of the County are hereby irrevocably pledged to the punctual payment of
the principal of, interest on and Maturity Amount of the Bonds. The Bonds shall be direct and general
obligations of the County and the County shall be obligated and hereby covenants and agrees to levy ad
valorem taxes upon all the taxable property in the County for the payment of the Bonds and the interest
thereon, without limitation as to rate or amount. The County hereby pledges, as equal and ratable security
for the Bonds, all present and future proceeds of the Pledged Taxes on deposit in the Bond Fund for the
sole benefit of the registered owners of the Bonds, subject to the right, hereby expressly reserved by the
County, to transfer certain interest income or investment profit earned in the Bond Fund to other funds of
the County.
Sec. 8.

Forms of Bonds.

The Current Interest Bonds and the Capital Appreciation Bonds shall be in substantially the forms
hereinafter set forth; provided, however, that if the text of the Bonds is to be printed in its entirety on the
front side of the Bonds, then the second paragraph on the front side and the legend “See Reverse Side for

Indenture.
Sec. 9.

Taxes Levied; Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest; Covenants re Pledged
Taxes; Ordinance and Bond Orders to be Filed; Abatement

A.
Taxes Levied. For the purpose of providing the funds required to pay the principal of and
interest on, or Maturity Amount of, the Bonds promptly as the same become due, there is hereby levied
upon all taxable property in the County, a direct annual tax sufficient for those purposes in addition to all
other taxes, for the years and in the amounts as shall be provided in each relevant Bond Order, which
amounts, when aggregated with (i) for any Series of Refunding Bonds, the receipts, if any, of taxes levied
and collected for the payment of Refunded Bonds, (ii) any accrued interest received on the sale of a Series
of Bonds, and (iii) any proceeds of a Series of Bonds available to pay capitalized interest on said Series of
Bonds, shall be sufficient to pay principal of and interest on the Bonds. For this purpose, interest to
accrue on Variable Rate Bonds shall be deemed to be that rate which, in the reasonable estimation of the
Chief Financial Officer as she may from time to time determine, will be sufficient to pay principal of and
interest on such Variable Rate Bonds when due.
B.
Payment of Principal, Interest and Maturity Amount. Subject to the right reserved by the
County under Section 7 of this Ordinance to transfer investment income, the Bond Moneys shall be
applied by the Trustee to pay principal of and interest on, or Maturity Amount of, the Bonds.

there are insufficient funds on hand from the Pledged Taxes to pay the same shall be paid promptly when
due from current funds on hand in advance of the collection of the Pledged Taxes herein levied which
funds are hereby appropriated for such purpose as necessary; and when the Pledged Taxes shall have been
collected, reimbursement shall be made to said funds in the amount so advanced.
C.
Covenants re Pledged Taxes. The County covenants and agrees with the purchasers and
registered owners of the Bonds that so long as any of the Bonds remain outstanding, the County will take
no action or fail to take any action which in any way would adversely affect the ability of the County to
levy and collect the Pledged Taxes. The County and its officers will comply with all present and future
applicable laws in order to assure that the Pledged Taxes may be levied, extended and collected as
provided herein and deposited into the Bond Fund. With respect to Variable Rate Bonds, in furtherance
of the general obligation full faith and credit pledge of the County to the punctual payment of the
principal of and interest on the Bonds set forth in Section 7 of this Ordinance, the County will take all
actions necessary to levy in addition to the taxes described above, any direct annual tax required in excess
of that levied in this Ordinance for collection on a timely basis to make all payments of the principal of
and interest on such Variable Rate Bonds.
D.
Ordinance and Bond Orders to be Filed. A copy of this Ordinance, together with a
subsequent copy of each Bond Order, duly certified by the County Clerk, shall be filed in the office of the
County Clerk, and such filings shall constitute the authority for and it shall be the duty of said County
Clerk, in each year as aforesaid, to extend the taxes levied pursuant to this Section and said Bond Order(s)
for collection, such taxes to be in addition to and in excess of all other taxes heretofore or hereafter
authorized to be levied by the County on its behalf.
E.
Abatement. Whenever and only when other funds from any lawful source are made
available for the purpose of paying any principal of and interest on, or Maturity Amount of. the Bonds, so
as to enable the abatement of the Pledged Taxes levied herein for the payment of same, the Corporate
Authorities shall, by proper proceedings, direct the deposit of such funds into the Bond Fund and further
shall direct the abatement of the Pledged Taxes by the amount so deposited. A certified copy or other
notification of any such proceedings abating taxes may then be filed with the County Clerk in a timely
manner to effect such abatement.
Except as may be otherwise provided in a relevant Bond Order or Indenture, at any time and from
time to time as the Chief Financial Officer shall determine to be necessary or advisable, the Chief
Financial Officer is hereby expressly authorized, without further official action of the Corporate
Authorities, to abate any portion of the Pledged Taxes levied to pay principal of and interest on Variable
Rate Bonds, in the event and to the extent that the Chief Financial Officer shall determine that the
collection of such Pledged Taxes will not be necessary to provide for the timely payment of the principal
of and interest on such Variable Rate Bonds. The filing with the County Clerk of a certificate of
abatement, signed by the President and the Chief Financial Officer, shall constitute due authorization for
the County Clerk to effectuate such abatement.
Sec. 10.

Powers as to Bonds and Pledge.

The County is duly authorized to pledge the Pledged Taxes and other moneys, securities and
funds purported to be pledged by this Ordinance in the manner and to the extent provided in this
Ordinance. The Pledged Taxes and other moneys, securities and funds so pledged are and will be free
and clear of any pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance thereon or with respect thereto prior to, or of equal
rank with, the pledge created by this Ordinance. The County shall at all times, to the extent permitted by
law, defend, preserve and protect the pledge of the Pledged Taxes and other moneys, securities and funds
pledged under this Ordinance and all the rights thereto of the Bondholders under this Ordinance against

or deletions as such officers may determine, with no further official action of or
direction by the Corporate Authorities.

connection with the sale of general obligation bonds or notes, but with such revisions in text as the
President or the Chief Financial Officer shall determine are necessary or desirable, the execution thereof
by the President or the Chief Financial Officer to evidence the approval by the Corporate Authorities of
all such revisions. The annual fee paid to any financial institution that provides a Credit Facility shall not
exceed one and one-quarter percent (1.25%) of the average principal amount of such Bonds outstanding
during such annual period. The final form of reimbursement agreement entered into by the County with
respect to a Series of Bonds shall be attached to the relevant Bond Order filed with the County Clerk

the Bonds and shall be a general obligation of the County for the payment of which, both principal and
interest, the County pledges its full faith, credit and resources. Each such promissory note shall bear
interest at a rate not exceeding 18 percent per annum. The President or the Chief Financial Officer is
hereby authorized to execute and deliver each such reimbursement agreement, under the seal of the
County affixed and attached by the County Clerk.
In connection with any sale of a Series of the Bonds, the President or the Chief Financial Officer
is hereby further authorized to obtain a Policy from an Insurer if the Chief Financial Officer determines
such Policy to be desirable in connection with such sale of such Series of Bonds or any portion thereof.
The President or Chief Financial Officer is hereby expressly authorized, on behalf of the County, to make
such customary covenants and agreements with such Insurer as are not inconsistent with the provisions of
this Ordinance, as may be required by such bond insurer, including as follows:
(i)

Consent to Amendments. That any provision of this Ordinance expressly
recognizing or granting rights in or to any such Insurer or to Bondholders
generally may not be amended in any manner which affects the rights of the
Insurer or Bondholders generally without the prior written consent of the Insurer.

7310

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 17, 2008
(ii)

Notices. That the County may be required to furnish to the Bond Insurer
information or notices.

(iii)

List of Permitted Investments. That the investment of moneys in the various

required by the Insurer; provided, however, such list shall include direct
obligations of the United States of America and shares in the Public Treasurers’
Investment Pool.

(iv)

Non-Defeasance and Subrogation. That in the event that the principal and/or
interest due on the Bonds shall be paid by the Insurer pursuant to a Policy, the
Bonds shall remain outstanding for all purposes, not be defeased or otherwise
satisfied and not be considered paid by the City, and the pledge of Net Revenue
and all covenants, agreements and other obligations of the City to the
Bondholders shall continue to exist and shall run to the benefit of the Insurer, and
the Insurer shall be subrogated to the rights of such Bondholders.

(v)

Payment Procedure Pursuant to Policy. That so long as the Policy shall be in full
force and effect, the City and any Paying Agent and Bond Registrar agree to
comply with such reasonable timing and notice procedures to properly effectuate
Bond payment.

(vi)

Control of Proceedings; Vote in Plan. That so long as the Policy shall be in full
force and effect and not in default, the Insurer may exercise the rights of the
registered owners of the Bonds in connection with the enforcement of all rights
and remedies, and may vote the interests of the owners of such bonds in
connection with bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency plan or proceeding.

I.
Qualified Swap Agreements. The President or the Chief Financial Officer is hereby
authorized to execute and deliver from time to time one or more Qualified Swap Agreements with Swap
Providers selected by the Chief Financial Officer, the purpose of which is to hedge or manage the
County’s interest cost with respect to the Bonds (or any portion thereof), or to reduce the County’s
exposure to fluctuations in the interest rate or rates payable on the Bonds or to insure, protect or preserve
its investments from any loss (including, without limitation, loss caused by fluctuations in interest rates,
markets or in securities). The stated aggregate notional amount under all such Qualified Swap
Agreements authorized hereunder shall not exceed the principal amount of the Bonds issued hereunder
(net of offsetting transactions entered into by the County). Any such Qualified Swap Agreement to the
extent practicable shall be in substantially the form of either the Local Currency - Single Jurisdiction
version or the Multicurrency-Cross Border version of the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement accompanied by
a schedule based upon the U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule published by the International Swap
Dealers Association (the “ISDA”) or any successor form to be published by the ISDA, and in the
appropriate confirmations of transactions governed by that agreement, with such insertions, completions
and modifications thereof as shall be approved by the officer of the County executing the same, her
execution to constitute conclusive evidence of the Corporate Authorities’ approval of such insertions,
completions and modifications thereof. Interest Rate Exchange Obligations or other amounts payable by
the County under any such Qualified Swap Agreement (being, collectively, “Swap Payments”) shall
constitute operating expenses of the County payable from any moneys, revenues, receipts, income, assets
or funds of the County available for such purpose or be payable from the Pledged Taxes, as the Chief
Financial Officer may from time to time determine. Swap Payments shall not constitute an indebtedness
of the County for which its full faith and credit is pledged. Nothing contained in this Section shall limit
or restrict the authority of the President or the Chief Financial Officer to enter into similar agreements
pursuant to prior or subsequent authorization of the Corporate Authorities.

7311

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 17, 2008
Sec. 12.

Creation of Funds and Appropriations; Abatement of Taxes Levied for Refunded
Bonds.

A.
Bond Fund Created. There is hereby created the “General Obligation [Refunding]
Bonds, Series 200__, Bond Fund” (the “Bond Fund”), which shall be the fund for the payment of
principal of and interest on and Maturity Amount of the Bonds.
All receipts of the Pledged Taxes received by the County Collector shall be deposited daily, as far
as practicable, with the Trustee. All other moneys appropriated or used by the County for the payment of
the principal or redemption price of, and interest on, or Maturity Amount of, the Bonds shall be paid to
the Trustee. The Trustee shall be accountable only for moneys actually so deposited with the Trustee.
The Trustee is hereby expressly authorized to establish such accounts within the Bond Fund as shall be
necessary to account for the Pledged Taxes levied for each Series of Bonds issued hereunder. All Pledged
Taxes, and all such moneys, shall be deposited by the Trustee into the Bond Fund.
The County Treasurer and the County Collector are hereby expressly authorized and directed to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to provide for the prompt deposit with the Trustee, in
accordance with this Ordinance, of all Pledged Taxes.
The Bond Fund shall be held and maintained as a separate and segregated account by the Trustee.
The Trustee may create Accounts within the Bond Fund as necessary for any Series of Bonds as specified
in a relevant Bond Order or, for Variable Rate Bonds, as provided in a relevant Indenture. Accrued
interest, capitalized interest and premium, if any, received upon delivery of the Bonds shall be deposited
into the Bond Fund and be applied to pay first interest coming due on the Bonds.
The Pledged Taxes shall either be deposited into the Bond Fund and used solely and only for
paying the principal of and interest on or Maturity Amount of the Bonds or be used to reimburse a fund or
account from which advances to the Bond Fund may have been made to pay principal of or interest on or
Maturity Amount of the Bonds prior to receipt of Pledged Taxes. Interest income or investment profit
earned in the Bond Fund shall be retained in the Bond Fund for payment of the principal of and interest
on Current Interest Bonds and Variable Rate Bonds and Maturity Amount of Capital Appreciation Bonds
on the interest payment date next after such interest or profit is received or, to the extent lawful and as
determined by the Chief Financial Officer, transferred to such other funds as may be determined. On or
after such date as may be provided in a relevant Bond Order, capitalized interest, if any, deposited to and
remaining in the Bond Fund for any Variable Rate Bonds shall be transferred to such other funds or
accounts as the Chief Financial Officer shall determine or as may be provided in a relevant tax agreement
for any Tax Exempt Bonds.
B.
Project Funds Created. The amount of proceeds of the Bonds as shall be set forth in the
relevant Bond Order shall be set aside in one or more separate funds of the County, hereby created, and
designated as the “Public Safety Project Fund,” the “Health Fund Project Fund,” the “Corporate
Project Fund,” the “Capital Equipment Project Fund,” the “Insurance Reserve Fund” and the “Working
Cash Fund” (collectively, the “Project Funds”). Any Project Fund may further be divided into accounts
and designated the “Series ______ Bonds Project Account”(an “Account”). The Project Funds shall be
held and maintained as separate and segregated accounts by the Trustee. Moneys in the Project Funds
may be withdrawn or may be transferred among the Project Funds by the County to pay the costs of the
Projects upon requisition by the Chief Financial Officer or any other employee of the County designated
by the Chief Financial Officer.

7312

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 17, 2008
Alternatively, the Chief Financial Officer may allocate the proceeds of the Bonds to one or more
related project funds or accounts of the County already in existence; provided, however, that this shall not
relieve the County and such officer of the duty to account for the proceeds as if any Project Fund or
Account were created as herein provided. The County by its Corporate Authorities reserves the right, as it
becomes necessary from time to time, to change the purposes of expenditure of any Project Fund or its
accounts, to change priorities, to revise cost allocations between expenditures and to substitute projects, in
order to meet current needs of the County; subject, however, to the provisions of the Act and to the tax
covenants of the County relating to the Tax Exempt status of interest on Tax Exempt Bonds.
C.
Escrow Accounts. The sum necessary, as determined by the Chief Financial Officer, of
the principal proceeds of the Refunding Bonds together with such money in the debt service funds for the
Refunded Bonds as may be advisable for the purpose, shall be used to provide for the Refunding,
pursuant to the provisions of the relevant Escrow Agreement or Escrow Agreements. Any funds
remaining to the credit of the County pursuant to an Escrow Agreement upon the termination of the
Escrow Agreement shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to the County as directed by the Chief
Financial Officer.
D.
Expense Fund Created. The sum necessary, as determined by the Chief Financial
Officer, of the principal proceeds of the Bonds shall be deposited into a separate and segregated fund,
hereby created, to be known as the “Expense Fund” (the “Expense Fund”) and shall be disbursed upon
the delivery of the Bonds by the Trustee at the written direction of the Chief Financial Officer or shall be
used by the County to pay costs of issuance of the Bonds in accordance with normal County disbursement
procedures. Any funds remaining to the credit of the Expense Fund on the date which is six months
following the date of delivery of the Bonds shall be transferred to the County Treasurer for deposit into
such fund or account of the County as the Chief Financial Officer may direct.
E.
Investments. The moneys on deposit in the Bond Fund may be invested from time to
time by the Trustee at the written direction of the Chief Financial Officer in Qualified Investments. Any
such investments may be sold from time to time by the Trustee without further direction from the County
as moneys may be needed for the purposes for which the Bond Fund has been created. The moneys on
deposit in each Project Fund shall be invested from time to time by the Trustee at the written direction of
the Chief Financial Officer in any lawful investment for County funds. In addition, the Chief Financial
Officer shall direct the Trustee (which direction may be by telephonic or facsimile transmission by the
County to the Trustee and confirmed by facsimile transmission by the Trustee to the County) to sell such
investments when necessary to remedy any deficiency in the Bond Fund, any Project Fund or any
accounts created therein. All other investment earnings shall be attributed to the account for which the
investment was made.
F.
Deposits. All moneys (not including securities) held by the Trustee subject to the
provisions of this Section may be deposited by it, on demand or time deposit, in its banking department or
with such banks, national banking associations, trust companies, savings banks or savings and loan
associations, that are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as may be designated by the
President or the Chief Financial Officer. No such moneys shall be deposited with any such financial
institution in an amount exceeding 50 percent of the amount that an officer of such financial institution
shall certify to the Trustee and the Chief Financial Officer as the combined capital and surplus of such
financial institution. No such moneys shall be deposited or remain on deposit with any such financial
institution in excess of the amount insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,
unless (a) such financial institution shall have lodged with the trust department of the Trustee or with a
Federal Reserve Bank or branch or, with the written approval of the Trustee and the Chief Financial
Officer, pledged to some other financial institution for the benefit of the County and the holders of Bonds,
as collateral security for the moneys deposited, Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations having a

7313

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 17, 2008
market value (exclusive of accrued interest) at least equal to 100 percent of the amount of such moneys,
and (b) the Trustee shall have a perfected first lien in the Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations
serving as collateral, and such Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations shall be free from all third
party liens. The Trustee shall allow and credit interest on any such moneys held by it at such rate as it
customarily allows upon similar funds of similar size and under similar conditions or as required by law.
Interest in respect of moneys or on securities in any fund shall be credited in each case to the fund in
which such moneys or securities are held.
G.
Repurchase Agreements. The County may invest any moneys pursuant to a repurchase
agreement. Each repurchase agreement shall meet the requirements of the Public Funds Investment Act
of the State of Illinois, as amended, or be secured by Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations or such
Qualified Investments as may be specified in a relevant Bond Order, having a market value, marked to
market weekly, at least equal to 102 percent of the amount invested in the repurchase agreement plus
accrued interest. The Trustee shall at all times have a first lien in such Federal Obligations or Agency
Obligations perfected (i) by possession of certificated securities held by the Trustee or held by a third
party acting on behalf of the Trustee if the institution serving as Trustee is also the counterparty to the
repurchase agreement and is providing the collateral securities, or (ii) under the book-entry procedures
specified in 31 Code of Federal Regulations 306.1 et seq. or 31 Code of Federal Regulations 350.0 et seq.
The President or the Chief Financial Officer is hereby authorized to enter into, execute and deliver any
investment or repurchase agreement authorized by this Ordinance, and any additional documents as shall
be necessary to accomplish the purposes of any such agreement.
H.
Variable Rate Funds or Accounts. Other funds or accounts appropriate for Variable Rate
Bonds, such as a purchase fund to accommodate demands for purchase of such Bonds and the
remarketing of same to other Bond owners, may be created in the Indenture.
I.
Taxes Levied for Refunded Bonds. To the extent not theretofore abated and as determined
necessary by the Chief Financial Officer, the taxes previously levied and collected (or in the process of
collection) to pay the Refunded Bonds shall be used to effectuate the Refunding as provided in the
Escrow Agreement, or to the extent not needed due to the issuance of the Refunding Bonds, shall be
deposited into the Bond Fund and used to pay first interest coming due on the Bonds. Taxes previously
levied for the Refunded Bonds but not yet extended for collection shall be abated. The Chief Financial
Officer is hereby expressly authorized to file an abatement certificate with the County Clerk, without
further official action of the Corporate Authorities, to effectuate such abatement.
Sec. 13.

General Tax Covenants.

A.
Not Private Activity Bonds. None of the Tax Exempt Bonds is a “private activity bond”
as defined in Section 141(a) of the Code. In support of such conclusion, the County certifies, represents
and covenants as follows:
1.

No more than the portion allowable for Tax Exempt financings of the sale proceeds of
each Series of Tax Exempt Bonds, each considered separately, plus investment earnings
thereon, will be used, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in any Private Business
Use.

2.

The payment of more than the portion allowable for Tax Exempt financings of the
principal of or the interest on each Series of the Tax Exempt Bonds, each considered
separately, will not be, directly or indirectly (i) secured by any interest in (A) property
used or to be used in any Private Business Use or (B) payments in respect of such
property or (ii) on a present value basis, derived from payments in respect of property, or
borrowed money, used or to be used in any activity carried on by any person other than a
state or local governmental unit.

7314

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 17, 2008
3.

No more than the lesser of five percent of the sale proceeds of each Series of the Tax
Exempt Bonds and investment earnings thereon or $5,000,000 will be used, directly or
indirectly, to make or finance loans to any persons.

4.

No user of any portion of the Public Safety Fund Project, the Health Fund Project, the
Corporate Fund Project, or the Capital Equipment Project financed by Tax Exempt Bonds
(collectively, the “Infrastructure”) other than a state or local governmental unit will use
more than the portion of the Infrastructure, in the aggregate, which is allowable for Tax
Exempt Financings, on any basis other than the same basis as the general public; and no
person other than a state or local governmental unit will be a user of more than such
allowable portion of the Infrastructure, in the aggregate, as a result of (i) ownership, (ii)
actual or beneficial use pursuant to a lease or a management, service, incentive payment,
research or output contract, or (iii) any other similar arrangement, agreement or
understanding, whether written or oral.

5.

The County has not and will not enter into any arrangement that conveys to any person,
other than a state or local government unit, special legal entitlements to any portion of the
Infrastructure that is available for use by the general public. No person, other than a state
or local governmental unit, is receiving or will receive any special economic benefit from
use of any portion of the Infrastructure that is not available for use by the general public.

B.

Pertaining to Rebate.

The County further certifies and covenants as follows with respect to the requirements of
Section 148(f) of the Code, relating to the rebate of “excess arbitrage profits” (the “Rebate, the County
Requirement”) to the United States:
1.

Unless an applicable exception to the Rebate Requirement is available to the County will
meet the Rebate Requirement.

2.

Relating to applicable exceptions, any Designated Officer is hereby authorized to make
such elections under the Code as either such officer shall deem reasonable and in the best
interests of the County. If such election may result in a “penalty in lieu of rebate” as
provided in the Code, and such penalty is incurred (the “Penalty”), then the County shall
pay such Penalty.

3.

The Designated Officers are hereby expressly authorized and directed to cause to be
established, at such time and in such manner as they may deem necessary or appropriate
hereunder, a “200__ General Obligation Bonds Rebate [or Penalty, if applicable] Fund”
(the “148 Compliance Fund”) for the Tax Exempt Bonds, and such officers shall further,
not less frequently than annually, cause to be transferred to the 148 Compliance Fund the
amount determined to be the accrued liability under the Rebate Requirement or Penalty.
Said Designated Officers are hereby expressly authorized and directed to cause to be paid
to the U.S., without further order or direction from the Corporate Authorities, from time
to time as required, amounts sufficient to meet the Rebate Requirement or to pay the
Penalty.

4.

Interest earnings in the Bond Fund and any Project Fund are hereby authorized to be
transferred, without further order or direction from the Corporate Authorities, from time
to time as required, to the 148 Compliance Fund for the purposes herein provided; and
proceeds of the Tax Exempt Bonds and other lawfully available funds of the County are
also hereby authorized to be used to meet the Rebate Requirement or to pay the Penalty,
but only if necessary after application of investment earnings as aforesaid.

7315

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 17, 2008
Sec. 14.

Registered Form.

The County recognizes that Section 149 of the Code requires Tax Exempt Bonds to be issued and
to remain in fully registered form in order to be and remain Tax Exempt. In this connection, the County
agrees that it will not take any action to permit Tax Exempt Bonds to be issued in, or converted into,
bearer or coupon form.
Sec. 15.

Further Tax-Exemption Covenant.

The County agrees to comply with all provisions of the Code which, if not complied with by the
County, would cause Tax Exempt Bonds not to be Tax Exempt. In furtherance of the foregoing
provisions, but without limiting their generality, the County agrees: (a) through its officers, to make such
further specific covenants, representations as shall be truthful, and assurances as may be necessary or
advisable; (b) to comply with all representations, covenants and assurances contained in certificates or
agreements as may be prepared by Bond Counsel; (c) to consult with Bond Counsel and to comply with
such advice as may be given; (d) to file such forms, statements and supporting documents as may be
required and in a timely manner; and (e) if deemed necessary or advisable by its officers, to employ and
pay fiscal agents, Financial Advisors, attorneys and other persons to assist the County in such
compliance.
The County also certifies and further covenants with the Underwriters and registered owners of
the Tax Exempt Bonds from time to time outstanding that moneys on deposit in any fund or account in
connection with the Tax Exempt Bonds, whether or not such moneys were derived from the proceeds of
the sale of the Tax Exempt Bonds or from any other source, will not be used in a manner which will cause
the Tax Exempt Bonds to be “arbitrage bonds” within the meaning of Code Section 148 and any lawful
regulations promulgated thereunder, as the same presently exist or may from time to time hereafter be
amended, supplemented or revised.
The County further covenants that it will not take any action, or omit to take any action or permit
the taking or omission of any action within its control (including, without limitation, making or permitting
any use of the proceeds of the Tax Exempt Bonds) if taking, permitting or omitting to take such action
would cause any Tax Exempt Bond to be a private activity bond within the meaning of the Code or would
otherwise cause interest on the Tax Exempt Bonds to be included in the gross income of the recipients
thereof for federal income tax purposes. The County acknowledges that, in the event of an examination
by the Internal Revenue Service of the exemption from federal income taxation of interest on the Tax
Exempt Bonds, under present rules, the County may be treated as a “taxpayer” in the examination and
agrees that it will respond in a commercially reasonable manner to any inquiries from the Internal
Revenue Service in connection with such an examination.
Sec. 16.

Reimbursement.

None of the proceeds of the Tax Exempt Bonds will be used to pay, directly or indirectly, in
whole or in part, for an expenditure that has been paid by the County prior to the date hereof except
architectural, engineering costs or construction costs incurred prior to commencement of any of the Public
Safety Fund Project, the Health Fund Project, the Corporate Fund Project, and the Capital Equipment
Project or expenditures for which an intent to reimburse was properly declared under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.150-2. This Ordinance is in itself a declaration of official intent under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.150-2 as to all costs of the Public Safety Fund Project, the Health Fund Project, the
Corporate Fund Project, and the Capital Equipment Project paid after the date hereof and prior to issuance
of the Bonds.

7316

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 17, 2008
Sec. 17.

Opinion of Counsel Exception.

The County reserves the right to use or invest moneys in connection with the Bonds in any
manner, notwithstanding the tax-related covenants set forth in Sections 13 through 16 herein, provided,
that it shall first have received an opinion from Bond Counsel to the effect that such use or investment as
contemplated is valid and proper under applicable law and this Ordinance and that such use or investment
will not adversely affect the Tax Exempt status of the Tax Exempt Bonds.
Sec. 18.

Certain Rights Reserved to County.

The County reserves the rights as follows:
A.
The County reserves the right to provide one or more Credit Facilities, or a combination
thereof to secure the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on one or more Series of
Outstanding Bonds, or in the event owners of such Bonds have the right to require purchase thereof, to
secure the payment of the purchase price of such Bonds upon the demand of the owners thereof. In
connection with any such Credit Facilities, the County may execute and deliver an agreement setting forth
the conditions upon which drawings or advances may be made under such Credit Facilities and the
method by which the County will reimburse the issuer of such Credit Facilities for such drawings together
with interest thereon at such rate or rates and otherwise make payments as may be agreed upon by the
County and the issuer of such Credit Facilities. Any such obligation of the County to reimburse or
otherwise make payments to the issuer of such Credit Facilities securing a Series of Outstanding Bonds
shall constitute operating expenses of the County payable, from any moneys, revenues, receipts, income,
assets or funds of the County available for such purpose or be payable from the Pledged Taxes, as the
Chief Financial Officer may from time to time determine, under this Ordinance to the same extent as any
Series of Outstanding Bonds, and any and all amounts payable by the County to reimburse the issuer of
any such Credit Facilities, together with interest thereon, shall for purposes of this Ordinance be deemed
to constitute the payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on Outstanding Bonds. Such
amounts shall not constitute an indebtedness of the County for which its full faith and credit is pledged.
B.
(1) If the County shall enter into a Qualified Swap Agreement with a Swap Provider
requiring the County to pay fixed interest rate on a notional amount, or requiring the County to pay a
variable interest rate on a notional amount, and the County has made a determination that such Qualified
Swap Agreement was entered into for the purpose of providing substitute interest payments for
Outstanding Bonds of a particular maturity or maturities in a principal amount equal to the notional
amount of the Qualified Swap Agreement and so long as the Swap Provider under such Qualified Swap
Agreement is not in default under such Qualified Swap Agreement:
(a)

for purposes of any calculation of the principal of and interest of, or Maturity
Amount of, such Outstanding Bonds, the interest rate on the related Bonds of
such maturity or maturities shall be determined as if such Bonds bore interest at
the fixed interest rate or the variable interest rate, as the case may be, payable by
the County under such Qualified Swap Agreement;

(b)

any net payments required to be made by the County to the Swap Provider
pursuant to such Qualified Swap Agreement from Pledged Taxes shall be made
on a parity with payments due on other Outstanding Bonds from amounts on
deposit to the credit of the Bond Fund; and

7317

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 17, 2008
(c)

(2)

any net payments received by the County from the Swap Provider pursuant to
such Qualified Swap Agreement shall, so long as there is no deficiency in any
account requirement, be applied as directed by the Chief Financial Officer.

If the County shall enter into a swap agreement of the type generally described in
paragraph (B)(1) above that does not satisfy the requirements for qualification as a
Qualified Swap Agreement as a result of its failure to make the determination described
therein or otherwise, then:
(a)

the interest rate adjustment or assumptions referred to in paragraph (a) of said
subsection (B)(1) shall not be made;

(b)

any net payments required to be made by the County to the Swap Provider
pursuant to such swap agreement shall be made from any moneys, revenues,
receipts, income, assets or funds of the County available for such purpose or be
payable from the Pledged Taxes, as the Chief Financial Officer may from time to
time determine; and

(c)

any net payments received by the County from the Swap Provider pursuant to
such swap agreement may be treated as Pledged Taxes at the option of the
County and applied as directed by the Chief Financial Officer.

C.
With respect to any Series of Outstanding Bonds, the County may provide for a
subaccount of the Bond Fund securing solely such Series, and such Series shall then have no claim on any
other cash or assets in or of the Bond Fund.
Sec. 19.

Indentures.

Any Indenture for Variable Rate Bonds shall conform as fully as may be practicable to the
provisions of Sections 20 to 46, inclusive, hereof, but need not be identical, giving effect to the unique
features of such Bonds. In addition, the provisions of this Ordinance relating to the following matters are
subject to different provisions that may be contained in an Indenture for Variable Rate Bonds:

Sec. 20.

(a)

the definition of, and rights and remedies related to, Events of Default;

(b)

the rights and duties of the Trustee and any agents thereof; and

(c)

notices to and consents of registered owners of Variable Rate Bonds.

Payment and Discharge; Refunding.

Variable Rate Bonds shall be subject to payment, provision for payment and defeasance as
provided in a relevant Indenture. Current Interest Bonds and Capital Appreciation Bonds may be
discharged, payment provided for, and the County’s liability terminated as follows:

7318

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 17, 2008
(a)
Discharge of Indebtedness. If (i) the County shall pay or cause to be paid to the
registered owners of the Bonds the principal, premium, if any, and interest, in the case of Current Interest
Bonds, and the Maturity Amount, in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, to become due thereon at the
times and in the manner stipulated therein and herein, (ii) all fees and expenses of the Trustee shall have
been paid, and (iii) the County shall keep, perform and observe all and singular the covenants and
promises in the Bonds and in this Ordinance expressed as to be kept, performed and observed by it or on
its part, then these presents and the rights hereby granted shall cease, determine and be void. If the
County shall pay or cause to be paid to the registered owners of all Outstanding Bonds of a particular
Series, or of a particular maturity within a Series, the principal, premium, if any, and interest, in the case
of Current Interest Bonds, and the Maturity Amount, in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, to
become due thereon at the times and in the manner stipulated therein and herein, such Bonds shall cease
to be entitled to any lien, benefit or security under the Ordinance, and all covenants, agreements and
obligations of the County to the holders of such Bonds shall thereupon cease, terminate and become void
and discharged and satisfied.
(b)
Provision for Payment. Bonds for the payment or redemption or prepayment of which
sufficient monies or sufficient Defeasance Obligations shall have been deposited with the Trustee or an

sufficiency being determined as provided in paragraph (b) hereof) for the retirement of any particular
Bond or Bonds, all liability of the County in respect of such Bond or Bonds shall cease, determine and be
completely discharged and the holders thereof shall thereafter be entitled only to payment out of the
money and the proceeds of the Defeasance Obligations deposited with aforesaid for their payment.
Sec. 21.

Duties of Trustee.

(a)
Subject to a different provision in an Indenture for Variable Rate Bonds, if the Trustee

required to have a notification system in place to inform crime victims and
witnesses regarding release from custody or transfer activity of persons held

SELECTION COMMITTEE’S CHOICE FOR INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR
GENERAL. Transmitting a Communication, dated July 31, 2008 from Todd H. Stroger,
President, Cook County Board of Commissioners:
The correspondence from the Independent Inspector General Selection Committee (the
“Committee”) transmits the identity of its selection for the Office of Independent
Inspector General. The Committee has selected Mr. Patrick Blanchard.
As stated in the Committee’s correspondence, the Committee interviewed the three (3)
candidates, set forth in the Cook County Bar Association/Chicago Bar Association Joint
Search Committee’s (the “Joint Search Committee”) Candidate List, on Wednesday, July
30, 2008, and selected Mr. Patrick Blanchard by a majority vote of the Committee. The
Committee’s correspondence also notes State’s Attorney Devine’s abstention from the
voting process.
Pursuant to § 2-282(b)(1)(b) of the Independent Inspector General Ordinance (the
“Ordinance”), I hereby submit the Committee’s selection for the office of Independent
Inspector General for your consideration at the County Board meeting scheduled for
Wednesday, September 3, 2008.
Pursuant to § 2-282(b)(1)(c) of the Ordinance, the Board of Commissioners must call a
vote for Mr. Patrick Blanchard’s appointment to the Office of Independent Inspector
General no later than Wednesday, September 17, 2008.
Please note that the office of Independent Inspector General is not a Presidential
Appointment; rather, the Committee has recommended Mr. Patrick Blanchard to you, the
Cook County Board of Commissioners, according to the independent selection process
set forth in the Ordinance.
As you will recall, in an effort to bring about transparency and accountability, I
voluntarily removed myself from the appointment process set forth in the Ordinance
which I sponsored. The appointment and selection process required the Cook County Bar
Association and the Chicago Bar Association to submit, to me, a Candidate List naming
three (3) duly qualified candidates. The bar associations conducted a national search with
the assistance of Hudson Recruitment and Talent Management; Hudson reviewed greater
than three hundred twenty-eight (328) applications and résumés, from which Hudson
created a subgroup of one hundred sixteen (116) highly qualified candidates. Hudson
conducted additional screening and interviews of the highly qualified subgroup and
created a slate of eleven (11) extremely qualified candidates from which the bar
associations selected the members of the Candidate List.
Upon my receipt of the Candidate List from the bar associations, and in accordance with
§ 2-282(b)(1)(b) of the Ordinance, I publicly submitted the Candidate List to the
Committee, at the July 22, 2008 Board Meeting, for the Committee’s review, interview,
and selection of a candidate to be submitted to the full Board of Commissioners.

addiction and crime, and facilitate the probationers’ successful reintegration into the community.
Program outcomes will be carefully measured in compliance with the department’s evaluation protocols.
The grant requires cash matching funds from Cook County in the amount of $54,782.00 and therefore are
requesting that matching funds be appropriated in the 2009 budget in Probation Fees 532-818 Account,

JAMES M. HOULIHAN, Cook County Assessor
by
MICHAEL A. STONE, Chief Deputy Assessor
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Accredited Chicago
Newspapers, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, for the publication of the state mandated publication of the proposed
assessed values for the 2009 real estate assessment in triennial townships in Cook County, within the City

assessments in townships in Cook County, within the City of Chicago, after publication of the initial
triennial assessment publication and for the publication of the 2009 triennial assessment list in additional
newspapers for additional public notification.
Reason:

Accredited Chicago Newspapers, Inc. has published the Cook County assessment records for
many years and has been the only vendor to submit a response after numerous attempts to
utilize the bidding process on this particular annual contract. The current Illinois State Statute
(35 ILCS 200/12-20) imposes strict guidelines as to who may publish the real estate
assessment records in the triennial and non-triennial townships in Cook County, inside the
City of Chicago and, per County Ordinance, contracts such as these that require a high degree
of professional skill where the ability or fitness of the individual plays an important part for
this services. Due to the timely nature of publishing the assessment records and the above
state requirements, the Assessor’s Office deems it necessary to sole source this contract.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $987,121.00. Contract period: April 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010. (040240 Account). Requisition No. 90400003.

acquisition costs and maintain a junior lien on the real property. The HOME loan will be amortized over
a 40-year period at 1% interest rate. The County’s HOME program will receive annual principal and
interest payments of $113,785.22 which will be used for other HOME eligible activities.
The HOME applicant, Hispanic Housing Development Corporation (HHDC), is an Illinois Not-For-Profit
Corporation located in Chicago, Illinois, and has been in existence for over thirty years. Initially, HHDC
was founded to develop affordable housing within Latino communities throughout the City of Chicago.

affordable apartments in 36 developments for families and seniors. HHDC is actively involved in
residential preservation as evidenced by its participation in the MacArthur Foundation Residential
Preservation Initiative.

(50) low-income first time home buyers to purchase single-family housing that will serve as the family’s
primary residence.

greater) per household for income qualified persons. This loan will greatly assist applicants in the down

interest forgivable loans.
