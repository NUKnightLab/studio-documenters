Greg Huth, Department of Development, presented. Dale Miller asked when did the County make the
commitment to provide funding to support this event; commented that he did attend the event and feels
this was a good investment to put the County on the map in terms of this area of activity with attendance
of vendors worldwide. Nan Baker concurred with Mr. Miller’s comments; asked how staff workloads
impacted the timing of this submission for approval, as indicated in the response to Council’s advanced
questions, and how this has not been a factor in other types of similar requests. Lenora Lockett stated
that the overall heavy workload on the Office of Procurement and Diversity staff during this time, partially
contributed to the delay of this request as items are processed on a “first in – first out” basis and provided
a timeline of the approval dates of all reviewers of this item. Ms. Lockett said that she can only speak to
the delays in the Office of Procurement and Diversity and cannot comment on any delays from other
reviewers. Ms. Baker asked that future requests be submitted in advance of the events so that the Board
is not asked to approve funding after services were provided. Ms. Lockett agreed with Ms. Baker’s
comment and stated that this should not be an issue with the new Enterprise Resource Planning System,
which will provide staggered alerts to the approvers of items needing attention, which the current system
does not have. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Michael Dever seconded. Item BC201928 was unanimously approved.

Court Project for the period 9/30/2018 - 9/29/2023.
Funding Source: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Grant
Martin Murphy, Corrections Planning Board, presented. Dale Miller asked the reason for late submittal
and asked if the requested award amount is for fiscal and administrative services or for direct services;
recommended that the language of the service description used on the agenda is clear so that the public
is aware that the actual treatment services are being funded and not the administrative costs. Dennis
Kennedy asked how the service description in the contract is written. Andria Richardson, Clerk of the
Board of Control, stated that the contract reads that services are for fiscal agent and administration
services, as presented on the written agenda. Trevor McAleer asked how much of the awarded amount is

Funding Source: General Fund
Donna Kaleal, Sheriff’s Department, presented. Trevor McAleer asked how many hours or nurses will be
made available each week or month for the $300,000.00 being requested and is there a limit per day of
nurses being provided on days when the jails are understaffed; asked what the ratio of Registered Nurses
to Licensed Practical Nurses is. Dale Miller asked if this is a transitional arrangement until an agreement
is reached with MetroHealth to begin providing nursing services to the jails and asked if these funds have
been budgeted and require the use of the General Fund reserve; and recommended forecasting the future
costs now, to incorporate into the 2019 budget, as budget amendments will be considered by Council
soon. Nan Baker asked if cooperation and communication is good between the Sheriff’s Department and
MetroHealth, and that a plan and understanding of the transition timing, staffing and financial needs are
