RESOLUTION CALLING ON THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO REMOVE THE
UNNECESSARY PROVISION THAT REQUIRES SENIORS IN COOK COUNTY
TO REAPPLY FOR THE SENIOR CITIZEN HOMEOWNER’S EXEMPTION
EACH YEAR (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution
sponsored by Forrest Claypool, Bridget Gainer, Timothy O. Schneider and Larry
Suffredin, County Commissioners; Co-Sponsored by President Todd H. Stroger,
Earlean Collins, John P. Daley, Elizabeth “Liz” Doody Gorman, Gregg Goslin,
Joan Patricia Murphy, Peter N. Silvestri, William M. Beavers, Jerry Butler, Joseph

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION CALLING ON THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
TO REMOVE THE UNNECESSARY PROVISION THAT REQUIRES
SENIORS IN COOK COUNTY TO REAPPLY FOR THE
SENIOR CITIZEN HOMEOWNER’S EXEMPTION EACH YEAR
WHEREAS, more than 284,000 senior citizens in Cook County benefit from the
Senior Citizen Homeowner’s Exemption each year, a valuable and important form
of property tax relief; and
WHEREAS, the Senior Exemption can reduce a senior’s property tax bill by
several hundred dollars, with 2008 tax bill savings ranging from $158 to $823; and

WHEREAS, in tax year 2007, the Cook County Assessor’s Office stopped
requiring seniors 65 years or older to apply annually for the Exemption and
therefore saved additional processing and mailing costs; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Assessor took this step in order to make the
process easier for seniors to avail themselves of the Exemption since no one gets
younger; and
WHEREAS, the Assessor re-verifies the Exemption whenever a deed transfer
occurs on a property receiving the Exemption; and
WHEREAS, the Exemption has no income requirement and requires only that the
taxpayer be 65 or older and own the house that is their principal residence; and
WHEREAS, legislation recently passed by the General Assembly now requires
seniors to reapply every year for the Exemption, creating an unnecessary obstacle
for them; and
WHEREAS, this requirement was mandated only for Cook County and does not
apply to any other assessor’s office or county office in Illinois; and
WHEREAS, this requirement will place an unfunded mandate on the County and
require the County to expend unnecessary funds for publications, mailings and
administration of the Exemption during an economic period where any and all
unnecessary expenses to taxpayers should be taken under high consideration;
and
WHEREAS, every time a major change in an exemption application process has
occurred it has resulted in confusion and missed property tax savings, especially
for those exemptions specifically targeted for the senior citizen population.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners urge the General Assembly to promptly reconsider this onerous
provision imposed upon the senior population of Cook County and remedy this
unnecessary provision by enacting further legislation allowing for the Assessor to
maintain the practice of verification they have installed which allowed for automatic
renewal of this valuable property tax relief for Cook County senior citizens.
