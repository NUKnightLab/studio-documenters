RESOLUTION HONORING THE COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF FACILITIES
MANAGEMENT FOR THE 2011 NACO ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FOR PERSONNEL
MANAGEMENT, EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (PROPOSED
RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Bridget Gainer, County
Commissioner; Co-sponsored by Toni Preckwinkle, President, Jerry Butler, Earlean Collins,

The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Resolution:

EQPOSED RESOLUTION

 

HON ORING THE COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF FACILITIES
MANAGEMENT FOR THE 2011 ACO ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FOR
PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND EMPLOYEE
BENEFITS ALTERNATIVE WORK PROGRAM-FACILITIES MANAGEMENT

WHEREAS, In January of 2009, The Cook County Department of Facilities Management
identi?ed that the County had multiple employees off of work due to injury or illness.
Facilities Management recognized that many non-administrative employees (Skilled Trades
and Engineers) who were currently collecting disability benefits could return to work in
administrative functions. Over the past two years, Facilities Management has had eleven
(11) employees participate in the newly created Alternative Work Program; and

WHEREAS, Cook County has endured multiple budget cuts over the past four years and
many administrative positions have been eliminated. With an expanding workload and
fewer staff, AWP participants have performed many clerical functions including: answering
phones, entering work orders into the work order system, ?ling, and other miscellaneous
office duties. Upon completion of the AWP, participants gain a better understanding and
awareness of clerical, administration, and management challenges and expectations; and

WHEREAS, as with many Counties in the United States, Cook County?s pension system is
minimally underfunded. All employees that become disabled while they are still employed
are paid partially through the pension system. Enrolling employees into the AWP and
getting these employees back to work has saved money within the system; and

WHEREAS, the Department of Facilities Management is very accustomed to the fact that
employees will get hurt while on the job. There is always a higher risk of injury within the
service occupations. In fact, according to OSHA statistics service workers account for 53.4
of all injuries in the public sector. Employees spend months, if not years, on disability.
One of the reasons employees were off for such a long period of time due to the fact that
the administration did not actively pursue bringing these employees back to work; and

WHEREAS, Cook County has been under budget constraints for the past seven years and
has had to continually lay off administrative staff in order to ful?ll their budget obligations.
The administrators within Facilities Management needed help with simple tasks that could
not be completed due to expanding workload and fewer staff. The administration was left
with only a couple feasible options: 1) Hire more staff. 2) Better utilize the workforce that
was already in place. Due to the current budget constraints, all innovative ideas were
considered; and

WHEREAS, as with many Counties in the United States, Cook County?s pension system is
minimally underfunded. All employees that become injured while they are employed with
Cook County are paid partially through the pension system. When an employee files for
ordinary disability bene?ts (non-work related injury) the employee is paid 50% of their
salary for the duration of their time off. The entire disability payment is made from the
pension system. In cases where an employee files for duty disability bene?ts (work related
injury) the employee is paid 8 1/3% of their salary from the pension fund and 66 2/3% from
Workers? Compensation; and

WHEREAS, the overall objective of the program is to bring service employees (Skilled
Trades, Engineers, etc.) who are on disability back to work in a clerical function as
effectively as possible. Each employee is taken on a case by case basis. An example would
be that Employee A has a torn ACL and hypothetically won?t be able to return to work in
six months while Employee has a broken foot and could return in six weeks.

WHEREAS, the overall methodology is that an employee who is recovering from an injury
would be more likely to return to their original function (Skilled Trades, Engineer, etc.)
more expeditiously if they were already back to work. in a clerical function than if the same
employee was recovering from their injury at home; and

WHEREAS, the Department of Facilities Management has partnered with the Department
of Risk Management to begin requesting physician documentation regarding work
restrictions that an employee would have if they were approved to come back to work in an
administrative function (also known as light duty). This is a crucial first step, because
physicians have become increasingly more cautious on work restrictions because they don?t
want a lawsuit ?led against them by either the employee or the employer; and

WHEREAS, once a physician has submitted work restrictions and has authorized that an
employee can work in an administrative function, Facilities Management assigns the
employee to an administrative function within the Work Order Division. The Work Order
Division is responsible for opening and closing of work requests, disseminating work
requests, and ?ling daily time logs for the department. The WOD processes an average on
150,000 work requests each year through a computerized work order system; and

WHEREAS, after the employee begins working as a member of the work order staff,
he/she will receive proper training on: basic computer skills, work order processing, basic
clerical skills, answering and transferring of the phone, and ?ling. This can be an
overwhelming for an employee that has never spent time in an of?ce environment before,
but over time the AWP. participants adapt; and

WHEREAS, once an employee is enrolled in the AWP, the only way to get removed is to
either: return to full duty, physician release back to disability, or resignation. Of the eleven
employees that have been assigned to the program: seven have returned back to their
original position, three have resigned, and one is still enrolled; and

WHEREAS, one of the best parts of the AWP is the fact that Facilities Management has
not incurred any additional costs for implementation. The major costs for implementing
this type of program would be: supervision of participants, desktOp computers, and work
order entry software; and

WHEREAS, all members that participate are supervised by the current data entry
supervisor. The supervisor already supervises nine (9) employees and adding additional
employees has proven to not be an additional burden. Facilities Management had additional
computers that were in storage due to their age. AWP employees did not require top of the
line systems, so they were issued refurbished computers that were approximately four years
old. The last major expense was the work order system which is already in place within
Facilities Management; and

WHEREAS, the overall goal of the Alternative Work Program is to get employees back to
work full time so they can complete their function that they were hired to do. The average
time spent by AWP participants in the program is 6 months while non-participants spend
over a year to return to work. There have been many other successes along the way that
have added to the programs overall success including: ?nancial savings, better
understanding of administrative functions, and innovative administrative ideas; and

WHEREAS, ?nancials savings was the easiest and most obvious result. The eleven
individuals that have gone through the program would have accumulated over $500,000 in
wages while not working. This savings is broken down into $90,000 savings for the
pension fund and $410,000 savings for workers compensation; and

WHEREAS, due to increased facility oversight, the amount of paperwork that is required
throughout the department has grown exponentially over the past few years. With the help
of AWP participants, Facilities Management has been able to organize and process their
needed paperwork much more effectively. found out that there is a never?ending process
of paperwork that I never knew existed? said AWP participant Andrew Ryndak, ?Once I got
back on regular duty, I learned how to manage and get my paperwork done a lot faster and
easier?; and

WHEREAS, when it comes to innovative ideas, there is always an added bene?t when a
newcomer is trained in performing administrative functions. One of the AWP participants
single-handedly changed the ?ling system for daily tracking logs that are used by
tradesmen. This individual saw that the ?ling was grossly inef?cient and since his
departure six months ago, the ?ling system has stayed intact and is still the model for ?ling
such paperwork. Another AWP participant developed a ?Key Phrase? document that

identi?es work processes commonly used by tradesmen. This document will be
disseminated to bring continuity to our work requests.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, the Cook County Department of Facilities
Management has taken a proactive approach to bringing men and women back to work that
would otherwise have been sitting at home while they were recovering from their injuries.
Facilities Management has worked to create a positive experience for both the AWP
participant and the administration. Counties across the United States are looking for ways
to fully utilize their personnel and to give such personnel proper training and departmental
understanding while also saving money. The Cook County Department of Facilities
Management has been able to achieve this goal and has deveIOped a usable model for other
Counties and would humbly accept a Achievement Award for the Alternative Work
Program; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Cook County Finance Subcommittee on Pension
should convene to discuss how to implement this proactive approach Countywide.
