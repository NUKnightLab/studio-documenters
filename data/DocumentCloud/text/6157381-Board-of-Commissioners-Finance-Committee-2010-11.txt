21, 2010 from R. Steve Edmonson, Chief Information Officer, Bureau of

Account 009-441, Maintenance and Repair of Data Processing Equipment and
Software for the extension of Contract No. 08-41-247.
(See related

Reason:

Due to insufficient funds for the first year of the contract, a shortage has

for these services.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require
an infusion of funds in order to meet current obligations? What was the
balance in the account on that date, and what was the balance 30 days prior
to that date?
The Bureau of Technology became aware of the shortage of funds in the
week of July 5-9, 2010. The balance in the account on that date was
$18,858.00. The balance 30 days prior was $18,858.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List
any other accounts that were also considered (but not used) as the source of
the transferred funds.
The Bureau of Technology identified the Account 260 for this transfer on
request.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations
that will be deferred, delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in
available spending authority that will result in the account that funds are
transferred from 009-260 (Professional Services).
The 260 Account is used for professional services. It was the Bureau of
Technology intention to use the $1.2 million for project management services
related to the Broadband Stimulus Grant Program. Funding for this Grant
was not awarded during the first two cycles. It is anticipated that funding for
this grant will not occur during FY2010. The Bureau of Technology seeks to
reallocate these funds to the Sentinel Hardware maintenance extension
period, while an RFP is developed.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this
account was originally budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated
surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
