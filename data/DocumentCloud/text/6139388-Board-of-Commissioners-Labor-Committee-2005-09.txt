AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY LIVING WAGE ORDINANCE (PROPOSED
ORDINANCE AMENDMENT).
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance Amendment
sponsored by Peter N. Silvestri, County Commissioner; Co-sponsored by Gregg
Goslin and Carl R Hansen, County Commissioners.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance Amendment.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY LIVING WAGE ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, on September 15, 1998, the Cook County Board of Commissioners
enacted the Cook County Living Wage Ordinance to establish meaningful employee
compensation for lowest wage individuals employed by a person or business entity
awarded a contract or subcontract with Cook County; and
WHEREAS, on December 1, 2004, said Ordinance was amended to require
compensation of the living wage for services performed or produced by lowest paid
individuals employed by a person or business entity awarded a contract or subcontract
with Cook County or by a for-profit person or business entity of an owner occupied
property who receives or renews a Class 6b or Class 9 property tax incentive pursuant
to the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance (Ordinance
02-O-14); and
WHEREAS, there are currently approximately 3,500 units which are certified as
supportive living facilities by the State of Illinois Department of Public Aid, with 1,700
such units being located in Cook County, and another 3,000 new units are in the
planning stages, with 1,500 new units currently planned for occupancy in Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, said 2004 Amendment has created an impediment to the Illinois
Supportive Living Program within Cook County, thereby diminishing a key component
of housing and health services for the elderly and low income populations in Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, the current ordinance has created a “chilling effect” on possible new units
being built in our county, discourage renewals of Class 6b and Class 9 incentives, and
ultimately may place current Cook County HOME funds, used to finance many of
these projects, in jeopardy of default.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE PRESIDENT AND BOARD OF
COMMISSIONERS OF THE COUNTY OF COOK that the Cook County Living Wage
Ordinance (05-O-02) is hereby amended as follows:
Section 1.
Section 2.
Section 3.
Section 4.

Living Wage Requirements.
Applicability.
Severability.
Effective Date.
