PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (“IFB”) No. 10 – 00584 on August 17, 2010 for unit
renovation work needed at Wentworth Annex. The IFB was advertised in the Chicago SunTimes, the Chicago Defender, El Dia, on the CHA website and on BuySpeed Online. The Prebid meeting and Site Visit were held on August 24, 2010.
The CHA issued Addendum No. 1 on August 26, 2010 to add information about the new on-line
compliance system to the procurement. Addendum No. 2, issued September 10, 2010, moved the
bid due date from September 13, 2010 to September 23, 2010. Addendum No. 3, released
September 15, 2010, responded to Requests for Information, made changes to selected technical
specifications and drawings, and distributed new BF pages, updated Davis–Bacon wage reports
and environmental reports. Addendum No. 4, issued on September 23, 2010, moved the bid due
date from September 23, 2010 to October 4, 2010. Addendum No. 5 was also released
September 23, 2010 to answer additional Requests for Information.
The CHA received and opened eight (8) bids on October 4, 2010.
After reviewing the bid submittal materials, the Department of Procurement and Contracts and
the Capital Construction Department held pre-award survey meetings with the apparent lowest
bidder, Oakley Construction Co., Inc. (“Oakley”), and the second lowest bidder. Both firms
responded to questions on the thoroughness of their bids, the amount of the work they planned to
self-perform, and their capacity to perform this work.
Having completed its review of the submitted bid materials and its responses at the pre-award
survey meeting, the Department of Procurement and Contracts has determined that Oakley is the
lowest responsive and responsible bidder.
