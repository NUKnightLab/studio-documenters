NOTICE AND AGENDA

There will be a meeting of the Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations Committee of the Board
of Commissioners of Cook County on Wednesday, November 14, 2012 at the hour of 9:15 A.M. in the
Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois to consider the

following:

320600

SUPPORTING THE REPORTING OF LOST OR STOLEN FIREARMS (PROPOSED
RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Larry Suffredin, John P.
Daley and Edwin Reyes, County Commissioners.

SUPPORTING THE REPORTING OF LOST OR STOLEN FIREARMS

WHEREAS, gun violence is a public health epidemic that touches the lives of ALL
Americans, and every year thousands of families, friends, schools and communities are
devastated by gun violence; and

WHEREAS, according to the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 1,064
people died from gun injuries in Illinois in 2010, the most recent year for which statistics
are available; and

WHEREAS, federal law 18 U.S.C. 923 requires licensed firearms dealers, but not
?rearms owners, to report the loss or theft of ?rearms to law enforcement within 48 hours;
and

WHEREAS, laws requiring the reporting of lost or stolen firearms are beneficial to law
enforcement because: one (1) when a crime gun is traced by law enforcement to the last
purchaser of record, that person may falsely claim that the gun was lost or stolen to hide his
or her involvement in the crime or in gun trafficking; and two (2) reporting laws provide a
tool for law enforcement to detect this behavior and charge criminals who engage in it; and

WHEREAS, a December 2008 report by Mayors Against Illegal Guns entitled ?The
Movement of Illegal Guns in America: The Link between Gun Laws and Interstate Gun
raf?cking? concluded that lost or stolen firearm reporting laws ?can help law enforcement
more easily identify and prosecute gun traf?ckers;? and

WHEREAS, a September 2010 report by Mayors Against Illegal Guns entitled ?Trace the
Gus: The Link Between Gun Laws and Interstate Gun ra?icking, presented data showing
that states that do not require gun owners to report lost or stolen guns to police are the
source of guns used in crimes that are recovered in other states at a rate more than two and a
half times greater that states that have lost or stolen reporting laws; and

WHEREAS, reporting laws help disarm persons prohibited from possessing ?rearms.
When a person who legally owned a gun falls into a prohibited category, it is crucial for law
enforcement to be able to remove the ?rearm from his or her possession. For example, a
gun owner who is convicted of a felony or who becomes the subject of a domestic violence
restraining order is not permitted under federal law to continue to possess ?rearms.
However, when ordered to surrender a ?rearm by law enforcement or a judge, the owner
may falsely claim it has been lost or stolen; and

WHEREAS, reporting laws protect gun owners from unwarranted criminal accusations
when their guns are recovered at a crime scene, and make it easier for law enforcement to
locate a lost or stolen ?rearm and return it to its lawful owner. A 2007 report, the
International Association of Chiefs of Police concluded that, ?law enforcement?s early
awareness of every lost and stolen gun will enhance their ability to recover those guns and
reduce gun violence? and recommended that state and local governments mandate reporting
of lost or stolen ?rearms; and

WHEREAS, according to a 2000 report from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms
entitled ?Following the Gun: Enforcing Federal Laws Against Firearms Traf?ckers,? at
least 500,000 ?rearms are stolen each year from residences across the United States; and

WHEREAS, the extreme danger ?rearms pose to public safety requires a heightened level
of accountability on the part of individuals who choose to own ?rearms; and

WHEREAS, laws requiring the reporting of lost or stolen ?rearms have been adopted in
jurisdictions throughout the country. Firearm owners are currently required to report lost or
stolen ?rearms in seven states and the District of Columbia, and in a number of local
jurisdictions in California and as well as in certain other major cities,
including Chicago, Illinois; Hartford, Connecticut; and New York, New York; and

WHEREAS, the American public overwhelmingly supports laws requiring the reporting of
lost or stolen ?rearms. A 2011 survey by American Viewpoint/Momentum Analysis of
public attitudes toward gun violence prevention measures found almost unanimous support
for these laws: 94% of all people surveyed, including 94% of gun owners polled, favored
reporting laws.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County urge the Illinois General Assembly to require ?rearm owners to report to law
enforcement if a ?rearm they own or possess is lost or stolen; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County
believes that requiring the reporting of lost or stolen guns will help improve public safety by
deterring gun traf?cking, improving gun crime investigations, protecting gun owners from
unwarranted accusations, and enabling law enforcement to disarm ineligible gun owners and
return lost or stolen ?rearms to their owners; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does
hereby urge the Illinois General Assembly to improve state laws that make gun owners
accountable for their ?rearms and require them to act responsibly; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County urges
the Illinois General Assembly to enact a law making it unlawful for a person who resides in
Illinois to fail to report to law enforcement the theft or loss of a ?rearm he or she owns or
possesses within forty-eight (48) hours of the time he or she knew or reasonably should
have known that the ?rearm had been stolen or lost.
