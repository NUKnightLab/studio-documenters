REPORT

Transmitting a Communication, dated July 5, 2002 from
JAMES M. HOULIHAN, Cook County Assessor
I am pleased to present the Executive Report for the South Suburban Tax Reactivation Project (SSTRP).
I respectfully request this report be received and filed .

LETTER
July 9, 2002
President John H. Stroger, Jr.
and the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County
118 North Clark Street
Chicago, Illinois 60602
Dear Mr. President and Commissioners:
I want to express my appreciation to you for your leadership in addressing economic development
initiatives and for your support of the South Suburban Tax Reactivation Project (SSTRP). Two years ago,
the Cook County Board of Commissioners approved the creation of SSTRP with one overarching goal, to
bring economic success to the south suburbs of Cook County.
I believe SSTRP has taken the important first steps. I am pleased to provide the Project's Executive
Report for your information and review. This report details our work over the past two years and
describes the important groundwork for economic development projects to come to fruition. We are
pleased with the progress that SSTRP has made thus far.
While the SSTRP has been successful in identifying and initiating steps toward acquiring and marketing
the tax delinquent properties, further crucial marketing activities and identification of potential buyers are
needed. The Cook County Board's recent approval to extend SSTRP another two years will provide the
Project with the resources and adequate time to fully engage in marketing and activities to facilitate the
development of acquired parcels and parcels already municipally-owned.
Again, thank you for all of your efforts. By working together, we can help bring economic success to the
south suburban communities.
Sincerely,
JAMES M. HOULIHAN
Cook County Assessor

JUDICIAL ADVISORY COUNCIL
GRANT AWARD
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 30, 2002 from
JAM ES M. O'ROURKE, Executive Director, Judicial Advisory Council
The U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), recently
authorized a grant of $748,350.00 to Cook County for juvenile drug abuse programs. This grant is an
earmarked appropriation from Congress and was included in OJJDP's budget for award to the County.
The application for these funds was submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice on August 17, 2001 ,
before the implementation of the grant pre-application approval process.
We propose that these grant funds be used to replicate Life Skills Training (LST), a juvenile drug
prevention program that has been evaluated and has demonstrated significant deterrent effects over a
sustained period of time. LST is an exemplary violence prevention program that numerous evaluations
conducted over a 15-year period show cuts tobacco, alcohol and marijuana use 50 to 75% among young
people. LST is a three-year schoo l-based intervention program to prevent gateway drug abuse. We
propose implementing it in targeted Cook County schools and school districts.
LST has been recognized as an exemplary program by the American Medical Association, the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Centers for Disease Control, the American Psychological
Association, the White House Office on Drug Policy, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S.
Department of Education.
To implement the LST program in a timely manner in accordance with federal requirements, we request
permission to enter into contracts with the fo llowing entities:

implementation, monitoring, evaluation and research services to government agencies and

Training project coordinator reporting directly to the Cook County Judicial Advisory Counci l.
They wi ll be responsible for overall project management, managing subcontractors, establishing
partnerships with interested schools, fac ilitating teacher training, oversight of school
implementation of LST curriculum and project assessment. One year contract for $97 ,920.00.

(2)

National Health Promotion Associates (NHPA), a health consulting, research and development
firm established by Dr. G ilbert Botvin, the developer of the Life Skills Training program in 1985.
Dr. Botvin, a prevention scientist at Cornell Un iversity Medical College, established NHPA to
provide training and technical assistance to school sites implementing the LST program . They
provide technical assistance to sites who are implementing the LST program, train teachers to
conduct the program, and train trainers to continue the program locally. Three year contract not

Program costs include a one-time fee for products and software; initial in-service
implementation and training for Nancy B. Jefferson teaching staff and JTDC staff; and
instructional materials for 480 students or 40 classrooms. Scholastic, Inc. will provide at no
additional cost one high school stage of READ 180 and over 400 library books that
correspond to the READ I 80 program.
Nancy B. Jefferson School/Chicago Public Schools has agreed to fund two new full-time
teachers to facilitate and implement the READ 180 program during and after school hours; to
pay the costs associated with replacing trade books as necessary and the cost of expanding the
program to 40 classroom teachers; and to dedicate a full-time network server to run the
READ 180 software program.
This system is used at other Chicago Public School locations, and has proven to be very
successful in improving student's reading scores.

ADULT REGULATED USES

13.15

REGULATED USES

The Supreme Court of the State of Illinois has determined that the purpose of Adult Regulatory
Ordinances serves a valid governmental interest. In the development and executi on of this Ordinance, it
is recognized that there are some uses which, because of their very nature, cause negative secondary
effects which have a deleterious effect upon adjacent residential and commercial areas where nurseries,
schools, nurs ing homes, churches and similar uses are located. Zoning and special regulations of adult
uses are necessary to ensure that adverse effects will not blight, down-grade or discourage normal
development of surrounding neighborhoods. To prevent adult uses from having an adverse effect upon
residential and commercial areas, adult uses are permitted only in 1-2, 1-3 and 1-4 industrial zoning
districts. Adult uses consist of the fo llowing.
A.
Adult booths.
B.
Adult entertainment cabarets.
C.
Adult motion and mini-motion picture theaters.
D.
Adult stores.
E.
Massage parlors.
F.
Massage schoo ls.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEED TN GS FOR JULY 9, 2002

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Tuesday, June 25, 2002 at the hour of I 0 :00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118
North Clark Street, Chicago, lllino is.
Sandra K. Williams, Secretary to the Board of Commissione rs, announced an amended request for the
Department of Building and Zoning was distributed to the Commissioners earlier.
Chairman Daley noted that he has submitted questions to the Secretary to be entered into the record as
well as a memorandum from last February which, at the direction of the President, outlined new transfer
of fund provisions. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County C lerk.)
President Stroger noted that stricter controls are needed with regard to transfers into overtime accounts.
He suggested that management provide closer oversight.
Chairman Daley as ked for leave of the body to have Mr. G laser give an overview of the 2nd quarter
revenue report. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Mr. Glaser noted the previously distributed revenue report provides a snapshot summary, and is subject to
change on a month-to-month basis. By comparing the revenue report from the end of February to today,
you can see that the revenues do not come in with regularity. Based on our current revenue streams, we
do not see s ignificant growth in overa ll revenues in the near future. We continue to believe that a
conservative approach to forecasting our revenues is appropriate, g iven the prospect of future terrorist
attacks, the uncertainty of the sustainability of the current economic recovery, and a crisis of confidence
in corporate America. All of these, coupled with escalating labor and health costs, will continue to
present budget challenges in the near term.
Mr. Glaser further commented that, as of the end of May, or s ix months into the fiscal year, our revenues
are on target with the original forecast. Total revenues in the operating funds are approx imately $24
million ahead of expectations. To highlight some reasons for that: the Recorder of Deeds is $9.2 million
ahead of forecasts, primarily due to numerous refinancings and home sales. We are uncertain as to
whether this trend is sustainable through the remainder of this year as home sales are declining and the
opportunity to refinance home mortgages is declining. Also, the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve Board may raise interest rates later this year, which would reduce fee revenue in the Recorder's
Office. Pena lties collected by the Treasurer's Office are up $ 10.7 million as a result of the tax sale that
ended in April and the fact that the s lowing economy has caused many homeowners to pay their property
taxes late. Sales tax collections continue to be strong as consumer spending in e lectronics remains sound.
Finally, our parking fees are up despite rising gas costs and area road construction projects. People are
still choosing the conven ience of driving.
Commissioner Gosl in asked what might happen to cause the County to fall behind revenue forecasts at
the end of the year.
Mr. Glaser replied this is unlike ly to occur, but a significant rise in interest rates could have a negative
impact on revenues.
Commissioner Lechowicz observed that interest rates are at historic lows, and asked what impact th is has
on invested funds, and the assets managed by the Cook County Pension Board.

2368

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 9, 2002

Mr. Glaser replied that other offices that maintain interest bearing accounts would be subject to lower
interest rates.
John Chambers, County Comptro ller, replied that while most state pension funds have had negative
returns, the Coun ty has had a positive return, a lbeit under I%. The reason for this success is that the
County was not heavily indexed.
Commissioner Lechowicz remarked that th is is very positive. The Commissioner asked what is invo lved
in Supportive Services where there is a s light loss. He is a lso conce rned about patient fees, where there is
a sizable loss.
Mr. Glaser responded that both of those depend on timing. For example, at the end of February the
County was about $20 million behind projections on patient fees, but that gap has since narrowed.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked for an explanation of the $2.7 million adjustment o n the cigarette tax.
Mr. G laser responded that the recent increase in Illino is ' cigarette tax may impact cigarette sales
statewide, as well as in Cook County.
Commissio ner Lechowicz inquired what the Cook County Department of Revenue is do ing to enforce tax
requirements at the wholesale and machine level of cigarette sales.
Jo hn Leonard, Manager of Collections & Compliance for the Cook County Department of Revenue,
responded that the Office refers compla ints to the Sheriff's O ffice regarding retailers selling cigarettes
without stamps, and the Department of Revenue audits the wholesalers.
Commiss io ner Sutker inquired with regard to the County use tax on a utomobiles. He asked how the
County is do ing in co llecting taxes from purchases outside of Cook County w ithin the State of I Ilino is?
Mr. Leonard respo nded that collection is going very well. He stated any resident of Cook County who
purchases a vehicle outside of the County is subject to a strict collection process.
Commissioner Sutker asked how the County is do ing with respect to receiving revenue from this source?
Mr. Leonard replied that the County is do ing very well, and further stated approx imately $5 mill ion of the
$52 million budgeted for the use tax is obtained from people who purchase vehicles outside of Cook
County.
Commissioner Sutker asked whether the County has reciprocal arrangements with othe r counties
regarding this tax?
Mr. Leona rd replied that there are arrangements w ith some dealerships located o uts ide of Cook County on
a voluntary basis, but noted the tax is mainly enforced by the Secretary of State.
Commissioner Steele asked the Chief Financial Officer if declining cigarette consumption is caus ing the
dec line in c igarette tax revenue.
Mr. G laser repl ied that the decline in cigarette tax revenue comes from a decline in cigarette sales.
Commissio ner Steele asked if the figures provided for the Sheriffs Office in the 2nd quarter revenue
report have to do with jail operations.

2369

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 9, 2002

Mr. Glaser responded that the figures are not related to operations but rather to court orders that the
Sheriff collects.
Commissioner Quigley asked whether the Bureau of Finance has broken down the most recent State
budget cuts in terms of their impact on Cook County and intergovernmental fees and revenues the County
would be receiving from the State?
Mr. Glaser responded that Tim Casey, Legislative Lia ison of Intergovernmental Affairs, has prepared a
report on this point.
Mr. Casey responded that the State cuts did not have a significant impact on Cook County . To cite one
example, the funds requested for the Juvenile Temporary Detention Centers Facility were approved.
Commissioner Quigley asked whether he could have an estimate of the reduction in funds from the State
for programs.
Mr. Casey responded that there would be an increase in funds in Medicaid because the County
renegotiated the intergovernmental transfer. The overall projection would be a slight increase.
Commissioner Quigley asked whether there are specific funding cuts outside of Medicaid?
Mr. Casey remarked that he is unaware of other specific cuts, but that he could get Commissioner Quigley
a copy of the report.
Chairman Daley asked Mr. Casey to provide a copy of the report to all commissioners. (The referenced
documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Pres ident Stroger noted that the County requested and received $7.5 mill ion for the Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center, and funding was also approved for the continuing transition of appellate cases from the
County to the State. The intergovernmental transfer agreement was negotiated separately between the
County, State and Federal Governments.
Commissioner Lechowicz remarked that the County's lobbyists did an outstanding job, and the
President's efforts and leadership had a pos itive impact.
President Stroger remarked that the County must improve its lobby ing efforts and that the lobbyists
should take a proactive stance on legis lation of interest to Cook County.
Chairman Daley noted that the lobbyists for the Board must work closely with lobbyists for the other
countywide e lected officials, because they often support bills that have a fiscal impact on Cook County,
and the Board is then asked to pay the cost ifthe bill becomes law.
Commissioner Quigley remarked that at the end of the first quarter, the commissioners discussed how
high the departments were in overtime usage. The commissioner noted that transfers from the 110
Account (Salaries and Wages of Regular Employees) into the 120 Accounts (Overtime Compensation) are
prevalent. He commended the Chairman and President for requiring detailed explanations. The County
has reduced the percentage of tota l transfers, but the overtime issue remains. The commissioner asked
whether rules could be established for the use of overtime? He concluded by saying that sometimes it is
more cost effective to hire additional people.

2370

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 9, 2002

Grace Colbert, Director of Budget and Management Services, responded that this is a responsibility of
management for every elected official, department head or bureau chief. Ms. Colbert noted there are a lot
of24/7 operations within the County.
Commissioner Quigley responded that before the next budget is prepared, the Bureau of Finance should
begin to analyze whether trends reflect critical 24/7 needs, and should determine how to budget more
appropriately to avoid overtime.
Chairman Daley stated that committee members were previously asked to provide suggestions or
recommendations prior to the transfer meeting, and four suggestions were received.
President Stroger noted that overtime was common in the health care field. He said it is hard to fill
nursing and therapist positions. These professionals have formed organizations and are typically not
employed directly by the hospital. This is a challenge faced by the entire health care field.
Commissioner Hansen asked what specific type(s) of penalties comprise the $10.6 million for the first six
months from the County Treasurer' s Office?
Mr. Glaser responded approximately $6 million is from the tax sale.
Commissioner Hansen asked why this is so much different from last year?
Daniel Degnan, Chief Financial Officer for the Treasurer's Office, responded that the scavenger sale,
which is held every two years, took place last December. Revenue was received from that, as well as
from delinquency penalties.
Commissioner Hansen asked for a breakdown of all sources of the additional $10 million.
Commissioner Silvestri commended the Treasurer's Office for its outreach/information services.
Commissioner Silvestri asked what percentage of the penalties are attributable to mortgage companies
and other lenders who fail to pay on time?
Mr. Degnan responded that he would have to provide that information later.
Commissioner Silvestri asked whether the Treasurer's Office has tracked the number of citizen
complaints regarding fees that were incorrectly charged to citizens.
Mr. Degnan responded that they receive a number of inquiries and in the event that a fee is incorrectly
charged, they work with the taxpayer, and the bank or mortgage company to resolve the problem.
Commissioner Silvestri remarked that taxpayers should be protected against paying such fees. He also
commented on the number of lenders who paid on the wrong Property Index Number (PIN). He asked
Mr. Degnan to provide a breakdown on how much of the fund reflects penalties assessed against bankers
and mortgage companies and how much of the fund reflects penalties assessed against taxpayers.
Mr. Degnan replied that he did not have that breakdown but that the Treasurer' s Office would study this
issue.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the transfers requested have not been this low since 1998. That is a
good record of control. The Administration deserves credit for keeping the transfers as low as they have
been, which is at 1.18% of the total budget.

2371

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 9, 2002

Commissioner Hansen stated that there was a study on importing cigarettes from outside the State of
Illino is at least 7 or 8 years ago, and asked whether that study has been updated, and whether the County
can relate that to the noteworthy decline in cigarette taxes of $2. 7 million in just six months.
Mr. G laser stated that he expects to update the study in anticipation of next year's budget.
Commi ssioner Hansen comm ented that a tax that generates less revenue poses a problem. The
commiss ioner asked if Cook County has any contacts with the State of Illinois and State of Indiana
regarding cigarette purchasing?
Mr. G laser responded that he is unaware of any contacts with either state.
Commissioner Hansen suggested that the Bureau of Finance look at that activity in any study that is done.
Commissioner Moreno commended Chairman Daley and his leadership, and Mr. G laser for his economic
forecasting. In the Statement of Appropriations book, several departments, inc luding the Sheriffs
Wo men's Justice Services, Cermak Health Services and the Special Purpose Appropriation have exceeded
50% of their appropriation only s ix months into the year. He asked if that level of spending can be
sustained through the end of the year?
Mr. G laser responded that the Bureau of Finance has not gone through some of the variances in detail but
that he could get back to Commissioner Moreno.
The Committee considered requests from various depa11ments to transfer appropriations between
budgetary accounts. C hairman Daley proceeded to the requests for transfers of funds under $ 10,000.

With respect to Cermak Health Services (Department 240), Commissioner Si lvestri noted an increase
regarding the drug AZT. He asked if this was due to an increase in the cost of the drug itself, or an
increase in usage?
Alvin Holley, Chief Financial Officer for the Bureau of Health Services, replied that more HlV patients
are being detained, thus the Bureau is usi ng more of this drug.
Commissioner Si lvestri asked for a statistical report with respect to usage for the detainees.

extra employees are used in a variety of ways. For example, late afternoon and evening shifts may work 4
to 5 hours per day to ensure same-day data entry and same-day filing in the Domestic Relations, Civil,
and Law Divis ions. Extra employees are also used in the five suburban Districts to keep the office
current.
Commissione r Si lvestri asked what is the justification fo r using extra e mployees and incurring overtime
costs?

2375

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 9, 2002

Ms. Olsen replied $3 0 thousand of the increased overtime is for cleanup operations at the Skokie
courthouse, which was unanticipated. Ms. Olsen stated a section of the basement at the courthouse was
used to inappropriately store records over a period of many years.
Chairman Daley asked William Huffman, Director of Facilities Management to provide the members with
more information regarding this issue.
Mr. Huffman explained the Skokie Fire Marshall c ited the County because the Clerk's office was storing
documents and records in the fire exits and corridors. The Department of Facilities Management served
notice on the C lerk that they had to move these records. Because these records are under the jurisdiction
of the C lerk they cannot be moved by anyone but C lerk' s personnel. Mr. Huffman stated his department
has been working with the Clerk's office to clean up the area.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if anything is being done to prevent those dangerous conditions from being
created again.
Mr. Huffman replied his department is responsible for ensuring the building is safe. He has made space
available at other facilities so the C lerk could relocate those records.
In response to Commissioner Silvestri 's question as to whether inspections of other Courthouses has been
completed, Mr. Huffman responded yes.
Commissioner Hansen asked if there were records stored at 23 rd and Rockwell. He al so inquired if the
records, which were in the basement of the Skokie Courthouse, were from places other than the 2nd
District?
Mr. Huffman stated the C lerk 's records are stored on three floors at 23rd and Rockwell, and records from
other suburban districts were fou nd at the Skokie Courthouse. The volume of records is so large, vacant
space at Oak Forest Hospital is being utilized to temporarily store these records. The Uniform Records
Act stipulates how long you keep certain documents.
Mr. Huffman indicated the Bureau of
Administration recently did a study on record storage and is finalizing their findings.
For clarification, Chairman Daley asked Ms. Olsen if they know where all of the records are located?
Ms. Olsen responded that her office does know where the records are. They are located in every Court
facility, including the Daley Center on every floor.
Commissioner Silvestri questioned why there is a need to transfer an additional $273,200 into Account
441 - Maintenance and Repair of Data Processing Equipment?

Ms. Olsen replied the equipment is o ld, and is in the process of being replaced. The two smaller
maintenance contracts for the micrographic equipment came in more than fifty percent over last year.
The largest contract is out to bid right now. Ms. Olsen stated the 2002 budget reflected an approximate
ten percent increase over last year, in anticipation of an increase in maintenance.

Commissioner Steele moved approval of the transfer of funds request for the Clerk of the Circuit
Court's Office, as amended. Seconded by Commissioner Butler, the motion carried.

Div ision II o f the Department of Corrections complex that date back to the late 1950s. He sa id Division
II is the second oldest division in the jail complex. The request is to replace the plumbing and fi xtures,
ceilings, windows and doors. Further, he stated that for several years the John Howard Association has
identified these buildings as ones that need replacement o f the above equipment and fi xtures. The Office
of Capital Planning and Policy has been working on the project for one year. He stated that the work
would be completed in six phases in orde r to relocate the inmates, one wing at a time.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the capacity at the three buildings?

place?
Michae l LaMont answered that c urrently the thought is to put the inmates in the o ld central kitchen, but
this will depend on the jail population at that time.

Capital Planning or so lely based on a recommendation by the John Howard Association?

 JOU RNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR J ULY 9, 2002

Commissioner Collins asked why this contract requires so many consultants?
Michael LaM ont responded that the request is to enter in to a professiona l services contract w ith Roula
Associates while the other consultants are subcontractors to Roula Associates.
Commissioner Collins asked if the county saves money by hiring cons ultants at discounted rates for every
proj ect that the county does rather than doing the work in-house?
Michael LaMont stated that the O ffice of Capital Pla nning and Policy does not have a staff large enough
or that has expertise to des ign the projects in all areas. Further, Mr. LaMont stated that the Office of
Capital Plann ing and Po licy does not hire a consultant fo r every project. He said that often specifications
are developed internally and then bid, which was recently done on the roofing proj ect that was approved
by the Construction Committee. Mr. LaMont continued by saying that there are two components to this
proj ect; one involves waterproofing of the deck, which is the biggest part of the project, and the other
involves the dra inage system.
Commissioner Hansen asked which deck is being repa ired?
Michae l LaMont stated that the area being repaired is primarily around the new administration building,
plus the connecting link between the two buildings and the sta ircase com ing up from Californ ia Avenue.
Commissione r Hansen stated that he is concerned that the amount of money involved in this project
seems very high.
Michael LaMont stated that the request is a budgetary figure at this point, and is based in part on costs
associated with the construction at the Daley Center.
Michael LaMont asked Roula A lakiotou of Roula Associates to respond to Commissioner Hansen's
questions.
Rou la A lakiotou stated that there is a building drainage system that is connected to the sewer in the
vicinity , and the specific details of how the work will take place will not be known until the investigation
is completed. Ms. Alakiotou further stated that there are drains into the system at the C riminal Courts
Administration Building.
Commissioner Hansen asked w here the drains are located?
Ms. Alakiotou stated that they are located on the inside, and the current drains and piping are in bad
condition and are causing a leakage into offices.
Commissione r Hansen stated that at some point he would like to receive the answer to exactly where the
water w ill drain off once the proj ect is completed.
Ms. Alakiotou commented that the re are sprinkler drains thro ughout the plaza and each drain is
interconnected as we ll as connected to the major storm line.
Commissioner Hansen stated that he would like to know the pattern of the drains.
Ms. Alakiotou responded that fo llowing the investigation, she will be able to g ive the committee a set of
documents that will explain exactly how the drainage in the plaza will occur.

2482

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDfNGS FOR JULY 9, 2002

Commissioner Hansen asked what is the life expectancy of the new liner?
Ms. Alakiotou sa id that the new system has not been designed but once it 1s completed, then a
determination can be made regarding the life expectancy of the liner.
Michael LaMont stated that once Ms. Alakiotou prepares a schematic design, he would present it to the
committee.
Commissioner Silvestri asked what caused the decks to deteriorate?
Ms. A lakiotou commented that the Crim inal Courts Adm inistration Building is an o ld building and has
salt damage from the wi nter. He said this is the reason why placing radiant heat in the area is now under
discussion so the main traffic area can be left free of salt.
Michael LaMont stated that anythi ng that is exposed to the elements wou ld incur deterioration.
Roula Alakiotou stated that the consu ltants are looki ng for at least three options to present to the Office of
Capital Planning and Policy Department.
Commiss ioner Hansen asked if sa lt is still being used on the deck?
Michael LaMont stated that there is a representative from Facilities Management to respond to the
question.
John Joiner, Deputy Director, Faci lities Management, stated that twice a year, the concrete s lab is
removed and the trough system is c leaned out. Also he stated that he has spoken to the Sheriffs Office
and the Custodial Department that handles snow removal a nd asked them to no longer use salt on the deck
and use a shovel to remove the snow. Further, he stated that the main problem is that the offices of the
Adult Probation Department is located under the deck and has approximately one hundred and fifty
employees.
Commissioner Hansen commented that the Board of Commissioners shou ld receive confirmation from
the Sheriffs Office that salt is no longer being used on the deck area.
Commissioner Butler asked a question regarding placing radiant heat in the area?
Michael LaMont stated that the consu ltants would look at radiant heat as an option along with a cost
benefit analysis.

Mr. Andrews said that the soil was tested to see what needed to be done to dispose of it.
Commissioner Moreno asked if it could have been leaking from below due to the existing dump that the
buildings were built over?
Mr. A ndrews stated that there a re two issues, the soil that was tested has been disposed so it is no longer a
problem a nd the water does not have contamination and it is just water.
