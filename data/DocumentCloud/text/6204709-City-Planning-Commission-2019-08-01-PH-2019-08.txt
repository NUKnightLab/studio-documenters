NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING

Whole Room, 13?h ?oor of the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center, 2 Woodward Avenue,

THURSDAY, AUGUST 1, 2019 AT 5:15 PM

to consider a text amendment that would amend Chapter 6] of the 1984 Detroit City Code,
Zoning, by amending Article XII, Use Regulations, Sec. 61-12-241, and Article XVI,
Definitions, Sec. 61-] 6-212, relative to youth hostels/hostels, for consistency with a proposed
amendment relative to hostels in Chapter 44, Public Lodging, Article I, De?nitions, and Division
2, Requirements Applicable to Public Lodging Houses, of the 1984 Detroit City Code.

The proposed Zoning text amendment would delete the 14 speci?ed Article XII use
regulations for hostels from the Chapter 6] Zoning Ordinance that are anticipated to being
recited, revised, and expanded as part of the preposed amendment to Chapter 44, which regulates
public lodging. The Zoning amendment would also state by cross-reference that the land use is
subject to the requirements of the proposed Chapter 44 amendment. The de?nition of hostel is
adjusted for consistency with the proposed de?nition in Chapter 44.

This text amendment is being considered by the City Planning Commission in accordance
with the provisions of Article 111, Division 2 of the Detroit Zoning Ordinance. Zoning Ordinance
text amendments require the approval of the City Council after a public hearing and after receipt
of a report and recommendation by the City Planning Commission. You may present your views
