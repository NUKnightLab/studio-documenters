On September 27 it became apparent that DFM would not have adequate funding to process request for

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
They were chosen according to the available funds in each of these accounts.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
There are additional facilities that have been added to the DFM management scope.

Journal of Proceedings

September 26, 2018

This contract will satisfy the statutory requirements for the Cook County Assessor’s Office set forth in 35
ILCS 200/12-20 and 715 ILCS 10/1 which require real estate assessments to be published at the same
time for the North and South suburban townships. Cook County Suburban Publishers, Inc. can publish the
North and South suburban townships under one umbrella.
This contract will also allow the Cook County Clerk’s Office to satisfy the statutory requirements set forth
in Article 12 of the Election Code, 10 ILCS 5/12-1 et. seq. which requires the Cook County Clerk’s
Office to place notices in a minimum of two newspapers for each suburban municipality in the election
jurisdiction on the same day and for the same duration of time. If multiple vendors are involved, there
could be a scenario where some newspapers in certain municipalities have different publication dates.
This would result in a loss of coordination of the notices and possible confusion among the voters.
Therefore, it is necessary to have one source that can publish notices in all election municipalities on the
same day. Cook County Suburban Publishers, Inc. can provide the necessary geographical coverage and
guarantee that notices are placed in the correct papers on the same day.
This is a Sole Source Procurement pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
ESTABLISHING THE COOK COUNTY COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE TO DEVELOP

WHEREAS, the United States Census Bureau will endeavor to count every person in the nation, and many
states and counties are establishing programs and initiatives to promote the census; and

of federal funds towards social service programs, influences the planning and development of highways,
hospitals, and businesses, and has a direct bearing on electoral representation and redistricting; and

including racial minorities, immigrants, young children, tenants, and low-income households, among
others, and an outreach strategy must be developed and implemented to include them in the Census; and

have a disparate impact on residents in hard-to-count communities who are more likely to face barriers
created by the digital divide; and
WHEREAS, a united voice from businesses, government, community and faith based organizations,
educators, media and others will allow the 2020 Census message to reach a broader audience, providing
trusted advocates who can spark positive conversations about the 2020 Census ensuring that all
communities are informed about the importance of the 2020 United States Census and that every resident
is counted; and
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board President create a Complete
Count Committee and appoint a Chair of the Committee, as well as the chairs of subcommittees that are
representative of, and are directed to develop locally relevant outreach to all Cook County communities;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Complete Count Committee shall report to the Cook County Board
of Commissioners on the development of a comprehensive outreach strategy on a bi-monthly basis leading
up to the 2020 Census that shall include, but not be limited to sponsorship and partner funding initiatives
to encourage participation in the 2020 census, the establishment and support of school-based outreach
programs, partnerships with philanthropic organizations, non-profit community based organizations, and
multi-lingual, multi-media campaigns designed to ensure an accurate and complete count of Cook County's
population.

OF

WORKER

WHEREAS, a “worker cooperative” is a business that is cooperatively owned and controlled by
itsworkers; and
WHEREAS, the worker cooperative model has proven to be an effective tool for creating and maintaining
sustainable, dignified jobs; generating wealth; improving the quality of life of workers; and promoting
community and local economic development, particularly for people who lack access to conventional
means of business ownership; and
WHEREAS, many worker cooperatives in the United States today were designed to improve low- wage
jobs and build wealth in communities most directly affected by inequality; and
WHEREAS, a 2009 University of Wisconsin study reported that there are an estimated 350 worker
cooperatives throughout the country with a combined estimated total revenue of $365 million, and it is
believed these estimates are much larger today; and
WHEREAS, the local economy has lost thousands of well-paying manufacturing jobs that have mostly
been replaced by minimum or low-wage service industry work and has expanded barriers to economic
mobility for people of color, returning citizens, and immigrants; and
WHEREAS, there is a growing number of worker cooperatives throughout Cook County that currently
lack access to capital, public awareness of the worker cooperative model, training and support services, and
also face significant legal complexity; and
WHEREAS, the mandate of the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development includes fostering
business growth, attraction, and retention; supporting workforce development, job creation, and sustainable
employment; and, encouraging sustainable community investment; and
WHEREAS, worker cooperatives employ less common governance and financial structures, and because
the County currently lacks programming and resources to help these beneficial enterprises thrive; now,
therefore,
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners supports the
development and growth of worker cooperatives; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners celebrates the
tremendous benefits of worker cooperatives in Cook County and supports the movement to create more
worker cooperatives throughout the region; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development is encouraged to
consider use of community development block grant (CDBG) funding where appropriate and other
appropriate sources of funding to support local worker cooperatives and cooperative conversions,
strengthen existing organizations that are incubating and training worker cooperatives in Cook County, and
help to equip other organizations to provide such services, focusing on services to low‐income residents or
in underserved areas; and
