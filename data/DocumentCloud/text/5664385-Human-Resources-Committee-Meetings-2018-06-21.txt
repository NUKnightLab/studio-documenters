 More Than Just Diversity,
HR Must Develop a Cultural Competence
• We are facing a dynamic and consistent cultural shift in the U.S.
• To ensure competitive advantage HR professionals need to be
aware of the new cultural dynamics and become competent in
the cultural diversity of the workforce of the future.
• Population research conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau
indicates that by 2020 over 50% of the children in the U.S. will
be majority-minority, and by 2044 the general adult population
will follow suit.

CCHHS Human Resources Committee I 06/21/2018

 Federal Mandates and Regulations
• Title VI of the Civil Rights of 1964 considers the denial or delay
of medical care due to language barriers to be discrimination.
• Similarly, any medical facility receiving Medicare or Medicaid
must provide language assistance to limited English proficiency
(LEP) patients.
• In addition, The Joint Commission, requires that interpretation
and translation services be provided as necessary.

 What is Diversity and Inclusion?

organizational differences and similarities. It is
who we are and how we live. Diversity is about
understanding and maximizing differences – the
variety of perspectives, opinions and
contributions that we each bring to the business
• Inclusion is about leveraging diversity to create
an environment and culture that is welcoming,
collaborative and productive
