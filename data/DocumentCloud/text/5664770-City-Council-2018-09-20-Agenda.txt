West Madison Street and North Aberdeen Street; Stop Sign, Stopping west and
eastbound traffic on West Madison Street at North Aberdeen Street. Not
Recommended. West Madison Street is a minor arterial roadway with significantly
higher traffic volumes than North Aberdeen Street, a local roadway that is offset at
West Madison Street. Stop Signs on streets with higher volumes such as West
Madison Street tend to increase rear-end crashes, increase congestion, and create a
false sense of security for pedestrians that every vehicle will stop. Stop compliance is
particularly low at T-intersections. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend an AllWay
Stop Sign at this intersection -- (18-02284598) [Or2018-378]

West Jackson Boulevard and South Sangamon Street; Stop Sign, Stopping eastbound
traffic on West Jackson Boulevard at South Sangamon Street. West Jackson
Boulevard is a major collector roadway with significantly higher traffic volumes than
South Sangamon Street a local roadway. Stop Signs on streets with higher volumes
such as West Jackson Boulevard tend to increase rear-end crashes, increase
congestion, and create a false sense of security for pedestrians that every vehicle will
stop. Additionally, the 25th Ward has recently funded two curb extensions on the west
leg of West Jackson Boulevard at South Sangamon Street. These bump-outs should
improve pedestrian safety by narrowing the crossing distance across West Jackson
Boulevard. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend an AllWay Stop Sign at this
location. The funded curb extensions at this intersection will improve pedestrian
visibility and safety -- (18-02284195) lOr201B-3771

West Madison Street and North Carpenter Street; Stop Sign, stopping west and
eastbound traffic on West Madison Street at North Carpenter Street. Not
Recommended. West Madison Street is a minor arterial roadway with significantly
higher traffic volumes than North Carpenter Street, a local roadway. Stop on streets
with higher volumes such as West Madison Street tend to increase rear-end crashes,
increase congestion, and create a false sense of security for pedestrians that every
vehicle will stop. Stop compliance is pafiicularly low at T-intersections. Additionally,
due to this intersection's proximity to the traffic signal at West Madison Street and
West Morgan Street, a stop sign at North Carpenter Street will be unexpected for
drivers. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend an All Way Stop Sign at this
intersection -- (1 8-0228551 2) [Or20 18-376]
