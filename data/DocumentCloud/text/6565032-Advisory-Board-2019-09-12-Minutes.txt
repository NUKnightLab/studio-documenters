NOFA 2019 RECOMMENDED STRATEGY APPROACH

 

Review of Cuvahoga County NOFA F2515

Annual Renewal Demand (ARD) is $27,860,355.

1.
Bonus Amount at 5% $1,393,106
3. DV-Bonus Application Set aside by HUD
4. HUD will award project funding according to the ranking of projects as submitted by the up
to 94% of the total ARD as Tier 1, with the remaining 6% amount in Tier 2.
Gaps

The Strategy Work Group identified these gaps which could be addressed through Reallocation or
Bonus funding in the FY2019 NOFA:

1. "Additional PSH for highly vulnerable and long term homeless populations including Youth and
Families. Dedicated Plus PSH would respond to this need

2. Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) Staffing and System support. The OHS is the
System Administrator for the HMIS. Cuyahoga County has over 120 End Users and 320 project
profiles; the system includes integrated data from the SSVF (VA), PATH (SAMHSA), and Runaway
and Homeless Youth Act systems. Additional staff are needed to manage the System
Management requirements. I

3. CH PSH fer Front Steps, St. Joseph?s Commons. Front Steps is adding 8 units of to the
new development. These units require rent subsidies to support the overall Project financials.

Recommendations

The NOFA Strategy Work Group recommends the following:

1. Include all RENEWAL projects recommended by the Review Committee

2. Include NEW projects which are responsive to the identified gaps and recommended by the
Review Committee;

3. Prioritize new projects utilizing REALLOCATED funds over new projects that use BONUS dollars
only. -

4. Bonus Projects will be ranked below Renewal and Reallocation Projects.

5. Bonus Projects will be ranked among themselves according to a final vote of the OHS Advisory
Board, based on the Review Committee Final Recommendations.

6. Include a Planning Grant Application in the amount of $250,000. The Planning Grant is not
ranked so will not impact the possibility of funding for any other applications.

MEENT I: 

The Cuyahoga County Continuum of Care submitted an application in Round 3 of Youth Homeless 
Demonstration Project (YHDP) Availability. This was a collaborative application with support from the
Youth Advisory Board of A Place 4 Me;the'Sisters of Charity Foundation, County Department 'of Child
Welfare; and others.

We have requested feedback from HUD on our Application Submission and scoring to understand how 
we could improve the CoC?s request if there is another round of funding announced and if the and

partners decide to apply again.

EVen without funds, the and Young Adult partners have done a let to
respond to .Youth homelessness:







Established a By Name Listof'homeiess sheltered and unsheltered Young Adults and

implemented processes to track all identified Young Adults to link them with stable hoUsing;

Implemented Low Barrier RRH for Young Adults and continue to work to improve outcomes and
prevent returns to homelessness;

Expanded RRH subsidies in response to demonstrated need for additional months of assistance;
Tailored RRH services to be more Youth centric

Developing a Youth. Navigator position at Coordinated Entry

Engaged Peer navigators at the front door;

Created resources for housing kits

Access to a Family Therapist to support safe family reunifications when possible

Through the 2019 NOFA, requesting funds to increase PSH for Young Adults.

Even without receiving YHDP funds; the and Young Adult Partners will continue towork
collaboratively to and youth homelessness:





Planning resources are committed to refresh the Strategic Plan to Reduce and End Youth
Homelessness;

Focus on developing partnerships and leveraging resources with systems that touch youth
before they become homeless, Justice, Child Welfare, Mental health; Youth Employment;
Identifying additionai local and federal resources as appropriate to support these efforts.
