RE: Request for the Establishment of an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act (OPRA)
District at 40 Hague Street, Detroit, Michigan 48202 for RainCheck Development,
LLC

Honorable City Council:

Please accept this letter as a request to establish an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District
(OPRD) for the property located at 40 Hague Street, Detroit, Michigan 48202, which is referred
to herein as the ?Property" and described on Attachment A. The Property will be rehabilitated by
the petitioner and current owner, RainCheck Development, LLC.

Company and Project Synopsis

RainCheck Development, LLC (the "Developer") is led by Neal Check. Mr. Check serves as the
manager and has worked more than 25 years in the low voltage industry. providing lighting,
security, entertainment systems, and home automation services via SoundCheck, lnc. Check
then combined his extensive tech-based knowledge with a passion for developing construction
projects, kicking off a new venture in single family residential development that feature smart-
home technology. Thus, TechHome Building Co., LLC was formed. Currently, RainCheck
Development has a new townhome development undenivay on 4th Street in Midtown Detroit that
highlights these smart home features. Their development experiences continues in New Center,
where RainCheck has purchased and is renovating the historic Sanders Confectionery on
Woodward Avenue.

The proposed OPRD contains three parcels. 40 Hague contains the current building and is
approximately 0.49 acres. 8524 Woodward Avenue is approximately 0.16 acres contains the
southwestern parking lot. The third and final parcel at 59 East Philadelphia Street is the
southeastern parking lot and is approximately 0.86 acres. The property is roughly bounded by
Hague Street to the northwest, an alleyway to the northeast, the property line and East
Philadelphia Street to the southeast, and Woodward Avenue to the southwest. The OPRD is
located in the North End Neighborhood of Detroit with the northern terminus of the Q-Line
located approximately one-half mile south along Woodward. The property is currently occupied
by a vacant 2-story office building totaling approximately 37,000 square feet and two parking
lots. The building was previously occupied by the nonprofit World Hope.

The proposed project will entail the rehabilitation of the current building into 38 residential
apartment units. Each unit will include new, modern appliances, and feature open, loft-style floor
plans. As part of the rehabilitation, the building will receive new utility distribution including
electrical and plumbing, new energy ef?cient heating, cooling and ventilation systems, new
energy efficient windows and doors, kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, appliances, and fixtures,

an improved access stairwell, and repairs to the building structure as needed. The structure will
also be brought up to code, as applicable.

The Necessity for Tax Relief

Substantial investment is necessary to rehabilitate the area into a viable, long?term
development. Additionally, the underutilized property will require repair and selective demolition
with the property rehabilitation. The overall internal rate of return for the proposed development
will be extremely low without the receipt of the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District (and
Certificate). and therefore, the development would not be possible without it. 

The costs associated with the rehabilitation require multiple capital sources including equity
contributed by 40 Hague. Members as well as an interim construction loan, and upon
completion, a long-term loan product. In order to secure this financing and future tenants, the
operating costs of the proposed renovations and redevelopment of the project need to be kept
as low as possible (including property taxes).

PA 146 Request
A 12-year abatement is being requested.
Economic Advantages of the Rehabilitation

Upon completion, the Development will return an obsolete property to productive use and will
increase residential density in an area characterized by disinvestment. Activation of this
property will spur further growth and act as a catalyst for future redevelopment of numerous
vacant and blighted properties along Hague Street, and the Woodward Avenue corridor of the
North End Neighborhood, providing spinoff consumer spending in an area that is currentiy left

out of redevelopment planning.

The granting of the OPRA tax abatement will not result in any fewer taxes to the City of Detroit
in the short?term or long-term. On a short?term basis approximately 18 construction jobs will be
created. The general contractor, Monahan Co, has several Detroit-based subcontractors that
they have used in the past and that they have requested bids from to ensure Detroit-based

contractors and workers benefit from the redevelopment.

Upon successful redevelopment, the proposed redevelopment associated with the Development
will create approximately one full-time equivalent (FTE) job related to the management and
maintenance of the prOperty. This new job. along with the new residents living at the
development, will generate increased income taxes for the City of Detroit.

Following expiration of the 12-year abatement the building will deliver a significant increase in
tax revenue. Over time, the successful redevelopment and cultural growth will a positive impact

on the neighborhood.

Closing

RainCheck Development, LLC, is composed of seasoned professionals with extensive
experience in residential development throughout Metro Detroit.

Description of Proposed Use

The proposed redevelopment will create additional housing and increased residential density in
an area of the North End Neighborhood that has been behind the curve for investment and
redevelopment. The proposed project will entail the rehabilitation of the current building into 38
5 Concept rendering of the proposed development Lizsgg??ldjvi?gysg?t unitinCl-Urg:
approximately 38,700 square feet of
living space, divided into two
studios, 28 one-bedroom units, and
eight two?bedroom layouts. Each
unit will include modern, open, loft-
style floor plans. A minimum of 20%
of the units will be priced to meet
affordable unit requirements for
. 80% of the Area Median Income
(AMI).

 

Greenspace will be incorporated throughout the development; a landscaped interior courtyard will
feature eating areas and a rooftop garden offers a unique place for residents to relax and
entertain. Further greenspace will be created by converting the western parking lot (8524
Woodward Avenue) into a fenced private park for residential use.

room for apartment units. The building will receive new utilities including electrical and plumbing,
new energy efficient heating, cooling and ventilation systems for each individual unit, new energy
efficient windows and doors. Kitchens and bathrooms will receive new cabinetry, appliances, and
fixtures. A new access stair tower will be constructed which will lead to the roof top garden and
sitting area. An open-air courtyard will be created in the center of the building to provide an
outdoor eating space. Repairs to the building structure will be completed as needed, and made
include replacing the roofing system, stone masonry repair, and other activities to honor the
building?s historic appearance. The structure will also be brought up to code, as applicable.

Furthermore, the western parking lot, 8524 Woodward Avenue will be improved as a private park

Statement of Economic Advantages

The proposed Development will bring needed investment to a vacant area of Detroit?s North End
Neighborhood. The Development will increase residential density in an area that is characterized
by vacancy and has the perception of being unsafe. Activation of this property will spur further
growth and in?ll development, and act as a catalyst for future redevelopment of numerous vacant
and blighted properties along the Woodward Avenue corridor and the surrounding neighborhoods
and provide spinoff consumer spending in the North End.

The granting of the tax abatement will not result in any fewer taxes to the City of Detroit in the
short?term or long?term. Upon successful redevelopment, the Development will generate
increased property taxes, through the newly renovated apartment building.

On a short?term basis approximately 18 full-time equivalent (FTE) construction jobs will be created
for a construction period of approximately 8-12 months.

On a long?term basis the proposed redevelopment associated with the District will create
approximately one FTE job and anticipated to house approximately 82 new Detroit residents
within the 38 units. Therefore. it is anticipated the City of Detroit will collect approximately 2.4%
income tax per resident per year. The table below illustrates the resident tax impact the

development will have following completion.

Detroit?s North End Neighborhood was once an important hub of automobile production in the
early 20th century, housing more than 50,000 workers. Additionally, several popular Motown
musicians including Aretha Franklin and Diana Ross called the neighborhood home. The North
End is just beginning its renaissance of infill housing projects to revitalize a vibrant neighborhood.
The proposed 40 Hague Redevelopment project is part of the neighborhood's transitional area

between the commercial nature of Woodward Avenue and the residential neighborhood branching
east. The 40 Hauge Redevelopment works to transform an underutilized Property into a
contemporary residential apartment building and will increase residential density in an area that
is characterized by vacancy and has the perception of being unsafe. Investment such as this will
help create an integrated and vibrant North End for all Detroiters.

Following expiration of the 12?year abatement the building will deliver a signi?cant increase in tax
revenue. Over time, the successful redevelopment and cultural growth will have a city?wide

impact.

RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Obsolete Property District (PA 146) at 40 Hague Street and 59 E.

[Petition #895]
DATE: June 13, 2019
CC: Maurice Cox, Director, Planning and Development
Kevin Schronce, Central Region, Planning and Development

In order to ensure that the creation of an Obsolete Property District is in conformance with the City?s
Master Plan Of Policies and will have the reasonable likelihood to increase commercial activity; create,
retain or prevent a loss of employment; revitalize an urban area; or increase the number of residents in
a community, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public Act 146 of 2000 (section 125.2788), the Planning and
Development Department submits the following interpretation. The Petitioner is RainCheck

Development LLC

Location and Project Proposal: 40 Hague Street and 59 East Philadelphia Street

Note: 40 Hague Street and 59 East Philadelphia Street; 8524 Woodward Avenue is an address that does
not exist and may be a retired parcel. According to city records, the property located at indicated 8524
Woodward is absorbed into the parcel with the address of 40 Hague Street.

The project proposal seeks to renovate existing structure to create 38 residential apartment units and
parking lot improvements on 59 E. Philadelphia Street. The proposed development will include 36,700
square feet of living space divided into 2 studios, 28 one-bedroom units, and 8 two-bedroom layouts. A
minimum of 20% of units will be priced to meet affordable unit requirements for 80% of the Area
Median income. Greenspace will be incorporated throughout the development; a landscaped interior
courtyard will feature eating areas and a rooftop garden. Further greenspace will be created by
converting western parking lot into a fenced private park for residential use.

Master Plan Interpretation
The subject sites are located on areas designated as Neighborhood Commercial and Low/Medium

Density Residential (RLM)

The subject site area is designated Neighborhood Commercial (CN). Neighborhood Commercial Districts
generally consist of a large collection Of contiguous storefronts along a street or streets. This commercial
type is pedestrian oriented with wide sidewalks and landscaping. Parking should be on the street, in
structures (with ground floor retail), at the rear of commercial establishments or in concentrated nodes
at the periphery of the area. In addition to commercial uses, Neighborhood Commercial areas may also
include institutional uses such as libraries and post offices.

 

 

The subject site area is designated Low/Medium Density Residential (RLM). Low/Medium Density
Residential areas should have an overall density of 8 to 16 dwelling units per net residential acre. The
areas are often characterized by two or four family homes with small yards, on-street parking, or
garages with alley access. The residential classifications allow for neighborhood?scale commercial
development. For instance, in a Low/Medium Density Residential area, small scale commerce 
convenience stores) should exist to serve residents' day-to-day needs.

The following policies of the Middle Woodward neighborhood describe the following recommendations:
. Goal: 3 Increase Residential Density
Policy 3.1 Develop East and West Grand Boulevard, and Woodward as a high-density mixed use
area, with housing and ground-floor commercial

The project proposal seeks to convert the interior of an existing structure that states former building
operations to include residence, printing and engraving services, professional offices, schools, and
automotive sales and services into high-density residential. The subject site is zoned B4 where multi-
family dwellings are conditional. The proposed impacts are primarily internal within the structure with
external landscaping upgrades and are not believed to have a negative impact on the character of the
surrounding area.

The proposed development conforms to the Future General Land Use recommendations for
this area.

Re: Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District RainCheck Development LLC

Parcel Numbers: 01002660-0 and 01002605?7

Dear Mr. Cox;

The Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of the Assessor, has reviewed the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
District located at 40 Hague and 50 E. Philadelphia in the North End neighborhood in the City of Detroit.

The rationale for creating Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Districts under PA 146 of 2000, as amended, is based on the
anticipation of increased market value upon completion of new construction and /Or significant rehabilitation of existing
commercial property and commercial housing property. Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not
necessarily generate additional market value.

RainCheck Development LLC intends to rehabilitate the building into 38 loft style residential units with modern appliances.
The two-story building at 40 Hague is currently vacant and consist of 36,944 square feet of office building area, built in 1935
and situated on .658 acres of land. The property at 58 E. Philadelphia consists ofa paved parking lot on .430 acres ofland.
Rehabilitation will include new utility distribution, including electrical and plumbing, new energy efficient heating, cooling
and ventilation systems, new energy ef?cient windoWs and doors, kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, fixtures and an
improved access to the stairwell with repairs to the building structure as needed.

This property meets the criteria set forth under PA 146 of 2000, as amended. It applies to blighted, functionally obsolete
and contaminated properties. "Rehabilitation," meaning that changes to qualified facilities that are required to restore or
modify the property, together with all appurtenances, to an economically efficient condition. Rehabilitation also includes
major renovation and modification including, but not necessarily limited to, the improvement of floor loads, correction of
de?cient or excessive height, new or improved fixed building equipment, including heating, ventilation, and lighting,
reducing multistory facilities to or 2 stories, adding additional stories to a facility or adding additional space on the same
floor level not to exceed 100% of the existing floor space on that floor level, improved structural support including
foundations, improved roof structure and cover, floor replacement, improved wall placement, improved exterior and
interior appearance of buildings, and other physical changes required to restore or change the obsolete property to an
economically efficient condition.

A field investigation indicated that the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District located at 40 Hague and 50 E.
Philadelphia is eligible as it pertains to the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act under PA. 146 of 2000, as amended.

- Most recent use: Vacant since 1979

Number of stories: 14

- Square footage: 122,745

B. General description of the proposed use of the rehabilitated facility:

Mixed-use project including first floor retail and approximately 110 hotel rooms, 2,000
SF meeting room space, food and beverage, gourmet pantry, and a roof-top outdoor
patio.

C. Description of the general nature and extent of the rehabilitation to be undertaken:

The rehabilitation includes the complete replacement of all exterior glass,
refurbishment of other exterior elements, the demolition of the existing interior
partitions, build-out of hotel rooms, and the revamping of the surrounding property
with new landscaping and hardscaping.

D. A descriptive list of the ?xed building equipment that will be a part of the
rehabilitated facility:

The facility will have new HVAC equipment installed on the roof and new fan coil units
throughout the new apartment floors. There will also be a centralized domestic hot

water system supplied with water heaters. New elevators will also be installed.

- Completion of construction documentation Complete
- Financial closing and construction commencement Complete
0 Construction completion Dec. 2018

F. Statement of economic advantages

The rehabilitation of the facility would not be undertaken without the applicant?s
receipt of the exemption certificate. The tax relief is imperative for Developer to
proceed with this project. Without such relief, the project would not be able to offer a
competitive lease rate to other properties in the neighborhood, all of which have
received similar tax abatements. If the planned investments were undertaken without
the benefit of this abatement, the resulting tax burden on the building would generate a
negative cash flow, and as such, the project could not be financed.

The economic benefits of this project are significant. Apart from saving an important
and historic property from near-certain demolition, the project will generate up to 200
construction jobs and up to 25 permanent jobs, associated with the operation of the
hotel. In addition, the delivery of 110 new hotel rooms to this important corner will
continue the evolution of the Central Business District into a high-density hotel
neighborhood, which in turn, will support the increasing number of entertainment and
conference activities that will be coming to the city.

RE: Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Certificate - Metropolitan Hotel Partners LLC
Property Address: 33 John Street
Parcel Number: 01004065-7.

Dear Mr. Cox:

The Of?ce of the Chief Financial Officer, Of?ce of the Assessor, has reviewed the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
certi?cate application for the property located at 33 John Street in the Downtown area in the City of Detroit.

The rationale for granting Obsolete Property Rehabilitation certificates under PA 146 of 2000, as amended, is based on the
anticipation of increased market value upon completion of new construction and [or significant rehabilitation of existing commercial
property and commercial housing property. Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not necessarily generate
additional market value.

Metropolitan Hotel Partners LLC plans to rehabilitate the vacant 14 story office building that is in a state of disrepair built in 1925
on .170 acres of land. The rehabilitated building will transformed into a mixed-use project including ?rst floor retail and
approximately 110 hotel rooms, 2,000 square foot meeting room space, food and beverage, gourmet pantry and a roof-top
outdoor patio.

The 2018 values are as follows:

 

 

Land
Building Assessed Building Ans-330d Value Land
Parcel Address Value (SEV) Taxable Value (SEV) Taxable Value
01004065-7 33 JOHN 38,900 34.235 $185700 5163.430

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This property meets the criteria set forth under PA 146 of 2000, as amended. It applies to blighted, functionally obsolete and
contaminated properties. "Rehabilitation," meaning that changes to qualified facilities that are required to restore or modify the
property, together with all appurtenances, to an economically ef?cient condition.

The proposed rehabilitation plan includes complete replacement of all exterior glass, refurbishment of exterior elements,
demolition of existing interior partitions, build-out of hotel rooms and revamping of the surrounding property with new
landscaping and hardscaping. The ?nished project will save a historic property, create jobs in the Downtown area and support
increasing number of entertainment and conference activities that will be coming to the city.

A field investigation indicated that the property located at 33 John Street is eligible as it pertains to the Obsolete Property
Rehabilitation Act under PA. 146 of 2000, as amended.

RE: Petition for the Establish menl of a Commercial Rehabilitation District at 3750 Woodward
Avenue, Detroit, Michigan.

Honorable City Council:

On behalf of 3750 Woodward Avenue, LLC, please accept this letter as a request to establish a
Commercial Rehabilitation District for the mixed-use development proiect knows as ?The
Mid" (3750 Woodward Avenue) in Midtown Detroit, located between Woodward and John and
shown more precisely on the map in Attachment A.

The Mid will be a 3.8-acre mixed-use development carefully planned to offer diverse programs,-
including retail, hotel, housing, and dining experiences with interwoven public spaces for community,
resident, and visitor engagement and connectivity. The Mid's planned investment exceeds $350
million and will create over 1,800 construction iobs and 400+ full-time equivalent positions (FTEs).
The proiect is expected to commence construction in the 3rd quarter of 2019 and be fully completed
by 2024.

This development aims to unite the surrounding community and residents across a range of
backgrounds and lifestyles. The Mid plans to incorporate a 225 room hotel, approximately 80,000
square feet of retail space, hundreds of multi-family residences, affordable housing, co-living
housing units and 60 residential condominiums. The proiect will offer alternatives for family and
communal living supported by eateries, entertainment and public amenities.

The Mid requires significant investment and development risk and would not be possible without
incentives, including the property tax exemption certificates provided for under the establishment of
a Commercial Rehabilitation District.

We are requesting that the CRD be applicable to the development proiect area for a period of ten
(10) years. The development area is eligible for CRD designation pursuant to Section 2(a) of Public
Act 210 of 2005, the Commercial Rehabilitation Act. The proiect site is a ?Qualified Facility" within
the meaning of MCL The requested district is both compact and contiguous as
understood under the Act and exceeds 3 acres in area.

The CRD will lead to construction of new hotel, retail and residential housing in keeping with the city
of Detroit Master Plan and the Woodward Avenue Gateway Radial Thoroughfare Overlay.

STEWARDS OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENTTM

We respectfully request your consideration of a Commercial Rehabilitation District for the proiect.
Please do not hesitate to call me at 31 3-408-5384 with any questions.
