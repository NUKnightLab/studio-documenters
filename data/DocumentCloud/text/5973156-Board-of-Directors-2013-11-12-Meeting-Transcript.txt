MR. BEITLER:

It's going to be a little

2

bit tougher today because there are people on the

3

phone, so I would appreciate everybody's indulgence

4

as we host the meeting with the individuals on the

5

phone including the Chairman.

6

One thing we need to do because we

7

have a stenographer with us today as usual is to

8

ensure that everybody lets her know whom is

9

speaking and particularly the folks on the phone.

10

It's really important that you identify yourselves

11

and so first before we begin -- before the Chairman

12

begins the meeting, if I could just ask everybody

13

on the phone to identify who's on the phone so

14

we'll have an idea who is there and so that the

15

stenographer can make sure she's got you from an

16

attendance standpoint, I'd appreciate that.

17
18

So if you would, starting off with
the Chairman, please.

This is Damon Silvers from the Advisory.

David Dohnalek is on the

We did.

Thank you, Damon.

Anyone else?
(No response.)

Mr. Chairman.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

Let me call the

meeting to order.
As you can see, we have a small

17

agenda, but I think we have a few things that we

18

want to talk about, and obviously it's all on the

19

Retrofit Project that we left our last meeting on,

20

and so I want to start on that particular subject

21

with Steve giving us a brief update on the deal

22

itself and some of the financials since we haven't

23

really talked about it, and then I'd like to have

24

Scott Falk give us an update on where the officers

 4
1

are documented.

2

Then I want to open it up to the

3

Board for comments on the information we received

4

since the subsequent -- since the last meeting and

5

then go into the resolution itself.

6

Following that, although not on the

7

agenda, I do want to open it up to public comments.

8

I don't know if we have public there or not, but

9

John can sort of deal with that since you're there

10

in person, but I think we need to have that as long

11

as there are public there.

12
13
14

So with that, Steve, why don't you
start?
MR. BEITLER:

So I just wanted to start

15

briefly with a reminder for those people who hadn't

16

thought about this lately, and frankly I'm probably

17

among you, in terms of what the broader

18

implications of the program are.

19

So from a big picture perspective,

20

we're looking at 75 buildings being part of the

21

program for a total of 5.9 million square feet.

22

This includes 23 libraries, 25 police stations and

23

buildings used principally by the police, 11

24

facilities that provide healthcare including

 5
1

community centers and facilities for the disabled

2

and aging, including centers in West Town,

3

Englewood, Uptown and Roseland.

4

We're also renovating many unique

5

City properties including City Hall, the Cultural

6

Center, the 311 Center, the 911 Center, the

7

juvenile detention facility, the Police Academy and

8

Fire Academy among others, so the projects that

9

compose this project will be completed in 40

10

different wards of the City.

11

And we expect to have savings in the

12

neighborhood of $2,000,000 per year and annual

13

reductions in energy of 23.23 million kilowatts and

14

515,000 therms which is a reduction of about 18

15

percent of the energy used in the buildings in the

16

program, and it's the equivalent of taking about

17

4.323 cars off the road on an annual basis.

18

Additionally, the program will generate about 125

19

jobs.

20

So just as an overview of the

21

program, I wanted everybody to be aware of that

22

since we tended to talk about the transaction more

23

than we have the broad scope of the program lately.

24

And with that, I'd like to turn it

 6
1

over as the Chairman directed to Scott Falk who's

2

going to talk a little bit about the transaction

3

between when we last met and today.

4
5

MR. FALK:

Great.

Thank you, Steve.

As a recap, we -- as people I think

6

know, the Trust issued RFPs to financial advisors

7

back in August.

8

advisor presentations through addendums to the RFPs

9

in September and then again in October.

We then refined those financial

10

Ultimately the Trust determined to

11

engage Piper Jaffray as the lead placement agent.

12

It then determined to engage one or more

13

co-placement agents to support Piper Jaffray in

14

their effort in the placement of the financing to

15

support the purchases of the equipment that will

16

underlie the retrofitting of the 2FM facilities.

17

Since last week we discussed the

18

term sheet that was presented to the lenders that

19

Piper Jaffray is soliciting for proposals to

20

participate in the financing.

21

That term sheet was subsequently

22

distributed to the Board with annotated cross

23

references to the various deal documents that are

24

referenced in the term sheet.

Those deal documents

 7
1

include an energy services agreement between the

2

Trust and the City of Chicago.

3

between the Trust and financing source is yet to be

4

determined pursuant to Piper Jaffray's placement

5

work.

6

between the ESCOs that have been engaged for this

7

project on the one hand and the City on the other

8

will, in turn, be backstopped by the project

9

management agreement between the Chicago

A loan agreement

A guaranteed energy performance contract

10

Infrastructure Trust and the ESCOs.

11

management agreement has yet to be completed or

12

negotiated, but it is in process.

13

That project

Those documents were, with the

14

exception of that project management agreement

15

that's in process, those documents were distributed

16

to the Board over the weekend in substantially

17

negotiated form except for the loan agreement

18

which, of course, is subject to negotiation with

19

the financing sources when they're identified.

20

Those documents will continue to evolve a little

21

bit, but what we're asking for today is the

22

approval of the Trust Board of those documents in

23

substantially consistent form with those presented

24

to the Board over the weekend.

To the extent that

 8
1

there are any material changes inconsistent with

2

the documents presented over the weekend, the Trust

3

staff would expect to come back to the Board for

4

further approval of any of those material changes.

5

MR. BEITLER:

6

Mr. Chairman.

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

8
9

Thank you.

Thank you, Scott.

So I would ask if the Board has all
gotten copies of these documents.

10

At this point I would open it up for

11

any comments, questions regarding the documents if

12

there are any, and then I would like to move on

13

with the resolution.

14
15

Scott, are there any questions or
comments?

16

Any comments on the resolution itself?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Yeah, James, this is

17

David.

18

give my thoughts about how we've moved from the

19

last meeting and asked some questions.

20

Let me make some comments since -- I'll

Let me say by opening I very much

21

appreciate the hard work of everyone -- Steve,

22

Claire, Scott, Henry, the other advisors -- since

23

the last meeting.

24

to where we are today.

Everyone's worked hard to get us

 9
1

You know, when we last saw each

2

other last week, we had not seen the September

3

document that had been sent to the potential

4

private placement agents that laid out the likely

5

contours of our transactions and contained some of

6

the key terms.

7

We've received that now.
We hadn't seen the term sheet that

8

was issued at the end of October that was sent out

9

to the potential lenders by the private placement

10

agent Piper Jaffray.

11

We've seen that now.

We hadn't seen the drafts of the

12

relevant agreements because those hadn't been

13

created yet but those -- we've received those now,

14

and we had only belatedly shortly before the

15

meeting been provided a very short summary of the

16

term sheet.

17

Today we're in a different position.

18

We've been provided all those documents.

19

a chance to review those and given the opportunity,

20

been given the opportunity to consult with the

21

Trust's legal and financial advisors.

22

opportunity to do that, and I have found that very

23

helpful, and I appreciated that.

24

We've had

I've had the

I can only just obviously state this

 10
1

from my own perspective, but I think that that

2

process is critical because it makes our review

3

meaningful, and it allows us, gives us the ability

4

to describe in a meaningful fashion what is going

5

on, what we're approving, and it allows us to

6

recommend in a meaningful fashion what we're

7

approving which I think would always be important,

8

but it's especially important when what's going to

9

happen next is that the City Council will be called

10

upon to examine this and make a decision and

11

presumably among other things will be coming to us

12

and saying why did you recommend this, what do you

13

think about these documents, what do you think

14

about these details.

15

agreements and details in front of them, and so our

16

ability to be able to explain why we approved them

17

and agreed to them is I think important.

18

They will have those

So I think all along we -- you know,

19

this process has required us to ask do we

20

understand the potential risks and the potential

21

problems as well as, of course, the potential

22

upside.

23
24

I say, I would say that at least
personally I feel in a completely different

 11
1

position than at the last Board meeting because of

2

the work that everyone's done to get us this

3

information, so I appreciate that.

4

In terms of what I see as open

5

issues which I think the resolutions adequately

6

identify and, therefore, create a good path I

7

believe in terms of how to proceed but I'd like to

8

raise those and ask for some commentary on them.

9

The first one is -- we discussed

10

this somewhat I'd say briefly at the last meeting

11

and that's the question of ownership by the Trust

12

of the projects, meaning the energy conservation

13

measures, the boilers, the chillers, the other

14

things that are gonna be installed, operated and

15

maintained by the ESCOs.

16

the Trust to own them, and so there's I think some

17

legitimate questions about, well, what does that

18

mean, what are the contours and consequences of

19

that ownership, what is the potential liability to

20

the Trust if there is an accident in relation to

21

the equipment that causes significant damage.

22

Typically as an owner you would think, well, there

23

might be some liability here.

24

indemnification and insurance can cover that.

These documents call upon

Sometimes

 12
1

And I heard a couple things in

2

consulting on this that I just wanted to ask you,

3

Steve, to make sure that your understanding is

4

consistent with this.

5

The first is that the intent of the

6

overall transaction, the intent of these documents

7

that are still in flux on this point but the intent

8

is that while the Trust will own these ECMs, the

9

Trust will not be at material risk of liability or

10

financial responsibility for defending against

11

claims if there is, for instance, an accident or an

12

equipment malfunction.

13

accomplish that sounds like it's still being

14

determined which I think is fair and seems fine,

15

but I want to be clear that that's the intent, and

16

if so, then I think I'm comfortable with our moving

17

forward and getting a report subsequently about how

18

that was worked out.

19
20
21

How the agreements will

Am I understanding the intent
correctly?
MR. BEITLER:

You are, and there is an

22

insurance component of the transaction, and the

23

City provides that, and let's put the word

24

insurance in quotes because the City is

 13
1

self-insured for certain things.

2

here, they can discuss it if we need to, but an

3

insurance component of the transaction so that in

4

the event that something occurs, some mishap

5

occurs, that there is coverage for that purpose,

6

but not every detail around this is worked out yet.

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

Right.

Since the City is

So that's

8

consistent with what I heard, and I think that that

9

makes me feel comfortable in terms of the intent,

10

that if we land at that point, that that's where

11

the insurance obligation lies, that's fine.

12

I spent some time talking with Scott

13

Falk who is here and Michael Dow who's on the phone

14

of McGuire Woods who represents the Trust in this

15

transaction, and they said something similar to

16

what you said.

17

more because it hasn't been worked out.

18

been finalized in the documents which is a fair

19

point.

20

Although they were -- they hedged
It hasn't

So that's why I think what I

21

recommended as an outcome here is that the

22

resolutions identify this as an issue and state

23

that you'll come back to us once it's worked out in

24

the documents and report to us about how it's

 14
1

worked out so we can feel comfortable that the

2

documents wound up where our intent is.

3
4

So is that consistent with how you
see the process going?

5
6

MR. BEITLER:

Yes, I believe that's what

the resolution says, so --

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

Great.

I say that, you

8

know, knowing that I've talked with Scott and Mike

9

about this but also for the benefit of my fellow

10

Board members to know how this will hopefully play

11

out.

12
13

The second issue is that -CHAIRMAN BELL:

I think even more

14

importantly, David, it has to be that or they have

15

to come back to us, so we're not going to agree to

16

a deal that doesn't happen.

17

tenent of the terms, so --

18

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's part of the

That's right.

I think

19

that -- So to be clear, I think that what you're

20

saying, James, even though that is not an explicit

21

term, I would say the documents or the proposed

22

term sheet, I think what you're saying which is

23

what I'm saying is it's the understanding of the

24

Board that that's what the ownership arrangement

 15
1

will be and that if the ultimate deal documents are

2

inconsistent with that, they'll be inconsistent in

3

some material term and you'd have to come back to

4

us.

5

I would say but even if they are

6

consistent at least come back to us as a matter of

7

notifying and advising us about how it wound up and

8

how the documents accomplish that because I think

9

that's an open issue about how the documents are

10
11

going to accomplish that intent.
MR. BEITLER:

I believe staff is

12

basically committed to come back to the Board in

13

the event of any change, material change to the

14

current documentation.

15

stating that?

16

MR. FALK:

Is that a correct way of

Yeah.

I think there's --

17

there's also an affirmative obligation in the

18

resolutions for staff to report to the Board on

19

filling in the holes that still have yet to be

20

filled in and that is --

21
22
23
24

MR. BEITLER:

I guess what I'm saying is

yes, but it would apply to other things not just -MR. HOFFMAN:

Yeah, I agree.

I think on

this one though I'm presuming that's what's going

 16
1

to happen is these documents are going to be

2

consistent with everything we're saying today

3

regarding the intent about ownership.

4

MR. BEITLER:

I certainly hope so.

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's right.

And even if

6

that's the case, the resolution says come back to

7

us and let us know how you accomplished that which

8

is a matter of advising us about a consistent

9

condition but one that's not yet worked out.

10

The next issue, and you raised this

11

a bit, Scott, is that we still don't have an

12

agreement worked out or key terms worked out

13

regarding an agreement between the Trust and the

14

future construction manager, and that may end up

15

being the PBC.

16

entity that's been contemplated here.

17

terms of that are and whether it ends up being the

18

PBC is up in the air.

That's obviously been the main
What the

19

And having thought about that and

20

talked with our advisors, I think that's fine if

21

that's the state that that's in today and that we

22

are going forward with the approval of the deal

23

documents provided that, same scenario I would say,

24

provided that you come back to us once you've

 17
1

worked it out and explain what the terms are.

2

I think there's an overlap with the

3

first issue about ownership and protection from

4

liability because obviously, you know, unless I'm

5

wrong I don't think you're going to have Scott Falk

6

out there overseeing the ESCO to make sure they're

7

installing the equipment correctly, but our

8

construction manager is the one that will be in

9

charge of that oversight, and so selecting that

10

construction manager and having the right terms

11

with them, including indemnification and insurance,

12

will be important in answering the ownership

13

question.

14

So, Steve, am I understanding it

15

right both in terms of what's -- how that issue is

16

open and what will happen next?

17
18

MR. BEITLER:

us please announce themselves?

19
20

Could whoever just joined

MR. SILVERS:
Silvers.

I'm sorry.

This is Damon

I hung up by accident and rejoined you.

21

MR. BEITLER:

Thank you.

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

Steve, am I understanding

MR. BEITLER:

Oh, so I -- George

23
24

it right?

 18
1

Marquisos from the PBC is in the room, so, George,

2

if I misspeak, please feel free to correct me.

3

But clearly the ESCOs that we're

4

contemplating engaging for these projects,

5

Schneider Electric, Ameresco and Noresco, are the

6

construction managers for completing the

7

construction, and then the PBC or some other

8

organization, although there's not another

9

organization identified at the moment, would

10

provide oversight for that particular purpose.

11

So if that is the same as what you

12

just said, then -- I'm not sure -- I just want to

13

make clear the term construction management.

14

George, you're looking directly at me.

15

correctly relating that?

16

MR. MARQUISOS:

So,

Am I

Yeah, the terms are a

17

little bit -- so the role that we currently

18

contemplate -- so the ESCOs are described as a turn

19

key design builder, so they are responsible for the

20

audit, the design, the installation and the

21

performance of everything that they are contracted

22

to do.

23

product that you should -- that should meet every

24

specification that we lay out in advance of the

So they theoretically give you a finished

 19
1

contract.

2

But it should be known that there is

3

an owner's responsibility or in this case the CIT's

4

responsibility to kind of help them coordinate

5

these activities, so a representative, a program

6

manager.

7

The other complication we have here

8

is we have three ESCOs, and we want to make sure

9

that we're coordinating and making sure that they

10

are largely cohesive and are doing the same thing

11

throughout.

12

by 2FM, and so the role of the program manager, if

13

you will, is to kind of ensure that consistency and

14

make sure the goals are being followed throughout

15

the project.

16

There's a consistency that's required

That's what we're currently --

MR. BEITLER:

Yeah, so nothing that

17

George or I just said I think in any way

18

contradicts anything that you just stated.

19

I just want to be clear about the

20

idea of a construction manager role and the fact

21

that the ESCOs themselves are managing their

22

construction and that we're providing oversight for

23

that construction.

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yeah, that's how I see

 20
1

it -- as an oversight.

2

MR. BEITLER:

Right.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

I think the GEPC, whatever

4

that contract spells out to, calls that entity the

5

project and construction manager, so we'll enter

6

into an agreement with that future project and

7

construction manager.

8

seems like basically an oversight function which is

9

important that there be some entity that does that

10

because there's no one on our staff who is really

11

going to do that.

12

Just as you all said, it

So I think -- as I said, while that

13

is an open issue, and depending on those terms,

14

that could end up being important in terms of what

15

the consequences of our ownership are.

16

I'm comfortable saying that can

17

happen after today and after tomorrow.

Obviously

18

it has to happen relatively quickly, and the

19

resolutions state that you'll come back to us and

20

tell us how that wound up so that we can assess it.

21

The third and last open issue is

22

also handled by the resolution, and that is the

23

cost of doing these projects for 2FM and all these

24

different buildings is right about $25.8 million,

 21
1

and the expected value of the loan is gonna be

2

about $1.7 million.

3

exactly what the dollar amount is I don't believe.

4

And so the reason for that as I understand it is a

5

combination of initial interest payments and fees.

6

More than that, we don't know

And I think what I, and the

7

resolutions spell this out, think would be

8

appropriate for you to come back with in terms of

9

details once the transaction is finalized and the

10

agreements are finished is what those exact numbers

11

are and how they break down.

Presumably that --

12

let's say it's $1.7 million.

Presumably that would

13

mean you'd come back to us with a breakdown of the

14

$1.7 million -- X amount is interest payments in

15

this way, X amount is fees, here's how the fees are

16

broken down.

17

I think just in terms of our keeping

18

track of how the money is intended to be spent,

19

that would be information that we don't have now,

20

understandable we don't have it now, but we will

21

have it in the short-term future, and the

22

resolution calls upon you to come back to us with

23

that information.

24

I just want to make sure you didn't

 22
1

see any problem with that and that's consistent --

2

MR. BEITLER:

I agree.

We also actually

3

have a legal requirement to provide it to the City

4

Clerk or Treasurer, I forget which exactly, but

5

it's actually in the documentation buried somewhere

6

that it says we have other legal requirements to

7

provide that same information, not that that has

8

anything to do with the Board, but just simply we

9

have multiple legal requirements for that.

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

11

Good.

So I really wanted to, apart from

12

those, I wanted to ask about two broader questions,

13

one broad question and one sort of I think minor

14

issue.

15

One is:

So what is in your mind the

16

worst case scenario here?

17

risk?

18

agreements or this structure address it?

19

What is the biggest

What could go wrong here and how do the

MR. BEITLER:

I don't want to

20

minimize -- I mean risk is always an important

21

component of any transaction, so I suppose here

22

there are two types of risks that you have

23

addressed in some fashion or another.

24

is financial transaction risk, and the other is,

One of those

 23
1

let's call it construction risk or physical, you

2

know, the actual physical risk.

3

So this particular project is a very

4

basic project.

We are doing things here that are

5

known.

6

unknown.

7

heaters and insulation and other types of energy

8

conservation measures of that type or other HVAC

9

measures forever, literally 100 years.

There's nothing that we're doing that's
People have been installing chillers and

10

So the things that we're doing are

11

very known.

12

are very known.

13

with these activities.

14

The ways to accomplish these things
There's diminimus risk involved

So -- and there's not really

15

chillers or heaters or whatever blowing up all over

16

the place, you know, as a matter of course.

17

people who install these things just generally

18

speaking know what they're doing and tend to

19

generally do a good job in everyday life

20

accomplishing this.

21

The

There's nothing going on in our

22

projects that, for which we should have any other

23

expectation than that they will be accomplished in

24

a similar fashion.

 24
1

So I think that you can never

2

exclude the possibility that there will be some

3

sort of complication either down the road or during

4

construction that will cause something to happen

5

somewhere, but I would say that the risk is just

6

extremely diminimus and that it's not really

7

something that we should be overly concerned with

8

out of the normal course of activities.

9

In terms of financial transactional

10

risk, again, we sort of bear the normal risks that

11

anybody else would bear such as you have a

12

particular, you know, unemployment report and the

13

markets assume that the Fed may stop buying bonds

14

and the interest rates increase, so -- which was

15

sort of what happened if I remember correctly last

16

Friday.

17
18
19

MR. HOFFMAN:

Are you talking about the

risks before the transactions close?
MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

Yes, in terms of

20

interest rate creep or other things like that in

21

the financial markets.

22

There's also the possibility that as

23

the respondents to the placement agents -- agent

24

reviews or review the detail that we've provided

 25
1

there may be some projects they like, there may be

2

some projects they don't like, and there's the

3

tendency for some maybe to cherry pick, for others

4

to not cherry pick.

5

So these are all activities that

6

when you're privately placing like we're doing at

7

the moment are more common, and they're risks, but

8

they're, again, consistent, normal risks that

9

everybody has as they do these kinds of deals, and

10

I don't think that there's any particular risk that

11

we're facing at the moment that I would consider to

12

be an abnormal, unusual risk.

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

Can you answer the

14

financial transaction risks?

Assuming that the

15

deal closes within the interest rate parameters

16

that are set, so now we're a year from now, four

17

years from now, ten years from now.

18

that way.

19

risks to the City or the Trust, if any, from this

20

arrangement and how does the arrangement or the

21

documents address that?

22

MR. BEITLER:

Just assess it

What -- how do you see the financial

So the first thing is that

23

I would just tell you, in terms of answering your

24

question broadly, you know, I was a venture

 26
1

capitalist, and I used to see a lot of people

2

pitching for their company, and, you know, in order

3

to do different kinds of calculations you need five

4

years of numbers and so on.

5

people don't bother providing me year three through

6

five because I can make up those numbers as well as

7

you can.

8

Typically I would tell

So essentially I would say to you

9

that the ten year part of your question, you know,

10

getting out to a certain point, you know, it's the

11

typical crystal ball answer.

12

particular unique crystal ball, and it's kind of

13

tough to predict that far out.

14

I don't have a

Having said that, we're doing a

15

transaction that has some longevity to it, so

16

basically I believe that this is an excellent

17

transaction.

18
19

We are doing what will be the second
tax exempt --

20
21
22
23
24

MR. HOFFMAN:

But talk to me about the

MR. BEITLER:

Yeah, I'm headed there.

risks.

-- the second tax exempt energy
services agreement that will ever have been

 27
1

completed, and basically one of the hallmarks of

2

that particular agreement is if there's no savings,

3

then the City and the Trust don't have to pay.

4

essentially that is a particularly interesting

5

arrangement because I think it provides significant

6

protections for the purposes of ensuring that

7

adequate work is done to get the savings that are

8

contemplated.

9

then there are protections built in in the event

So

And if those savings don't arise,

10

that those savings don't occur, and I find that to

11

make this transaction extremely attractive and to

12

significantly reduce risk that you would otherwise

13

potentially anticipate in other types of

14

instruments.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

Let me ask a follow-up

16

about year ten.

17

ESCOs, their obligation to guarantee those savings,

18

that obligation is the same in year one, year five,

19

year ten, year twenty?

20
21
22

Under the agreements with the

MR. BEITLER:

It runs the term of the

MR. HOFFMAN:

So provided that the ESCOs

agreement.

23

are still in existence, the point that Damon raised

24

last time, provided that they're still in existence

 28
1

and able to make these payments, regardless of how

2

the machinery operates, regardless of what the

3

kilowatt per hour charge is ten years from now or

4

what the savings are, the City is not obligated and

5

the Trust is not obligated to pay more than the

6

expected savings; is that correct?

7

MR. BEITLER:

Yes, that's correct.

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

9

MR. BEITLER:

So -- And let me just say

10

that the three companies that are involved in this

11

particular transaction are extremely established,

12

highly regarded, well-run, very large companies

13

that have excellent balance sheets and who have

14

submitted their, you know, financial picture to --

15

for the purposes of being able to engage in this

16

transaction.

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

Right.

So, in other

18

words, whether it's year one, five, ten or twenty,

19

the risk of having to pay more than the guaranteed,

20

than the expected savings, that risk is effectively

21

laid off on the ESCOs?

22

MR. BEITLER:

Yes, that's correct.

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

Scott, is there --

24

MR. FALK:

Mike Dow, do you want to

 29
1

address for the Board the duration limitation on

2

the guarantee?

3

MR. DOW:

Well, as I understand it,

4

that's -- that point is in flux, if I'm not

5

mistaken.

6

Initially the guarantee period, the period during

7

which the ESCOs regard to guarantee certain

8

performance levels, guarantee savings was

9

essentially left in the full term of the

Maybe John Coan could weight in on that.

10

transaction, after which period the City would

11

agree that the savings would continue on as proven

12

out during that initial period.

13

That may change.

14

it may be possible to have the ESCOs guarantee

15

savings throughout the term, but, again, that's an

16

open issue as far as I understand it.

17

MS. TRAMM:

Michael, if I can build on

18

what you're saying.

19

Director for the Trust.

20

I understand that

This is Claire Tramm, Energy

We have been in conversations with

21

the three ESCOs in the last several days.

They are

22

prepared to extend the term of their guarantee for

23

the full 20-plus-year agreement.

24

slight cost increment to the transaction, so part

It just adds a

 30
1

of what then comes out of the savings every year is

2

a couple percent that pays for their M and V, their

3

monitoring and verification, and that energy

4

savings guarantee.

5

So still the model works.

The

6

numbers work.

7

means that we're extending the term of their energy

8

performance guarantee.

9
10
11

The deal still looks great.

MR. BEITLER:

It just

That's the direction that

we're headed at the moment.
MR. HOFFMAN:

While I haven't heard that

12

before, I think what you're saying seems like a

13

good result.

14
15
16

Let me just ask a few questions to
make sure I understand it.
So I reviewed the draft documents

17

with Scott and the lawyers.

18

anything in there that limited the duration.

19

that a new development since the agreements were

20

drafted or did I miss it in there?

21

MR. FALK:

I didn't see, Scott,
Is

It was blank, and so there

22

was a negative implication that maybe they intended

23

to make it less than the duration of the financing.

24

What you're hearing today is good

 31
1

news which is they've come around and, yes, they're

2

getting paid for this risk, but they're going to

3

take that guarantee all the way out through the

4

duration of the loan.

5

MS. TRAMM:

6

We have those estimates from

all 3 for 20 years.

7

MR. BEITLER:

But I should also say this

8

was a cost calculation where we're figuring out the

9

cost benefit arrangement of this, so it's not just

10

that a particular company wouldn't want to assume

11

that risk.

12

which is best.

13

It's what is the cost benefit to us and

MR. HOFFMAN:

So that's fine.

I want to

14

ask a couple questions about costs but just in

15

terms of -- can we have an understanding here that

16

one of the material terms of these agreements is

17

what Scott just laid out, that the duration of the

18

guarantee is the full length of the term of the

19

loan and if, therefore -- if things change after we

20

leave this meeting and the ESCOs back off of that

21

oral commitment, that it would be considered a

22

change in the term that would be inconsistent with

23

the material term?

24

MS. SCOTT:

May I raise a point on that?

 32
1

Sorry.

2

City.

Lois Scott, Chief Financial Officer for the

3
4

Couple things you said I just want
to fine-tune maybe just a little bit.

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

6

MS. SCOTT:

Yeah, please.

You said that the savings

7

that are paid are the expected savings.

I want to

8

be very clear that it's the actual savings is what

9

is paid to the investor -- the guarantee and the

10

risk to the benefit of the investor.

11

extend for the entire term, we, the City, and

12

through the Trust, are paying more for protections

13

that inures to the benefit of the investor which

14

should reduce the rate, but we're paying for it

15

over here.

16

So when we

Finding that balancing point between

17

how much you said pay for the M and V versus what

18

you have to pay on the interest rate is what Piper

19

Jaffray will be working on.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

Now I think I understood

21

what you said.

However, just to match that with

22

the way I'm talking about it in terms of the

23

duration of the guarantee, I know that the term of

24

the loan may end up being longer than 20 years.

 33
1

Let's just say 20 years for the sake of this.

2

we knew today that the ESCOs were only gonna give a

3

guarantee for ten years, wouldn't that create a

4

concern for the City and, therefore, the Trust that

5

in the second ten years of this agreement if the

6

actual savings turned out to be significantly lower

7

than the expected savings today the City would

8

somehow have to cover that?

9

MS. SCOTT:

No.

That's the way the deal

10

works.

11

actual savings achieved.

12

doesn't work as planned, that would be

13

transferred through the Trust.

14

that risk to investors away from away from

15

taxpayers.

16

that's their concern not ours.

17
18
19
20

If

The investors are only benefiting from the
If the equipment fails or

We've transferred

If the savings don't materialize,

MR. HOFFMAN:

So what you're

saying -- so that's helpful.
MR. BEITLER:

If I may also, Lois, to

supplement that.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yeah.

22

MR. BEITLER:

There may be some of the

23

projects among the total number of projects where

24

it's more effective to Lois' point to just simply

 34
1

stipulate to the savings as opposed to be really

2

concerned about measurement and verification of

3

savings if that could save us money in the long

4

run, and it is possible that we could have a mix of

5

projects, some of which are stipulated to and some

6

of which have an M and V actually running on the

7

project for the duration of the term of the

8

instrument.

9

So I think that it's fair to say

10

that we really need to have some latitude on this

11

because we need to be able to make the judgment as

12

to whether a particular sub-project of all of the

13

projects is better off to be stipulated at because

14

it's cheaper and it's common, for example, versus

15

it is something that's unusual, and measurement and

16

verification would be a good thing.

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I'm not sure I -- so

18

isn't -- I mean as I was understanding this, the

19

reason this seems like such a good deal is that

20

ultimately if the bad situation arises in the

21

future where our estimate of the savings from these

22

energy conservation measures, our estimate of that

23

savings ten years from now, if that turns out to be

24

wrong and it's much, much, much lower because of

 35
1

changed circumstances in the world, the City

2

doesn't bear a significant risk of that either

3

because, A, the ESCOs are gonna make up the

4

shortfall because there's a guarantee or, B, what

5

Lois just said, which is that even if there's not

6

such a guarantee the only thing the City and the

7

Trust owe the investors is the actual savings.

8

MS. SCOTT:

Right.

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

I want to make sure I

10

didn't hear something inconsistent with what you

11

said, Steve, which is that if you had stipulated

12

savings as opposed to actual and the City was on

13

the hook for "stipulated savings," that sounds like

14

that might be here's the number that we expect the

15

savings to be over the years and the City and the

16

Trust are on the hook for that even if the numbers

17

are less.

18

hear stipulated savings.

19

different than I think what I just laid out.

20
21
22

I can't -- that's what I hear when I

MS. SCOTT:

If so, that would be

I'll clarify that a little

bit further.
There are some improvements that are

23

more tried and true with more predictable outcomes

24

in situations like that.

It might be more cost

 36
1

effective to stipulate because paying for

2

measurement and verification is actually paying

3

somebody to do that when, in fact, it could be well

4

established what the savings of this particular

5

project are.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

7

MS. SCOTT:

Can you give an example?

Light bulbs.

Well, you

8

know, if you change them out and make them more

9

energy efficient, does it make sense for somebody

10

to come in and measure that savings when you have

11

reams of technology data that demonstrates the

12

savings?

13

all agree these are the savings from this

14

particular product than to pay a third party to

15

come in and calculate that each year.

It's more -- it's cheaper just to say we

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

17

MS. SCOTT:

Yeah.

Again --

What is the lowest cost

18

possibility we can do, how little measurement and

19

verification do we need to purchase to make the

20

investors happy for the projects being financed.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yeah.

Again, isn't the

22

risk there that ten years from now unexpectedly the

23

cost of electricity per unit is much higher so no

24

matter what light bulbs you have in it turns out

 37
1

that we're not saving of money?

2

MS. SCOTT:

3

That's the investors' risk

not ours.

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

Wait.

Because, as you

5

said, the only thing that the City and the Trust

6

owe is the actual saving.

7

MS. SCOTT:

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

9
10

13

But stipulated savings are

different from actual savings; right, or am I
misunderstanding that?

11
12

Um-hum.

MS. SCOTT:

Yes, that's correct.

That's

correct.
MR. HOFFMAN:

So when you say the only

14

thing we would have to pay in my bad case scenario

15

is what the City was actually saving, what if the

16

actual savings were only ten percent of the

17

stipulated savings and then the City somehow has to

18

make up that shortfall because the guarantee is

19

gone and it turns out the actual savings are much

20

lower than the stipulated savings?

21

MS. SCOTT:

22

circumstances, that could be --

23
24

In that unique set of

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's a risk, right.

I

understand we can assess the likelihood of that but

 38
1

that's different than --

2

MR. BEITLER:

3

MR. MARQUISOS:

4

point of clarification.

5

from the PBC.

6

George.
I just want to make a

This is George Marquisos

The ESCO's guaranteeing energy

7

savings.

8

over the next 20 years.

9

kilowatt hour increases dramatically over 20 years,

10

there is no guarantee the City will have -- will be

11

glad that they did the savings measures they did

12

because they'll be saving even more relatively, but

13

they are guaranteeing kilowatt hours and therms.

14

Those are energy units that are being guaranteed

15

not dollars, so the risk associated with utility

16

rates is not covered in this agreement at all.

17

They are not guaranteeing utility costs

MR. HOFFMAN:

So if the cost per

That's a fair point.

I

18

think that sounds like it might answer my question

19

which is that --

20

MS. SCOTT:

Yeah.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

-- which is that the

22

stipulated savings, the risk of the spread between

23

actual savings and stipulated savings is low.

24

MS. SCOTT:

Um-hum.

 39
1

MR. BEITLER:

Particularly for things

2

where you may have a 20-year history, so like

3

certain types of light bulbs.

4

somebody has been examining that and determining

5

that this is the savings you get over a 20-year

6

history, and that history is pretty predictive

7

going forward for say light bulbs.

8

comfortable with light bulbs.

9

MS. TRAMM:

For 20 years

People are very

You don't even need the

10

history, in fact.

11

measurements.

12

lighting, so you just stipulate to the number of

13

hours that that light bulb is turned on in

14

buildings based on how, you know, exactly it's

15

being used in the building.

16

You just look at the wattage

They're very, very accurate for

MR. BEITLER:

At this point all we're

17

suggesting is we go back and forth through these

18

calculations to make a determination on a

19

project-by-project basis as to what is the best way

20

to get the best savings for the City and the Trust,

21

what is the best way to get the best savings for

22

the City and the Trust based on each particular

23

sub-project within the overall project.

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

We have to move on,

 40
1

David.

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

I think we're getting

3

there.

I mean this is a new description that is

4

making sense as it's being flushed out but it is --

5

I think the bottom line is that my understanding of

6

this is that the City and the Trust, therefore,

7

didn't run any significant risk of unexpected

8

payments in the future because the expected

9

savings -- all the City was gonna have to be on the

10

hook for in the future were the actual savings that

11

were happening only because these energy

12

conservation measures were being put into place,

13

and, therefore, the City was completely protected

14

from having to pay unexpected payments in the

15

future even if the savings were lower.

16

And as long as -- and I felt

17

comfortable with that based on, A, the guarantee

18

and, B, what Lois said -- even if there's not a

19

guarantee, all we're on the hook for is the actual

20

savings.

21

The stipulated savings is kind of an

22

asterisk to that, and I think what you're saying is

23

even if we measure it based on -- even if we are

24

agreeing with the investors based on stipulated

 41
1

savings, you're telling us that the City does not

2

have a risk of making more payments than, in any

3

significant way than the actual savings in the

4

future.

5

think we can rely on that, but I wanted to clear up

6

this stipulated savings point.

7

If that's the answer, that's fine.

MS. TRAMM:

I

Yes, that's absolutely true.

8

So the City will only be paying the actual savings

9

which for some particular measures may agree to at

10

the outset what those stipulated savings will be

11

like lighting.

12

measured, and we will only pay, the City will only

13

pay the actual savings.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

Most things will be actually

Okay.

Now in terms of

15

cost, if the guarantee is much less than the full

16

term, should we expect this is going to

17

significantly increase the cost of this, the

18

interest rate of the loan and so on?

19

MR. FALK:

No.

The whole purpose, just

20

to be clear, the whole purpose of the

21

guarantee -- so I apologize if we miscommunicated

22

on this before.

23

is to make the deal saleable.

24

at this point is to raise the financing.

But the purpose of the guarantee
The number one goal
That's

 42
1

what we're looking at.

2

lies ahead.

3

now engaged in.

That is the key hurdle that

That's what John Coan and his team are

4

The guarantee is a tool that he can

5

use to help sell the deal to the financing sources.

6

That's really the way I think about it, and I think

7

it's the way the Board should think about it.

8

It's a net positive tool.
only help.

It can

It's not a guarantee of any of your

10

obligations, the Trust's obligations.

It is merely

11

a way to reduce risk for the lenders.

So the

12

stronger the guarantee, right, the lower the cost

13

should be for the financing.

14

guarantee, at some point it may incrementally cost

15

you something.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

The weaker the

Right.

17

question -- whether there was --

18

MR. FALK:

That was my

But I think -- what we've

19

done is -- what Claire's been able to do is achieve

20

an understanding with the ESCOs that we have --

21

that John Coan can take to the market maximum

22

flexibility.

23

15-year guarantee, then maybe that's where we ought

24

to look.

If he can get the same pricing for a

 43
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's fine.

If the

2

guarantee is not the ultimate protection for the

3

City because the ultimate protection for the City

4

is its only actual savings that need to be paid or

5

stipulated savings where it's virtually the same,

6

then that's the protection.

7

clear about, you know, that's the protection that

8

avoids the risk.

9

MS. TRAMM:

I just wanted to be

Absolutely.

That's a great

10

way to think about it -- that the guarantee has

11

really nothing to do with the fact that the City

12

has no risk to pay anything more than its actual

13

realized savings.

14

The guarantee -- I think I described

15

it in our last meeting as being two perfect puzzle

16

pieces, that with the energy savings agreement

17

linked up with the energy performance guarantee,

18

those two things to the end financier in the

19

private market give them substantial belief that

20

they will definitely get their money back one way

21

or the other either because the savings materialize

22

and the City does pay through the energy service

23

agreement those savings or because the savings

24

don't materialize and the contractor -- the ESCOs

 44
1

are on the hook to compensate them for that

2

shortfall, so the two puzzle pieces are what create

3

a nice, stable annuity, stable cash flows that they

4

are comfortable investing in.

5

balancing act that we've created to make this an

6

off credit and off balance sheet for the City.

7
8
9

That is the

MR. BEITLER:

So have we addressed that

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yeah.

question?
Right.

The overall

10

question was what are the big risks, and the

11

question is making sure that the City and,

12

therefore, the Trust are protected.

13

is a public interest analysis -- is the City

14

protected from unexpected large payments in the

15

future, and I understand the answer which is yes.

16

Basically this

The only other question I have

17

before we finalize was this Com Ed issue that's

18

arisen in the media aspect.

19

comments on this.

20

transaction has nothing to do, as I understand it,

21

with the presentation that the Trust has made to

22

Com Ed relating to how the Trust might be able to

23

use or intersect with its energy efficient funds.

24

Am I understanding that right?

I've seen your

Just to confirm, this

 45
1

MR. BEITLER:

That's correct.

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

That discussion is for

3

potentially something in the future?

4

MR. BEITLER:

That's correct.

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

That something in the

6

future, it's not your or the Trust's intent to do

7

anything that would raise anybody's Com Ed rates;

8

is that correct?

9

MR. BEITLER:

10

MS. TRAMM:

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

12

from reading.

13
14
15
16

That's correct.

Correct.
That's what I picked up

I just wanted to confirm that here.

MR. BEITLER:

Okay.

So just go to the

Chairman.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

So are there any other

comments from the other Board members?

17

ALDERMAN POPE:

18

MR. RAMIREZ:

No.

19

MR. BEITLER:

Mr. Chairman.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

21

No.

Okay.

Are we ready for

a resolution?

22

MR. FALK:

Yes.

23

MR. BEITLER:

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yes, Mr. Chairman.
I need a motion if we

 46
1
2
3
4
5
6

are.
MR. BEITLER:

Would one of the Board

members care to make a motion?
ALDERMAN POPE:

Move to accept the

resolution.
MR. HOFFMAN:

I'll second it, but I do

7

want to make some comments about why I think it's

8

appropriate, and I know that we've been going on

9

close to an hour today but consider this --

10
11
12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I think we know why you

think it's appropriate, David.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

You've told us.
Well, actually, I

13

don't think -- I've been asking a lot of questions,

14

so with your permission, Mr. Chairman, I would like

15

the chance to make some comments about -- now that

16

we have a full understanding of the why, I think

17

this is a good deal and a very good day in the

18

history of the Trust assuming we can get the

19

interest rate consistent with it.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

21

MR. HOFFMAN: Thank you.

22
23
24

Sure.

So I'd say that there are a handful
of points I want to make briefly.
Number one, I do think this loan is

 47
1

gonna allow us -- and I'm making these points

2

thinking about our future projects as well.

3

think these are going to be good guide posts for

4

what it -- you know, we look to some projects here

5

that ended up going by the wayside which I also

6

think was appropriate and important.

7

I

The first is that this loan is gonna

8

allow us to pay for important projects that

9

wouldn't otherwise be done now, and I think that

10

that wasn't true of everything we looked at and

11

it's true of these.

12

The second is that when we look

13

carefully at these specific projects, they are, in

14

fact, helpful and in the public interest.

15

weren't hastily decided upon.

16

They

The 2FM commissioner who's not here,

17

David Reynolds, deserves significant credit for

18

sometime ago lining up the buildings and the

19

investment grade audits and the study of what

20

should be done to improve the buildings.

21

The equipment in a lot of these

22

buildings, police stations and libraries, is old.

23

It needs updating.

24

do right now.

It's not something the City can

This project can allow it to do it.

 48
1

It's gonna make a very significant change in the

2

real world.

That's important.

3

Third, and this is the point we were

4

just discussing for the last 20 minutes, the cost

5

to do this is all paid for solely out of either

6

energy savings themselves that would come through

7

this or the guarantee.

8

project that pays for itself.

9

be the case.

10

Therefore, it really is a
That will not always

That's makes it an especially good

model for what we're doing.

11

There are no other costs or fees

12

being imposed on City residents or users.

13

project that pays for itself.

14

thing.

15

It's a

That's a great

Fourth, the upside is not limited.

16

As Claire laid out last time, the Trust and the

17

City will receive the extra savings if the opposite

18

of what I was talking about comes true and there's

19

more savings.

20

Fifth, we wanted to ask from the

21

beginning is this better than a bond.

22

the City just issue a bond?

23

than a bond.

24

downside guarantee.

Why can't

It's clearly better

In a bond you don't have this
Regardless of the duration,

 49
1

there's some significant guarantee, and there's

2

clearly a different credit analysis because of the

3

guarantee and because of the savings stream.

4

Six, we were going to ask should --

5

could the City just do this itself.

6

need the Trust here?

7

very unlikely the City would be able just to spend

8

this money out of its coffers on its own and the

9

City would not be able to limit its downside risk

10

in the same way, so I think we also answered that

11

question affirmatively.

12

Why do we even

I think the same thing.

It's

And, finally, I appreciate this

13

process, and I think this was important.

14

there clearly was substantial and transparent

15

thought and analysis that went into this option.

16

Look,

We were here three months ago at

17

the -- two meetings ago and we were talking about a

18

grantor trust.

19

Jaffray and others turned this around and went in

20

this new direction which clearly is a very good

21

direction.

22

about it in a deliberate public way made a

23

difference and landed us where we were now as

24

opposed to doing it behind closed doors in a hasty

Well, look, the staff and Piper

Taking our time to flush it out, talk

 50
1

fashion.

2

So I think this was a good lesson in

3

terms of taking our time and making sure that we

4

deliberate about it and get to a point where it's

5

well thought out.

6

All of the documents that are gonna

7

be defined in this deal are going to be revealed

8

publicly to the City Council with adequate time for

9

them to consider it, deliberate on it, act in a

10

public fashion.

11

That's significant as well.

So, look, we haven't done this

12

before, and I think that those are the reasons -- I

13

was thinking about what are the reasons that we can

14

look to in the future that would make it a good

15

deal.

16

the guide posts to the future.

17

here, so that's why I think that it's a -- assuming

18

we can get the interest rate within the parameters,

19

it's a good transaction, good model for the future.

20
21

I think that those in my mind are gonna be
