THE METROHEALTH SYSTEM

Committee Members Present: Mr. McDonald, Mr. Monnolly, Dr. Silvers, Ms. Whiting
Staff Present:

Dr. Boulanger, Dr. Boutros, Mr. Jones, Mr. Phillips, Ms. Platten,
Mr. Richmond, Mr. Stern

Mr. McDonald called the meeting to order at 8:00 a.m.
The minutes for the meeting of June 27, 2018, were approved as submitted.
The next item of business was an update review of facilities provided by Dr. Bernard Boulanger
and Michael Stern. They indicated that a refresh was being for all sites, including furniture and
the coordination of the appearance of our sites. In addition, an assessment of the older sites
(Main Campus, Beachwood, and West 150th) is being done at the same time. Given age and
customary wear and tear, the degradation of our current facilities, here including OBC and the
Outpatient Pavilion, will require additional capital to maintain necessary function and
appearances.
The Board then discussed a scheduling change for the October 2018 meeting. The Chair and
Dr. Boutros proposed that, due to the required 2019 Budget schedule and presentation to the
County, the October meeting scheduled for the Executive Committee, October 24, 2018, should
be converted to a regular meeting of the Board of Trustees. There being no objection, the Chair
asked that the appropriate notices be prepared and posted and/or communicated.
Executive Session
Mr. McDonald indicated that the remaining matters to be considered involved Trade Secrets.
Upon unanimous roll call vote, the Committee went into Executive Session to discuss such
matters.
The meeting was adjourned at approximately 10:00 a.m.
Respectfully submitted,

Mr. Thomas M. McDonald
Chair
