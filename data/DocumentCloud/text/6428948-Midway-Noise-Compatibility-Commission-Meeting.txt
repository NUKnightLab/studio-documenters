Final Minutes of the February 28, 2013, Meeting of the
Executive Committee of the
Midway Noise Compatibility Commission
The Midway Noise Compatibility Commission (MNCC) Executive Committee Meeting
was held February 28, 2013, at the Midway Airport Maintenance Complex (AMC)
Building, 6201 S. Laramie Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.
Chairman Thomas Baliga called the meeting to order at 6:30 p.m.
The following members were present:
Thomas Baliga – Chicago Ward 23
Stan Lihosit – Chicago Ward 14
Kenneth Pannaralla – Chicago Ward 13
The following members were not present:
Mayor Harry Klein – Burbank
Joseph Loduca – Chicago Ward 23
Gail Conwell – Chicago Ward 13
Also present:
Aaron Frame, Assistant Commissioner – Chicago Department of Aviation
Jeffrey Jackson, Project Manager – Landrum & Brown
Marcie Vasta, Administrative Assistant – Residential Sound Insulation Program
MNCC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE BRIEFING (document attached)
A. DOCUMENT PRESENTATION
Mr. Aaron Frame and Mr. Jeffrey Jackson provided a detailed review of the
briefing.
School Sound Insulation Program Summary
Forty-one schools have been completed.
RSIP Program Summary
Including the 2011 remaining 500 homes, a total of 8,045 have been completed.
Part 150 Summary
Mr. Ken Pannaralla asked if the RSIP program would be included in the Part 150
update. Mr. Frame responded it is. Once FAA reviews and approves the
update, it becomes eligible for 80/20 federal grant funds.
Mr. Frame referenced Appendix F (of Draft Part 150) which provides an historical
background of the formation of the Commission and its accomplishments to date.
Mr. Stan Lihosit requested that a copy of Appendix F be provided on disc.

 Final Minutes of the February 28, 2013, Meeting of
Executive Committee of the
Midway Noise Compatibility Commission
Future Conditions (2018 Impacts)
There are approximately 3,200 potential units to be sound-insulated in the 2018
Draft.
Mr. Jackson stated that FAA requires existing patterns be compared with future
FAA procedures scheduled within the next five years. Examples of modeling
inputs include fleet mix, runway use, operation levels etc.
There will no longer be any conflict with the Midway and O’Hare airspace which
will result in greater use of Runway 13C where there are fewer homes. The use
of 22L will also increase as a result of the new flight paths.
Part 150 Summary (NCP)
The 1992 Plan included 16 measures. Six of those measures have been
completed or withdrawn, 10 will be maintained and two new ones were reviewed
and are not recommended (see attachment for details). Chairman Baliga and
Mr. Lihosit asked if the measure eliminating the Voluntary Acquisition Program
would impact the acquisition of properties at the four corners, specifically 63rd
and Central. Mr. Frame stated that this applies solely to residential. The
property at 63rd and Central has apartments but is considered commercial. The
property will be converted into a green space.
Mr. Pannaralla inquired whether the RSIP would result in involuntary acquisition.
Mr. Frame responded that the City is not interested in acquiring property and that
maintaining acquisition for commercial property is for obstruction and safety
purposes, not noise. Mr. Pannaralla asked if the City would buy out a residence
if the noise level was too loud to be insulated. Mr. Frame responded that
regardless of the noise level the property could be effectively insulated. The
window grades at Midway are STC 44 to accommodate the noise levels. The
grade at O’Hare is STC 40.
Key Messaging for the Public Hearing
 Future RSIP
Mr. Frame stated that all residences within the new noise contour, including
rental apartments, high rises, condos, and residential portions of convents
and rectories will be eligible for participation. Temporary lodging such as
motels or hotels will be excluded.
Chairman Baliga asked about eligibility and zoning compliance.
The
Executive Committee members expressed great concern about illegal
conversions and expressed their preference to disallow sound insulation
eligibility for these homes. Mr. Frame said he would confer with Managing
Deputy Commissioner O’Donnell, First Deputy Commissioner Boland, and the
City attorneys. This is a local building code/zoning issue that FAA has no
involvement with and does not require resolution for Part 150.

 Final Minutes of the February 28, 2013, Meeting of
Executive Committee of the
Midway Noise Compatibility Commission


New Flight Procedures
This will be addressed by the FAA.

Next Steps
The Proposed Schedule is detailed in the presentation (see attachment). Mr.
Frame e-mailed the date of the Public Hearing to everyone on the Commission
so comments can be addressed, submitted, and included in the document.
Commission comments are to be transmitted to CDA from April 5th through April
20th. The Executive Committee requested to hold an extra meeting after the
Public Hearing, because the April 20th deadline for Commission comments would
occur before the next Commission meeting on April 25th.
Mr. Frame
acknowledged the request and said that he would check with CDA management.
MNCC members can comment individually, as ward/community representatives
and as the Commission as a whole. Some topics that the Commission should
address include continuation of RSIP, block rounding, and code issues. Mr.
Frame indicated that he must receive all comments by April 20 th. The official
comments from the Commission contribute to the FAA’s approval of the Part 150
Document.
B. MATERIALS PRESENTATION
Draft Public Hearing Handout
Mr. Jackson stated that a handout would be distributed to the attendees. It will
indicate the purpose of the meeting and define what a noise compatibility study is.
Also, the locations for obtaining copies of the document and where and how to
comment will be included. A court reporter will also be attending the hearing to
record comments. Chairman Baliga requested that the committee members be
provided with a package of the materials before the hearing and Mr. Frame
agreed to do so.
Draft Public Hearing Boards
Mr. Jackson explained the content of the boards that will be along the wall of the
hearing room. The boards show the existing conditions of the noise contour,
those of the future contour and the impacts for 2012 and 2018. They also show
the number of homes that have been completed, are in progress and the number
of potentially eligible units yet remaining. The 2010 census was used to provide
the FAA with an estimated population of the 65 DNL. Both current and future
costs are indicated. Measures such as the SSIP, RSIP, noise suppression
barriers, and noise walls are also addressed.
Mr. Frame responded to Chairman Baliga’s inquiry regarding translators. The
request must be made a week in advance.

 Final Minutes of the February 28, 2013, Meeting of
Executive Committee of the
Midway Noise Compatibility Commission
Draft Public Hearing Quadrant Maps
Mr. Frame and Mr. Jackson presented draft quadrant maps showing the new 70
DNL and 65 DNL. Detailed explanations of the significance of the color coded
dots and boxes were provided. The colors indicate the status of specific areas
within the new contour. The impact on the quadrants was discussed.
Commissioner Baliga asked if there were any additional questions. With no other
business, he asked if there was a motion to adjourn, which was made by Mr. Lihosit and
was seconded by Mr. Ken Pannaralla. The motion passed.
MEETING ADJOURNMENT
Chairman Baliga adjourned the meeting at 8:06 PM.
