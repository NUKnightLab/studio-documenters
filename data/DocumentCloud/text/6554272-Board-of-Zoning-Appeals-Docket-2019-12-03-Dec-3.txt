PURPOSAL:

Green Skies-Hoover LLC requests to modify BSEED Case #68-17 to
add a 38,862 square foot Medical Marihuana Grow Facility (MMGF)
and a 6,407 square foot Medical marihuana Processor Facility
(MMPF) to an existing 3,778 square foot Medical Marihuana
Provisioning Center facility (MMPCF) of an existing one-story 62,799
square foot building in a M4 zone (Intensive Industrial District). This
case is appealed because appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals
may be taken by any person, firm, partnership or corporation, or by
any City department, commission, board or other City agency which
is aggrieved 1) by a decision of an enforcing officer, or 2) by any
decision made by the Buildings and Safety Engineering Department
involving Conditional Uses. Medical marihuana facilities may be
permitted on a conditional basis in the following zoning districts in
accordance with this Article, subject to the provisions of this Division
and any other applicable provisions of this Code; the proposed MMF
are excessive in square footage. The gross square footage of the
building is 62,799 square feet, which is excessive by 12,799 square
feet. (Sections 50-4-131 Appeals and 50-3-281 General approval
criteria).AP
