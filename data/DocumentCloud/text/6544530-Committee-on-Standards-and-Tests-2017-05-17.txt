Case: 

Dear Chris Chwedyck,

In response to your, May 17th, 2017 presentation to the Committee on Building Standards Tests, the
Committee has voted to allow the installation of a ?Mahaffey? fabric tent structure to provide
structural protection for the existing bowstring truss roof system at the PNC Bank building located at
3844 West Belmont Ave. This tent will be allowed to remain in place for a period of 30 months in
lieu of meeting the requirements of Code section 13-96-500 (Limitation on Duration) for tents. When
the new PNC Bank Building (located on an adjacent parking lot) is completed and occupied for use
by the current PNC Bank staff, the existing bank building Will be vacated and demolished.

As presented to the Committee, the following safety practices shall be followed:

1. The tent and roof structure will be inspected every week by a licensed structural engineer.
The Department of Buildings shall be noti?ed immediately if any imminently dangerous or
hazardous conditions are discovered during these inspections.

2. The existing shorin currently in place for the bowstring trusses will be maintained until the
building is demolished.

3. The tent will use a fabric that is ?re treated to meet the requirements of NF PA 701and will
not be removed by washing or exposure to the elements.

4. The tent structure will be designed to meet the structural and wind loading requirements of
the Chicago Building Code.

5. At the perimeter of the tent, the tent fabric will be held 0? (Four feet) above the level of
the roof to allow adequate outside air and combustion air for the operation of the existing
rooftop package HVAC units.

In the summer when the temperature is above 65 Degree Fahrenheit, the north and south end
canvass of the tent structure will be removed to allow free air ?ow within the canopy to
dissipate heat from the existing condensers.

All other Building Code requirements shall be met. This installation is site speci?c and shall not be
viewed as a precedent. A permit is required for this work.A signed hard paper copy of this
communication will be mailed to you at a later date. Please contact your project administrator for
