Commissioner Karim called the meeting to order at 6:05pm
Motion was adopted to approve minutes with permission for changes
as necessary.
Eddie Jones and Brian Taylor of Allpoints provided statistics of
criminal activity within the SSA Boundaries. Several incidents have
occurred within the boundaries during times that Allpoints is not on

to follow up with 71st St mall security to work with Allpoints. Allpoints
will push the troubled building forms to help decrease loitering and
alleged illegal activity at the nuisance businesses. Mr. Jones will
contact Commander Doss to set up a meeting with SSA #42.

The additional $50,925 must be spent before December 31, 2016.
