Report from Chief Executive Officer
William T. Foley, Chief Executive Officer, reported on the following subjects:
•

Update on Performance Improvement Plan
Mr. Foley provided an update on the performance improvement plan. He stated that the assessment phase
is essentially completed; an assessment of Cermak Health Services was recently added to the tasks as an
addendum, and should be completed within a couple of weeks. Approximately $60-70 million of
opportunities have been identified throughout the System.
The next phase is to implement the plan. Normally, a consulting firm would be engaged to do a fullblown implementation of the plan; this will not be necessary, as some of the pieces are already being
implemented, such as those relating to labor, productivity and workforce rebalancing. However, there is a
need for the engagement of a consulting firm to implement other opportunities and pieces of the plan,
such as those relating to supply chain and other areas. Work addressing this is currently underway; the
recommendation will come back through the Finance Committee and will be part of the whole
implementation plan.

Board and Committee Reports
A. Minutes of the Board of Directors Meeting, September 18, 2009
Director Greenspan, seconded by Director Lyne, moved the approval of the minutes of the Board of
Directors Meeting of September 18, 2009. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B. Minutes of the Board of Directors Special Meeting, September 18, 2009
Director Lyne, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved the approval of the minutes of the Board of
Directors Special Meeting of September 18, 2009. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. *Minutes of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting, September 22, 2009
During the presentation and discussion of the minutes of this meeting, an extensive discussion took place
on an item relating to a recommendation from leadership for influenza vaccination requirements for
employees. At the Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting of September 22, 2009, a motion to
approve proposed amendments to the employee health policies, as summarized by Dr. Stephen Martin and
attached to the minutes of that meeting, passed unanimously.
Subsequently, a revised recommendation was prepared and distributed to the Board prior to the meeting of
the Board of Directors of October 7, 2009. Director Carvalho questioned the process used to communicate
the proposed revisions to the Directors, and objected that the proposed revisions were not minor in nature,
compared to the recommendations contained in the document approved by the Quality and Patient Safety
Committee.
Dr. Martin provided information on the proposed revisions. He stated that there were some clean-up
language revisions, revisions which provide more flexibility, and revisions with regard to exemptions that
would make the System’s policy more consistent with other organizations.
Director Ansell requested that Dr. Martin state the specific changes between the two documents. Dr.
Martin stated that the document reviewed and approved by the Quality and Patient Safety Committee
contained a requirement of mandatory influenza vaccinations for System employees. After the approval of
the recommendation from the Committee, his staff continued to review the document, and received
feedback from Infectious Diseases, Employee Health, Human Resources and Administration staff. This
(revised document) provides an opportunity to clean-up issues that would have been a problem on day one,
such as those relating to compliance and understanding by the System employees.

Board and Committee Reports
C. Minutes of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting,
September 22, 2009 (continued)
Director Carvalho disagreed, stating that the revised document contained fundamental changes. He stated
that the recommendation approved by the Committee would be considered a “Loyola model,” or a
mandatory vaccination requirement for employees, with the only exception being medical
contraindications. The proposed revised recommendation, however, contains language that allows for
other exceptions. Director Ansell agreed, noting that the Committee made their decision based upon “best
practices”; the proposed revisions could create a gap or loophole, which defeats the purpose of a
mandatory vaccine policy.
The Board discussed the issue further, and information was provided on employee vaccination policies for
other similar institutions. Additionally, the Board discussed the issue of implementation of a mandatory
vaccine policy.
It was determined that the item would be remanded back to the Quality and Patient Safety Committee for
further review and consideration. Director Greenspan requested that the Committee be asked to make the
decision, and be given the authority by the Board to move ahead with the decision. Due to the timesensitive nature of the item, Mr. Foley suggested that a special Committee meeting be scheduled in the
next week for consideration of this matter.
Director Zopp, seconded by Director Lyne, made the following motion:
•

•
•

To approve the minutes of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting of September 22, 2009,
with the exception of the recommendation relating to influenza vaccination requirements for
employees, which will be remanded back to the Quality and Patient Safety Committee for further
review and consideration;
To authorize the Quality and Patient Safety Committee to work with management to develop a final
policy relating to influenza vaccination requirements for employees for approval; and
To authorize the Quality and Patient Safety Committee to approve and effectuate this final policy.

On the motion, a voice vote was taken and THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

D. *Minutes of the Human Resources Committee Meeting, September 29, 2009
Director Zopp, seconded by Vice Chairman Ramirez, moved the approval of the minutes of the Human
Resources Committee Meeting of September 29, 2009. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

E. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, September 29, 2009
Director Golden, seconded by Vice Chairman Ramirez, moved the approval of the minutes of the Finance
Committee Meeting of September 29, 2009. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Director Carvalho voted PRESENT on request numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, under the Contracts and
Procurement Items contained in the minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting of September 29, 2009.

VI.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update from Ad Hoc Working Group on Medical School Relationships
Director Lyne described an issue with regard to Committee and Board approval of medical school
relationships. She stated that at the last Board meeting, the Board approved an OB/Gyne relationship with
Northwestern; the relationship is reasonable, as Northwestern has a larger volume of births, while John H.
Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County has a larger volume of patients receiving gynecological services.
This item came to the Board through the Finance Committee, however, some of these affiliation
agreements go through the Quality and Patient Safety Committee. There doesn’t appear to be a clear
pattern or process with regard to the presentation for approval of these relationships.
Chairman Batts recommended that before any contracts for medical school relationships go to the Finance
or Quality and Patient Safety Committees, or to the Board, that these be reviewed by Director Lyne’s
working group. Additionally, Director Ansell requested that the process of approval from Director Lyne’s
working group through the final Board approval be reviewed and refined.
B. Miscellaneous
Chairman Batts, seconded by Director Lyne, moved to enter the following congratulatory communication
into the record: “On behalf of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, we hereby congratulate
Rush University Medical Center for being chosen by University HealthSystem Consortium as one of the
top five hospitals for patient outcomes.” THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

VII. Action Items
A. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Director Greenspan requested additional information on the increase and extension of the contract for the
provision of PET scanning, specifically on the subject of clinical needs. Leslie Duffy responded that only
twenty PET scans are being done per month, and provided information relating to the request presented.
Director Ansell requested that an analysis be presented on the subject at the next Quality and Patient
Safety Committee meeting. Johnny Brown, Chief Operating Officer of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of
Cook County, stated that an analysis of these services can be provided. He echoed Ms. Duffy’s comments,
stating that the usage is very limited now and is done on an outpatient basis.
Director Carvalho clarified that the request to increase and extend was for a future period; this request does
not involve payment for prior services rendered. Ms. Duffy responded affirmatively.
Additionally, Director Carvalho inquired as to the reason for the contract increase and extension, as it was
stated in the request that the reason was due to technical issues with the System’s website, which impacted
Purchasing’s ability to schedule bid openings. Ms. Duffy responded that there have been complications
with the new website, so they have been unable to post Request for Bids and Request for Proposals; they
will be able to post manually this week.
Director Carvalho, seconded by Director Golden, moved the approval of the Contracts and Procurement
Items. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

A. *Minutes of the Human Resources Committee Meeting, September 29, 2009
B. Discussion of Litigation Matter
C. *Minutes of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting, September 22, 2009
Director Greenspan, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved to recess the regular session and convene into closed
session, pursuant to the following exceptions to the Illinois Open Meetings Act: 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(2), regarding
“collective negotiating matters between the public body and its employees or their representatives, or
deliberations concerning salary schedules for one or more classes of employees,” 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(1),
regarding “the appointment, employment, compensation, discipline, performance, or dismissal of specific
employees of the public body or legal counsel for the public body, including hearing testimony on a complaint
lodged against an employee of the public body or against legal counsel for the public body to determine its
validity,” 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(11), regarding “litigation, when an action against, affecting or on behalf of the
particular public body has been filed and is pending before a court or administrative tribunal, or when the
public body finds that an action is probable or imminent, in which case the basis for the finding shall be
recorded and entered into the minutes of the closed meeting,” and 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(17), regarding “the
recruitment, credentialing, discipline or formal peer review of physicians or other health care professionals for
a hospital, or other institution providing medical care, that is operated by the public body.” THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Chairman Batts declared that the closed session was adjourned. The Board reconvened into regular session.
Director Ansell, seconded by Director Zopp, moved the approval of the settlement agreement with Roseland
Community Hospital Association. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
