Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Audit Committee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Tuesday, October 5, 2004 at the hour of 1:30 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118
North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
After calling the meeting to order, Chairman Daley stated that he had submitted questions for the record
to the Secretary to the Board and to the various parties also present. (The referenced documents are on file
with the Office of the County Clerk.)
1. 265920

BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVICES by Ruth M. Rothstein, Chief, transmitting a
Communication, dated March 17, 2004:
This letter is to formally request that the Bureau of Health Services Audited Financial
Statements, related Management Letter, and request for Bad Debt write-off for fiscal year
2002 be forwarded to the Audit Committee of the Board of Commissioners for
discussion.
*Referred to the Audit Committee on 06/03/04.

Commissioner Hansen asked for the status of the General Ledger.
Alvin Holley, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Health Services, stated the following: Currently the
General Ledger is controlled by the Chief Financial Officer of Cook County. The Bureau of Health
Services has sent a communication to Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer of Cook County, to
segregate the Bureau of Health Services' General Ledger. Mr. Glaser is reviewing the Bureau's request.
Mr. Holley stated that the Bureau of Health Services concurs with the Auditor's observation and the
Bureau would like to have its own separate General Ledger posted by the Bureau itself.
Walter Knorr, County Comptroller, stated that any level of supervision or peer review of particular entries
that affect the Bureau of Health Services should be verified primarily by the Bureau of Health Services
ensuring their accuracy.
2. 266169

CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT, Dorothy Brown, transmitting a Communication,
dated May 27, 2004:
Submitting herewith a copy of the financial report of the Fiscal Year 2003 Independent
Audit Report and Memorandum on Internal Controls for the Office of the Clerk of the
Circuit Court. Please accept these reports and refer them to the Cook County Audit
Committee for the appropriate review.
*Referred to the Audit Committee on 06/15/04.

Commissioner Hansen asked what is "ACCPAC" mentioned on page 3 of the management letter.
John Morales, Chief Financial Officer, Clerk of the Circuit Court, stated that ACCPAC is an acronym for
"accounting package" and is a brand of accounting software.

2989

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 19, 2004
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the target date for the integration of that software.
Mr. Morales stated that the formal written process is already being developed as part of the Integrated
Cashiering and Security System Project. The target date of completion for the timely recording of
disbursements is May 31, 2005, when the Clerk of the Circuit Court is fully active with the new
Integrated Cashiering System.
Commissioner Hansen asked when the written process will be completed.
Mr. Morales stated that it will be completed by December 2004 or early January 2005 .
Commissioner Hansen asked how .38% in NSF checks converts to a dollar amount.
Mr. Morales replied the following: The amount of NFS checks last year was $619,000 gross; however,
Cook County colleted a net of $312,000. Analysis is based on the number of checks processed per day
(4767 on average) times 248 business days. Theoretically, based on a run rate, the Bureau would have
taken in 1.18 million checks for the year. Of that total, 4,497 checks were returned as NSF.
Commissioner Hansen asked what types of checks the Clerk of the Circuit Court accepts.
Mr. Morales replied personal checks, cash or money orders.
Commissioner Hansen suggested that the NSF checks should be looked at in greater detail.
Mr. Morales stated the following: The Bureau is putting more pressure on the point of transaction, and
the general trend of NSF checks is decreasing. Also, the Bureau will be examining the older NSF checks
that have been past due over two or three years, and will be rendering a decision on those in the near
future.
Commissioner Hansen asked how practical it would be to not accept personal checks.
Mr. Morales replied that it would be a constraint on the customer base and it would not be practical given
the low amount of NSF checks received.
Chairman Daley asked what mechanisms are available to prevent the same individual from presenting
multiple NSF checks to the County.
Mr. Morales replied that when a check is presented for the first time to the finance institution, the bank
will present the check one additional time to recover the funds. Further, he stated that numerous calls are
made in an attempt to recover the funds and this process has been largely successful.
Mr. Morales stated the following: For traffic violations, a lien is placed on their driver's license, and that
license may be suspended by the Secretary of State until payment is made. If an attorney submits a bad
check, notices go out from the State's Attorney's Office, and subsequently the claim goes to the Attorney
Registration and Disciplinary Commission (ARDC). Additionally, the attorney's code number is entered
into the cashiering system and that attorney is barred from doing any further business until his NSF check
is resolved.
Chairman Daley asked if the County opposed SB 2456.

2990

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 19, 2004

Mr. Morales stated that the County did not support SB 2456. He further stated that this is not a piece of
legislation that would work in anyone's favor.
Commissioner Quigley asked if the County testified on this matter.
Mr. Morales replied in the negative.
Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Vice Chairman Goslin, moved to receive and file Items 1 and 2
(Comm. Nos. 265920 and 266169). The motion carried.
3. 266602

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT. Transmitting a Communication, dated June
22, 2004 from Michael F. Sheahan, Sheriff of Cook County, by Jack Kelly, Chief
Financial Officer.
Submitting the Independent Auditor's Report dated May 1, 2004, from Sam D. Macaluso
& Associates, Certified Public Accountants for the period ending November 30, 2003.
This audit report contains a Statement of Revenues Collected, Expenditures Paid and
Changes in Fund Balances for the two State Equitable Sharing Programs administered by
the Cook County Sheriffs Office along with Independent Auditor's Report on
Compliance and on Internal Control.
I respectfully request that this report be referred to the Audit Committee.

4. 267305

BUREAU OF FINANCE, by Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, transmitting a
Communication, dated June 15, 2004:
Re:

Single Audit Report for Fiscal Year Ending November 30, 2002

submitting a copy of Cook County's Single Audit Report for fiscal year ending
November 30, 2002, as prepared by Washington, Pittman & McKeever, LLC. I
respectfully request that the report be referred to the Audit Committee for further
discussion.
*Referred to the Audit Committee on 09/08/04.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether a Single Audit Compliance has been established.
Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, stated that the Comptroller's Office brought in an accountant
just two weeks ago to handle the grant accounting; the Comptroller's Office thinks that this will ensure
compliance with how the grants are handled.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the status of the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards
(SEFA).
Mr. Glaser stated that in the past, the responsibility had been divided between the Budget Department and
the Comptroller's Office. Now it is organized exclusively in the Comptroller's Office.

2991

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 19, 2004
Commissioner Hansen asked what was the status of the filling of the fiscal 2002 audit and financial
statements and annual financial information.
Mr. Glaser replied that the audit and financial statements have been corrected, however, it took longer to
generate the 2002 financials because of the implementation of new requirements under GASB 34. The
2003 audits are underway and the targeted completion date is November of 2004.
Commissioner Hansen asked Mr. Glaser to comment on the following quote from the Bureau's report:
"An audit of the basic financial statements disclosed a need for the County to enhance staffing and
training of the Bureau of Finance for preparation of external financial statements; redesign the monthly
cash reconciliation progress; and assess existing responsibilities and procedures over accounting for
capital assets".
Mr. Glaser responded that he is trying to identify accountants with prior governmental experience for
employment within the Comptroller's Office.
Commissioner Hansen asked for a target date.
Mr. Glaser stated that he is presently working toward identifying the necessary individuals.
Vice Chairman Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to receive and file Items 3 and 4
(Comm. Nos. 266602 and 267305). The motion carried.
5. 267306

COOK COUNTY TREASURER, Maria Pappas, by Daniel R. Degnan, Chief Deputy
Treasurer, transmitting a Communication, dated August 16, 2004:
The Office of the Cook County Treasurer is pleased to submit to the Board of Cook
County Commissioners the Independent Auditor's Report of the financial statement as of
November 30, 2003 and 2002.
*Referred to the Audit Committee on 09/08/04.

Commissioner Quigley asked about plans to implement a disaster recovery strategy for the entire County
and for the Treasurer's Office.
Cathy Maras O'Leary, Chieflnformation Officer, stated that the first meeting for the Business Continuity
group is planned for October 6, 2004 at 1:30 P.M. She noted that business continuity has many facets and
that most of the data utilized by the Treasurer's Office is on the County's mainframe.
Commissioner Quigley asked what types of circumstances would constitute a threat.
Mrs. O'Leary replied that her department is safeguarding against a 911-type event. She stated that such a
contingency plan would include purchasing equipment at another site and holding it there, or paying for
the usage of alternative main frame, servers, etc. to be located elsewhere. She stated that the various
departments, by that time, will have informed her of how quickly they will need to be up after such an
event.
Commissioner Quigley asked whether Mrs. O'Leary can report on how long it will take to put together
this project and the budget amount.

2992

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 19, 2004

Mrs. O'Leary stated the following: She already has the funds in her budget to perform the analysis and to
hire one staff person to assist with this process. There will be a software tool that will assist in
accumulating a total cost of business continuity. Additionally, over 100 departments will be involved.
She currently already has arranged for offsite storage, uninterrupted power sources and generators. Her
department is working toward organizing the business continuity of a catastrophic event. Such an event
would probably result in a cost of millions of dollars. The cost is a two-fee process and is dependent
upon turn-around time. Her bureau is considering using either of the two major vendors, or making inhouse arrangements, and/or partnering with another organization such as a college or another
governmental agency.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the Commissioners need cost estimates prior to the 2005 Budget.
Mrs. O'Leary stated that she will provide the information to the Commissioners.
Chairman Daley informed the Committee that Mrs. O'Leary would make a separate presentation
regarding the disaster recovery strategy at a later date. Further he stated that Mrs. O'Leary would submit
to the Board of Commissioners a budget for the implementation of this program.
Commissioner Hansen noted the importance of this matter and that it be taken up in the context of the FY
05 Budget, and be subject to further consideration by the Board of Commissioners.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to receive and file Item 5
(Comm. No. 267306). The motion carried.
6. Cook County Treasurer- Special Fee Account, November 30, 2002.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to receive and file Item 6. The
motion carried.
7. Department of Central Services -Telephone Commissions and Salvage Sales, November 30, 2001.
Commissioner Hansen asked what offices are not serviced by Office Technology.
Mrs. O'Leary replied that Office Technology services all Offices under the President except the Bureau of
Health. The agencies that are not serviced by Office Technology will receive training and tools, which are
coordinated by her office.
Chairman Daley asked whether the various agencies report back to Office Technology when they have
performed such features as debugging.
Mrs. O'Leary responded in the affirmative.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Vice Chairman Goslin, moved to receive and file Item 7. The
motion carried.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the County of Cook values intergovernmental cooperation by and between units
of government within Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the development and maintenance of affordable housing for senior citizens
throughout Cook County is of paramount importance; and
WHEREAS, the Housing Authority of Cook County has developed various senior citizen
housing projects in municipalities throughout Cook County, and
WHEREAS, the Housing Authority of Cook County has recently begun placing non-senior
citizens into housing that was previously designated for the exclusive use and enjoyment by
senior citizens; and
WHEREAS, the Federal Fair Housing Act specifically provides that housing developments

WHEREAS, allowing residency for non-senior citizens may constitute a violation of local

WHEREAS, providing for such use by non-senior citizens may constitute a violation of local

* The above item was deferred on 09/08/04 to the Board Meeting of 09/21/04.
**Referred to the Committee on Finance Real Estate Subcommittee on 09/21/04.
Commissioner Butler asked for an overview of the above item.
Commissioner Peraica stated the proposed resolution urges the Housing Authority of Cook County to
enforce a rule founded in the federal and state statutes regarding senior housing. These housing
developments were designated solely for senior utilization. The Housing Authority of Cook County
initiated a program allowing non-seniors and their families to move into seniors' developments. The nonseniors occupying the units were placed there due to disabilities, alcohol and substance abuse. The nonseniors occupying units have caused disturbances and parking problems for the surrounding residential
community. This resolution urges the Housing Authority of Cook County to stop placing non-seniors in
units that should be occupied by seniors only.
Commissioner Butler asked who defines seniors.
James Floyd, Executive Director of the Housing Authority of Cook County, stated that all units in the
seniors' facilities are one-bedroom apartments and are not rented to families. The HUD age requirement
for admittance into senior housing is sixty-two. However, in 1959 the federal regulations changed,
allowing disabled individuals over fifty to be eligible for senior housing. Under the 1974 Disability Act,
disabled individuals have been allowed in senior housing regardless of age. We have petitioned HUD and
are in the process of designating all senior housing as elderly. The Housing Authority of Cook County
needs final approval from HUD to make any changes to current statute. HUD indicated to the Housing
Authority of Cook County that we would have to continue to admit families who are disabled. It is
federal law and the Housing Authority of Cook County cannot deny housing to the disabled in the elderly
housing.
Chairman Steele inquired about the passage of the proposed resolution and whether it is unenforceable.
Mr. Floyd stated according to the federal law the proposed resolution is unenforceable.

Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Commissioner Gorman,
Communication No. 267490, as amended. The motion carried.
Commissioner Butler voted no on Communication No. 267490.

behavior problems that are irreversible; and
WHEREAS, lead poisoning can be detected through a simple blood test performed at a medical
provider's office and early detection is important; and

lead hazards and providing information to the public on the importance of having children tested for lead
