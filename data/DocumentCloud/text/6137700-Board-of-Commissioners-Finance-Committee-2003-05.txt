THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County authorize the commission of an independent
investigation of Cook County Jail System by a university or law school through
the RFP process.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED , that the RFP process clearly defines the scope
