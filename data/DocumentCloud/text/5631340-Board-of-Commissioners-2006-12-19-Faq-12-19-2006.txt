Requested the Board to consider the ramifications
and impact of the site and neighborhood policy, in
particular, policy penalizes revitalizing
neighborhoods, is discriminatory and restricts
housing choice.

The Site and Neighborhood Policy does not limit voucher
families' ability to reside in areas that are safe, and have ample
resources to meet family needs such as schools, parks, and
security. Since implementation of the policy, the CHA has
monitored leasing patterns, housing search times, and overall
inspections and unit failure rates. The results indicate that the
aforementioned aspects of the program have not been
negatively impacted by the policy. Families continue to lease
units in every community area in Chicago at the same rate as
prior to implementation of the policy.
