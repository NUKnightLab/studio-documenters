Re: Request for Establishment of Neighborhood Enterprise one

Ladies and Gentlemen:

On behalf of AK Owner LLC, a Michigan limited liability company (the ?Owner?), please accept
this letter as a request to establish a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone pursuant to MCL 207.771 for the parcel
of property described on Attachment A and depicted on Attachment B.

The Owner proposes to rehabilitate the Albert Kahn Building at 7430 Second Avenue to create
approximately 211 rental apartments and 75,652 square feet of retail and other commercial space. The
commercial components of the building will be located on the main ?oor, a portion of the basement, the
mezzanine and a portion of the second ?oor, and the balance of the building will be used for residential
purposes, approximately as depicted on the attached schematic drawings. Further information about the
project will be included in the forthcoming application for a neighborhood enterprise zone certi?cate.

Each of the apartments will constitute a ?rehabilitated facility? within the meaning of the
Neighborhood Enterprise Zone Act (the Act?). The property is located in a ?Quali?ed Downtown
Revitalization District? pursuant to the NEZ Act because it is in an area zoned and primarily used for
business. The true cash value of each apartment currently is less than the $80,000 per unit limitation
provided in MCL The owner intends to make improvements signi?cantly in excess of the
thresholds set forth in MCL Due to being located in a ?Quali?ed Downtown Revitalization
District? the proposed rehabilitation of ten or more apartments, each of which is a ?facility? within the
meaning of the NEZ Act, satis?es the requirements of MCL 207.773(1) for the establishment of a

neighborhood enterprise zone.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Very truly yours,

PETITION FOR A SEMI PERMANENT STREET CLOSURE

Burgess Street between Eaton and Acacia

To the Honorable Members of the Detroit City Council:

We the owners of properties located on Burgess Street, addresses between 14300 and 14430 requests a
permit to semi permanently close this street to vehicular traffic. We also ask that the city?s land
development department initiate a study to consider a permanent closure.

For several years this street has been an attractive nuisance for crime and illegal dumping. Often we the
property owners are targeted, issued citations for and charged with the responsibility of removing
debris discarded by other. There is constantly a stream of stolen automobiles transported to this stretch
of roadway to be stripped and discarded.

We feel that the best way to combat or curtail this illegal activity is to close the street to automobile
traffic and restrict access to pedestrians only. We would like to create park-like setting which will
include two large cement plant boxes at each end ofthe street. The property owner would utilize their
grass spaces to place benches and tables for use by the neighborhood. We will find funding sources or
bear the expense of the closures. The property owners will continue to maintain their respective lots,
and collectively maintain those that belong to the City of Detroit or the Detroit Land Bank Authority.

Attached are recently photographed images of illegally discarded debris. Please take into consideration
this request and notify me of your decision.

Respectfully,

Michael E. Williams

Honorable City Council:

RE: Amended Petition No. 140 PVS Chemicals, Inc. request to vacate various streets
and alleys surrounding its headquarters located at 10900 Harper

 

Amended Petition No. 140 PVS Chemicals, Inc. nequesting the vacation and conversion to
easement of Venice Avenue, 50 feet wide, from Harper Avenue to Devine Avenue; and
Montclair Avenue, 60 feet wide, from Ford Freeway West Bound Service Drive to Harper
Avenue; and east-west alleys, 15 and 20 feet wide, and north-south alley, 15 feet wide, all in the
block of Harper Avenue, Devine Avenue, and Venice Avenue.

The petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for investigation (utility
review) and report. This is our report.

The request is being made to consolidate the PVS properties in the area of their World
Headquarters. At the present site, in addition to their World Headquarters, PVS has extensive
facilities including: Water-Treatment Chemical Manufacturing Facility, Transportation
Terminal, Warehouse Facility, and a Landscaped Park area. PVS has acquired the properties
adjoining the streets and alleys, and maintains the properties. The street closure-s will help
prevent illegal dumping and other illicit activities in the area.

The request was approved by the Solid Waste Division DPW, Traffic Engineering
Division DPW (TED), and City Engineering Division DPW. The petition originally
included a vacation of Athens Avenue from Devine Street to Harper Avenue, and the
creation of a turnaround area; however, the request was amended to not include Athens
Avenue or the turnaround.

Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has no objection to the conversion to
easement. The speci?c DWSD provisions for easements are included in the resolution-

DTE Energy Electric reports having facilities in the subject streets. Provisions for DTE to have
unimpeded access to maintain their facilities are a part of the resolution.

1/29/19 mac?s @411?th

All other involved City Departments, and privately owned utility companies have reported no
objections to the conversion of the public rights-of-way into private easements for public utilities.
Provisions protecting utility installations are part of the attached resolution.

I am recommending adoption of the attached resolution.
