Communication dated November 20, 2018 (received March 11th) requesting
Commission approval of a purchase and development agreement involving the
Charter County of Wayne (“County”), the Wayne County Land Bank Corporation
(“Land Bank”) and ICONIC-511, LLC (of Birmingham) in the amount of $4,650,000 for
the conveyance of 511 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, MI 48226 from the County to the
Land Bank, and the property’s sale from the Land Bank to ICONIC-511, LLC; the
transaction also includes roof and alley easement agreements between the County
and ICONIC-511, LLC; the County Executive advises that this site adjacent to the
Guardian Building is no longer utilized by the County; considering maintenance costs
and the County’s plans for the consolidation of assets in order to reduce General Fund
expenditures, the administration has determined that it is prudent for the County to sell
this property; the term of the agreement will commence upon Commission approval;
the revenue from the agreement will be deposited into Account No. 101 92504 673020
(General Fund General Purpose). (2019-91-004)
