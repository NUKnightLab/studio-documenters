Report from System Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
Debra Carey, Chief Operating Officer of Ambulatory Services, provided an update regarding the Joint
Commission survey of the Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County (ACHN). She
stated that the survey took place between March 17th and March 20th. The administration was required to
submit action plans on several items that were cited during the survey. One of the responses was submitted
prior to May 15th, as was required; in that response, it was indicated that all of the citations had been
reviewed and addressed, and action items, as well as monitoring actions, have been implemented. The
second set of responses was due on May 30th; the administration has also submitted its corrective action
plan, as well as monitoring activities that will be conducted on those citations. As of this date, responses
have been submitted for all of the requirements for the survey.
B. Publicly Reported Ratings
There was no report presented on this subject at this time.

Report from System Chief Quality Officer (continued)
C. Report – 2013 Stroke Program (Attachment #1)
Dr. Michael Kelly, Chairman of the Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, provided a
presentation on the 2013 Stroke Program. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
The Committee discussed the differences between a primary stroke center and a comprehensive stroke
center. Stroger Hospital is certified as a primary stroke center; Dr. Kelly noted that most major hospitals in
the area are certified as either primary or comprehensive stroke centers.
Dr. Kelly stated that certification as a primary stroke center requires that the hospital administration and
staff follow the guidelines, have the structure in place, measure and compare the hospital against national
goals, and are able to provide the kind of educational program that is required. To do that, the hospital
needs to have a radiology suite that meets certain standards; it also needs to have an intensive care unit
(ICU) that meets certain standards. It needs to have leadership within the medical group, and also needs to
have the administrators in the hospital support it.
Ramping up to a comprehensive level involves a few more requirements. The hospital needs to have a
neurologic ICU that is able to provide the kind of care that is available twenty-four hours per day/seven
days per week (24/7) that these very sick patients need. The typical institution that is certified at a
comprehensive level would have a neurologic ICU where all serious stroke patients would be admitted.
Those patients would be cared for by a group of individuals dedicated to care of stroke patients. Typically,
this kind of level of service would have within it teaching programs, such that they would provide
fellowships for the training of people to follow them afterwards. The hospital would need to have
endovascular therapy available 24/7 – this is a matter of being able, on very short notice, to deliver
thrombolytic clot busting drugs by way of a catheter into that very blocked artery in the brain. Stroger
Hospital provides some of that kind of care, but does not provide that level of care on a 24/7 basis.
Director Lerner noted that 92% of Stroger Hospital stroke patients present as basically a result of blood
clots. With regard to CountyCare patients, and managing a population, the hypothesis he would put on the
table is to ask how many of that 92% could effectively be managed on a primary prevention basis, and how
many of those folks could be obviated through some type of primary prevention before the onset of the
stroke? Once an institution has a risk-based population, having members of that population present with a
stroke means it is already too late for preventative measures – he wondered how the System can work
backwards to prevent that from happening. Dr. Kelly responded that it is not known what is the maximum
ability of the System to prevent it, but it could probably be reduced by half if all of its patients were within
range with their blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol, and did not practice risky behaviors with drugs –
he believes that is a goal. The other half is composed of unknown factors, including things like genetic
predispositions that cannot be addressed at this time. Currently, what may be lacking are stronger efforts to
make the patients informed with the knowledge that following a program can prevent this kind of event.
Director Lerner referenced the 80/20 rule – this is a concept that predicts that 80% of the costs and
utilization will be caused by 20% of the population. By looking at the CountyCare member at-risk
population, such as those members who are at a higher risk for stroke, and striving for some kind of
community intervention that can take place, perhaps the onset of the 20% can be minimized. Dr. Kelly
added that 20% of patients who have a stroke will have another stroke within five years – for that group, it
is incumbent upon the System to make sure it takes care of that high-risk group.

Report from System Chief Quality Officer
C. Report – 2013 Stroke Program (continued)
Dr. Kelly stated that the mean age of the stroke patients at Stroger Hospital is 58 years; nationally, the mean
age of stroke patients is 70. 12% of Stroger Hospital stroke patients are under the age of 45; 82% are under
the age of 65. With regard to risk-based populations, Director Lerner noted that the acute care for stroke
patients is only part of the care involved; the post-acute care is extremely important, too, because a stroke
essentially becomes a chronic disease that has to be managed along with the patient’s other medical
problems.

IV.

Action Items
A. Minutes of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting, April 24, 2014
Director Lerner, seconded by Chairman Collens, moved to accept the Minutes of the
Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting of April 24, 2014. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B. **Medical Staff Appointments/Re-appointments/Changes (Attachment #2)
Director Lerner, seconded by Chairman Collens, moved to approve the medical staff
appointments/reappointments/changes. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Any items listed under Sections IV, V and VI

V.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees
i. Provident Hospital of Cook County
ii. John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
Dr. Ozuru Ukoha, President of the Executive Medical Staff (EMS) of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook
County, presented his report regarding the recent meeting of the EMS on May 13th.
Dr. Ukoha stated that, at that meeting, an update was received on Meaningful Use. One of the initiatives
relating to that is the creation of an internet portal for use by patients to access their medical records.
MyCookCountyHealth.org allows the patients to sign up to view their medical records, which are updated
within a few hours of the patient leaving one of the System’s facilities. The patients are allowed to view
some data; the portal also gives them the opportunity to do other things, such as schedule appointments
online and receive information on financial counseling. Dr. Ukoha stated that, over the past three month
period, the portal has gotten better, but there are certain areas where goals still need to be reached.
Dr. Ukoha stated that the medical staff is concerned about the proposed changes to the County’s pension
plan. He stressed the need to effectively deliver information on this matter to the medical staff across the
spectrum. Dr. John Jay Shannon, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief of Clinical Integration, stated
that the administration is currently in the watchful, waiting mode, anticipating that something is going to
happen in Springfield this week regarding this subject. Once the details of that legislation are known, then
the administration will have a much better ability to focus in and highlight some of those areas in particular
that it believes are at risk because of impending
pension plan changes.

V.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees (continued)
Dr. Ukoha brought up the subject of capacity; he indicated that, as patients continue to be signed up as
CountyCare members, staff needs to continue to work diligently to provide those patients with a home for
their medical issues. Director Lerner remarked that, rather than treating this as a matter relating to capacity,
perhaps it should be viewed as a matter relating to capabilities - you really want to have the capability to
treat all of these patients. The size issue is really a throughput problem; it is a systemic problem. Issues
relating to location are influenced by whether the patients are treated here in the hospital or in the
community. There are a lot of alternatives for effective treatments for a large number of patients. He stated
that the capability discussion boils down to the common belief shared by staff and the Board – they want the
County System to treat patients as if they were in a private system - that is really the standard that is needed,
otherwise those patients will choose to go to another system.
In response to a question posed by Chairman Collens regarding one or two areas in need of improvement
that relates to capacity/capability, Dr. Ukoha stated that, in his opinion, the two areas would be access and
staffing. The System needs to have a bank of services and needs to provide patients with the opportunity for
them to get access to health care when they need it – staff is working very hard on addressing this. To do
this, the System needs to have enough employees, including members of the medical staff. The System
needs to grow that number – if the System can keep the staff it currently has by persuading them from
leaving the System, and then focus on hiring people to fill the other vacancies, this favorably impacts access.
Dr. Pierre Wakim, of Provident Hospital of Cook County, presented a report on behalf of Dr. Anwer
Hussain, President of the EMS of Provident Hospital of Cook County. With regard to the subject of
proposed changes to the County’s pension plan, he noted that a member of the staff at Provident Hospital
recently resigned, in anticipation of legislation that may soon be voted upon down in Springfield; he
remarked that it is challenging to replace valued staff, particularly those in leadership positions.
With regard to the earlier discussion on capacity/capabilities, Dr. Wakim stated that, approximately four
years ago, presentations were prepared and research done on the possibility of creating a center for chronic
illness and preventive medicine on the South side of Chicago; he added that this initiative was not further
developed due to funding issues. He noted that staff are equipped with knowledge to move forward if it is
determined that this initiative should be re-examined.

VI.
