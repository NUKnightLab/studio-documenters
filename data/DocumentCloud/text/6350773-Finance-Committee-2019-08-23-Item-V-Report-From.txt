Observations on Financials
 Net Patient Service Revenues - $408M, 4% unfavorable to target due to increasing and unsustainable growth in
charity care and some lower clinical activity

•

System-wide uninsured numbers
•

Captured by Visits, held at 44%

•

Captured by Charges, held at 40%

 CountyCare Capitation Revenues - $1.1B, 3% unfavorable to target due to lower than budgeted enrollment as a
result of lower State/County MCO enrollment
 Other Revenues - $2.8M , ongoing review of outstanding payments to ensure we get caught up by year end

 Cost of Pharma - $46M, favorable by 2% compared to budget
