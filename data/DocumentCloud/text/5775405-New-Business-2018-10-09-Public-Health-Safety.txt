DATE: October 8, 2018

RE: Request for the Legislative Policy Division to Draft a Water Affordability Ordinance

I believe all people should have access to clean, safe, accessible and affordable water and sanitation and
that water is a human right. The number of water shutoffs in the City of Detroit is an affront to the
humanity of Detroiters, a public health crisis and a threat to the economic vitality of our City. Therefore, I
am requesting that LPD draft a water affordability ordinance for the City of Detroit.

The ordinance should be based upon the research provided by Roger Colton entitled Water
Affordability Program for the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department? dated January, 2005. The draft
ordinance should utilize assumptions and recommendations made in the report with respect to customers

in arrearage and following EPA standards of affordability - amongst others.

Thank you.

RE: 5728 Lawndale Street

 

I am requesting a status update regarding aft-"5128 Lawndale Street;
Over the last 8 years, the home has received 7 blight violations. Despite elevated violation rates over
time, Department of Administrative Hearings records indicate nonpayment on six of these
violations.

The property currently suffers from a number of blight concerns. High weeds and foliage have led
to an infestation of both small rodents and snakes. Neighbors have reported observing snakes in
and around their homes.

What escalated measures can be implemented to ensure these safety concerns are addressed?

Please contact my office (313) 224-2450 if you have any questions.
