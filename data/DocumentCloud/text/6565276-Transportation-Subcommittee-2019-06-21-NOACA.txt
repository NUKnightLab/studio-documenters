SFY 2021-2024 TIP Development – Potential projects for NOACA
controlled funds

PREVIOUS ACTION

Developed criteria and methodology to evaluate
eligible projects for NOACA funding
•
6-11

Presented to the Advisory Councils, Transportation
Subcommittee and the Programming and Planning
Committee for input and discussion

 BACKGROUND
The Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)
is a compilation of projects to be implemented
using Federal-aid funding over the next four-year
period
• Implementation arm of the AIM Forward 2040
long-range transportation plan
• Contains both NOACA and ODOT funded projects
• Incorporated into the Statewide Transportation
Improvement Program (STIP)
• Historically developed every two years

6-11

 BACKGROUND

The SFY 2021-2024 TIP will:
• Be in effect from July 1, 2020 through

•
•

June 30, 2024;
Contain road, bridge, public transit
and other transportation projects
scheduled for implementation; and
Include projects supported by federal
funds through:

• NOACA
• ODOT
• Transit Agencies

6-11

 BACKGROUND
The universe of projects being evaluated for NOACA
administered funding was developed through a
comprehensive needs assessment process including:
• Projects derived from NOACA plans

• Transportation Asset Management (TAM);
• Safety, Congestion and Transportation Alternatives plans; and

• Projects submitted by communities and other agencies

• Responses to NOACA’s request for evaluation of project needs
• Included project scope, schedule and budget

6-11

 BACKGROUND
Overall, nearly 700 projects were identified totaling more
than $1 billion to implement
• Resources needed in the five counties far exceeds the
estimated $90 million of NOACA funding available for the
SFY 2021-2024 TIP

Projects advanced with NOACA funding in the TIP should:
• Best correspond to priorities contained in the AIM Forward
2040 long-range transportation plan; and
• Closely align with established State and Federal
transportation management initiatives

6-11

 BACKGROUND

• March 2019 – Staff presented methodology to evaluate
projects for NOACA funding to the Transportation
Subcommittee for input and discussion
• Input received was incorporated into staff presentation to
Planning and Programming Committee

• April 2019 – Staff presented the updated methodology to
evaluate projects for NOACA funding to the Planning and
Programming Committee for input and discussion
• Received additional input that was incorporated into the final
recommended methodology which follows

6-11

 BACKGROUND
Project Evaluation Approach
1. Filter 25 percent of preservation projects by
County and regional miles travelled, then by cost
effectiveness;
2. Incorporate all other NOACA plan list projects; and
3. Evaluate eligible projects against established
Regional Significance Criteria, NOACA plans and
other considerations

6-11

 BACKGROUND

Project Evaluation Approach

1. Filter preservation projects:

1. 25% – 671 projects in universe x 25% = 167
projects; then
2. County by regional vehicle miles traveled; then
3. Cost effectiveness within each County

•
•
6-11

Incorporate additional regionally significant
projects important to the economy, regional
travel and destinations
Remove project segments that have been
recently rehabilitated or are planned
(Ongoing)

 BACKGROUND

Universe of remaining eligible projects

 BACKGROUND
3. Evaluate with Regional Significance Criteria (cont.)
• Consistency with NOACA plans (up to 1 point each /
maximum of 5 points)
•
•
•
•
•

6-11

Safety/Congestion Priority locations
Freight Plan Priority Routes
Public Transit Priority Corridors

 BACKGROUND
3. Evaluate Projects Against Other
Considerations
• NOACA Diversity and Inclusion
Policies

• Environmental Justice Community
• Disadvantaged Community
• Urban Core Community

• Consideration of Urbanized vs. Rural
Areas
• Cost effectiveness across project types
6-11

 BACKGROUND
• Draft list of projects proposed for further evaluation by work type,
including preservation; safety and congestion; and transportation
alternatives
• Top 25% of preservation projects proposed for further evaluation
and NOACA funding consideration; and
• Bottom 75% not proposed for evaluation for NOACA funding
consideration
• Subcommittee asked to provide input on whether any project(s)
not proposed for further evaluation should be considered based
on its regional importance and connectivity

 NEXT STEPS
•
•

Staff will continue to evaluate potential projects for
NOACA administered funding
Project funding recommendations will be presented
to:
•
•

6-11

recommendation on July 12, 2019
Board of Directors for approval on September 13, 2019

 NEXT STEPS
