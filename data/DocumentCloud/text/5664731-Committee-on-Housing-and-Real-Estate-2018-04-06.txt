CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF
PLANNING DEVELOPMENT

LETTER FROM THE COMMISSIONER

We are pleased to submit the 2017 Fourth Quarter Progress Report, which presents the
Department of Planning and Development?s progress on the goals set forth in Bouncing Back,
the City?s Five?Year Housing Plan covering the years 2014-18. During the fourth quarter the
City approved three innovative mixed?use projects combining affordable housing with
neighborhood libraries, and we inaugurated two pilot projects under the 2015 Affordable
Requirements Ordinance designed to spur creation of additional affordable units in
neighborhoods experiencing accelerated private development.

For the full year of 2017, the Department committed $403.5 million to support 8,208
housing units. This represents 166% of our annual resource allocation goal and 107% of our
unit goal. With the completion of the fourth year of our plan we have now achieved 101% of
our ?ve?year resource goal and 71% of our unit goal.

The Department of Planning and Development (DPD) is the lead agency for the City?s
affordable housing, housing preservation and homebuyer assistance programs. DPD also
promotes economic development by helping existing businesses grow and attracting new
industry to the city, and it coordinates all of our zoning, land use planning, sustainability and
historic preservation initiatives.

With the Chicago housing market?s accelerating recovery from the 2007?8 collapse, along with
the successful 015 expansion of the City?s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, we have seen an
upsurge in production under our affordable housing programs. But we at DPD could not
succeed in our work without the ongoing support and cooperation of our community partners
that serve Chicago?s neighborhoods, together with elected officials, state and federal agencies and
other community stakeholders. Through these efforts, we will continue to move forward in
creating and preserving affordable housing for the people of Chicago.

CREATION AND PRESERVATION OF
AFFORDABLE RENTAL UNITS

Multi?family Rehab and New Construction

In 2017, the Department of Planning and Development projected commitments of almost
$205 million to support more than 5,400 units of affordable rental housing. DPD initiatives
support new construction, rehab of abandoned or deteriorated properties and direct rental
subsidies.

For the full year, DPD committed over $234 million in resources to support 5,396 units.
These numbers represent 99% of the 2017 multi?family unit goal and 174% of the multi-
family resource allocation goal.

Life Center Artist Residences

A $23.3 million, mixed-income apartment complex for artists and their families will be
developed in the Washington Park community through a ?nancial package approved on
October 11 by the City Council.

Life Center Artist Residences, located at the southwest corner of Gar?eld Boulevard and
Michigan Avenue in the 20th Ward, will contain 58 apartments for artists and families
and 5,000 square feet of retail and studio space on the ground floor. The project will be
constructed on two City-owned vacant lots appraised at $925,000 that will be conveyed for
$1 each, combined with two other parcels already owned by the developer.

Forty?nine units will be rented to households at 60 percent of area median income; the other
nine will be offered at market rates. Amenities will include a fitness room, bike storage,
community space and on?site parking.

The four?story project is being developed through a partnership of Brinshore Development,
Imagine Group Washington Park LLC and KLEO Comm unity Life Center. City
assistance will include $6.4 million in TIF funds, $1.5 million in Low Income Housing Tax
Credits that will generate $15.2 million in equity, and $270,000 in Donations Tax Credits

Lincoln Park Community Shelter

On November 8 the Council approved a $2.5 million Multiwfamily Loan from the Affordable
Housing Opportunity Fund to support the construction of a five-story supportive housing
facility on the Near North Side. Lincoln Park Community Shelter, to be located at
1521 N. Sedgwick Street in the 27th Ward, will contain twenty BOO?square?foot efficiency
apartments, each with private bath, along with laundry facilities, a ?tness center and a
community space.

All units in the $7 million project, which is being developed by
Lincoln Park Community Services, will receive rental assistance
from the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) and be affordable
for tenants earning up to 50 percent of AMI. Additional
funding will be provided through a $4.5 million loan from the
i Illinois Housing Development Authority (II-IDA). Case
management services and support staff will be furnished by an
adjacent homeless shelter.

 

Taylor Street Library and Apartments

A combination Chicago Public Library branch and mixed?income housing development will
be built on the Near West Side through ?nancial measures approved on November 8 by the
City Council. The $36.2 million Taylor Street Library and Apartments was one of three
CHA?sponsored residential/ library projects that received City approval in the fourth quarter.

The Taylor Street project, to be developed by Related Midwest, will feature a 17,000?square?
foot branch library and 73 one- and two?bedroom apartments. Thirty-seven of the units will
be set aside for CHA residents, 29 will be affordable at up to 60% of AMI, and seven will be

leased at market rates.

?This innovative partnership will create new affordable housing and a valuable neighborhood
resource,? said Mayor Emanuel. ?Chicago will be one of the first cities using this type of
partnership between housing and libraries to benefit and beautify our neighborhoods.?

City financial assistance will consist of $7 million in TIF funds, $26 million in Housing
Revenue Bonds that will generate $9.9 million in Low Income Housing Tax Credit equity,
and $1.2 million in donations tax credit equity. Other funding sources include a $17 million
CHA loan and $1.2 million in grants.

 

The new building, to be located at 1328-50 West Taylor Street
in the 28th Ward, is part of the ongoing redevelopment of the
former ABLA Homes public housing complex. The project?s
residential component will also include a management office,
exercise room, laundry facilities, roof terraces and on-site
parking. The seven-story structure was designed by the
architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings 8c Merrill.

Independence Library and Apartments
Northtown Library and Apartments

Two additional library/housing developments will also move forward as the result of tax
incentive packages approved by the City on December 15. Together, the projects will create
88 units of affordable housing for independent seniors in the Irving Park and West Ridge
communities.

Independence Library and Apartments will occupy a six?
story building to be constructed by EREG Development LLC
at 4022?36 N. Elston Avenue in the 45th Ward. Above the
two?story library, the four upper ?oors will contain 36 one-
bedroom and 8 two-bedroom apartments, all affordable to
seniors at up to 60% of AMI.

The $33.3 complex will be built on CHA?owned land, and
the Authority is providing $10.9 million in capital funds as
well as project-based Section 8 vouchers for thirty units funded
by RAD (Rental Assistance Demonstration) Program.
The City is supporting the project with $1.7 million in Low Income Housing Tax Credits,
generating $17.2 million in equity, and $940,000 in Donations Tax Credits that will generate

$840,000 in equity.

 

 

The same developer is also building the $34.0 million Northtown Library and Apartments
on a CHA?owned site at 6800 N. Western Avenue in the 50th Ward. This four?story project,
designed by the architectural firm of Perkins+WilL will contain 44 affordable one-bedroom
apartments on three ?oors atop the branch library. Here again, thirty units

will be supported with Section 8 vouchers
under the RAD Program.

Updates to Previously Reported Developments

Trianon Lofts a Milestone In
Revitalization of Woodlawn

Mayor Emanuel on November 7 joined with
local officials and neighborhood residents to celebrate
completion of the first units of market?rate rental
housing constructed in Woodlawn in more than forty
years. The $12.5 million Trianon Lofts contains 24
two?bedroom apartments split equally between market-
rate and affordable units, located in a four?story building
constructed on the southeast corner of 61st Street and
Cottage Grove Avenue in the 20th Ward

 

The development by Preservation of Affordable Housing, Inc. (POAH) is located direct-
ly across from the site of a future Jewel?Osco grocery and pharmacy scheduled to begin
construction in 2018. In addition to the residential units, the building contains 7,000 square
feet of ground?floor commercial space anchored by an early childhood center.

?Trianon Lofts demonstrates the City of Chicago?s commitment to building stronger,
safer communities with more housing and better economic opportunities,? the mayor said.
?Today?s grand opening represents the latest step in Woodlawn?s rebirth and reflects the hard
work and commitment of POAH and our other community partners.?

Since 2011, POAH has partnered with the City to leverage a $30.5 million HUD Choice
Neighborhoods Initiative grant into $410 million in new residential, retail, institutional and
civic investment. Besides Trianon Lofts, this investment has created six new buildings along
the Cottage Grove corridor and nearly 800 units

of market?rate and affordable housing throughout
Woodlawn.

 

Financing for the project, which was approved by
the City Council in February 2016, included a
$2.5 million Multi?family Loan. The building is
named for the historic Trianon Ballroom that was
located nearby until its demolition in 1967.

Rosenwald Courts Restoration Honored
By Landmarks Commission

On October 24 the Commission on Chicago Landmarks honored thirteen unique
redevelopment projects with Preservation Excellence Awards, including the City?funded
rehabilitation of the long?vacant Rosenwald Court Apartments in Grand Boulevard.

The 2017 awards, held for the eighteenth year, were presented at the Chicago Cultural
Center. The winning buildings were chosen by the Commission?s Permit Review
Committee, which considered dozens of projects involving individual landmarks and
landmark district buildings that were completed over the last year. Honorees included
property owners, architects, design professionals and historic preservation specialists and
advocates.

Rosenwald Courts was built in 1930 at 47th Street and Michigan Avenue by former Sears,
Roebuck President Julius Rosenwald. Originally called the Michigan Boulevard Garden
Apartments, the complex of connected three- and five-story structures provided workforce
housing during the Great Migration era that drew a half?million African Americans to

Chicago.

The buildings? brick exteriors, designed by Rosenwald?s nephew Ernest Grunsfield, Jr.,
feature a unique combination of Arts and Crafts brickwork with Art Moderne terra cotta
detailing. Vacant for more than a decade, the complex reopened in 2016 following a $132
million, City?aided restoration by Rosenwald Courts GP LLC that created 239 one? and two?
bedroom apartments for seniors and families. Financing for the redevelopment, located in
the 3rd Ward, was authorized by the City Council in October
2015. City assistance included tax?exempt bonds, tax credits, TIF
funds and a Neighborhood Stabilization Program grant.

 

 
 
  

On November 8 Rosenwald Courts was ap-
proved by the City Council as an official
Chicago landmark. The designation, which
was recommended by the Landmarks
Commission in July 2016, will protect the
buildings? exterior elevations and interior
courtyard from alteration or demolition.

PROMOTION AND SUPPORT OF
HOMEOWNERSHIP

In 2017, the Department of Planning and Development projected commitments of
almost $26 million to help over 400 households achieve or sustain homeownership. DPD
initiatives support the construction of new homes, the acquisition and rehab of deteriorated and
abandoned properties and ?nancing programs for home purchase and rehabilitation.

For the full year, DPD committed more than $32 million to support 581 units.
These numbers represent 134% of the 2017 homeownership unit goal and 126% of the
homeownership resource allocation goal.

City Land Sales Program to Boost
Affordable Homeownership in Neighborhoods

City?owned vacant lots will be offered for $1 each to developers of affordable single-family
homes and two-flats under a new program authorized by the City Council on November 8.
Mayor Emanuel?s City Lots for Working Families initiative is designed to create new
affordable homeownership opportunities in neighborhoods throughout Chicago.

Under the program, eight to twenty City?owned lots with a maximum appraised value of
$125,000 will be conveyed to the developer of each project. Seventy-five percent of the homes
built on these sites will be priced at approximately $150,000 to $300,000, depending on neigh?
borhood. These houses will be made available to quali?ed buyers with incomes at up to 140
percent of AMI, currently $110,600 for a family of four. Buyers must use the homes as their
primary residence for a minimum of five years.

?Land acquisition costs are some of the biggest barriers to development of new homes,? noted
Mayor Emanuel. ?Eliminating these costs will support more construction, more jobs and more
economic development in our neighborhoods.?

The new program, to be administered by the Department of Planning and Development,
also features a streamlined acquisition process and reduced permit fees, in order to encourage
participation by small and minority developers. Approximately 5,000 vacant lots zoned
residential currently are owned by the City, primarily on the West and South Sides.

Bronzeville Hosts Third Ward
Parade of Homes Tour

On December 18 Mayor Emanuel joined Alderman Pat Dowell and local developers for a
tour of the new market?rate, single-family homes that are now being built under the Third
Ward Parade of Homes initiative in Bronzeville.

?The Parade of Homes is driving new residential development to support the commercial
development happening across Bronzeville,? the mayor said. ?This initiative doubles down
on the progress we have seen throughout Bronzeville?from the Arts and Recreation Center
at Ellis Park to the Mariano?s on King Drive to the state?of?the?art pedestrian bridge at 35th
Street.?

In the first phase of the program, five participating developers?R8CD Builders, Greenline
Parade of Homes, Urban Equities, Wade Enterprises 85 Associates, and Click Development?
are building model homes in the 4500 block of 5. Prairie Avenue on City-owned vacant lots
acquired for $1 each. These developers were selected by the Department of Planning and
Development through a Request for Quali?cations (RFQ) process in late 2016.

The completed two-story homes will range in size from
3,200 to 4,000 square feet. The largest will contain ?ve
bedrooms and 3.5 baths. Sales prices will start at $450,000.
After these houses are sold, additional parcels will be
conveyed to the developers for half of their current
appraised values. Eventually, up to 42 single-family homes
are expected to be built on City?owned lots in the 3900 to
4500 blocks of Prairie, Calumet and Indiana Avenues.

 

IMPROVEMENT AND PRESERVATION
OF HOMES

In 2017 the Department of Planning and Development projected commitments of over
$13 million to assist nearly 1,800 households repair, modify or improve their homes. DPD
initiatives support emergency repairs, energy efficiency improvements and financing programs
to help existing homeowners keep their homes.

For the full year, DPD committed almost $16 million in resources to support 2,231 units.
These numbers represent 126% of the 2017 improvement and preservation unit goal and
119% of the improvement and preservation resource allocation goal.

POLICY, LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS
AND OTHER ISSUES

ARO Updates Will Focus On Gentrifying Neighborhoods

Two pilot programs authorized by the City Council on October 11 will update the
Affordable Requirements Ordinance (ARO) to strengthen the City?s affordable housing
policy in redeveloping areas on the Near North, Near West and Northwest Sides. These
initiatives are expected to spur the creation of as many as 1,000 new affordable units in targeted
neighborhoods that now face accelerated private development and growing displacement

pressures.
The pilot programs will operate in two geographic areas over the next three years:

Milwaukee Corridor Pilot Area, covering approximately nine square miles along
Milwaukee Avenue in the Logan Square, Avondale and West Town community area

Near North/Near West Pilot Area, covering a total of about six square miles in two
zones near the North Branch Industrial Corridor on the Near North Side and along
the Green Line and on the Near West Side

In these areas the revisions will expand the provisions of the 2015 ARO, which mandates a 10
percent affordability component for all new projects containing ten or more units that receive
a zoning change. The 2015 ARO also requires at least 25 percent of the required affordable
units to be constructed on? or off-site, with the remaining obligation to be met through pay?
ment of in?lieu fees ranging up to $225,000. The new pilot programs eliminate the in?lieu fee
option to incentivize the production of greater numbers of affordable units in each target area.

In the Milwaukee Corridor, the revisions also:

Raise the 10 percent ARO unit obligation to 15 percent if a developer builds on?site
and 20 percent if a developer opts to build off?site within the pilot area

Increase the number of households eligible for affordable units by expanding the pool
of eligible tenants to those earning up to 80 percent of AMI (currently $50,600 for a
two?person household)

In the Near North/Near West Pilot Area, the new requirements are responding to the
growing need for affordable workforce housing serving the thousands of new jobs expected to
be generated by the North Branch Industrial Corridor modernization initiative, as well as
stabilizing Near West Side neighborhoods now experiencing limited housing investment. The
ARO unit obligation will increase from 10% to 20% in the Near North Zone ofthis pilot area,
with half of the required units built either on?site or within two miles of the project. In the
Near West Zone, the unit obligation will now be 15%, with two?thirds of the required units
constructed on-site or within two miles of the project.

Zoning applications that trigger the ARO have more than doubled since 2014. Over the next
three years, DPD will assess the impact of the ARO revisions on the production of affordable
units within the two target areas and develop recommendations for the new policy?s
continuation or expansion.
