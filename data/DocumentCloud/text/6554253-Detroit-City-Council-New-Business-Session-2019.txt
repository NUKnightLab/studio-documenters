HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: CPC Comments on Proposed Chapter 4 Sign Ordinance of 9/30/2019?City Council
Public Hearing, 11/21/2019

Per the request of Council President Pro-Tem Shef?eld, City Planning Commission (CPC) staff has
prepared and updated an analysis of the proposed Chapter 4 (Advertising and Signs) amendment to
the 2019 Detroit City Code. The public hearing for the Chapter 4 amendment is November 21, 2019.
Chapter 4 is part of a multi-chapter revision of sign regulations. Chapter 50, Zoning, is also proposed
for revision to move sign regulations out of Zoning and will be the subject of a CPC public hearing
on the evening of November 215?.

Proposed Ordinance

The City Planning Commission staff has received from City Council the most recent Law
Department draft of amendments to seven different chapters of the 2019 Detroit City Code with
regard to signs. We commend the authors for having fashioned a comprehensive revision and
updating of de?nitions, regulations, and procedures that have needed attention for a decade. We look
forward to continued contribution to this effort via informal and formal review.

It has been the express desire to merge regulations for on?premises business signs and off-premises
advertising signs into a single chapter of the City Code; the preposed Chapter 4 amendments would
accomplish that task. The ordinance also allows owners to legally generate revenue from the display
of super-graphics on their buildings downtown, as the proposed ordinance removes longstanding
obstacles.

We acknowledge and appreciate the changes in the proposed ordinance from earlier versions and for
its recognition of the importance of aesthetics:

The creation of ?Sign districts? based on Master Plan classi?cations provides applicants and
City staff a clear and objective basis for understanding which signs can go where in lieu of
zoning districts.

The value of local artists is recognized by the ordinance?s favoring of painted wall graphics.

0 Landscaping requirements will improve the aesthetics of solitary billboards on a vacant lot.

Downtown be subject to conSIderable accountab111ty requirmg they be current
with tax respon ?ipilities and their building possessing a certi?cate of occupancy and
certi?cate of cam?liance.

For the ?rst time, signs will be subject to amortization, consistent with state law and case
law, requiring eventual compliance of existing noncompliant signs with proposed standards.

The ordinance?s statement of purpose is more robust and in line with cities of comparable
size.

Stringent provisions relating to obsolete, vacant, neglected and abandoned signs are clearly
stated.

Dynamic/digital advertising signs are Speci?cally regulated for the ?rst time.

Portable signs in the right-of-way (sidewalk signs) are permitted and regulated.

Comments and Concerns

As is true of any major ordinance revision, there are innumerable to dot and to cross. We
?nd a variety of sections where corrections are merited and where alternate language would be
appropriate; those are listed in Attachment A. Additionally, certain provisions formally
recommended by vote of the City Planning Commission in 2015 are missing from the most recent
draft. Most importantly, however, several features of the ordinance have intended or unintended
consequences that give us great pause, speci?cally:

While the driving force behind the cmrent revisions has been to remove the prohibition of
advertising signs in the Central Business District (CBD), the Chapter 4 ordinance
dramatically increases the areas where conventional billboards and advertising wall signs
can be displayed outside the CBD?areas, including residential districts, where advertising
signs have long been held as inappropriate Concerns over new advertising
sign allowances and the repeal of longstanding advertising sign prohibitions and limitations
were strongly voiced at community/ stakeholder meetings earlier this year. A more detailed
description of this expanded allowance is provided in Attachment B.

Review of signage is no longer able to be undertaken as part of site plan review?an
unnecessary fragmenting of the project review process. Among other things, this precludes
City Council from reviewing/approving/ denying signage in large developments on land
zoned SD4 (Special Development District, River?ont Mixed-Use) and in SDS (Special
Development District, Casinos) ?5 0-2-1, ?50?3-152, ?50?3-
180). Excluding signage from site plan review may compromise the integrity of approved
plans and have unintended impacts on adjacent properties and the right-of?way.

City Council would no longer have the authority to approve/deny signage as part of its
?special district review? responsibility. Special district review requires Council to authorize
alterations to the exterior appearance of buildings and premises on land zoned PC (Public
Center) and PCA (Public Center Adjacent, Restricted Central Business District. The City
Flaming Commission and the Planning and Development Department are also mpacted..

2

(?50-11?66) and ?50?11?96)

Those who object to an administrative decision or to a waiver or adjustment in favor of a sign
applicant, such as neighboring property owners/residents/other businesses, have no right to

appeal the determination. ?4-4?21)

Sign application review staff is responsible for determining whether an advertising sign
application is compliant with spacing and setback requirements, yet the ordinance repeals the
provisions that place a burden on the applicant to indicate a proposed sign?s proximity to
nearby dwelling units, schools, parks/playgrounds, historic districts, rights-of-way, and other
advertising signs (?50-6?80 through 50-6-84). More robust ?submittal requirements? are
warranted in general and for comprehensive sign plans in particular 

Nonconforming signs that have until January 1, 2030 to become subject to the proposed sign
ordinance appear to enjoy a loophole to disregard the ?no signs on vacant buildings?
provision and the ?Protection of Minors? prohibition against alcohol/tobacco advertising in
certain locations. Tighter wording would be appropriate. 

Violations of Chapter 4 sign provisions are proposed to be handled as blight violations but
state law may not allow that. MCL 11 7. 4q(4))

CPC staff submits these items, and those listed in Attachment A, as you consider the proposed

Chapter 4 amendment.

ATTACHMENT A: CPC staff concerns over 9-30-2019 draft of Sign Ordinance.

The Flaming and Development Department?s and City Planning Commission?s ?Special
District Review? authority to review and City Council?s authority to approve/deny
proposed signage on land zoned PC (?50-11-66) and PCA (?50?11-96) is not preserved.

Authorization to review signage as part of site plan review is not preserved 
113(7), ?50-3-180).

Chapter 4 violations are to be treated as ?blight violations? however, the Home
Rule City Act (MCL only allows eight types of ordinances to be handled as
blight violations. Sign ordinances (outside of Zoning) do not appear to be one of the
eight types.

Restrictions on signage for home occupations are not preserved.

Billboards that are currently nonconforming appear to be newly allowed to ?out the
alcohol-tobacco limitations until January 1, 2030 and the ?no signs on vacant
buildings? provision among other provisions.

Conformities/Nonconformities:

0 Many existing billboards are conforming Egg permitted uses in a given
district), but are nonconforming structures?too high, too big under current
Zoning. Unclear when billboards that are nonconforming structures are subject to
the new Chapter 4 

0 Similarly, many advertising signs are both conforming uses and conforming
structures but do n_ot conform with the proposed new standards in Ch. 4 for
height, area, setback, and spacing.

Violations of the ?protection of minors? ordinance (alcohol/tobacco sign provisions) are
classi?ed as misdemeanors but BSEED is responsible for enforcement; unclear whether
BSEED writes misdemeanor tickets.

The de?nition of ?sponsorship sign? implies a much broader applicability than
as speci?ed under the sign regulations as accompaniments to public art 

Advertising signs require a BSEED permit which cannot be issued ?except upon approval
of a waiver of such however, no cross-reference is provided
for ?such prohibition.? Rather, advertising signs are implicitly permitted in ?High-
density commercial/industrial,? ?Hi gh-density residential/mixed use,? and ?Low-density
commercial/institutional" sign districts where they comply with required ?ndings and
dimensional speci?cations. Use of the term, waiver, is problematic.



Submittal requirements for permit applications (?50-6-80 through 50-6?84) n_ot requiring
a waiver are not preserved??placing all the burden on the application review staff to

ascertain Spacing between advertising signs, Spacing from schools, historic districts,
4

parks/playgrounds, setbacks from right?of?way and residential units.

Prohibition against advertising signs ?wrapping? two or more facades of a building or
structure inaccurately implies that one facade could be wrapped even though
no wall sign can cover the entirety of a facade 4-4-131).

The only sign districts where advertising signs are n_ot permitted are ?low-density
residential? and ?recreation/open space? thus newly permitting billboards
in Master Plan-designated Institutional areas and advertising wall signs in Master Plan-
designated medium and high density residential areas, which are often zoned residential
or non?residential zoning classi?cations where advertising signs are currently prohibited.

Policy formally adopted by the CPC on March 15, 2007 relative to signs for casino
complexes on land zoned SD5 were recommended by the CPC for inclusion as part of the
Sign Ordinance in its vote of June 18, 2015 on the insistence of the Law Department;
these unique provisions are not re?ected in the ordinance.

Waivers and adjustments are permitted for ?dimensional or operational? standards 
20); no clear statement is provided as to waivers/adjustments for the actual permissibility
of a given sign type in a given sign district.

Appeals of conditional approvals and denials are afforded to the petitioner 
but no appeal of an aggproved waiver or adjustment is afforded to a party
objecting to a petition, such as a neighbor or community organization.

is required to maintain a ?transcript or other written or audio recording of the
public hearing? involving waivers/adjustments unclear whether the
transcript/written recording must be verbatim.

is required to provide advisement (notice) of a hearing to owners and occupants
within 300 feet of a premises involving a waiver/adjustment however,
?4-4-20(p) provides that failure/refusal by to issue advisement or collect/admit
comment does not constitute deprivation of a nearby individual?s right. This provision
appears to render advisement of the public hearings as a ?courtesy notice? and to
immunize against procedural due process claims for appeal.

Appeals of administrative decisions may only be made by the entity that is subject to the
decision it appears that parties aggrieved by the administrative decision have
no right of appeal.

The de?nition of ?building frontage? is more confusing than the current
de?nition because of the phrase, . .as perpendicularly 

CPC staff had recommended limiting the placement of advertising signs to streets
designated by the Master Plan as ?major thoroughfare? or ?secondary thoroughfare? or in

5

?freeway adjacent areas,? the omission of that restriction permits advertising signs to be
displayed on side streets.

It is unclear why ?portable signs? should be allowed to be illuminated and/or dynamic in
select sign districts, including in the right?of-way 

Currently, signs in residential districts schools, churches) are limited to 32 sq. ft.
(?50-6-112) and signs for home occupations are prohibited in R1 and R2 districts and
limited to 144 sq. inches in other residential districts the proposed
ordinance would allow a wall sign to cover 10% of a facade in a low-density residential
sign district A house facade measuring 45? 20? 900 sq. ft.; a wall sign
equaling 10%, or 90 sq. ft. would be permitted by the proposed ordinance?signi?cantly
more than what is currently allowed. However, the ?maximum aggregate business sign
area? permitted in low-density residential sign districts is speci?ed as six sq. ft. in 
Unclear which of the two standards takes precedence?

Directional signs count against the ?maximum aggregate business sign area? and are
accorded only a minimal increase over business signs yet certain
businesses, such as parking structures have a disproportionate need for directional

signage.

Business signs on multiple-story buildings may be 40 feet high except in
low-density residential sign districts; however, ?mechanical signs? are limited to 10 feet
?monument signs? are limited to 15 feet ?pole signs? are
limited to 15 feet or 25 feet depending on street width ?portable signs? are
limited to 4 or 5 feet Unclear whether the 40 foot limit is meant to apply
only to wall signs or to any business sign on the premises.

The conversion of an existing and conforming s_tgti_o advertising sign to a dmamic sign is
not straightforwardly addressed; the permit requirements of ?4-4-102 require ?waiver of
such prohibition? but no prohibition is referenced and no public hearing is clearly
mandated.

The allowance of 60 advertising signs in the CBD ensures no clear public bene?t except
for the ?Mitigation of harmful visual aesthetics? provisions (?4-4-132) which are only
triggered by a (one-time) negative finding by the director of rather than by a
legislative presumption of harmful visual effect. The director has authority only
to request payment of a specified and proportionate monetary contribution by the
applicant to a fund for public art purposes. The ordinance is silent on the City?s recourse
where the applicant declines to make a monetary contribution. [Note: Pg 121, Lines 5-6
incorrectly reference ?wall signs? twice]

Given the stated purpose of protecting public safety/traffic safety the
rationale is unclear for permitting advertising signs in the right-of-way 

placing vehicles even clOser to distraction.

The rationale is unclear for the inconsistency between the 250-foot Spacing provision
between advertising signs in the right-of?way and the general 1,000 foot
spacing provision between advertising signs on private property.

The enforcing authority for misdemeanor violations of the ?Development Noti?cation
Signs? provisions is not identi?ed 

ATTACHMENT B: Ch. 4 Sign 0rd.?Master Plan Subsectors (54 of 54)

CPC staff analysis of Master Plan maps reveals many speci?c locations where advertising signs
outside of the Central Business District have heretofore been deemed inappropriate but would

now be permitted by the proposed ordinance as pole signs (billboards) and/or wall signs, subject
to applicable dimensional standards.

The Low-Density Commercial/Institutional sign district would allow both pole signs, such as
billboards, and wall signs; the High-Density Residential Mixed?Use sign district would allow

advertising wall signs on nonresidential buildings.

The intended or unintended consequences of permitting advertising signs outside of the Central
Business District where they are currently prohibited can largely be addressed by amending Sec
4-4-103(9) to add ?Low-Density Sign District? and ?High-Density
residential Mixed-Use Sign District? to the list of sign districts where advertising signs are not
permitted and by adding a subsection (10) to Sec. 4-4-103 to specify that advertising signs are
not permitted on streets other than those designated as ?major thoroughfare? or ?secondary
thoroughfare? by the Master Plan or that are in a freeway adjacent area. (Such a change would

be consistent with the CPC communications to the Law Department of 5/25/2019 and

6/12/2019.)

HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: Proposed Text Amendment to Chapter 50 of the 2019 Detroit City Code, Zoning
Traditional Main Street Overlay Ordinance (RECOMMEND APPROVAL)

On Thursday, September 19, 2019, the City Flaming Commission (CPC) voted to recommend
approval of the attached Zoning Ordinance text amendment to Your Honorable Body relative to the
Traditional Main Street Overlay (TMSO) Area, among other provisions.

Background

In 2005 with the recent adoption of the major rewrite of Chapter 61, the Detroit Zoning Ordinance,
the Planning and Development Department submitted a series of design-related provisions
that would apply to a number of pedestrian retail oriented business strips where there was the desire
for more sensitive design. These business strips were identi?ed in the First General Text
Amendment to the Zoning Ordinance as ?Traditional Main Street Overlay (TMSO) Areas? 0rd. No.
20?05). Subsequent to 2005, the TMSO provisions were adjusted in 2013 (0rd. No. 23?13).

Currently, there are nine TMSO areas:

(1) West Seven Mile. All zoning lots abutting West Seven Mile Road between the zoning
lots at the four (4) corners of John Avenue and the center line of Woodward Avenue.

(2) Grand River. All zoning lots abutting Grand River Avenue between the center line of
Woodmont Avenue and the zoning lots at the four (4) corners of Evergreen Road.

(3) Bngirnv?l?ernor. All zoning lots abutting Bagley Avenue between the center line of 16?11
Street and the center line of 24?" Street; and all zoning lots abutting West Vemor
Highway between the center line of Newark Avenue and the center line of Clark Street.

(4) Livernois/West McNichols. All zoning lots abutting Livernois Avenue between the
center line of the John C. Lodge Freeway and the center line of West Eight Mile Road; 
and all zoning lots abutting West McNichols Road between the center line of Lawton
Avenue and the zoning lots at the four (4) corners of Wyoming Avenue.

(5) EastJe?i'rmn. All zoning lots abutting East Jefferson Avenue between the center lines
of Dickerson Avenue/Gray Avenue and the city limits ol"Grosse Pointe Park. 

(6) All zoning lots abutting Woodward Avenue between the center line of
Temple Avenuer?All?rcd Street and the city limits of Highland Park.

(7) Grand Boulei'ni?fml zoning lots abutting West Grand Boulevard/East Grand

Boulevard-thaw"

the John C. Lodge freeway and the eastern edge of

Cameron StreEf'textended}.

(8) Michigan Avenue. All zoning lots abutting Michigan Avenue between the John C.
Lodge freeway 0) and the zoning lots at the four (4) comers of Vinewood Avenue.

(9) Vemor/Springwells. All zoning lots abutting West Vemor Highway between the center
line of Clark Street and the zoning lots at the four (4) comers of Woodmere Avenue;
and all zoning lots abutting Springwells Avenue between the four (4) corners of West
Vemor Highway and the four (4) corners of the Fisher Freeway (1-75) service drives.

Zoning lots abutting these nine TMSO street segments are subject to additional design standards
intended to improve the curb appearance of the business strip and to enhance a pedestrian-friendly
environment. Those standards relate to a variety of factors:

0



0

Building site relationship; placement and orientation.

Site design standards: Fencing.

Building design: Style.
Building design standards:

Massing, scale, and form.

Facade and architectural details.

As part of the Administration?s efforts to support and encourage development along neighborhood
commercial corridors, the Planning and Development Department is suggesting a series of updates
and revisions to the TMSO provisions.

Scope of the proposed Ordinance?

The proposed ordinance would alter provisions related to three overlay areas, not just the TMSO:

RE: First Amendment to Development Agreement
Frederick Douglass Development Project - Douglass Acquisition Company LLC

Honorable City Council:

In July 2018, the Detroit Housing Commission entered into a purchase agreement for
sale of the former Frederick Douglass public housing site (?Douglass Site?) to the Douglass
Acquisition Company LLC for The Douglass Site, comprised of roughly 22 acres
of vacant land near the southern end of Brush Park in the City of Detroit, has not had residents
living at the site since 2008. DAC intends to develop the entire Douglass Site into several mixed-
income residential projects providing over 800 units, along with construction of various other
commercial, retail and public space components. Total development costs are expected to exceed


Furthermore, in 2017, the Housing and Revitalization Department entered into an
Affordable Housing Agreement Agreement?) with Bedrock Management Services LLC
(?Bedrock?), of which DAC is an af?liate, to provide for the construction of affordable housing
units in the event the City supports Bedrock residential development with a ?nancial incentive.
HRD recognizes that the Douglass Site will require signi?cant public road and utility
infrastructure, pro-development, housing construction, site prep work, environmental work and
park construction (?Improvements?) to become a viable project in the City. Additionally, HRD
believes that the proposed development at the Douglass Site poses an opportunity to create new
affordable residential units in the City of Detroit.

In support of the Improvements and creation of new affordable units at the Douglass Site, the City
entered into that certain development agreement with DAC that was approved by Detroit City
Council on July 31, 2018 (the ?Development Agreement?). The Development Agreement
committed to make in certain funding available to DAC, provided that they meet certain
underwriting criteria. Pursuant to the Development Agreement, HRD agreed to make Federal
HOME and CDBG funds available to DAC, along with from DWSD, to
support construction of the Improvements and a commitment that 156 units or 25% of the
total rental units at the Douglass Site be affordable units for a period of 30 years under the terms
of the AH Agreement.

Development at the Douglass Site has been delayed due to unexpected environmental and site due
diligence activities that exceeded the initial project schedule. At this time, DAC contemplates

    
 

closing on acquisition of the Douglass Site by the end of 2019 and has asked the City to amend
the Development Agreement to: (1) re?ect updates and changes to the project schedule and the
new purchase agreement between DHC and DAC, (2) provide a $262,000 increase to the CDBG
commitment and (3) clarify certain terms as they relate to the funding provided under the
DeveIOpment Agreement and the AH Agreement.

For the reasons stated above, we respectfully request your adaption of the attached resolution that:
1) approves a First Amendment to Development Agreement and 2) approves an increase of the
CDBG funding allocation towards completion of the Improvements.

RE: Northlawn Limited Dividend Housing Association LLC- Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT)

Larc Properties, Inc. has formed Northlawn Limited Dividend Housing Association LLC in order to
develop the Project known as Northlawn Garden Apartments. The Project is an existing ninety-six
(96) unit affordable housing complex located in twelve (12) two-story residential buildings in an
area bounded by Plymouth Road on the north, Oakman Boulevard on the east, West Chicago on
the south and Ohio Avenue on the west. The rehabilitation Project will include ninety-six (96) 1
bedroom/1 bath apartments and exterior/landscape improvements.

A tax-exempt bond construction loan in the amount of$5,369,886, a tax-exempt bond permanent
mortgage loan in the amount of $3,108,101 and a HOME loan in the amount of $1,347,120 will be
provided by the Michigan State Housing Development Authority. The City of Detroit is providing
new gap funding of HOME in the amount of $791,577 and will allow the assumption of an existing
HOME loan in the amount of $2,000,000. Affordable Housing Partners, Inc. will make Capital
Contributions of $2,699,955 which includes the purchase of Low Income Housing Tax Credits. The
Sponsor has agreed to defer $75,427 of the developer fee.

The existing Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) Contract covering ninety-four (94) units
provided by the US. Department of Housing and Development (HUD) will be assumed and
renewed. A HUD Operating Cost Adjustment Factors rental increase is scheduled to go into effect
January 1, 2020. The ninety-fifth unit will be rented to tenants whose incomes do not exceed
sixty percent of area median income. The ninety-sixth unit will be used as a
management office/manager?s unit. All ninety-six (96) units will be subject to the PILOT based on
Section 15a of the State Housing Development Authority Act of 1966, as amended.

In order to make this development economically feasible, it is necessary for it to receive the
benefits of tax exemption under Section 15a of the State Housing Development Authority Act of
1966 (PA 346 as amended, MCL 125.1415A). Adoption of the resolution by your Honorable Body
will therefore satisfy the requirements of Public Act 346 and City Ordinance 9?90, as amended, by
establishing a service charge of four percent of the annual net shelter rent obtained from this
housing project.

At this time, the city has completed the process of properly splitting and combining its respective

RE: Amended and Restated Land Transfer Agreement Property Sale by Development
Agreement - Queen Lillian II Redevelopment Project

Honorable City Council:

On November 21, 2017, your Honorable Body adopted a resolution approving the transfer of
certain real property at 3439-3455 Woodward Avenue and 13 Stimson, Detroit, MI (the
?Properties?) to the Detroit Brown?eld Redevelopment Authority for One Million
Three Hundred Nine Thousand and 00/100 Dollars (the ?Purchase Price?) in
accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of a Land Transfer Agreement with the
DBRA (the 

The LTA authorized the DBRA to transfer the Properties to Queen Lillian II, LLC (the
?Developer?) for the Purchase Price subject to a development agreement. The Developer?s
anticipated development of the Properties included a 5-story building with approximately 25,000
square feet of ?rst ?oor commercial, 112 residential units, and a 3-story parking garage (the
?Project?). The Project also contemplated Developer?s use of certain ?nancing programs through
the US. Department of Housing and Urban Development and, accordingly, the
resolution provided that the actions contemplated therein were conditioned upon approval
of a request for release of ?mds and related to environmental review certi?cation for the Project
in accordance with 24 CFR 58.22 (the ?Council Condition?).

Due to ?nancing complications, increased construction costs and unexpected redesigns related to
the Project, Developer has revised its anticipated development of the Properties to increase the
residential components from 112 residential units to 201 residential units, and to replace the
intended 3-story parking garage with a surface parking lot intended to service the Project and has
determined that it will not be seeking ?nancing through HUD.

The DBRA and Developer propose to amend and restate the LTA to re?ect modi?cations to the
Project and reduce the Purchase Price to Three Hundred Thousand and 00/ 100 Dollars
(the ?Revised Purchase Price?) to enhance the Developer?s ability to ?nance the
Project. The City has reviewed the circumstances and ?nancial information surrounding the
Developer?s proposed Project and ?nd such amendments to the LTA to be necessary to move the
Project to a closing. Further, in light of the fact that Developer will not be seeking ?nancing
through HUD, the City has determined that the Council Condition is no longer appropriate.

We, therefore, request that your Honorable Body adopt the attached resolution that authorizes the
City to amend and restate the LTA with the DBRA to re?ect the foregoing and removes the
Council Condition.

Respectfully submitted,

Katharine G. Trudeau
Deputy Director
Planning Development Department

Re: Request for Property Transfers to the City of Detroit Brown?eld
Redevelopment Authority in Connection with the Land Assembly Project.

Dear Honorable City Council:

At the request of the City of Detroit, the City of Detroit Brown?eld Redevelopment Authority
has been engaged in land assembly activities aimed at establishing market-ready
industrial sites within City limits in order to attract manufacturing and logistics companies (the
?Land Assembly Project?). DBRA has identi?ed the site located at 9501 Conner Street, Detroit,
MI and formerly known as the Cadillac Stamping Plant, as more particularly described on Exhibit
A hereto (the ropem?), as a key site for industrial development. Acquired by the City in
October 2018 as a tax foreclosed property, the l8-acre Property was previously used or various
industrial uses, including as a stamping plant for General Motors.

 

DBRA has executed a letter of intent with NorthPoint Development, LLC (?Developer?)
to purchase and redevelop the Property, including the demolition of the existing structures, any
