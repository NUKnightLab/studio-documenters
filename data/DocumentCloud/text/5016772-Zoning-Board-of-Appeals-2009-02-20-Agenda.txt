Premises affected - 3545-47 W. Cortland Street
Subject Appeal from the decision of the Office of the Zoning Administrator in refusing to allow the
appellant to de-convert a front building from 14 dwelling unit to 12 dwelling unit in an RS-3
Residential Single-Unit (Detached House) District. There is a rear building with 3 dwelling
units. Appellant claims a total of 15 dwelling units. This matter was at the Board in 1964 (9164-A) and the only permit issued shows 12 and 3 dwelling units. The 2 additional front units deconversion require Board action because the Department of Zoning will not recognize a permit
which does not match the Board's prior resolution.
