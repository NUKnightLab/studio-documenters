SOLICITATION SUMMARY
N/A
GENERAL BACKGROUND
In furtherance of Plan Forward: Communities that Work, the CHA entered into a Land Transfer
Intergovernmental Agreement (“IGA”) with the City of Chicago and Chicago Park District in 2014.
This IGA provides that the City will convey and CHA will acquire the Near North High School and
adjacent field (collectively referred to as “the NNHS Property”) at 1450 -1500 North Larrabee Street
in exchange for CHA conveying to the City a portion of CHA-owned land that was formerly part of
the Harold Ickes Homes development site. The City will, thereafter, convey such property to the
Board of Education of the City of Chicago for the construction of a new artificial turf field and running
track for Jones College Prep High School.

 The City conveyed the NNHS Property to CHA on August 17, 2015. The NNHS Property is needed by
CHA for mixed-income residential development, retail/commercial development and green space.
It is a part of the revitalization of the former Cabrini-Green development community and is included
in the Cabrini Consent Decree. The redevelopment of the land is being planned through the Near
North Working Group and is anticipated to commence in 2018.
Currently, the NNHS building sits on a portion of the acquisition site and is being used by the Chicago
Police Department (“CPD”) and the Chicago Fire Department (“CFD”) for training purposes. The CPD
and the CFD desires to continue to utilize the building until such time as CHA commences
redevelopment activities. The CHA and City have negotiated a lease with an initial term of two (2)
years with an option to extend the term for another one (1) year period. The CHA received HUD
approval to enter into the Lease Agreement with the City in June 2015.
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) regulations.
The Deputy Chief Development Officer concurs with the recommendation to: 1) enter into a Lease
Agreement between the CHA and the City for use of the Near North High School building at 1450
North Larrabee Street; and 2) execute and deliver such other documents and perform such actions
as may be necessary to implement the foregoing.
The Acting CEO/President recommends: 1) entering into a Lease Agreement between the CHA and
the City for use of the Near North High School building at 1450 North Larrabee Street; and 2)
executing and delivering such other documents and performing such actions as may be necessary
to implement the foregoing.
