To Whom It May Concern,

Elliott?s Amusements has been a leader in protecting our environment. We were
the first carnival in the United States to use Soy Biodiesel in our generators. We
found it to be a clean alternative and still use it today when available and
affordable.

In the last 3 years we have been gradually converting our many ride light
packages to LED lighting. Making this costly change results in much LESS
wattage being used. As we continue to make the changeover, we anticipate
being able to eliminate one of 2 generators during operation.

This year we are making another big change. We have started working with a
new platform that allows us to document our ride inspections, break scheduling,
and many other daily and weekly chores digitally by using our phones. This will
eliminate many pages of printed and written papenrvork.

Thank you for you interest is our stewardship.

Regard,

Deb Elliott

will offer a tiered Green Food Truck Certification for compliant food trucks, and we are working to have
all food trucks certified by the end of the 2019 season. We complement our food truck operations at
Cadillac Square and Beacon Park with recycling receptacles on-site during food truck hours.

We will also be expanding our onsite recycling program at our DDP-managed parks with permanent and
temporary receptacles that make recycling easier for the public. Beacon Park has permanent recycling
cans. This year, our parks rentals and special events will have recycling receptacles on site. We take our
recycling to Recycle Here!, a Detroit-owned local business.

The City of Detroit seeks to develop a Citywide Transportation Plan [the Plan) that
provides the roadmap for not only how Detroiters get around, but how city streets
can continue to support the City?s advancement. This effort will be led by the
Department of Public Works. with support from the Planning and Development
Department. the Department of the Municipal Parking Department.
and the Mayor's Of?ce. The process will be done in collaboration with state. county
and regional partners. The end deliverable of this process must serve as a living
guide toward future infrastructure investment and transportation development
that: 1) has overarching principles of equity, dignity, and transparency. 2] addresses
cri?cal safety issues' 3) improves people's health and nelghborhood air quality. 4]
increases the number of realistic mobility options, and 5] strengthens the
neighborhoods and advances economic opportunity through capital investments.

The Transportation Plan will implement key strategies identi?ed in the recently
published Strategic Transportation Plan and work from the framework created in
the Downtown Transportation Study: collect and analyze new and existing data to
inform and develop transportation policy and programs; and engage the public in
the planning of Detroit's Transportation initiatives. Consultants are being asked to
present the City with a scope of work that achieves the following:

Key initiatives include:

0 Improve Safety Detroit's annual vehicle crashes totaled 22,833 in
2015, an average ofone crash for every 30 residents. The Plan will
guide Investment and development priorities to achieve safer
infrastructure.

- Build safety analysis and toolkit for integration into routine
transportation capital projects. i.e. Resurfacing Program

I Identify and develop a metrics driven approach to prioritize
safety improvements for each type of travel mode, including
walk. bike, vehicular, and transit.

Develop protocols to prioritize traf?c calming initiatives and
an implementation process for various types of roadway
classi?cations within the City of Detroit. Including non-City
owned roadways in coordination with regional multi-modal
plans and networks.

0 Support Walking. Biking and Transit Everyone deserves the right

feel equally respected on Detroit streets no matter what form of
transportation they are using (walking riding, driving. transit 

The challenge of mobility in Detroit goes beyond traf?c congestion.
Many negative societal outcomes are due the lack of ability to get to a
destination. The plan will identify ways to make it easier and more
affordable for Detroiters to get around, from improvements to
traditional ?xed route transit to integrating new solutions, such as
mobility hubs and microtransit.

Develop a series of policies. programs and potential funding
streams for creating safer streets for pedestrians, encouraging
walking. and creating places for people on Detroit's streets and

0 Design Streets for Everyone Heart disease is the leading cause of
death for Detroit residents. Detroit's right of ways represent more
than 65 percent of the publicly held open space in the city. The Plan
will introduce more opportunities to walk and bike citywide,
increasing healthy choices for active commutes (complete streets)
and access to recreational activity. ltwill also improve neighborhood
air quality [speci?cally in freight movement, with Detroit being one of
the busiest trade crossings) and reduce our carbon footprint

Approximately 40 percent of Detroit's residents live below the
poverty line and 26 percent of Detroiters lack access to a personally-
owned vehicle. The Plan will set targets to establish a policy of
greater access to economic opportunity by increasing travel options
and coordinating modes, empowering all residents with a viable
mobility system to increase better access to jobs, core services and
amenities.

I Develop and implement a complete streets policy for adoption
within the City of Detroit.

- Develop guidelines for when a roadway should consider
various complete streets elements and implementation
methods.

- Establish streetscape design guidelines. including landscape
and roadway/non-roadway design guidelines by

within the City of Detroit.

. Establish policies and design standards for incorporating
stormwater best management practices into streets.

0 Education infrastructure and policy changes will only take a plan so
far. Detroit seeks to educate enforcement agent and of?cers. residents
and visitors to fully understand that designing streets and systems to
include all modes is a public asset and not an attack on one speci?c
mode (Le. vehicular).

Develop an education and marketing strategy for the City
based on best practices in other cities and Detroit's unique
needs and establish a detailed roll out plan. cost estimates and
potential funding sources and partners.

- Develop policies, programs. and outreach strategies for a
Safety Ambassador Program.

Create an aggressive program to educate motorists on safe
driving around pedestrians. cyclists and transit stops. And
educate cyclists and pedestrians on how to properly use
infrastructure.

- Address the general cultural bias toward ?cars only" while
educating the public about other viable options.

0 Policy Development Detroiters expect openness and inclusiveness in
planning and implementation process. and the community
engagement process. The Plan will explain the recommendations that
will be proposed and give benchmarks for tracking progress and
implementation.

Develop curbside policies for emerging micromobility
providers, delivery trucks, valet, residential parking permit,
on-street parking, new signage, etc.

Sawyer Playground was a part of Jada's entire life. My mother live one block over from the playground
on Ardmore. I use to scroll Jada to Sawyer Playground when she was a baby. When Jada got older
enough to go to the park without me she went to the park with her friends and family. Jada use to spend
her summer vacation at her Big Mam house. When Jada became a teenager she use to take the children
from the local daycare on outing to the playground, she read to them, and played games with them.

in the summerJada use to give out lemonade also she gave out water to anyone that was playing at the
park. In the winter Jada use to give out hot chocolate. On Wednesday's during the summer Jada gave
out lunches to the neighborhood children using her weekly allowance. On the weekend Jada goes up to
the playground and clean up after families had their parties because she never wanted any of the
children that played in the park to get hurt. On Sunday momlng before church Jada use to run track and
shoot hoops at the park with her big/little favorite cousin. Jada was always a leader she lead the clean-
up crew to clean the vacant lots In the neighborhood.

She always cared and help the elder people in the neighborhood. she shovel their snow In winter, raked
their leaves in the fall. Jada use to feed the homeless, Jada will go to the corner store and buy food and
feed them when she saw them standing outside the store asking food money. One homeless man was
her favorite his name Is ?Joe? she made sure Joe had food and clean shirts. Jada was a strong
community advocate her willing to help other was amazing. Jada?s passing devastated that
neighborhood and the community. Jada was murdered in front of her Ma on Aron-lore. To this clay
no one can't believe she's gone. I know Jada was only 15 years old and wasn't known threw the city but
she was loved and smart, giving and had a beautiful heart.

lie-Naming Sawyer Playground to Jada Rankin Playground will be such an honor and her name and
legacy will live on. it will impact the neighborhood in a positive way Sawyer can become a Playground
where other families can come and get peace and serenity. host my" itide4lustice against Gun

November 16, 2018
RE: Renaming of Sawyer Playground
Dear Mrs. Jan Anderson,

My name is Johnny Yousif. I am the president of ?550 Wrecking Co. We are a Certi?ed Detroit
Headquartered Business and a Certi?ed Detroit Small Business. We have been at this location
since 2011. We are responsible for cleaning the overgrowth and dead trees on the west side of
the park. Everyone in the neighborhood has thanked us for cleaning up not only the park, but
also our yard when we bought it from the City of Detroit. Our ya rd is next door to Sawyer
Playground.

The reason for my letter is to show support of renaming Sawyer Playground to Jada Rankin
Playground. Jada?s Life was tragically taken in an unfortunate order of events. After asking a
Speeding car to slow down on Ardmore St., the car returned and shot and killed Jada. Jadas
Grandmother used to take her to the park to enjoy the playground during the summers. I have
known Tiawanna, Jada?s Mother, for quite some time and earlier this summer she had
mentioned to mher idea of renaming the playground. I feel that if it honors an innocent victim
of a senseless crime, and it helps to preserveher memory, then naming the playground in her
honor should be done. As a direct neighbor of the playground and someone who took pride in
cleaning it up, I am asking you to approve the petition of the name change.

RE: RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF THE MEDICARE FOR ALL ACT OF 2019

Council member Raquel Castaneda-Lopez requested that the Legislative Policy Division (LPD)

draft a resolution in support of the Medicare for All Act of 2019.
Attached, please ?nd our draft of the aforementioned resolution.

Please contact us if we can be of any further assistance.

RESOLUTION MEMBER RAQUEL 

RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF THE MEDICARE FOR ALL ACT OF 2019

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

RESOLVED,

RESOLVED,

The mission of the Detroit City Council is to promote the economic, cultural and physical
welfare of Detroit?s citizens through Charter-mandated legislative functions; and

United States health spending is projected to rise 5.3 percent in 2018, re?ecting the rising
prices of medical goods and services and higher Medicaid costs. According to the US.
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), in 2017, those same costs rose 4.6
percent to nearly $3.5 trillion; and

Despite spending over 18 percent of the nation?s gross domestic product on healthcare,
weather the fact that over the past three decades, the world has seen a steady decline in the
number of women dying from childbirth, the United States is a noticeable outlier.
According to the Washington Post, here in the US, the maternal mortality rate has been
rising, putting the United States in the unenviable company of Afghanistan, Lesotho and
Swaziland as countries with rising rates; and

In addition, while life expectancy around the world are trending upward, in 2018, US. life
expectancy rates have dropped for the third year in a row. The three-year drop represents
the longest sustained decline in actuarial lifespan in the US. since the turbulent period of
1915 to 1918, when the decrease could be at least partially attributed to World War I and
the devastating 1918 in?uenza pandemic; and

Although the Affordable Health Care Act (ACA) has resulted in dramatic increases in
health insurance coverage since its passage in 2010, too many Americans are one medical
crisis away from bankruptcy, or they are forced to pay for either rent and food, or for life
saving medical treatments and medicines; and

The Medicare For All Act of 2019, if passed, would create a single ?payer universal
Medicare program that would cover all Americans, including the 28 million Americans
that are currently uninsured. The features of the bill include provisions that would,
eliminate copays, premiums and deductibles; ensure that every single resident of the US.
has access to comprehensive quality healthcare, including primary care, hospital and
outpatient services and women?s reproductive services; long term services and supports;
mental health and substance abuse treatments; laboratory and diagnostic services and
ambulatory services; and to ensure that patients can choose their own doctors and hospitals;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT

The Detroit City Council, as an advocate of the ef?cient use of tax payer dollars, expresses
its strong support of Medicare For All Act of 2019 and urges the Federal Government to
pass this posthaste; THEREFORE BE IT FINALLY

That copies of this resolution be forwarded to the Detroit Delegation in Washington and to
President Trump.

RESOLUTION SUPPORTING ADDITIONAL $10 MILLION
IN COMMUNITY BENEFITS FOR DELRAY FROM
GORDIE HOWE INTERNATIONAL BRIDGE (GHIB) PROJECT

By Council Member Castaneda?Lopez

WHEREAS, Detroit City COuncil has previously resolved1 that residents of the Delray
neighborhood in Detroit should receive adequate community bene?ts from the Windsor-Detroit
Bridge Authority that manages the Gordie Howe International Bridge (GHIB) project, to
compensate residents for the disproportionate and adverse impacts on their lives and community
from hosting this major transportation infrastructure construction project; and

WHEREAS, At this time the prolonged planning process for the GHIB project appears to be
nearing its end, and transitionng into the actual construction phase which should include speci?ed

community bene?ts for Delray; and

WHEREAS, Detroit City Council strongly supports the requests of the Delray Community Action
Group (CAG) for an additional $10 million in public health enhancing community bene?ts, in the

following forms:

a Home repair programs: $2.5 million for critical home repairs such as roofs,
furnaces, insulation, doors and windows for 150 homes, at an estimated cost of
approximately $15,000 each in Delray and the immediate GHIB impact area, for
residents committed to staying and not participating in the Home Swap opportunity;

I Quality of life programs: $3 million for implementing some priority community
objectives, such as expanding the existing Home Mitigation program for windows, air
?ltration and insulation to 100 homes at a cost of approximately $25,000 each in Delray
and additional homes within 500 feet of the GHIB construction footprint that are not
participating in the Home Swap program;

a Youth and senior programs: $1.85 million for:

0 Support Peoples Community Services youth after school and summer
programs at a cost of $30,000 per year for a 5-year period, $150,000 total.
Support after school and summer youth programs at the one remaining
agency serving children in Delray; PCS operates the City?s Delray Park
facility, and should receive program funding to provide partial support for
their critical programs;

0 Support Clark Park youth recreation programs and synergy with Delray
Park at a cost of $150,000, contributing to the cost of a Splash-Pad, for

example;

 

1 See, e. attached resolution from Fall of 2016)

LPD DRAFT 03 22 19

0 Provide critical infrastructure in the form of roof repair for the impact area
youth agency, at a cost of $50,000

0 Support the Family Asthma Education Life Maintenance Program run by
CHASS and other active partners with a total of $1,500,000 paid out over 3
years, at $500,000 per year; and

- Air quality programs: $2.5 million for a program to upgrade 16 schools and 8
Head Start facilities for early education in South West Detroit with air ?ltration
equipment and window replacement, improving health for over 8,000 students and
hundreds of families; and

9 Local agency transit vehicles: $150,000 to gain access for vulnerable youth and
seniors in the impact area to access health, recreation and skills-building resources;
and

WHEREAS, In addition to the above, and because GHIB construction crews have removed 4000
mature trees in the area in preparation for construction, the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority
should pay for and implement appropriate studies and construction projects to re- green Delray and
erect barriers and buffers around residential areas to shield them from the most severe and
pervasive impacts of increased traf?c toLand-from the bridge; moreover, because the loss of so
many trees was part of the GHIB construction plan, these remediation measures should be at the
bridge authority?s expense, rather than subtracting scarce funds from the total community bene?ts
package to provide such basic, just and necessary remediation of the conditions caused by the
bridge construction program itself; and

WHEREAS, The GHIB literally represents a once-in?a?lifetime opportunity to give back to the
residents of Delray and surrounding areas of South West Detroit for the major sacri?ces they make
in terms of their 'quality of life in close contact with heavy industry and busy international
transportation routes; and

WHEREAS, Failure to provide adequate community bene?ts to Delray residents would compound
severe environmental and social injustices in their neighborhood, sacri?cing their health and
welfare for the bene?t of international transportation infrastructure that runs directly through their
community; and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT Detroit City Council of?cially and strongly
supports the above community bene?ts for Delray from the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority,
in connection with construction of the Gordie Howe International Bridge (GHIBlproj ect; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT Copies of this resolution shall be provided to the Windsor-

Detroit Bridge Authority, the Governor, the Detroit delegation in the State Legislature, and the
Michigan delegation in Congress.

RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF THE TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF BOND
REQUIREMENTS DURING BIDDING FOR CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

April 1, 2019

The mission of the Detroit City Council is to promote the economic, cultural and
physical welfare of Detroit?s citizens through Charter-mandated legislative
functions; and

Detroit is in the midst of demolishing dangerous and open residential and
commercial properties as well as residential renovations through various programs.
However, some local Detroit small business contractors are unable to bid on many
of the City?s demolition contracts, due to their restrictive performance bond
requirements; and

Current state law under, MCL 129.201 et. seq., requires public construction
contracts over $50,000 to have performance bonds and payment bonds of not less
than 25% of the contract amount; and

The statute outlined the rationale for the State?s requirement of bonding insurance
for contractors. Reasons for the necessity of bonding insurance include the
following factors:

- Mechanics liens cannot be used on public projects.

- Subcontractors and suppliers rely on the general contractor's payment bond
for protection,

a A lack of bond protection is particularly detrimental for traditionally
marginalized and disadvantaged small businesses and emerging sub-
contractors.

Exempting small contractors from bonding hurts their ?nancial stability
and growth.

a The steps taken to qualify for bonding ensure that small contractors are
managing their business well.

- If the bond is waived and the contractor defaults, the taxpayers are on the
hook for ?nding another contractor and paying to complete the work.

a Performance bonds are Vital safeguards for construction projects and the
money invested in them; and

Although it is of the highest priority of the Detroit City Council to remove all
unreasonable barriers that inhibit local Detroit small businesses to bid on City
demolition contracts, our approach must be balanced with the consideration of the
long-lasting and potentially expensive consequences of waiving surety bond
requirements; and

WHEREAS,

In order to allow for more bid Opportunities for Michigan contractors, we
recommend for the addition of a new provision in state law, which would allow for
the suspension of bonding requirements during the contract bidding period for
public construction contracts above $50,000. The aforementioned provision in
state law would also be accompanied by a requirement that all winning bidders be
required to obtain performance bonds and payment bonds of not less than 25% of
the contract amount, prior to the initiation of the contracted work; NOW
THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, That the Detroit City Council urges the Governor and the Michigan Legislature to

April 1, 2019

modify the state of Michigan?s public construction contracts performance bonds
and payment bonds requirements, to allow for the suspension of performance bonds
and payment bonds requirements during the bidding process, which inhibit the
ability of many Michigan businesses to bid on public construction contracts above
$50,000. The provision would also require winning bidders to obtain performance
bonds and payment bonds prior to the commencement of work, thereby assuring
that bonding safeguards are in place.

Re: Legislative Observation initiative

Every day brings new challenges, new possibilities, and new uncertainties for all of us. As
such, 1 am proposing a Legislative Observation Initiative through which Council Members
will have the opportunity to learn and understand all aspects of City Council, including the
Of?ce of the President and associated duties.

The most effective means to prepare and learn is through experience. I propose that every
Council Member, who wishes to take advantage of this opportunity, spend one day observing
and participating in the daily activities of the Council President This would include chairing
a Formal Session and possibly a Committee of the Whole, or a Special Session.

I want to designate one Formal Session, every month, to be chaired by one of my colleagues.
For the Formal Session at which a Council Member is acting as Chair, the President will guide
the member, if, or where needed. The President will be at the Table next to the acting Chair
intervening only if necessary. Although this would be a voluntary activity, I strongly encour-
age each and every one of my colleagues to participate.

RE: RESOLUTION TO SUPPORT THE BLACK MATERNAL HEALTH

WEEK DETROIT CITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE MARY

SHEFFIELD

Council President Pro-Tem Mary Shef?eld requested that the Legislative Policy Division (LPD)
draft a resolution in support of The Black Maternal Health Week April 11th-17th, 2019.

Attached, please ?nd our draft of the aforementioned resolution.

Please contact us if we can be of any further assistance.

BY COUNCIL PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE MARY SHEFFIELD
RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF THE BLACK MATERNAL HEALTH WEEK

WHEREAS, in April of 2018, the Black Mamas Matter Alliance (BMMA) launched its first annual Black
Maternal Health Week with the support of US. House of Representative Alma S. Adams (D) and Senator
Kamala Harris (D), which takes place during National Minority Health Month. This April 11"1-17th will be
the second year BMMA has sponsored a week of activism and awareness regarding the health and
reproductive rights of black mothers; and

WHEREAS, According to BM website, their ultimate goal is to create ?a world where black mothers
have the rights, respect, and resources to thrive before, during, and after pregnancy.? This is a
discussion that is all too often missing from the national narrative; and

WHEREAS, Statistically speaking, the maternal health disparity between black mothers and women of
other races are staggering. Due to limited resources and/or racial biases, limited access to adequate
maternal care has resulted in the disproportionate death rate of black mothers, ultimately, causing the
United States to have the highest maternal mortality rate among affluent countries. Black women are
three times more likely to die during child birth, two times as likely to suffer life-threatening pregnancy
complications, and are 49% more likely than white women to deliver prematurely; regardless of socio-
economic status; and

WHEREAS, The Black Maternal Health Week want to promote steps designed to remedy these concerns
by:

0 Exploring, introducing and advancing policy to increase access to maternal care facilities for
black mothers, in order to improve maternal health outcomes.

I Research and inform the public about policy agendas and innovative strategies that allows black
women to actively participate in policy decisions that impact their lives.

- Redirect and reframe the conversation on black maternal health and amplify the voices and
concerns of black mothers.

- Shifting the cultural mind-set that leads to inadequate maternal care.

- Advocacy for fair distribution of resources, access to high quality care, respectful care and
preventing discrimination for black mothers who are most vulnerable.

- Partnering with healthcare-related organizations to strengthen the movement; and

WHEREAS, Detroit City Council is dedicated to instituting programs, services and activities that
addresses the needs of our community. Consequently, City Council understands the importance of
raising awareness and addressing the racial disparities of maternal health outcomes of black women.
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT

RESOLVED, Detroit City council recognizes and celebrates the Black Mamas Maternal Alliance?s Black
Maternal Health Week from April 11-17, 2019.
