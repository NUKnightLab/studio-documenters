JEFFREY R. TOBOLSKI, COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
ADDRESSING THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF IMMIGRANT CHILD AND
FAMILY DETENTION AND CALLING ON THE U.S. CONGRESS AND THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO RESCIND THE “ZERO TOLERANCE” POLICY
WHEREAS, Cook County is a “Fair and Equal County for Immigrants,” as defined in 07-R-240; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has demonstrated leadership and commitment towards upholding the rights of
immigrants by being the first county in the nation to develop and approve a policy of how to respond to
Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers per Ordinance 11-O-73; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has benefitted culturally, socially and economically from the diversity of its
residents, including over one million immigrants from throughout the world; and
WHEREAS, in April 2018, United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum requiring
all federal prosecutors along the Southwest border to adopt a zero tolerance policy for attempted entries as
defined under 8 U.S. Code § 1325; and
WHEREAS, there are migrant parents who have been criminally prosecuted as a result of this zero
tolerance policy and are currently being detained in immigrant detention facilities in Illinois, despite their
children being scattered across the country and thus further complicating the litigation of their asylum cases;
and
WHEREAS, this has vastly expanded the criminalization of adult migrants, some of whom are presenting
asylum claims and are now being criminally prosecuted before federal judges, instead of appearing in civil
immigration proceedings, and has resulted in the separation from their minor children who have been
erroneously labeled as unaccompanied alien children; and
WHEREAS, there has been a spike in separations after the issuance of the zero tolerance policy
memorandum with nearly 3,000 children separated from their parents with an unspecified number of these
children being sheltered in Chicago facilities with no plan to reunify the children with their parents per a
June 21, 2018 Chicago Sun-Times report; and
WHEREAS, on June 20, 2018, the President of the United States signed an Executive Order requiring that
families be detained together indefinitely during criminal or immigration proceedings, with expanded use
and construction of facilities as needed, yet does not rescind the zero tolerance policy and further contributes
to the mass incarceration of people of color in the United States; and

 WHEREAS, the federal government has not clarified a pathway to reunification for families who have
already been separated, whom are experiencing extreme duress, as evidenced by the suicide of a Honduran
father who killed himself in a detention cell after being separated from his child in June 2018; and
WHEREAS, adding to a growing pattern of permanent family separation, the Chicago-based National
Immigrant Justice Center reports that some parents have already been deported to their home countries
without knowledge of their children’s whereabouts; and
WHEREAS, the Office of Refugee Resettlement has historically been charged with reunification of
unaccompanied minors with sponsors, but now, any future sponsors of the separated children, including
parents, would be subject to investigation and discretion by the United States Department of Homeland
Security per a recent April 2018 Memorandum of Agreement between said department and the United
States Department of Health and Human Services which would continue to put the well-being of children
and families at risk; and
WHEREAS, these practices impose long-lasting, trans-generational toxic stress on impacted families with
negative ramifications on public health, according to decades of research on the factors needed for healthy
child development; and
WHEREAS, furthermore, in light of a May 2018 joint report from the American Civil Liberties Union and
the International Human Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School which details evidence of
abuse against immigrant children while in government custody as well as separate reports that Immigration
and Customs Enforcement will start destroying records of abuse against detained immigrants, it can be
argued that detained families are in a perilous state with no accountability; and
WHEREAS, renowned mental health organizations such as the Illinois Childhood Trauma Coalition and
the American Psychological Association have decried the practice of separating families and have
emphasized the harmful effects that trauma caused by detention and deportation can have on children and
families; and
WHEREAS, moreover, mental health providers have reported that they cannot adequately address premigration trauma that causes youth and families to seek asylum when trauma is further compounded by
family separation and family-based detention practices and current actions that place undue stress on
families, including in Cook County, who await reunification with loved ones via asylum; and
WHEREAS, the American Psychological Association’s Society for Community Research and Action
documented that the broader community can suffer negative consequences of immigration enforcement and
deportations by becoming more fearful and mistrustful of public institutions and being less likely to
participate in community activities such as school, church, and social services; and
WHEREAS, the situation has prompted a national outcry for the federal government to address the
malignant effects of detention, with leading immigrant rights organizations demanding United States House
and Senate leaders scale back funding for immigrant detention and enforcement; and
WHEREAS, in the United States, there already exists very limited mechanisms to safeguard parental rights,
let alone for the precarious situation of newly arrived migrant parents who are unduly being referred to
federal custody for criminal prosecution; and

 WHEREAS, elected officials across the country, including Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, have
either participated in various actions or issued statements condemning the practice and calling out the lack
of legal basis in the “zero tolerance policy”; and
WHEREAS, the current actions on behalf the Executive Branch are burdening practitioners in the social
service and legal sectors and are further unnecessarily entangling families into indefinite interaction with
both child welfare and criminal justice systems.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, Cook County calls on the United States Attorney General
Jeff Sessions to rescind the zero tolerance policy enacted in April 2018 which prosecutes families at the
border and instead adhere to core human rights as stated by the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights in order to allow United States Citizenship and Immigration Services
(USCIS) to properly review and process asylum cases to ensure the safety of all children and families within
our borders while ensuring due process to these individuals; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Cook County calls on the United States Department of Health and
Human Services and the United States Department of Homeland Security to retract their Memorandum of
Agreement that allows for the Office for Refugee Resettlement to share data on minors and potential
sponsors with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and keep the work of these agencies separate to
safeguard the basic rights of children and families; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners do hereby demand that the Congress of the United States and the Executive Branch ensure
that separation of families and the detention of families at the Southern border is halted and define a
reunification pathway for impacted families and that it conduct review and reform of current conditions of
detention for immigrant children; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution be presented to the Illinois
Delegation to the United States Congress and to the President of the United States as a sign of our
commitment to this critical issue.
Approved and adopted this 27th of June 2018.

justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in
whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify
finding the property is deemed abandoned; and

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION OPPOSING THE REDUCTION OF AIR AND WATER POLLUTION
STANDARDS IN WISCONSIN FOR THE PROPOSED FOXCONN DEVELOPMENT
WHEREAS, Foxconn Technology Group (“Foxconn”) is a manufacturer of computer, communication and
electronics; and
WHEREAS, Foxconn is constructing a fabrication plant in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin to manufacture
LCD glass panels. Mount Pleasant is in Racine County, Wisconsin; and
WHEREAS, the proposed plant is sited at the headwaters of the Des Plaines River and is located
approximately 50 miles from the border of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, Cook County shares the Des Plaines Watershed Region, and our water and air resources are
all interconnected; and
WHEREAS, the State of Wisconsin has passed legislation that waives environmental regulations for the
Foxconn plant;
WHEREAS, the legislation allows Foxconn to fill 26 acres of wetlands with dredged materials without an
Environmental Impact Study or input from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; and
WHEREAS, the United States Environmental Protection Agency exempted Racine County, Wisconsin
from air quality requirements for ozone, allowing Foxconn to avoid having to install stringent pollution
control equipment; and
WHEREAS, the Foxconn plant will divert approximately 7 million gallons of water from Lake Michigan
a day; and
WHEREAS, the greatest natural resource Cook County has is Lake Michigan and the proposed plant will
adversely affect that resources; and
WHEREAS, there has been no stormwater management plan for the proposed plant, even though the plant
will encompass thousands of acres of farmland; and
WHEREAS, the Des Plaines River has had significant flooding and removing permeable land at the
headwaters of the River will likely increase the downstream flood risk; and

 WHEREAS, without a proper study of all potential environmental impacts of the plant, it is unknown if
there will be adverse effects to the environment and population of Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County call on the
State of Wisconsin and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to require the Foxconn
Development to comply with all applicable environmental regulations in the construction and operation of
its proposed plant at Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County urges the State of
Wisconsin and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to uniformly apply and enforce all
applicable regulations and laws as written without any exemptions, waivers or variances to ensure negative
impacts are not imposed on the residents of downstream Cook County;
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County supports the Illinois
Attorney General, Illinois General Assembly and Illinois agencies in taking whatever actions possible to
protect Cook County and the State of Illinois against the loss of water resources, potential flooding, and
other ecological impacts from this development; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution shall be provided to the Governor of
Wisconsin, the Director of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the Governor of Illinois, the
Illinois Attorney General, the Director of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, the Director of the
United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Director of Region 5 of the United States
Environmental Protection Agency.
