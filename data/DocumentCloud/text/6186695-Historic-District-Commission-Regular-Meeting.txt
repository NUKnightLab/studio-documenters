STAFF REPORT 07-10-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6305
ADDRESS: 1971 CHICAGO BOULEVARD
HISTORIC DISTRICT: BOSTON EDISON
APPLICANT: TRAVIS SEDLACEK, PROPERTY OWNER
STAFF SITE VISIT: 07-02-2019

PREPARED BY: A. PHILLIPS

PROPOSAL
The building located at 1971 Chicago Boulevard is a 2½-story single family residence constructed in 1920. The house
is clad in red brick with ornate wood detail at the roof eaves and dormers. Carved stone detailing exists around the
doors and windows. The majority of the architectural details are painted white. The hipped roof is covered in brown
asphalt shingles and features dormers at all elevations. The symmetrical façade includes an uncovered raised porch. A
concrete driveway is located to the east of the house which provides vehicular access to the garage located at the
southeast corner of the parcel. The rear of the house currently includes three doors into the house (see attached photo).
One set of raised doors exists at the southwest corner and opens onto a small uncovered patio. One door exists at the
ground-level of the rear façade and one raised door exists at the southeast corner. The two raised doors are accessed
by three concrete steps. It appears that the majority of the rear lot is paved with concrete.

With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to erect a new elevated wood
composite deck at the rear of the house per the attached drawings. Including the following scope items:
•
•

Demolish existing brick and concrete patio and steps
Erect new elevated wood composite deck. The proposed deck will be 16’ deep x 29’-2” wide with the floor of the deck
elevated at 2’-8” above grade. The substructure will be constructed with wolmanized yellow pine and finished with a
wood composite decking material in the color of walnut. The railing is to be white PVC and the spindles are proposed

 to be black aluminum. The application includes “20 trapezoid vinyl post lights,” however, it is unclear what that
information indicates.

STAFF OBSERVATIONS
It is staff’s opinion that the existing brick and concrete patio and steps proposed for demolition are not significant
features of its historic character. It is currently unknown how or if the proposed wood deck will tie into the existing
structure of the house. Staff has asked the applicant to provide more detail regarding this issue. Staff has also asked
the applicant for more information regarding the “20 trapezoid vinyl post lights.”
Given the recent discussion held amongst Commissioners at the June 26, 2019 HDC meeting regarding the
appropriateness of the use of vinyl (windows, fences, siding, etc.), staff is concerned about the appropriateness of the
“white PVC” of the handrail.
While on a site visit to the property, staff noticed recently completed concrete work at a portion of the sidewalk in
front of the house as well as a portion of the front walk to the house (see attached photo). This work was completed
without a Certificate of Appropriateness from the HDC.
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. In those examples derived from classical precedents, entrances
and porches, if any, tend to be centered on the front facade. Other examples display more freedom with entrance
and porch placement. Porches and permanently enclosed sun porches are often placed at the side and sometimes
at the rear of the building.
(7) Relationship of materials. The majority of houses are faced with brick, while many are partially or totally
stucco. There are some stone buildings, sometimes combined with stucco; clapboard is rare, and is extremely
rare as the sole material. Roofing includes slate, tile and asphalt shingles. Wood shingle roofs were once
common and have generally been replaced with asphalt. Wood shake does not exist and there is no known
evidence that it was ever used in the district. Stone trim is common. Wood is almost universally used for
window frames and other functional trim and is used in many examples for all trim.
(8) Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that of a low-relief pattern
of mortar joints in brick contrasted with the smooth surface of wood or stone trim. There are a few houses with
rough or rusticated stone surfaces. The use of stucco or concrete, with or without half-timbering, as a contrast to
brick surfaces, is not unusual. Tile, slate, or wood shingle roofs have particular textural values where they exist.
Asphalt shingles generally have little textural interest, even in those types which purport to imitate some other
variety.
(9) Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors (such as red, yellow, brown, buff) predominate in wall surfaces.
Natural stone colors also exist. Where stucco or concrete exists, it usually remains in its natural state, or is
painted in a shade of cream. Roofs are in natural colors (tile and slate colors, natural and stained wood colors),
and asphalt shingles are predominantly within this same dark color range. Paint colors often relate to style. The
buildings derived from classical precedents, particularly those of neo-georgian style, generally have woodwork
painted white, cream, or in the range of those colors including "putty"; doors and shutters are frequently dark
green or black. Colors known to have been in use on similar buildings of this style in the eighteenth or early
twentieth centuries may be considered for appropriateness. Buildings of medieval inspiration (notably neotudor) generally have painted woodwork and window frames of a dark brown or cream color. Half timbering is
almost always stained dark brown. The original colors of any building, as determined by professional analysis,
are always acceptable for a house, and may provide guidance for similar houses.
(10) Relationship of architectural details. Architectural details generally relate to style. Neo-georgian buildings
display classic details, mostly in wood, and sometimes in stone. Porches, shutters, window frames, cornices, and
dormer windows are commonly, although not always, treated. Details on "mediterranean" style or vernacular
buildings including arched windows, door openings, and porches, are often done in stone, brick, tile, and
sometimes in stucco. Buildings of medieval inspiration tend to have details in the form of carved wood or
carved stone ornaments on window frames, door frames, and eaves. In general, the various styles are rich in
architectural details.
(13) Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The typical treatment of individual
properties is a flat or graded front lawn area in grass turf, often subdivided by a straight or curving walk leading

 (14)

(18)

(20)

(21)

(22)

to the front entrance. Materials for such walks are concrete, brick, stone, or combinations of those materials.
Some front yards have rectangular raised earthwork terraces upon which the house stands. These unpaved
terraces have sloping embankments or retaining walls which are made of brick, stone, or both, at the change of
grade. Foundation plantings, often of a deciduous character, characteristic of the period 1900-1930, are present
virtually without exception. Hedges between properties and along front property lines are not uncommon. It is
characteristic for corner lots to have hedges or fencing at side lot lines along the sidewalk. There is a wide
range in the type of fencing. Fencing within the public view was generally designed to complement the style,
design material, and date of the residence. Although the American elm was once the dominant tree, it is
virtually extinct in the district. Replacement trees should be characteristic of the area and period. Plantings of
new trees should be directed to "tree lawns" and medians. If American elm is planted, it should be disease
resistant. Straight side driveways leading from the street to rear garages are the norm, although access to garages
is also off the alley, especially in areas of the district that were developed earlier. On corner lots, garages and
driveways often face the side streets. These driveways are paved in asphalt, concrete, or brick. Side lots are not
uncommon for the larger properties in the district, and a number of these form a part of the original site plan for
the residence. Such side lots are usually landscaped and are often fenced at or near the setback line. The width
of tree lawns varies from block to block. Street pavements are now asphalt. Cut stone curbs still exist in areas of
the district where they have not yet been replaced with concrete, primarily east of the John C. Lodge freeway.
Public sidewalks are concrete. Some tree lawns/berms have been covered with concrete in parts of the district,
which may represent encroachment on city property. The resulting wide sidewalks are not appropriate in the
district. The ample one hundred and twenty-five (125) foot street right-of-ways of west Boston boulevard and
Chicago boulevard are ample, and each have two (2) narrow pavements divided by the large graded grassy
median strips which are planted with evergreens and deciduous trees. The other east-west streets, Longfellow
street and Edison Boulevard, are sixty-six (66) feet wide. The Detroit Lighting Commission's ornamental poles
("o.p.") with cast iron bases (pattern #10 and cast iron panel pattern #16a) and wooden shafts are placed at
regular intervals primarily on the medians on boston boulevard and Chicago boulevard, and on the tree lawns on
other east-west streets. Lighting on the north-south side streets consists of steel poles, some of which are fluted,
with either ornate pendants or simple cranes. There are historic upright poles along the periphery of Voight
park. Concrete and brick entrance piers exist at woodward avenue and Longfellow Street. Alleys run east-west
down the center of the blocks, with the exception of the north-south alleys behind the Woodward Avenue
frontage.
Relationship of open space to structures. Open space in the district occurs in the form of vacant land, a city
park, side lots, and grassy median strips in the boulevards. There are no houses facing Woodward Avenue.
Ample open space is provided at Woodward Avenue and Boston Boulevard, creating a park-like entrance into
the district. The John C. Lodge freeway is depressed and forms a visual and physical gap in the district. All
houses have rear yards as well as front yards. Where an original or early arrangement of house and grounds
included, and still includes, landscaped lots which form part of the landscaping plan for the residence, such
landscaped lots are significant landscape features.
Relationship of lot coverage. Lot coverage ranges from approximately forty percent (40%) to ten percent (10%)
or less in the case of homes with large yards. Most homes are in the twenty-five percent (25%) to thirty-five
percent (35%) range of lot coverage.
Orientation, vistas, overviews. Most of the houses in the district have front entrances which are oriented toward
the streets running east-west. The houses on Lasalle Boulevard, from Chicago Boulevard to Edison Boulevard,
are orientated toward Lasalle. Garages are frequently oriented either toward an alley and/or the front drive or
toward a side street in the case of corner lots. Almost all garages are detached and are at the rear of the lot.
Symmetrical or asymmetric appearance. Neo-Georgian and other buildings derived from classical precedents
are generally symmetrical. Buildings in other styles, including the neo-Tudor, are generally asymmetric, but
balanced, compositions.
General environmental character. The Boston-Edison district, with its long straight streets, two (2) boulevards,
large-to-moderate sized stately single-family homes, Voight park and Woodward avenue's open space, has an
urban, substantial, low density residential character.

RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommends that the Commission find the project scope, as proposed, to be appropriate as it meets the following

 Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation:
• 9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its
environment.
• 10) New additions and related adjacent or relate new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner
that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment
would be unimpaired.
However, staff recommends the following conditions:
• The proposed railing should be of a more appropriate material than PVC
