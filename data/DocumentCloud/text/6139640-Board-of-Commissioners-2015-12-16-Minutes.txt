WHEREAS, the November 24th video release of LaQuan McDonald being fatally shot 16 times on

HANDLING OF ALLEGED POLICE MISCONDUCT MATTERS

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

December 16, 2015

WHEREAS, the aftermath of officer-involved deaths of civilians such as those of Michael Brown in
Ferguson, Freddy Gray in Baltimore, Eric Garner in New York, Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Walter Scott in
North Charleston and the shooting death of Laquan McDonald here in Chicago, has brought to the
national consciousness not only the question of what constitutes justifiable force by police officers but as
importantly, the manner in which such all police-involved incidents are investigated, and when warranted,
prosecuted; and
WHEREAS, it is vital that there exists public confidence in all branches of the criminal justice system,
including the prosecutorial arm, and that such trust fundamentally relies upon a showing of transparency
and accountability by those criminal justice stakeholders; and
WHEREAS, it is essential that the Office of the Cook County State’s Attorney recognizes and
acknowledges the legitimate societal expectations of such stakeholders and the justifiable need for public
trust in order to have the public as a willing participant in the justice system; and
WHEREAS, since shortly after the shooting of Laquan McDonald, the State’s Attorney was in
possession of multiple video images associated with the incident yet no charges were brought until 400
days after the shooting, thereby raising myriad questions among the public concerning the overall
investigation, what steps were or were not undertaken by the State’s Attorney, the rationale for those
decisions and the reasoning underlying the coincidental timing of the indictment relative to the release of
the videos; and
WHEREAS, this is just one incident among numerous other matters that raises significant questions
about the operations of her office numerous recent events have brought to light significant questions
with respect to the action or inaction of the Office of the State’s Attorney in other alleged police
misconduct matters ; and
WHEREAS, leaving such questions unanswered serves only to undermine community trust, thereby
hampering future efforts by criminal justice stakeholders to administer justice in other incidents and to
have the public as willing and trusting partners in working to prosecute other individuals responsible for
the plague of violence that exists in the City of Chicago and beyond; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has a legitimate, shared and vested interest in
ensuring that its agencies and offices operate honestly and efficiently in order to assure the confidence of
Cook County residents in the fundamental workings of the criminal justice process; and
WHEREAS, it is in the interest of this government and the County of Cook that its residents are
receiving, and entitled to, the best possible criminal justice system and that such entitlement is premised
upon honest, accountable and transparent services by those responsible for such system.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners do hereby request that a hearing of the Criminal Justice Committee be convened as soon
as is practical to discuss the decisions and processes used to investigate and bring charges in the Laquan
McDonald case in alleged police misconduct matters; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, in order to properly and fully have such discussions, the President and
the Cook County Board of Commissioners do hereby request that the Cook County State’s Attorney

WHEREAS, the 13-month time period between the shooting death of a 17-year-old African American,
Laquan McDonald, and the filing of criminal charges by the Cook County State’s Attorney against the
shooter, Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke has undermined local confidence in the criminal justice
system in Cook County; and,

the position of having to defend the impartiality of the State’s Attorney’s Office in prosecuting Officer Van
Dyke; and,

Department by the State’s Attorney for its own investigatory purposes places the Cook County State’s

PROPOSED PAYMENT APPROVAL
Department(s): Cook County Department of Homeland Security (“DHSEM”)
Action: Authorization for the Cook County Comptroller to remit $1,392,750.26 to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency due to ineligible costs for Project Shield from FY 2006 and FY 2007
Homeland Security Grant Programs.
Payee: Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington, DC
Good(s) or Service(s): FEMA reimbursement for Project Shield Costs deemed ineligible.
Fiscal Impact: $1,392,750.26
Accounts: 499-814
Contract Number(s): “N/A”
Summary: In July of 2015, the Cook County Department of Homeland Security and the Illinois
Emergency Management Agency (“IEMA”) received a Notice of Debt Collection for Homeland Security
Grant Funds Awarded to Project Shield, totaling $1,392,750.26 from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (“FEMA”). The July FEMA correspondence indicated that various Project Shield
activities that were funded by the Fiscal Year 2006 and 2007 Homeland Security Grants were
unreasonable, unallowable and unallocable costs. Even though the findings resulted from work
performed by a previous administration, DHSEM worked with the IEMA to appeal FEMA’s findings;
however, the DHSEM was notified on 11/12/2015 by IEMA that FEMA denied the appeal and included a
final determination that grant funds were expended by Cook County in the amount of $1,392,750.26 on
ineligible costs for Project Shield and are required to be returned to FEMA.

Summary: I am delighted to submit this letter of request for the City of Harvey’s interest in Cook
County’s No Cash Bid Program to the Cook County Board of Commissioners. There are a total of 79
Parcels listed in our request and they are as follows. As indicated in Resolution 2772 and amended in
Resolution 2775, the City of Harvey requests 79 parcels of land for the redevelopment of our major
thoroughfares and Downtown Business District areas.
The City will retain legal counsel and pay all costs for tax deeds. Currently, the City has no “Third Party
Requestors.” The City will report as required to the Cook County Bureau Economic Development annually
from the date of sale on each parcel for five years or until the development is completed or whichever
comes last. The City will file for tax exempt status for PINs which will be used for municipal purposes or
maintain the status until tax deed(s) are conveyed to developers. If a City of Harvey lien is cleared by the
no cash bid, the City agrees to this in that the future redevelopment is more valuable to the City than the
cost of the municipal lien. If a Cook County lien is on a parcel, the City agrees to reinstate the lien after
the tax sale for the County with an intergovernmental agreement to be recorded.

Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location:

Village of Justice

Volume and Property Index Number:
084, 18-34-405-008-0000
Summary: The Village of Justice (the Village) hereby submits a No Cash Bid Request Package to acquire
the following parcel of real property located at 8801 West 84th Place, Justice, Illinois 60458 (the Property).
The Property is improved with a gasoline service station that has been abandoned and remained unoccupied
for at least two (2) years. The Village will file for tax exempt status once the Property has been acquired.
Once tax exempt status is obtained, the Village intends to demolish the gasoline service station
improvements, remediate environmental contamination, and possibly market the same for redevelopment
by a third-party. If the Property is sold and redeveloped by a third-party, it would no longer be exempt
from taxation. The Village initiates this request on its own, and there has been no request by a third-party
for the Village to acquire the Property or to convey the certificate of purchase or the perfected tax deed(s)
to said third-party purchaser.
The Village will retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all legal costs and other costs associated
with acquisition of the Property. The Village will submit annually to the Cook County Department of
Economic Development "No Cash Bid Reports" on the status of each parcel for five years, or until the
intended use and development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No Cash
Bid Ordinance.

PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: Marilynn J. May, Village President, Village of River Grove
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location:

Village of River Grove

Volume and Property Index Number:
067, 12-26-311-010-0000; 067, 12-26-311-012-0000; 067, 12-26-416-010-0000
Summary: Three (3) properties located within the Village of River Grove are currently tax-delinquent
and unoccupied, and the Village would therefore like to secure ownership of these properties through the
Cook County No Cash Bid Program and the 2015 Scavenger Sale. A list containing the volume number
and full 14-digit permanent index number (PIN) of each parcel requested is as follows. The total number
of PINs requested in the package is three (3). A statement of current and intended use for each PIN follows,
but, the Village intends on acquiring all three parcels for the development of public parking facilities:
Common Address 2620 Thatcher Avenue, River Grove, Illinois, 60171 Vol. 067 PIN 12-26-311-010-0000
currently contains multiple unoccupied, neglected commercial structures. Vol. 067 PIN
12-26-311-012-0000 currently contains two
unoccupied, neglected structures, with one improvement being commercial and the other residential. Both
parcels have not been occupied for a period in excess of three (3) years. As mentioned above, the intended
use of these parcels is the development of public parking facilities. These two parcels are located near the
business district and across from the municipal building of the village. Currently, the business district
suffers from a profound lack of parking for owners, businesses and customers within the district. For this
reason, the village plans to build a public parking lot for village employees and the public on these parcels,
which in turn would free up space in the village’s current public parking lot immediately adjacent to the
business district. This plan expands parking available to the owners, employees and patrons of the
businesses in the business district. The village believes that by increasing public parking facilities, the
commercial activity of the business district will be enhanced and greater sales-tax revenues will be
generated for both Cook County and the Village of River Grove. Common Address 8135 West Grand
Avenue, River Grove, Illinois, 60171 Vol. 067 PIN 12-26-416-010-0000. This parcel currently consists of
an obsolete, neglected unoccupied restaurant structure, and the improvement consumes the entire parcel
with no on-site parking facilities. This parcel has not been occupied for a period in excess of three (3)
years. As mentioned above, the intended use of this parcel would be the development of public parking
facilities. The parcel is situated in the middle of the Grand Avenue Business Corridor and offers a great
opportunity to create additional public parking to serve the business district. As previously stated, the
village believes that by increasing public parking facilities serving the business district, the commercial
activity of the business district will be enhanced and greater sale-tax revenues will be generated for both

Cook County and the Village Rive Grove. Next, in accordance with the county ordinance, on behalf of the
Village of River Grove, I make the following representations and affirmations in support of the Village’s
Request Package: The Village shall file for tax exempt status on each parcel because the Village intends
on retaining these three parcels for municipal use. There is neither a Third Party Request nor a Third Party
Requestor with respect to these three parcels. The Village shall retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deeds
and bear all legal and other costs associated with acquisition of these three parcels. The Village agrees to
submit to the Cook County Department of Economic Development No Cash Bid Reports on the status of
each parcel for five (5) year or until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the
Cook County No Cash Bid Ordinance.

Summary: Please take notice, by this letter, the interest and intent of the Village of Bridgeview (the
“Village”) to participate in the Cook County No Cash Bid Program and receive a No Cash Bid for the
following parcels. This Request Package contains 29 PINs. To the best of our knowledge, all but one of
the parcels contains vacant land. Parcel # 23-01-114-009-0000 contains a mixed-use structure, which the
village is determining occupancy.

Original Text of Item:
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
ORGAN DONOR LEAVE POLICY
WHEREAS, the need for potentially life-saving organ and bone marrow transplants far exceeds the supply;
and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois has recognized the importance of organ donation by providing the
opportunity for paid leave to State employees who donate an organ or bone marrow; and
WHEREAS, like Illinois, many other jurisdictions have attempted to offset the incidental costs associated
with the donation and protect employees from retaliation for taking leave to donate an organ by passing
legislation providing job-protected, paid leave to employees who donate organs or bone marrow; and
WHEREAS, Cook County currently does not provide job-protected, paid leave for the purpose of organ or
bone marrow donation, necessitating employees to use their accrued sick and vacation leave or take unpaid
personal leave, if eligible; and
WHEREAS, in order to offset the incidental costs associated with donation and protect employees from
retaliation for taking a leave of absence to donate an organ, all Cook County agencies and offices should
afford paid leave to employees who donate organs or bone marrow; and
WHEREAS, the President’s Office and the Bureau of Human Resources have researched various organ
donor leave policies and as a result, the Bureau of Human Resources has developed an Organ Donor Leave
Policy that will provide job-protected, paid leave for the purpose of organ or bone marrow donation; and
WHEREAS, the proposed policy would be available to all eligible Cook County employees (employed
with the County for at least twelve (12) months) who donate organs or donate bone marrow via surgical
aspiration or non-surgical apheresis; and
WHEREAS, the risk of complications and death, as well as the burden to the donor in terms of recovery
time, pain, and suffering is lowest for apheresis donation and greatest for organ donation; and

Page 244 of 260

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

December 16, 2015

WHEREAS, an eligible employee who donates bone marrow via non-surgical apheresis would receive five
(5) days of paid leave within a twelve (12) month period; and
WHEREAS, an eligible employee who donates bone marrow via surgical aspiration would receive fifteen
(15) days of paid leave within a twelve (12) month period; and
WHEREAS, an eligible employee who donates an organ would receive thirty (30) days of paid donor leave
within a twelve (12) month period; and
WHEREAS, an eligible employee that donates an organ as of January 1, 2015, that by necessity used their
accrued sick and vacation leave or took unpaid leave may recover that time under this policy but may not
exceed the thirty (30) days of paid donor leave within a twelve (12) month period; and
WHEREAS, the Bureau of Human Resources shall adopt and circulate the Organ Donor Leave Policy to
all Cook County agencies and offices as this policy will not only benefit our employees and their families
but also the County’s overall mission.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook
County does hereby direct the Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources to implement an Organ Donor
Leave Policy with an effective date of September 1, 2015; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all Cook County agencies and offices receive a copy of the Organ
Donor Leave Policy issued by the Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all Cook County agencies and offices which shall include but not
be limited to the offices under the Cook County Board President, Cook County Board of Commissioners,
Cook County State’s Attorney, Cook County Sheriff, Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Cook

Summary:

The Juvenile Court Clinic operates in all courtrooms of the Juvenile Justice Division and

Page 246 of 260

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

December 16, 2015

Child Protection Division. In 2014, the Juvenile Clinic processed about 4,400 requests for forensic
clinical services and produced 197 forensic evaluation reports to the court. Judges, lawyers, probation
officers, and staff of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center rely on the services of the Clinic to make
informed and relevant decisions in juvenile court proceedings concerning minors and families. These
services include clinical coordination and referrals in the courtrooms, court-ordered forensic clinical
assessments, expert testimony, evaluation of community-based mental health resources, and education on
mental health issues and court proceedings.
Currently, Northwestern University, through the Juvenile Court Clinic, is one of four (4) separate
agencies providing forensic clinical services across the juvenile justice system. The others are the
Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department, the Isaac Ray Center at the Cook County Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center, and the State of Illinois Mental Health and Juvenile Justice Program. A
2014 independent review ordered by Chief Judge Timothy C. Evans determined that all forensic clinical
services should be provided uniformly by a single provider, using state-of-the-art, evidence-based
standards of care. The requested increase and extension will provide time to prepare and issue a Request
for Proposal (RFP) to retain a provider of forensic services on a global level.
This contract was originally awarded through a Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures. Northwestern
University was awarded based on established evaluation criteria.
