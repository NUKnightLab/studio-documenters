federa l government relations consulting services to Cook County. Compensation for these services shall
be at a rate of $5 ,000.00 6,250.00 per month and include reimbursement of expenses not to exceed
$5 ,000.00 10,000.00.
The scope of the services shall include but are not limited to leading and coord inating services in relation
to federal initiati ves regarding health care, welfare and immigration reform, federa l crime legislation and
regulatory concerns. Ms. White's knowledge of both federal and local government has been an asset to
Cook County for the past two years.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $65,000.00 85,000.00. Contract period: May 6, 2000 through May 5, 200 I.

Reason:

Yerio Chicago has hosted the Assessor's web site s ince November of 1997 and currently
provides the Assessor's Office with dedicated Internet Access. In order to prevent the costs
that would be involved in both setting up these services with another vendor and educating
that vendor about the Internet needs of the Assessor's Office, the Assessor' s Office wishes to
enter into a sole source contract with Verio Chicago. Because Internet Access and Web
Hosting are ongoing effo1ts, it is important that the delivery of these services not be
interrupted. This is particularly important because of the interactive search portion of the
Assessor's site, which a llows residential taxpayers to look up important assessment data
about their own, and neighboring properties. Any break in this service could create a
problem for taxpayers who rely on the Assessor' s web s ite to find critical information for
filing appeals on their assessments.

OFFICE OF THE RECORDER OF DEEDS
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by
EUGENE "GENE" MOORE, Recorder of Deeds
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
PURSUANT TO THE HOM E RUL E AUTHORITY OF THE COUNTY OF COOK,
AS VESTED TN IT BY THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF ILLINO IS,
THERE IS HEREBY ENACTED THE FOLLOWING ORDINANCE:
The Cook County Recorder of Deeds is hereby authorized to provide a photocopier for customers' use,
and to charge a fee of $.25 per copy.
This Ordinance shall be in full force and effect immediately upon passage by the Cook County Board of
Commissio ners.

This item was WITHDRAWN at the request of the sponsor.

CLAIM FOR DAMAGES
Transmitting a Communication, dated April 3, 2000 from
EUGENE "GENE" MOORE, Recorder of Deeds
The Recorder of Deeds has received a claim for damages pursuant to Section I 0 I of the Registered Titles
(Torrens) Act (765 ILCS 35/ 10 I). The Torrens Act states:
"Any person sustai ning loss or damages through any om1ss1on, mistake o r
misfeasance of the registrar, any examiner of titles ... shall have a right of action for
damages thus sustained against the county in which such land shall be registered, and
may file a c laim with the co unty board ... " Also 765 ILCS 35/ 102 permits for an
Indem ni ty Fund for "claims allowed against the county for loss or damages
aforesaid ... That no claim for such loss or damages shall be allowed unless upon the
recommendation of the registrar who shall be in office at the time the claim sha ll be
a llowed. The county board shall grant or deny such claims in whole or in part .... "
In the judgment of foreclosure the circuit court ruled that the Registrar of Tit les accepted I/2 of a forged
signatu re on a Deed into Trust in document number LR 386 I 078.
T he court has also determined that Parkway Bank and Trust Company is entitled to $187, I25.93 from the
proceeds of the sale. The judgment of forec losure was for $690, 123 .18 less the amou nt that Parkway
Bank received leaves a balance of $502,997.25. The Registrar of Titles is liable for I/2 of that amount
which is $25 1,498 .62 .

1580

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 2, 2000
Attorney Leon Wexler who represents Parkway Bank and Trust Company will accept $250,000.00 to
settle the claim. This amount is less than the Registrar's Office liability so the Registrar recommends the
settlement of this claim for said amount.
Therefore, the Recorder of Deeds approves the claim for Parkway Bank and Trust Company in the
amount of $250,000.00 and recommends that the Board of County Commissioners grant the claim.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Sutker, moved that the request of the Recorder of
Deeds be approved. The motion carried unanimously.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON ZONING AND BUILDING
May 2, 2000
The Honorable,
The Board of Commissioners of Cook County

ATTENDANCE
Present:

Chairman Silvestri, Vice Chairman Stee le, Commissioners Butler, Carr, Daley, Goslin,
Hansen, Lechowicz, Maldonado, Moran, Moreno, Quigley , Schumann, Sutker, and

Absent:

Also Present:

Gayle Smolinski, President, Village of Roselle

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Zoning and Building, having had under consideration the matter hereinafter
mentioned respectfully reports and recommends as follows:

1596

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 2, 2000

SECTION J
Your Committee has considered the following numbered and described application requesting a public
hearing before the Cook County Zoning Board of Appeals on a request for a Spec ial Use on certain
property described therein:
230928

DOCKET NO. #6901 - JOHN HOLZER, Owner, 1906 Manor Lane, Park Ridge, Illinois
60068, Application (No. SU-99- 1O; Z99086). Submitted by same. Seeking a SPEC IAL USE
in the C-4 General Commercial District for a public parking/vehicle storage use in Section 34
of Schaumburg Township. Property consists of approximately 0.19 of an acre located at the
northwest corner of North Shore Avenue and Roselle Road in Schaumburg Township.
Intended use: Public parking/vehicle storage. Recommendation : In the view of the foregoing,
the Zoning Board of Appeals recommends to the Cook County Board of Commissioners by a
vote of 4-1 (A lex Se ith dissenting) that the proposed Specia l Use in the C-4 General
Commercial District for public parking/vehicle storage be granted with cond itions. Should
the foregoing be granted, all pertinent records, maps and Comprehensive Plan shall be
changed. Parking lots, other than accessory allowed, and no Specia l Use is necessary under
the C-4, which the property is currently zoned.

The Village of Roselle has objected to the above (Item 230928) petition by Resolution and the Village of
Schaumburg concurs with the Resolution of objection in a letter.
The Cook County Zon ing Board of Appeals to whom said application was referred, subm itted a
communication setting forth its fi ndings and recommendations following public hearings held thereon,
and recommended that said application be granted subject to conditions as set forth in the findi ngs.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to deny the recommendation of
the Zoning Board of Appeals on the above Item 230928 for the following reasons:
I.

The proposed use (storage of towed junk, disabled, or abandoned cars) would be injurious to the
enjoyment of surrounding property because of visual clutter of the cars, and the open yard
fac ility, lacking on-site human supervision and maintenance, wou ld create the appearance of an
abandoned business.

2.

The proposed use wou ld impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the
surroundin g property, which is envisioned as suitable for commercial businesses such as hotels or
office parks.

3.

The proposed use does not conform to app licable Cook County regulations for a C-4 General
Commercial District. The C-4 al lows accessory parking lots as a permitted use and commercial
parking lots as a Special Use, but open storage yards and junk yards are specifically prohibited.

4.

The proposed use would be incompatible with the Comprehensive Plan of the Village of Roselle .

T he motion carried unanimously.

RESOLUTIONS

OO-R-271
RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE JOHN H. STROGER, JR., PRESIDENT AND CARL R. HANSEN
COUNTY COMMISSIONERS

WHEREAS, there exists a national debate on the issue of whether and how to collect sales and use taxes
on remote sales transactions such as those which occur over the Internet, telephone or via mail; and
WHEREAS, out-of-state merchants who conduct sales via the Internet, mail order and telephone are not
currently required by law to collect sales and use taxes imposed by state and local governments, and
WHEREAS, Congress enacted a moratorium on the imposition of sales and use taxes on interstate sales
over the Internet and established an Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce ("the Commission")
charged with making recommendations to Congress on federal, state, local, and international taxation and
tariffs on transactions using the Internet and Internet Access; and
WHEREAS, the Commission 's final report was submitted to Congress on April 12, 2000. Of particular
note are the recommendations to Congress proposed by a majority of the members of the Commission,
but which failed to receive the affirmative support of the 2/3 super majority required by the Congressional
charge. The Commission' s majority report makes several significant recommendations including:
•

Repeal of the federal three- percent excise tax on telecommunications services; and

•

Simplification of state and local sales and use tax systems; and

•

Permanent prohibition on states and localities from taxing Internet access subscription charges;
and

•

Extension of the Internet Taxation moratorium legislated by Congress which is set to expire
October 200 I; and

WHEREAS, the Commission 's maJonty report, in addition to failing to receive the required 2/3
affirmative vote, fails to advise Congress of the concerns and recommendations made by the minority,
including the need to proceed cautiously to protect sales tax revenue sources for state and local
governments, and to extend the moratorium only until the tax simplification study which is currently
underway can be completed; and

1642

 JOU RNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 2, 2000
WHEREAS a significant national coa lition, inc luding the National Association of Counties, Nationa l
Governor's Association, and National Conference of State Legislatures, is working to develop model
legislation for a simplified sales tax administration and collection plan that would facilitate collection of
sales taxes from Internet sellers and other out-of-state parties using 2 1st Century technology with
simplified de finitions, tax rates and tax bases, while removing many of the administrative burdens from
retailers; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Legislature recently passed SB 1682, which provides that the Illinois Department
of Revenue shall enter into discussions with other states regarding deve lopment of a multi-state,
voluntary, streamlined system for sales and use tax collection and administration, and authorizes the
Department to participate in a pilot project with other states and selected businesses to test such a
proposed system; and
WHEREAS, a recent University of Tennessee study estimates that the loss of state sales tax revenue due
to untaxed re mote sa les in 2003 alone, will exceed $ I 0 billion, and
WHEREAS, increas ing sales on the Internet and through other remote means, and the resulting erosion of
sales and use tax revenues, will limit the ability of state and local governments to fin ance essential public
services such as public safety and health care; and
WHEREAS, according to a poll by the National Association of Counties and US Conference of Mayors
released in December 1999, 72% of Americans surveyed say that it is unfair that local businesses and
"Main Street" retailers must collect sales taxes while out-of-state Internet retailers do not; and
WHEREAS the United States Congress will soon consider legislation based upon the Commission's
recommendations. Of paramount concern to Cook County, Illinois is the recommendation calling for
extension of the moratorium on taxation of Internet transactions without regard to efforts to simplify state
and local sales and use taxation.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLV ED THAT:
1.

The Cook County Board of Commissioners supports efforts to deve lop model laws providing
for simplified administration and enforcement of state and local sales and use tax collections,
a nd urges the expeditious completion of this proj ect.

2.

The Cook County Board of Commissioners urges the United States Congress to defeat
legislation extending the moratorium beyond its current sunset of October 2001 ; or in the
alternative, to extend the moratorium only for a brief period of time linked to the
implementation of model laws be ing developed to simplify the administration and
e nforcement of state and local sales and use taxes.

3.

That a suitable copy of this Resolution be submitted to Congressiona l leaders and to all
members of Congress representing districts in Cook County, Illino is.

Approved and adopted this 2nd day of May 2000.
