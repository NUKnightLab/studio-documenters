 Office of the Medical Examiner – FY2013 Accomplishments
FY2014 Budget Presentation
• Improved processing time for indigent burials. The M.E. ordinance allows us 90 days to
process indigents held in our cooler. In FY13-Q3 all but four were buried of within 90 days
compared to 17 in Q1 (target 0)
• Reduced morgue census from 204 in Q1 to average 143 in Q3 through streamlining operations
and improving interagency relationships (morgue capacity 275)
• Hired five additional pathologists (two current vacancies) to reduce the caseload per doctor
and give them time to sign out 62% of reports within 90 days of autopsy in Q3 compared to
38% in Q2. (NAME standards requires 90%.) Decrease number of cases per pathologist from
449 in Q1 to 370 in Q3 (NAME standard less than 250)
• Increased scene investigations from 12 per month to 60 per month and initiated American
Board of Medicolegal Death Investigators certification process for investigators
• Completed six-Sigma re-engineering of all work processes and revised section standard
operating procedures to maximize efficacy of software upgrade.

13

 Office of the Medical Examiner – FY2014 Budget Highlights
FY2014 Budget Presentation

• Apply for provisional accreditation by the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME) in
FY 14. Successful accreditation would ensure the opportunity to obtain federal funding, bolster
the Office’s credibility in court, and reflect NAME’s assessment that the Office is adhering to
standards that ensure quality work by its pathologists. At the same time, accreditation would
send a clear message to the taxpayers of Cook County that the Medical Examiner’s office, the
subject of much controversy last year, has made enormous progress under its current
leadership, and has proven itself worthy of peer recognition.

• Continue to recruit top-quality individuals to fill vacancies and reach appropriate staffing levels
• Launch new case management software system that will streamline daily operations and allow
for both academic and public health-related research

• Continue to upgrade the facility with new equipment in the pathology suites and toxicology lab.
• Challenge staff on a daily basis to promote the County’s governing principle of improved
service. Professionalism and courtesy in delivering services to those who find themselves in
need of the ME’s office should be the standard for all staff at all times.

 Adoption & Child Custody Advocacy – FY2013 Accomplishments
FY2014 Budget Presentation

• The department created and developed a survey for the primary shareholders. This will allow
the department to determine how we can better service the taxpayers
• In FY 2012 it was determined that 20% of our reports did not meet the appropriate timeline
largely due to the large number of cases a caseworker carries. However, in FY 2013, we were
able to reduce the delinquency amount to 10%
• The department became fully operational with a new online credit card and debit card payment
process. This allows families another avenue and convenience to make payments

18

 Adoption & Child Custody Advocacy – FY2014 Budget Highlights
FY2014 Budget Presentation
• In FY2013, a triage system was created to determine which court orders are needed to
immediately provide services based on children being at risk. It is believed that this process
expedites high priority cases and reduces the risk to children
• The modified reporting system along with utilizing additional statistical information has resulted
in exceeding STAR goals for input and output knowledge development
• The tracking system, which helps determine DCFS involvement, also helps determine the
actual number of individuals assisted by our department
