Community Grant Applications
1. The committee discussed the distribution of grant funding for the remainder of 2019 and
into 2020
a. After record number of applicants in 2019, the committee’s goal is to more events
for smaller amounts rather than a few grants for the highest possible amount
($5,000)
2. Application: 826CHI – Revitalization Initiative - $5,000
a. Committee determined that part of this application made more sense for a

program and identify areas of their programming that may be eligible for
