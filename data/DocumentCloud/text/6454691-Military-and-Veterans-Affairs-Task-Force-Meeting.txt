HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: Neighborhood Enterprise Zone Certi?cate Application for the rehabilitation of a
single-family home located at 1793 Seyburn Avenue in the Islandview Neighborhood
Enterprise Zone area. (RECOMMEND APPROVAL)

The of?ce of the City Flaming Commission (CPC) has received an application requesting a
Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (NEZ) certi?cate forwarded from the of?ce of the City Clerk for
the rehabilitation of a single-family home located at 1793 Seyburn Avenue. This application
corresponds to a quali?ed facility which will be newly renovated. The project consists of a
complete and total renovation of the property. CPC staff has reviewed the application and
recommends approval.

The subject property has been con?rmed as being within the boundaries of the Islandview NEZ
which was established by a vote of Council on April 30, 1996, and should be eligible for NEZ
certi?cates under State Act 147 of 1992 as currently written. The anticipated cost of
rehabilitation for 1793 Seyburn Avenue is $176,247.00. The applicant is seeking a 17 year tax
abatement based on the historic nature of the property which is located in the West Village
historic district. The NEZ certi?cate application appears to have been submitted after the
issuance of applicable building permits. However, given the historic nature of the property the
issuance of the requested certi?cate is permissible per Sec. of PA. 147 of 1992 which
states:

(2) An application may be filed after a building permit is issued only if 1 or more of the following apply:
For a rehabilitated facility if all or a portion ofthe rehabilitated facility is a quali?ed historic
building.

Please contact our of?ce should you have any questions.
