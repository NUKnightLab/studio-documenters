Submitting report relative to Proposed Chapter 11-30 of Recodified Detroit City
Code. (For your consideration, the Legislative Policy Division has provided a
general overview of the type of amendments that have been made in the
proposed chapters 11-30 of the Detroit City Code recodification project. The
Home Rule City Act, 117.5b, authorizes the City to amend, rearrange and repeal
provisions in the Code through a recodification process. The amendments are
being made to update language to reflect changes in State law and to remove
unnecessary and duplicative provisions. There are only a few instances where
changes are being made because of a City agency’s request for a change of
policy, in those instances the request is noted. Although allowed, it has been
determined that further changes of policy would be best handled outside of this
process.)
