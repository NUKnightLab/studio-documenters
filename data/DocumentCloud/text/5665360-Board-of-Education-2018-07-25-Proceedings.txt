POLICE NOTIFICATION GUIDELINES

School administrators contact the Chicago Police Department (CPD) in two situations: (1) to seek
assistance with an emergency situation, or (2) to notify law enforcement of a criminal act.

When an allegation of harassment, bullying, assault, or abuse related to sex, sexual orientation, gender, or
gender expression or inappropriate consensual sexual activity arises, the Of?ce of Student Protections and
Title IX can assist with assessing whether police noti?cation is needed.

Emergency
School administrators have the responsibility to call 9-1-1 in situations they determine to be emergencies.

In an emergency situation, administrators must make reasonable efforts to notify parents/guardians
immediately after contacting CPD.

Criminal Acts

When a student engages in illegal activity, it may be necessary for school staff to report the act to CPD. in
this situation, school officials contact CPD to report violations of the law. School officials must not contact
CPD merely to request removal of a disruptive student from the school in a non-emergency situation.

In a non? ?emergency situation, administrators must make reasonable efforts to contact parents/guardians
prior to contacting CPD.

The inappropriate behaviors that are clear violations of criminal law are identi?ed in the next section with
an asterisk before the Speci?c inappropriate behavior The inappropriate behaviors that may be
violations of crimInal law are identified in the next section With a double asterisk before the speci?c
inappropriate behavior.

School of?cials must assess the situation before determining whether or not to contact CPD to report a
criminal act. School of?cials should consider factors including:

0 Whether the student distributed or was in possession of illegal drugs, narcotics, controlled
substances, or "look-alikes" of such substances. if so, CPD must be noti?ed.
Whether the student was in possession of a ?rearm?- If so, CPD must be noti?ed.
The severity of the criminal violation and the degree of harm to the school community,
Whether a person was physically injured as a result of the student's conduct,
Whether the student presents an imminent danger to the health, safety, or welfare of others, and
The student's age. For a student in ?fth (5th) grade or below, school staff must consult with the Law
Department (773/553?1700) prior to reporting the act 

Once school staff members contact CPD, the responding police of?cers ultimately will determine whether
or not to' investigate, arrest, and/or take any other steps in response. School principals and staff do not
have the authority to decide whether a student will be arrested. Moreover, responding police of?cers do
not have the authority to decide whether a student will receive interventions or consequences at school.
The school principal will use the SCC to determine the appropriate intervention(s) andlor consequence(s)
to address a student's behavior.

achievement is not an inappropriate behavior. The SCC and school rules may not be used to discipline
students for poor academic progress or failure to complete in?ciass and homework assignments. Instead,
struggling students shouid'be considered for academic or behavioral interventions to help them improve.
Also students must not be disciplined for the refusal to consent to the administration of
medication

Cellular Phones and Other information Technology Devices3 
A principal may allow students to possess cellular phones or other information technology devices by
creating a school policy identifying when the items may be authorized, used, and how they must be kept.
A principal may also prohibit cellular phones and other information technology devices but allow individual
students to possess them for any good cause after considering a written request from a parentlguardian.
If a principal denies a- parentlguardian 5 request the parent may appeal to the Network Chief or his/her
designee. Unless approved by the principal cellular phones and other information devices are
not allowed at school.

detentions or excluded from extracurricular activities, but may not be barred from attending class. A student

ANTI-BULLYING POLICY

Purgose
The General Assembly has found that a safe and civil school environment Is necessary for students

to learn and achieve and that bullying causes physical .and emotibnal harm to students and
interferes with their ability to learn and participate in school activities. Bullying has been linked to other
forms of antisocial behavior, such as vandalism, shoplifting, skipping and dropping out of school, ?ghting,
using drugs and alcohol, sexual harassment, and violence. it is the goal of the Chicago Board of Education
Board? to create a learning environment in all its school communities where all students feel safe and
supported, are protected from bullying, and are able to succeed academically and develop socially and
emotionally into responsible, caring individuals.

School of?cials may suspend students with disabilitieslimpairments and cease educational services for a
total of up to 10 consecutive or 10 cumulative School days in one school year without providing procedural
safeguards. Saturday, and before- and after-school detentions do not count toward the 10-day limit.
Additionally, if students with disabilities continue to participate in the general education curriculum, continue
to receive theirlEP services, and continue to participate with non-disabled. peers to the same extent as
specified in the lEPs, in-school suspensions and lunch detentions do not count toward the 10-day limit.
Administrators are not required to suspend students with disabilities for the recommended periods set forth
in this Code for a single incident. Speci?cally, the Principal or his/her designee has discretion to suspend
students with disabilities fewer days than set forth for a single incident. Federal regulatiOns offer some 
flexibility in suspending students with disabilities in excess of 10 school days in the school year in certain
circumstances. in order to determine whether the circumstances permit a suspension in excess of 10 days
per school year, consultation by the school with the Department of Procedural Safeguards and Parental
Supports (773553-1905) is absolutely necessary. Without such consultation and approval from the
Department of Procedural Safeguards and Parental Supports, the 10 school day limit on out of
school suspensions will continue to apply.

When school officials anticipate a referral for expulsiOn, including referrals requesting emergency
assignment pursuant to the CPS 800, the following apply: 

1: School must provide written notice to the parentlguardian or surrogate parent of the request
for an expulsion hearing and the date of an Individualized Education Program 
Manifestation Determination Review (MDR) meeting, which must be held within 10 school days
of the date of the decision to request the expulsion hearing School must also provide
parentlguardianlsurrogate with a written copy of the Notice of Procedural Safeguards

2. The team must.
A, Determine whether the misconduct is related to the student's disability by
reviewing all current and relevant information, including evaluation and diagnostic results.
information from the parentlguardian. observations of the student, and the student?s IEP.
The behavior is a manifestation of the student?s disability if; 
1) the conduct in question was caused by the student?s disability or has a direct and
substantial relationship to the student's disability; and/or
2) the conduct In question was the direct result of the school' 5 failure to implement
the student' 5 IEP
B. Review, and revise if necessary. the student?s existing behavior intervention plan or
develop a functional behavior assessment and behavior intervention plan to 
address the misconduct. The behavior intervention plan must address the misconduct for
which the student Is being disciplined.

If the students behavior is not a manifestation of the disability school of?cials may apply the SCC, taking
into consideration the student?s special education and disciplinary records. in no event. however. may the
student be suspended for more than 10 consecutive or cumulative school days in a school year without
providing apprOpriate educational services

If the student's behavior Is a manifestation of the disability, 'a disciplinary change in placement (expulsion)
cannot occur. Students with disabilities, even if expelled, must be provided with an appropriate education
in an altemative educational setting.

All MDRs are subject to legal review by the Department of Procedural Safeguards and Parental Supports.
