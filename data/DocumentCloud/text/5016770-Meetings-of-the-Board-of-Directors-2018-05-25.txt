C. Managed Care Committee
i. Metrics (Attachment #2)
Director Junge and James Kiamos, Executive Director of Managed Care, reviewed the metrics. The Board reviewed
and discussed the information.
Director Driscoll inquired regarding the percentage of CountyCare members who use CCHHS as a provider,
compared to the overall patients at CCHHS. Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and
Strategy, responded that CountyCare represents approximately 11% of CCHHS’ business – that is based on charges,
not visits.
During the review of slide 3 of the presentation, Director Junge referenced Mr. Kiamos’ comments regarding those
managed care organizations (MCOs) whose claims/encounters acceptance rate goes below 90% - when this happens,
they are disqualified from receiving new members based on auto-assignment. She inquired whether there are any
MCOs whose rate is currently below 90%. Mr. Kiamos responded that he will check and provide that information;
at this time, he believes there is one (1) MCO whose claims/encounters acceptance rate is below 90%.
During the discussion of the information on slide 5 of the presentation, Director Richardson-Lowry disclosed for the
record that she used to serve as outside counsel for La Rabida.

Officer, and Mr. Elwell reviewed the Metrics and presentation on Revenue Cycle Management Initiatives and
Metrics. Charles Jones, Chief Procurement Officer, provided a brief overview of the contractual requests that were
considered at the Finance Committee Meeting. It was noted that there is one (1) request (request number 16) that is
pending review by Contract Compliance.
Chairman Hammock suggested that staff somehow find a way to identify unique supply situations where only one
(1) option/vendor is available.
During the review of the Metrics, Chairman Hammock suggested that, at the next Board Meeting, they should expect
to spend extra time reviewing and discussing the information contained within the Stroger Hospital Operation
Overview and the Corporate Office Financial Statements and Operational Statistics.
Director Munar suggested that, perhaps in the future, the income statement can be presented and reviewed based on
CCHHS’ four (4) different business lines.
During the review and discussion of the information contained in the presentation on Revenue Cycle Management
Initiatives and Metrics, Director Richardson-Lowry stated that it would be helpful if Mr. Akpan could provide some
prioritization in terms of objectives for the next time he returns with an update.
Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the approval of the
Minutes of the Meeting of the Finance Committee of May 18, 2018. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
