Total Amount of Transfer: $18,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On January 22nd it became apparent that a funds transfer would be needed in the Branch Court program
Institutional Supplies. Therefore, funds will be transferred into account 333 program 11375. There was a
typo when funds were initially loaded-funds were loaded into account 330 instead of 333.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
This account was chosen because the funds were placed in account 330 in error.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

Summary: This three (3) month extension would allow Sentinel Offender services, LLC to continue to
provide electronic monitoring and Global Positioning System (GPS) services for the Adult Probation
Department and Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department for minor and adult clients who are
ordered by the court to wear electronic monitoring devices. Sentinel provides GPS monitoring equipment
and services for adult probationers and pretrial defendants in order to comply with Public Act 95-0773,
also known as the Cindy Bischof Law, which calls for the monitoring of certain domestic violence
offenders through GPS technology. The law allows the court to order adults charged with certain
domestic violence offenses to be monitored electronically by the Adult Probation Department Home
Confinement Unit as a condition of bail or probation. Offenders are ordered to wear a GPS tracking
device to help monitor compliance with orders to stay away from the complaining witness, the
complaining witness’s home/workplace, or any other protected address specified. There are currently
more than 210 adults under GPS monitoring and 110 victims who carry GPS devices to create mobile
exclusion zones.
Effective on 1/1/2015, new legislation (Public Act 98-1012, 725 ILCS 5/110-5) significantly expanded
the types of charges required to be considered for GPS monitoring as a condition of bail.
GPS technology is used by the Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department to monitor high-risk
youth in home confinement as an alternative to secure detention or as a condition of release into the
community. These devices are deployed at various points of the judicial process from pre- adjudication
through post-dispositional stages of court proceedings. For the month of November 2017, there were 381
court-involved youth under GPS electronic surveillance, 55% of whom are on pretrial status.
A new Request for Proposal process is concluding for a new contract. The extension provides a brief
period of time as a contingency to transition services to a new provider.
The contract was awarded through the Request for Proposals (RFP) process in accordance with the Cook
County Procurement Code. Sentinel Offender Services, LLC. was awarded this contract based on
established evaluation criteria

Summary: On 2/5/2013, the Cook County Board of Commissioners approved a ten-month contract with
Heartland Human Care Services, Inc. to manage the Cook County Juvenile Detention Reduction Project
(DRP) to serve court-involved, moderate and high-risk youth in jeopardy of imminent referral to the
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center due to non-compliance with court orders.
The DRP augments the court’s nationally recognized Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative which is a
continuum of community-based services that judges and probation officers may use to divert at-risk
minors from detention. Both the Initiative and the DRP programs allow minors to remain in their
communities and engage in pro-social interventions. The DRP currently provides services to youth living
in targeted Chicago communities. The contract provides a wide range of interventions and mentoring,
including educational, therapeutic and recreational programming, which responds to the needs of the
juveniles who are referred to participate in this project. Heartland partners with 13 faith-based and other
community based-agencies to facilitate direct access to services and care. Since the beginning of the
project, more than 3,750 referrals have been processed for DRP services.
The request for the increase is to continue services until a new contract is executed, while a corresponding
Request for Proposal (“RFP”) process is completed.
This is a Sole Source Contract pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.

A RESOLUTION CALLING ON CONGRESS AND THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE
TO ENSURE CENSUS FUNDING, FAIRNESS, AND ACCURACY
WHEREAS, Census results determine the number of seats each state has in the House of
Representatives, are used to draw political districts at federal, state and local levels, and affect the
distribution of billions of dollars of federal funding annually to local communities for infrastructure and
vital services like hospitals and schools; and
WHEREAS, an inaccurate census will result in underrepresentation and fewer dollars for many of our
most vulnerable communities; and
WHEREAS, the perception of cyber-security risks; real cyber-security threats; the digital divide affecting
rural, low income, minority, and older households; a growing climate of fear among immigrants,
regardless of their legal status; and growing anti- government sentiment in some communities are known
factors that can depress response rates considerably; and
WHEREAS, the Constitution requires a count of all persons living in the U.S. on Census Day, regardless
of citizenship or legal status; and
WHEREAS, new Census Bureau research documenting the growing reluctance of immigrants to
participate in surveys and census tests will require expanded research and testing of effective messages
and communications avenues to overcome this significant barrier to an inclusive enumeration; and
WHEREAS, the recent U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) request to add a question about citizenship to
the 2020 Census threatens the Census Bureau’s ability to conduct an inclusive enumeration that
accurately reflects the diverse fabric of America; and
WHEREAS, the American people must have confidence that the Bureau’s leaders will uphold its core
principles of protecting confidentiality, sharing expertise, and conducting its work openly and fairly,
without regard to partisan interests, and be guided by a commitment to scientific objectivity and
excellence and research-based innovation; and
WHEREAS, in order to ensure a full, fair and accurate 2020 Census, there must be adequate funding;
qualified Census Bureau leadership; and no untested questions.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners that Congress and the Secretary of Commerce ought to ensure provide adequate funding
in the final FY 2018 omnibus appropriations bill, continue the tradition of strong, nonpartisan,
experienced leadership in the Census Bureau, and reject the DOJ’s request to add a citizenship question to
the 2020 Census; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution be delivered by the Cook
County Clerk to each member of the Illinois Congressional Delegation.
Approved and adopted this 7th of February 2018.
