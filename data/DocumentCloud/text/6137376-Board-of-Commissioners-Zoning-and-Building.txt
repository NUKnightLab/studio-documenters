MORATORIUM ON NEW HEARINGS FOR THE VARIANCES FOR CELLULAR
TOWERS TO BE LOCATED WITHIN RESIDENTIALLY ZONED DISTRICTS IN
UNINCOPORATED COOK COUNTY (PROPOSED RESOLUTION).
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Herbert T. Schumann and William R.
Moran, County Commissioners.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Resolution:
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
Whereas, the regulation and zoning control of Cellular Radio Facilities, commonly
referred to as Cellular Towers, in the unincorporated areas of Cook County was
adopted in 1995; and
Whereas, the Ordinance allows for permits to be issued for Cellular Towers in
residentially zoned districts where the height of the tower is limited to fifty feet, and,
however, where a variance in height to exceed the limit is permissible if granted by the
Cook County Zoning Board of Appeals; and
Whereas, the variances as to the height of these towers are not limited by the
Ordinance; and
Whereas, one result of the granting of the height variances has been an increase in
the number of applications for the location of Cellular Towers within residential districts
throughout unincorporated Cook County; and

Whereas, residents throughout unincorporated Cook County have made various
attempts to oppose the towers in their residential neighborhoods on the basis of the
inappropriateness and incompatibility as commercial structures placed within
residential areas, among other considerations; and
Whereas, the Zoning Board of Appeals has been placed in the untenable position of
having to adjudicate these variances by having to weigh between the business
purposes of the telecommunications industry and the peaceful well being of residential
neighborhoods; and
Whereas, the ongoing issuance of building permits and/or zoning relief under the
existing ordinance undermines the ability of Cook County to effectively regulate the
proliferation of Cellular Towers within residentially zoned districts throughout the
unincorporated areas of Cook County.
Now, therefore be it resolved as follows:
From the date of the adoption of this Resolution and until a complete review of the
pertinent Article(s) and Section(s} of Building and Zoning Ordinances of Cook County
has been completed, there shall be a moratorium on new hearings for the variances
for Cellular Towe rs to be located within residentially zoned districts at the Cook
County Zoning Board of Appeals.
The Commissioner of Building and Zoning shall take appropriate measures to inform
the Zoning Administrator and the Zoning Board of Appeals of this moratorium.
If, upon the expiration of six months from the date of adoption of this moratorium, the
review of the pertinent Articles and Sections of the Cook County Zoning Ordinance
has not been concluded, the moratorium hereby imposed shall be reviewed and the
County Board shall determine whether basis exists to extend the moratorium for a
further period of time.

*The above item was Deferred on 1-20-1999 and 1-29-1999 As Amended for
further review and recommendation from the State's Attorney's Office.

LEGISLATION REGARDING ANNEXATION AND THE FUTURE USE OF LAND
LOCATED WITHIN COOK COUNTY (PROPOSED RESOLUTION).
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by William R. Moran, Cook County
Commissioner:
WHEREAS, according to Illinois Statute (65 ILCS 5/7-1-47), when a municipality
annexes an area of land the territory is automatically zoned as the highest restrictive
zoning classification providing principally for residential use under the municipality's
zoning ordinance; and
WHEREAS, this land can be rezoned when it is annexed by the municipality and is
automatically changed if the municipality's zoning ordinance does not match the
County's current zoning classification for the property; and
WHEREAS, the current process of zoning does not consider the best use of the land
within the County as set by the County zoning classification; and
WHEREAS, the County puts forth a great deal of effort in order to set the zoning
classifications for county land, however once this land is annexed by a municipality the
County's zoning ordinance and classification is ignored; and
WHEREAS, the County zoning classification should be respected and considered by
the annexing municipality in deciding the possible use of the land; and WHEREAS, at
the very lease notification should be provided to a County when a portion of that
County's land is being annexed, and
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners urges the Illinois General Assembly to review the current legislation
regarding annexation and the future use of land located within Cook County taking
special care to include the issues mentioned in this Resolution .
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be sent to The
Honorable George H. Ryan, Governor and the honorable Members of the Illinois
General Assembly.
*The above item was Deferred on 11/6/2001.

*The next regularly scheduled meeting is presently set for Tuesday, April 23, 2002.
