Ms. Maxwell presented the 220 West Congress project for review and consideration. A
PowerPoint presentation provided renderings and maps. The developer, Graten Little, answered
questions about potential tenants, lease rates, project financing, construction contractors, green

Project Introduction
220 West Congress Detroit, LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) and owner of the
property for the Plan which entails one parcel, commonly known as 220 West Congress Street.
The developer intends to renovate the five-story building on the property to modernize the
36,500 total square feet of office and retail space. Constructed in the early 1900’s, the building
has been occupied by various professional offices and restaurants since the 1950’s and is
currently 96% vacant.
The final use will serve as mixed use space. The first-floor retail space will be completely
renovated with the intention of retaining the current Subway tenant, the building’s sole current
tenant. The second through fifth floors will be extensively renovated and will be marketed as
incubator-style office spaces. The Developer has received interest from potential tenants in tech
and creative industries and hopes to secure tenants who will help to activate the Congress
Street Corridor and the west side of Detroit’s Central Business District (CBD).
The Developer will restore and rehabilitate the building’s exterior, including a redesigned façade
and repurposed roof with a rooftop terrace. The building’s interior will be rehabilitated to include
energy efficient building materials and mechanics. Additionally, the Developer is working with
the City to invest in improvements to the adjoining, publicly owned alley to the west of the
building with the intention of activating the alley a public gathering and art space.
It is estimated that 40 temporary construction jobs will be created and 1 additional permanent
jobs by developer as well as 75 expected jobs to be created by prospective tenants. Total

 investment is expected to be approximately $6,898,000.00. The Developer is requesting

751 Griswold Brownfield Redevelopment Plan

presentation provided renderings and maps. The developer, Graten Little, answered questions
about project tenants, project design, construction costs, and project completion timing. Mr.
Vosburg answered questions about eligible activities timing.
Project Introduction
751 Griswold Detroit, LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the Plan which entails
the renovation of a four-story office building, constructed in 1924 under architect Albert Kahn
and sculptor Corrado Parducci. The renovation includes retail space on the first floor and office
space on the 2nd through 4th floors. The first-floor retail space will make use of both the
basement and mezzanine space. The redesign of the building incorporates essential
considerations specific to modern office spaces and “state of the art” telecommunications
technology systems. The rehabilitation of the Property includes the repair or replacement of all
of the deteriorated and/or damaged plaster, masonry, brick and stone. Particular attention is
being given to the preservation of the historic nature of the Property by ensuring that the
damaged decorative details will be replaced with material consistent with the current profile,
finish, and color.
It is estimated that 79 temporary construction jobs will be created and 2 permanent jobs are
expected to be created. Total investment is expected to be approximately $6,883,375.00. The
Developer is requesting $836,869.00 in TIF reimbursement for eligible activities under the
proposed Plan.
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of a single (1) parcel located at 751 Griswold
Street in Detroit’s Central Business District, bounded by West Lafayette Boulevard to the north,
Griswold Street to the east, the property line to the south and the property line to the west.
Basis of Eligibility
The property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because (a) the
property was previously utilized for a commercial purpose; (b) it is located within the City of
Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and (c) the Property is determined to
be a historic resource and functionally obsolete.

 Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
“eligible activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they included include demolition and
asbestos abatement, infrastructure improvements, site preparation, and development and
preparation of brownfield plan and/or work plan. The eligible activities and budgeted costs are
intended as part of the development of the Property and will be financed solely by the
Developer. The Authority is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and will incur no
debt.
Eligible activities commenced in October 2014 and completed in April 2017. The project is
requesting retroactive reimbursement on eligible activities due to an increase in budget and
timelines on the project as a result of numerus unforeseen circumstances. This included
identification of plaster behind the previous wall coverings (i.e. drywall, paneling), which was
determined to be asbestos containing. The asbestos containing materials were extensive and
required abatement throughout the entire building. Re-construction and stabilization of the
sidewalks surrounding the property, was required by the City of Detroit. During the start of
construction, the City determined the existing public sidewalks to be structurally unsound, which
required a full tear out and re-build of the infrastructure. In addition to the demolition and new
concrete that was required, this included re-engineering and construction of all the supports
under the sidewalk in the basement of the building, which extends under the public sidewalk
space. Relocation and replacement to existing utility lines were required as a result of the
construction on the sidewalk as well.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment
revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse the
cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan pursuant to
the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.
