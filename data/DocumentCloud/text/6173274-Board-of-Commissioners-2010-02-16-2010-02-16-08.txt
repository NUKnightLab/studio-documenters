EXPLANATION
The purpose of the Surveillance Cameras Initiative is to improve the CHA’s property
management capabilities by leveraging state of the art surveillance technologies for improved
investment protection and operational security at CHA’s residential developments. The CHA
entered into an agreement with Siemens Building Technologies, Inc. in December 2009 for this
initiative. The vendor is currently doing field survey work for the assessment and design stages
of the project.
An upgrade to our existing wide area network (WAN) is necessary to provide sufficient
bandwidth and integral infrastructure required to support the video surveillance project. To
deliver high quality real time video to the Office of Emergency Management and
Communications (OEMC) each CHA remote location’s infrastructure and electronic

 communications equipment must be upgraded. The WAN upgrade project is a critical
prerequisite to implementing a successful video surveillance solution. The video surveillance
and WAN projects are tightly coupled, and to ensure their success it is prudent to have the PBC
coordinate both implementations.
 
It is recommended that the Public Building Commission (PBC) serve in the capacity of Project
Management and Quality Control oversight for the CHA WAN Initiative. This initiative will
require a significant coordination effort across the telecommunication and camera vendors, the
CHA, and other city agencies, such as the City of Chicago’s Office of Emergency Management
and Communications (OEMC). The PBC project team brings a unique combination of
experiences in these areas based on their ability to leverage learning and synergies from similar
telecommunications and camera initiatives that are in progress across the City of Chicago.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA that the Board of Commissioners
authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to enter into an Intergovernmental
agreement (“IGA”) with the City of Chicago, acting through its Public Building Commission to
provide project management services for the wide area network telecommunication project for
CHA Administrative Offices and Traditional Housing Portfolios in a total amount not-to-exceed
$370,000.00 for a term of sixteen (16) months.
