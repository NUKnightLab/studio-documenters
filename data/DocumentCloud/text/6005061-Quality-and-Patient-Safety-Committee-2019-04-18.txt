Develop and administer post-match survey to be sent to all local
students that rotated here-to determine what factors led to
choosing another program over CCH.

Complete

Identify clinical areas of need (positions unfilled/positions not
filled with superior clinical faculty).

In Progress

Implement institutional exit interviews to include questions about
why graduate chooses to leave.

Complete

Annually review alignment of program's educational goals with
those of the institution and identify opportunities to improve
alignment.

In Progress

Develop a metric that measures success of retaining superior
members of a residency/fellowship class based on open positions.

 History of Medical Training in the U.S.
Learning By Doing (Service >Education)
• 1765 - 1st Med School
• 1876 - Association of American Medical Colleges

• 1910- Flexner Report
• 1920’s-Internship and Residency following Med School became standard
• 1965 – Medicare Established: payments to hospitals to subsidize resident education
• 1996 – Medicare Caps Residency Slots
• 1999 – To Err Is Human
• 2002 – ACGME institutes duty hour regulations (80 hours per week, 30 hour call, one day off per
week)
• 2014 – ACGME establishes the CLER Program
ACGME-Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education

 Moving Away From A Service-Based Residency Model
Generally Accepted Benefits of Residencies/Fellowships
• Still facilitate a cost effective model of 24/7 care of acutely ill patients
• Are associated with safer care and better outcomes1

• Help to attract attending physicians
• Provide valuable feedback that can improve hospital performance
• Improve physician hiring decisions (when familiar with graduate’s skills)
• Reduce recruiting costs
• Improve retention of newly hired attending physicians

 Final Deliverable
Retention of Superior Graduates
Recruit Outstanding Medical
Students

Train Them In High Quality
Residencies/Fellowships

Successfully Recruit and
Retain the Best to Stay at CCH

 Recruit Outstanding Medical Students
International Vs. American Medical Graduates?
There are not enough American Medical Graduates (AMGs) to Fill All of the Residency Slots in the US
(12,500 of 30,000 1st Year slots filled by IMGs)

• ~25% of All Residents and ~30% of Fellows in the US are International Medical Graduates (IMGs)
• IMGs pass boards at nearly the same rate as AMGs
• ~25% of all practicing physicians in the US are IMGs including1:
• 40% of Primary Care Physicians
• >50% of those practicing Geriatric Care
• 2/3 of all physicians practicing in Non-Urban Medically Underserved Areas
