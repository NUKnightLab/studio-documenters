Summary: The Bureau of Technology (BOT) is requesting approval to enter into a six-year contract,
agreement with Adapt Technology Services, LLC for the purpose of deploying a state-of-the-art
Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system to provide automated answering and routing services for
approximately four million callers per day, which involves seven big County agencies (Assessor,
Building and Zoning, County Clerk, Clerk of the Circuit Court, Health and Hospital Systems, Risk
Management, Sheriff, and Treasurer).
Currently, there are five (5) independent IVR systems utilize 408 ports and, from time-to-time,
experience system overload challenges resulting from high volumes at given peak seasons such as
elections and tax season. Current IVR systems are antiquated and require considerable effort on the part
of user departments to keep configurations current and constituencies informed, and they are disjointed,
fragmented, and inefficient to use and administer.
When the new IVR system is deployed and implemented successfully, the system will result in simplified
maintenance & support; greater degree of availability; successful handling of peach call volumes;
standardized customer experience across agencies; and reduced risk of equipment failure.

Agreement Number(s): N/A
Summary: Under this intergovernmental agreement, the Illinois Housing Development Authority
(IHDA) will operate a toll-free housing counseling helpline service and manage and administer housing
counseling services as a part of the Circuit Court’s Mortgage Foreclosure Mediation Program. IHDA’s
helpline provides critical information to families facing foreclosure, assigns families to a HUD-certified
housing counseling agency, and schedules housing counseling workshops and appointments for families.
Housing counseling services are provided county-wide by IHDA’s 12 HUD-certified subcontractors
which were selected after a rigorous application process. Services provided by the subcontractors include:
housing counseling workshops; one-on-one housing counseling with families; assistance with applying for
loan modifications; and identifying other options to avoid foreclosure whenever possible. As of 9/30/2013,
IHDA’s subcontractors assisted more than 130,000 families through the helpline, provided over 30,000
families with free one-on-one initial housing counseling sessions, and conducted more than 200 housing
counseling workshops throughout Cook County at which almost 6,000 families received assistance. Each
family receives an average of four, one-on-one counseling sessions.
The Illinois Housing Development Authority was originally selected to manage the program’s hotline
and counseling services with the initiation of the Mortgage Foreclosure Mediation Program in March
2010. A request for proposal (RFP) was completed for these services earlier this year; IHDA provided the
only proposal to the programs’ hotline and counseling services components.

Pursuant to clause 5 (b) of the court order, I, as the Transitional Administrator, have the responsibility to
oversee, supervise, and direct all management, administrative, financial, and contractual, personnel,
security, housing, custodial, purchasing, maintenance, technology, health services, mental health services,
food and laundry service, recreational, educational, and programmatic functions relating to the operation
of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC).
This extension is necessary because G4S Secure Solutions provide security services to ensure the safety
of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center residents and staff members. The JTDC continue to
experience unexpected terminations, resignations, and new eligibility requirements causing fluctuations
in the needs for the JTDC staff coverage. The expiration date of the current contract is 11/30/2013.

BOARD AGENDA

According to a letter of advice from the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office, this property should be
removed from Hyde Park Township in addition to its disconnection from the City of Chicago.

township. Pursuant to 60 ILCS 1/10-5(i), the Cook County Board is expressly authorized to alter the
boundaries of townships. Thornton Township, which adjoins the property, is the best choice to annex
this property.
It is recommended that, for tax year 2013, the following property be annexed into Thornton Township:
“That part lying South and West of the Little Calumet River in the South half of Section 35 Township 27
North Range 14 East of the Third Principal Meridian in Cook County, Illinois.”
