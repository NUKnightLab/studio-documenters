OPTION PERIODS REMAINING:

SCOPE OF SERVICES:

The Vendor will continue to provide the integrated, centralized library automation System, Library Solution
for Schools, including all selected enhancement products and related services. The library automation
software will continue to provide a searchable catalog of library collections and to automate administrative
tasks such as the circulation of library materials among patrons and the generation of library statistics and
reports. The integrated library automation system will include Web-based Online Public Access Catalog,
Cataloging and Authority Control, Circulation, Serials Controls, and Reporting capabilities. in addition to this
core functionality. the system will continue to support integrated searching of print and electronic resources
and the inclusion of vendor and third-party supplied content such as images of book jackets, book reviews,
reading level data, and author information. Should the Board desire to expand the functionality of the
system in the future, the system is capable of supporting Inter-Library Loan, Textbook Management,
Classroom Library Management, and Materials Booking. The Vendor will continue to provide
implementation services including project management and training services.

DELIVERABLES:

The Vendor will continue to provide the Library Solution for Schools Software Licenses, implementation and
project management services, installation and con?guration of servers, end-user training, data conversion
and enhancement services, help desk design and deployment, and software technical support, upgrades
and maintenance as required by the Board.

OUTCOMES:
The integrated library system will continue to result in:

Effective Materials integration: Teachers and librarians can use an integrated
library system for a multitude of purposes, from posting reading lists, bibliographies and path?nders online
to creating easy title searches by reading program. Furthermore, library professionals are freed from the
time consuming task of manually performing the circulation and cataloging functions of running a library.
This change enables them to spend more time working with students and collaborating with teachers.

Collection Development: Schools and the Board can use the system to identify collection gaps, determine
collection age, and understand resource usage trends, thereby driving better purchase decisions. In
addition, librarians can electronically share collection information with other librarians considering similar
purchases.

Library Automation: An integrated library system will provide benefits on two levels. First, all schools will
have a state-of-the-art. fully maintained system. Second, a centralized system will relieve librarians and
tech coordinators of the time-consuming administrative tasks associated with independent systems, such
as the purchasing of systems and servers, installing upgrades and backing-up data. Again, this is valuable
time that can now be spent with students.

Use of Online Resources: CPS libraries currently invest $300,000 of grant funds annually in online
subscription databases Thomas Gale, Britannica). An integrated library system will
increase the use of these databases, as they can be included in a variety of searches, thereby dramatically
expanding the quantity and quality of resources that students use.

Coordination of Library Technology with other technology in the school: The centralized system will
interface with other district-wide and school databases, such as the Board's student information system,
IMPACT. Furthermore, students and educators will be able to access the library from all school classrooms
with an intemet connection, transferming a basic computer into a virtual extension of the library.

51

September 24, 2014

Grant Applications and Implementation: Most library grant applications require detailed information
about library collections and trends. Furthermore, the ability to be accountable for speci?c goals is a major
driver of success in attaining grants. Without library automation, even basic questions such as "number of
books in coilection" or "percent increase in circulation" are nearly impossible to answer without a manual
count. A centralized system will allow both schools and district to instantly address these questions with
pre-deveIOped reports.

Coordination of school and public library resources and services: A centralized system is a
prerequisite for coordination among schools and with the public iibrary system, as it enables searching of all
schools' and, potentially, the Chicago Public Library's records. In addition, the system can be USed to loan
resources across the district.
