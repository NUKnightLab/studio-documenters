Re: McLagan and CEM Benchmarking
Trustee Cowan was not in support of the McLagan and CEM Benchmarking motion
because:
1. A Request for Proposal was not sent out for advertisement.
2. Other companies were not given the opportunity to submit a proposal.
3. I don’t feel that this is the appropriate time to have this done.
“My focus is to keep in mind, as a Trustee, the importance of fulfilling my fiduciary
responsibility to be prudent in utilizing the funds wisely and providing restoration to our
retirees pension check as soon as possible.”
