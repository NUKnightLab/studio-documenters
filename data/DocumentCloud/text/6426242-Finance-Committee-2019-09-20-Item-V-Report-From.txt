Observations on Financials
 Net Patient Service Revenues - $455M, 5% unfavorable to target due to increasing and unsustainable growth in
charity care, some lower clinical activity and lower revenue cycle activity

•

System-wide uninsured numbers
•

Captured by Visits, held at 44%

•

Captured by Charges, held at 40%

 CountyCare Capitation Revenues - $1.2B, 4% unfavorable to target due to lower than budgeted enrollment as a
result of lower State/County MCO enrollment
 Other Revenues - $3.8M , ongoing review of outstanding payments to ensure we get caught up by year end

 Cost of Pharma - $52, favorable by 4% compared to budget
