CHAIRMAN BELL:

Good afternoon.

I

2

want to thank all of you for showing up to be

3

part of this important process.

4

get started because obviously we have a lot to

5

do.

6

We're going to

I do want to thank the Metropolitan

7

Planning Council for allowing us to use their

8

space.

9

so everything that is provided pro bono we

As you know, we're on a tight budget and

10

really do appreciate, and we appreciate quite a

11

bit.

12

Jorge, although he can only be here

13

until 3:15, hasn't shown up yet, so I was going

14

to go out of order, but I'm not now because he's

15

not here, so we're going to go through the --

16

start from the beginning of the agenda and then

17

we will start on the infrastructure project as

18

soon as he gets here.

19

won't be joining us today.

20

John Pope is ill so he

So to order -- I've just done that.

21

We'll go through the first organizational matter

22

which is principally approving the minutes.

23

any questions, comments or changes to the

24

minutes for last meeting?

So

MR. HOFFMAN:

CHAIRMAN BELL:

MR. HOFFMAN:

So moved.

4

MS. FERGUSON:

Second.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

6
7

Okay.

10

Do I have a motion?

All right.

So passed.

Steve, you'll walk us through

the budget?

8
9

No.

MR. BEITLER:
is here today.
the budget.

11

Actually, Vivian Funches

She's going to take us through

She's joined by Lester McKeever.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Why don't you introduce

12

Lester and his firm because people might not

13

know that we have retained them?

14

MR. BEITLER:

Well, Washington and

15

McKeever is our accounting firm, and Lester

16

McKeever is obviously one of the named partners.

17

I presume that many people in the room know

18

him.

19

Vivian Funches is the accountant who

20

works with us to keep me on the straight and

21

narrow.

22
23
24

So, Vivian, if you would, please?
MS. FUNCHES:
a wireless mic?

The podium or am I using

I'm up against the pole here.

 4
1
2

MR. BEITLER:

Do you want to come up or

stay there?

3

MS. FUNCHES:

4

I can come up.

Good afternoon.

The first statement

5

that I'm going to go over is the statement of

6

financial position which shows current assets,

7

total assets of 261,786 which represents mostly

8

a receivable from the City of Chicago.

9

Our total liabilities are 261,786

10

which gives us total liability and net assets of

11

261,786.

12
13
14
15
16

Currently there's no fixed assets.
Do anybody have any questions about

the statement?
CHAIRMAN BELL:
revenue number?

What's the deferred

What does that mean?

MS. FUNCHES:

The deferred revenue

17

represents what has not been expended of the

18

grant receivable of 250,000.

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

20

MS. FUNCHES:

Okay.

Got it.

The next statement is the

21

statement of activities which represents budget

22

versus actual for the nine months ended

23

September the 30th.

24

The first column of actual shows

 5
1

that our total income is 304,982 with total

2

expenses of 304,982.

3

represents staff time as well as consultants

4

which compared to budget is 452,412 which shows

5

a variable budget of 147,430.

6
7

The bulk of the expenses

CHAIRMAN BELL:
is it time phased?

8

MS. FUNCHES:

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

Yes, it is.
So we're under spending

by 147,000 at this point?

11

MS. FUNCHES:

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

13

Now, the budget column,

Yes, we are.
Okay.

That's a good

thing.

14

MS. FUNCHES:

15

Yes, it is, favorable.

The total annual budget is 835,397

16

which leaves a remaining budget for 2013 of

17

382,985.

18

expenditures of 247,045 which it appears that

19

we would be coming in under our total budget

20

amount.

21
22

We are estimating our forth quarter

MR. HOFFMAN:
that.

I have a question about

I'm David Hoffman.

23

MS. FUCHES:

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.
It looks like the

 6
1

expected forth quarter expenses would be about

2

equivalent to what we've spent year to date or

3

close.

4

And I guess one line item I would

5

just ask for some detail on either from you or

6

from Steve is legal and professional fees.

7

looks like we've spent about 94,000 year to date

8

and are expecting to spend $95,000 in the

9

current quarter, and I was wondering if we can

10

get a breakdown summary of what those are for.

11

MS. FUNCHES:

It

Professional fees

12

represent web design, accounting fees, the

13

consultant that we did not bring on staff yet,

14

the web design, IT support.

15
16
17

CHAIRMAN BELL:

It sounds like the bulk

of them are legal fees then?
MS. FUNCHES:

No.

No.

Most of it is

18

the consultants that we had expected to hire

19

that we have not hired yet, plus accounting and

20

web design and IT support.

21

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I guess in the future

22

I'd like those broken out separate than legal.

23

Put the big hitters separately because I think

24

it's little easier.

 7
1

When I read that I immediately

2

thought there were legal fees, and my question

3

was going to be the same.

4

MS. FUNCHES:

5

That's a summary.

6

up under there.

7

It's actually a roll up.

I do have individual accounts

CHAIRMAN BELL:

It's just what the big

8

ticket items are is what we would like to

9

understand because that's what we want to be

10

sure we manage as we go forward.

11

MS. FUNCHES:

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay?

Yes.
David?

I agree.

I'm sorry.
I mean, I do

14

think that the forth quarter spending looks like

15

a very high level of spending compared to what

16

has been spent.

17

have a million dollar annual level spending

18

which may be justified, but I just think it

19

would be different than what we've seen

20

previously.

21

It's effectively on pace to

Just to break it down one bit

22

further, so $95,000 for the professional fees

23

for the quarter, what's the biggest item in that

24

$95,000?

 8
1
2

MS. FUNCHES:

Consultants,

non-employees.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

How much is that?

4

MS. FUNCHES:

I actually have that.

5

Give me one second.

I do have the details.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

Sure.

Take your time.

7

MS. FUNCHES:

So the non-employees

8

we're expecting to expend 100 grand.

9

sorry, we expect to spend 60 grand of that

10

No, I'm

95,000 for the first quarter.

11

CHAIRMAN BELL:

12

MS. FUNCHES:

For the forth quarter.

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

And how many people is

15

MS. FUNCHES:

Three.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

17

TREASURER NEELY:

18

ask for a point of clarification?

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

20

TREASURER NEELY:

14

21

For the forth quarter?.

that?

Sure.
I'm sorry, $60,000 is

for what?

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

23

TREASURER NEELY:

24

Mr. Chairman, can I

consultants?

Consultants.
Okay.

What type of

 9
1

MS. FUNCHES:

Working on the

2

Retrofit One project and the --

3

MR. BEITLER:

They're working on

4

various energy projects, particularly

5

Retrofit One.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

Steve, just to understand

7

this, I mean, I know that you've explained that

8

it has not been easy to have a flow of funds

9

that would allow you to hire, so what I'm

10

gathering here, and I want to see if I'm

11

understanding correctly, is that you, therefore,

12

draw people in as non-employee consultants

13

because you haven't been able to bring in

14

employees under a more regular basis, and the

15

three people that are being described being paid

16

a total of $60,000 for the forth quarter fit

17

within that category and you're using them as

18

you would employees?

19

MR. BEITLER:

Yes, that's correct.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

Is there any -- Can you

21

say just a little bit more?

22

this to us previously, but I think it would be

23

helpful to hear.

24

I think you've said

These three people are being paid on

 10
1

average $20,000 for the forth quarter each.

2

you describe a little bit what you're having

3

them do and what their -- what the scope of

4

their responsibilities are?

5

MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

Can

Actually you'll

6

meet Claire Tramm who is going to do part of the

7

Retrofit One presentation.

8

McKenzie consultant who also worked at Blue Star

9

Energy and on the Climate Action Plan here in

10

Chicago and who has been working diligently on

11

helping to define the Retrofit One project which

12

we'll go through.

13

Claire is a former

Then there's Greg Karczewski who is

14

working with us on underutilized property but

15

actually he's being paid through the WBC; Dick

16

Epstein who is here today who is also working

17

with us on energy projects and particularly on

18

CNG, Compressed Natural Gas, as well as doing

19

some work on retrofit; another person Matt

20

Schmidts who's not here today who has been doing

21

research for us as needed.

22

up things, he looks up things.

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

24

When we need to look

Well, that's great.

I

want to commend you because I think that it has

 11
1

been explained to us in terms of your and our

2

goals in trying to move this forward, you know,

3

broader than just retrofit, requires you to have

4

good people around you who are talented and

5

experienced.

6

collecting and doing a good job of having those

7

folks work for the Trust, but you haven't had

8

the certainty regarding funding to be able to

9

hire people is what I've heard you say.

10

It sounds like you've been

So I think it all makes a lot of

11

sense and I -- you know, we sat down with

12

Claire, and she's very impressive, and I think

13

you've done a really good job with that.

14

So I think this is good, and I would

15

just say for budgeting and accounting purposes

16

it would be useful and I think beneficial to you

17

and the staff to break that line item out of --

18

really you can call them non-employee

19

consultants or whatever you want, but they are

20

really the people that are allowing you and the

21

Trust staff to do their work when you have

22

limited capabilities to hire.

23

MR. BEITLER:

24

Okay.

This, of course,

is a high level view of the ledger so we have a

 12
1

significantly detailed ledger that Vivien

2

maintains that lists all the expenses --

3

MS. FUCHES:

4

MR. BEITLER:

5
6

In detail.
-- in detail by month, by

person or by activity.
MR. HOFFMAN:

We don't have that and

7

I'm not sure we need it.

If you want, you can

8

provide that or you can just break out this

9

additional line item.

That would be helpful.

10

So whatever way you want to go.

11

MR. BEITLER:

12
13
14

We'll be happy to break

out the line item on the summary view.
(Enter Mr. Ramirez.)
MR. HOFFMAN:

That would be good.

The

15

only other question I have, and then my

16

filibuster will end since we now have our other

17

member here, is on the other general and

18

administrative expenses it looks like we have

19

spent a thousand dollars year to date but are

20

planning to spend $50,000 in the quarter.

21

you just explain that one, please?

22

MS. FUNCHES:

Could

That's a catchall, so the

23

things that have not been identified because

24

things come up all the time, so things that we

 13
1

don't have a particular category for, we hope

2

not to have to touch that $50,000.

3

like a contingency.

4
5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

That's more

So we're going to under

run that.

6

MR. BEITLER:

Just to be clear, we're a

7

start-up organization so there are expenses that

8

we haven't necessarily anticipated that are

9

legitimate expenses, and we have created

10

categories as these expenses have come up and

11

taken the money out of miscellaneous and created

12

the category.

13

very, very small miscellaneous number going

14

forward.

It would be our goal to have a

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

17

(No response.)

19

Okay.

23
24

Why don't we jump right into

retrofit now that we have Jorge here?

21
22

Any other questions on

the budget presentation?

18

20

Thank you.

MR. BEITLER:

So there is a resolution

for -CHAIRMAN BELL:
come back to it.

I know that.

Let's

Let's use Jorge's time and get

 14
1

through the Infrastructure Trust.

2

MR. BEITLER:

Okay.

So as most people

3

in the room are aware, we issued an RFQ and an

4

RFP with two subsequent addenda.

5

who is sitting in the middle of the room with

6

PFM, was instrumental in enabling us to do this.

7

Thank you, Tom.

8
9

Tom Morsch,

And so we're doing this update today
with which we have a recommendation to the

10

Board.

11

project, renovations for Fleet and Facility

12

Management, renovations for CPS and renovations

13

for the Department of Water Management.

14

Now, there were three components of the

Basically the component that we will

15

be addressing today is the Fleet and Facility

16

Management component.

17

through the options that we looked at, and

18

essentially the best option for the Chicago

19

Public Schools was to do a project based on the

20

recommendations of the Trust and the City but

21

through the public schools, so I believe that we

22

accomplished the mission of the Trust but are

23

not recommending to the Board to approve a

24

particular transaction for the Chicago Public

Claire will take us

 15
1
2

Schools.
And for the Department of Water

3

Management, there are a number of eccentricities

4

about how structures exist in -- financial

5

structures should exist for the Department of

6

Water Management, so we're continuing to look at

7

that project to determine whether or not it

8

would be a good project for purposes of going

9

forward, but it is not, for today's purposes,

10

appropriate to recommend one way or the other to

11

the Board doing that particular project, so

12

we'll focus today on the Fleet and Facility

13

Management Project.

14

So we have picked a methodology

15

which again Claire will go through in a little

16

bit with my assistance, and we believe that that

17

methodology is a template for doing future

18

transactions for some of the things that you see

19

on the list there and have already begun to look

20

at some of these projects such as the street

21

light replacement program.

22

So we will be asking the Board today

23

to approve this transaction as they see fit to

24

do so and also to approve hiring an independent

 16
1

financial adviser to work on this particular

2

transaction.

3

Claire?

4

MS. TRAMM:

5
6

everyone.

Thank you, Steve.

Hi

I'm Claire Tramm.
I'll take you through a little bit

7

about the background of the RFQ and RFP process.

8

The RFQ process started last January and

9

resulted in a board resolution this August to

10

authorize a placement agent or RFP and

11

selection, so that's what we've have done.

12

August we issued that RFP.

In

13

We had 13 respondents at that time.

14

We then subsequently issued two addenda to that

15

RFP asking for greater information about the

16

particular structures that were being suggested

17

and the terms and the qualifications.

18

We narrowed it from then 11

19

respondents to that first addendum down to four

20

at the end of the second, and we will show you

21

later in the presentation some of the high level

22

responses from those four participants.

23
24

There were six different models
considered as a part of the Retrofit One deal

 17
1

evaluation.

2

Obligation Bond as well as Capital Lease and

3

Operating Lease.

4

First, the classic General

There were also three more unique

5

models to energy finance that we considered.

6

The first being a Grantor Trust Model, the

7

second an ESCO model.

8

heard of that.

9

World Energy Finance, it involves large company

10

guaranteeing the energy savings as part of the

11

deal.

12

Some of you may have

If you are familiar with the

And then finally the ESA model or

13

Energy Services Agreement Model.

This is very

14

unique.

15

energy savings but not to the end recipient and

16

the end building owner.

17

that's actually gained a lot of traction in the

18

industry in the last few years and has a number

19

of positive benefits, the credit and balance

20

sheet implications that these other five models

21

do not offer.

It also involves the guarantee of

So this is the one

22

So as we compare these six models

23

along their major axes here of both being off

24

credit and off balance sheet which is very

 18
1

advantageous to the City because it is off

2

credit.

3

bond rating is not effected.

4

perceived as a fixed long-term payment

5

obligation on the part of the City.

6

It means that our rating as a City, our
This is not

The Energy Service Agreement is

7

perceived as off credit and off balance sheet

8

because if you don't realize any savings as a

9

result of the upgrades installed in your

10

buildings, you pay nothing.

11

that savings, then you pay.

12

If you do realize

So it's a contingent payment

13

structure that's very advantageous for folks

14

that are interested in doing these kinds of

15

projects but without committing their own

16

capital and their own balance sheet and their

17

own credit to it.

18

So a little bit more about the ESA

19

model.

Another way to think about it really is

20

a PPA or Power Purchase Agreement for negawatt

21

or units of energy savings or sharing in that

22

expected energy savings, and it's similar to a

23

revenue bond or a utility bill in that again it

24

has variable payment obligations as services are

 19
1

actually rendered or as units of energy savings

2

are delivered.

3

It requires guarantee or reserve,

4

unlike a bond, just a UCC 9 fixture filing to

5

secure a contractor in case of default on the

6

proven savings.

7

that does need to be mitigated.

8
9

So that's the financial risk

And because the contractor in this
kind of a deal structure is responsible for

10

maximizing the savings, it's also responsible

11

for design, installation, monitoring and O & M

12

of all of those measures.

13

One of the best things about the

14

Energy Service Agreement Model is that under

15

this kind of arrangement the Trust actually gets

16

to keep the potential upside, not our investors

17

in the deal.

18

So what I've shown you here are four

19

different scenarios.

The first one on the left

20

is what the City is currently paying.

21

are just dummy numbers to give you a sense of

22

how an Energy Service Agreement takes place.

These is

23

So, for instance, the City is paying

24

$20 million right now on a given bill in a given

 20
1

building.

2

you look at the second bar, if the savings are

3

less than the amount that our ESCO Energy

4

Performance Guarantee partners have suggested

5

these savings should be, then they actually have

6

to meet that shortfall to investors themselves,

7

and the City pays again 20 million, no more than

8

it would otherwise be paying.

9

Under an Energy Service Agreement, if

In the third bar, ESA Scenario

10

No. 2, you'll see that in the case where

11

savings are equal to the ESCO guarantee, the

12

City again is paying no more than what it would

13

have been otherwise if they had never entered

14

into this kind of contract, and the utility

15

bills fall to the projected amount, and the City

16

pays the Trust which pays the investors for the

17

deal.

18

In the last scenario, you see the

19

upside scenario that I'm talking about.

20

the savings exceed the amount that the ESCOs

21

have projected that the energy savings measures

22

they're installing will create, in that case the

23

City pays even less on its utility bills.

24

So when

It pays the same amount to the Trust

 21
1

which then is passed to investors, and then the

2

remaining amount is paid to the Trust and is

3

available to be reinvested in City productive --

4

things that benefit the City.

5

TREASURER NEELY:

6

question.

7

fee?

8

structure?

I have a quick

Is this scenario net or gross of

Where is the fee component in this

9

MS. TRAMM:

We'll actually get to that

10

later.

11

under a variety of different --

12
13

This is just looking at the scenario

TREASURER NEELY:

built in just even in this scenario?

14

MS. TRAMM:

15

you're looking for?

Can you describe what fees

16

TREASURER NEELY:

17

MR. BEITLER:

18
19

Where is the fee

I don't know.

So there's transactions

fees.
MS. TRAMM:

So the transaction fees are

20

part and parcel of this.

21

the amount that is, you know, paid through the

22

Energy Savings Agreement.

23

TREASURER NEELY:

24

They are financed into

So again where is --

if you're saying the City will never pay more

 22
1

than the 20, where are the transaction fees in

2

that 20?

3

MS. TRAMM:

So the 6, the 8 and 8, the

4

City to Trust to investors, basically we're

5

looking at all of the fees that the investors

6

and others are charging being financed within

7

that amount, so that's it.

8

And we'll get to a more detailed

9

break out later in the presentation.

10

is not meant to answer that question.

11
12
13

MR. BEITLER:

When we do the initial

financing -- I'm sorry.
MR. SILVERS:

Isn't it the case that

14

it's built in the 8?

15

paying back (unintelligible).

16

MS. TRAMM:

17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24

This slide

Part of what the 8 is

Exactly.

Yes, it's all

part and parcel of the -MR. BELL:

You got to speak up so our

recorder can hear you.
MR. SILVERS:

Oh, I'm sorry, what I

said was -MR. BELL:

And give your name.

That

would be helpful.
MR. SILVERS:

I'm Damon Silvers.

I'm

 23
1

an Advisory Board Member.

2

What I was -- I'll just repeat what

3

I said which is that the underwriting fee is

4

rolled into the principal of the financing which

5

is then being paid back through the 8 number

6

that's on in the chart there.

7

least the underwriting fee, that's what that

8

would be.

9
10

So that's at

I suppose there are other fees.

TREASURER NEELY:

Yes.

MS. TRAMM:

So those are the

Yes.

11

total costs including both the principal and the

12

interest and all fees that are being paid back.

13

Okay.

So the other model that we've

14

taken a much closer look at is the Capital Lease

15

Model.

16

exempt fashion.

17

long-term payment obligation.

18

less deleterious on the City's balance sheet and

19

credit than traditional debtor bond.

This can be done in a taxable or tax

20

It creates, unlike the ESA, a
It is, however,

It has a lower coverage requirement,

21

lower security requirement, lower cost of

22

capital in some cases and so we have looked at

23

that.

24

as well.

They are advantageous for other reasons

 24
1

MR. BEITLER:

2

MS. TRAMM:

3

MR. BEITLER:

Claire, if I may.

Go ahead.
So basically the CPS is

4

looking at using a lease for their financing

5

mechanism and essentially, as Claire will

6

discuss with the ESA on this chart, because the

7

CPS was finished with their project, there was

8

no guarantor which is the third box from the

9

bottom, meaning the contractor that did the work

10

to provide a guarantee in order to enable the

11

CPS to use an ESA.

12

So had the work not been completed

13

at the CPS, we could have asked the contractors

14

to be guarantors and to use an ESA at the CPS

15

which would have been a highly appropriate

16

vehicle in our opinion to recommend to the Board

17

and to the City.

18

So the CPS is going forward with a

19

lease instrument based on the work that we did,

20

but because there is no guarantor available to

21

do an ESA at the CPS.

22
23
24

MS. TRAMM:

Thanks, Steve.

So turning back now to 2FM's
recommendation, we will be recommending an

 25
1

Energy Service Agreement be approved by the

2

Board today for deployment in 2FM.

3

As you can see, the Capital Lease

4

Model is on balance sheet and on credit which is

5

why we in this case suggest the Energy Service

6

Agreement Model.

7

an ESCO or savings guarantor in this case, and

8

the project has not yet been commenced.

9

merely been scoped by those potential savings

There is, as Steve mentioned,

It has

10

guarantors so it's an ideal model at this

11

juncture for 2FM to pursue.

12
13

MR. HOFFMAN:

Claire, can I ask you

some questions about that slide?

14

MS. TRAMM:

Absolutely.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

I notice that in the

16

boxes about off credit, off balance sheet you've

17

got this chart two slides back and it's got --

18

it's off credit, off balance sheets are the

19

rows.

20

couple of footnotes.

21

the footnotes.

Then for ESAs it says yes and there's a
I want to ask you about

22

MS. TRAMM:

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

24

Different Models.

On the previous chart?
It says Impact of

 26
1

MS. TRAMM:

Yes.

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

So it says an ESA is off

3

credit and then says particular ESA offerors,

4

for example, Hannon Armstrong and Piper Jaffray

5

have confirmed the off-credit treatment with

6

ratings agencies.

7

MS. TRAMM:

Yes.

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

So that sounds fine if

9

that confirmation is something that we can rest

10

assured upon, but I wanted to ask you about that

11

and get a little more detail since we just have

12

a footnote.

13

means, and I want to make sure we can feel

14

comfortable if that's one of the reasons you

15

recommend it, that it really is off credit.

16

I don't know exactly what that

MR. BEITLER:

Okay.

So to that

17

question, joining us today, and I'll put Michael

18

Dow on the spot, if that's okay, from McGuire

19

Woods who is working with Piper Jaffray who is

20

the firm that we're recommending for the deal,

21

and perhaps you care to explain historically the

22

treatment of ESAs.

23
24

MR. DOW:

I'm a bond lawyer from

McGuire Woods so I'm not a banker, but I have

 27
1

been involved in similar types of transaction

2

structures.

3

My understanding is rating agencies

4

have looked at an ESA structure, contingent

5

payment obligations such as this.

6

an operating expense, there's no incremental

7

cost to the end user of the asset.

8

completely based on savings so it's really a

9

negative cost that we're dealing with.

10

Because it's

It's

I think the rating agencies would

11

phrase it that there's no negative impact on the

12

end user's credit rating as a function of this

13

transaction structure.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

So that sounds good.

You

15

know, obviously the way rating agencies view the

16

world has changed.

17

understanding, I guess one question I would have

18

is has this been used elsewhere.

19

When you say your

Do we have other municipalities or

20

governmental units using ESAs so that we can say

21

oh, yeah, we had seen this example of where the

22

rating agency has treated it the way you say it

23

or is it all at this point hypothetical and

24

we're going first, and so we, you know, just

 28
1

need to base it on the understanding of how

2

rating agencies would likely treat this?

3

MR. DOW:

Right.

I can speak for my

4

own experience.

I have never had a rating

5

agency tell me directly this is off credit,

6

okay?

7

project participants that brought it to rating

8

agencies that say under this transaction

9

structure it will be treated as off credit.

I have through other bankers and other

10

Again, I'm not a banker, so that's not really my

11

function in the transaction.

12

This structure has been used in

13

other -- by other municipalities, other

14

governmental users.

15

the University of Maryland has used a number of

16

these structures, the same structure for various

17

energy improvements at its various institutions,

18

and my understanding is it hasn't been treated

19

as on credit for that.

20

For example, most recently

MR. HOFFMAN:

And if a rating agency

21

surprised you and said oh, we are going to treat

22

it on credit, would that change your view about

23

whether this was advisable?

24

MR. DOW:

Again I'm a lawyer, I can

 29
1

tell you wether or not it's a good structure.

2

MR. BEITLER:

You can hand the mic to

3

John if you want.

4

MR. DOW:

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

6

how much weight to put on this.

7

MR. COAN:

I can hand it to John.
I'm trying to figure out

Yeah.

The size of this

8

project is 25 and a half million, so not to be

9

flip but whether it's on credit or off credit,

10

that won't move the dial at all for the credit

11

perception of the City.

12

The intent here is to structure it

13

more like a project finance, right, so the

14

project has to be constructed where payments

15

won't begin and the project has to perform, and

16

that's how we keep it off credit is you think of

17

it more as a project finance rather than a

18

revenue credit or GO credit or something of a

19

municipal credit, and that's the whole intent

20

here.

21

I do want to mention that this will

22

be a 20-year financing.

We can't control what

23

the rating agencies do in 10 years or 15 years

24

or down the road.

So just keep that in mind.

I

 30
1

wouldn't want to say this is the sole reason for

2

doing the transaction because they will never

3

give you a written guarantee that they will

4

always view this a particular way for the life

5

of the financing.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

That makes sense.

I

7

think that's a good point about the size of

8

this, but as we think about an ESA as perhaps

9

the answer going forward, it sounds like we

10

should keep in mind that we won't know for

11

certain how rating agencies will treat this in

12

the distant future.

13

MR. COAN:

In the distant future.

Now,

14

again we've structured this as project finance.

15

You'll see all the protections in there.

16

will be payment of performance bonds.

17

guarantees.

18

that protect a lender, you know, that the

19

project actually is constructed on time and on

20

budget and performs as expected.

21
22

There

There's

You know, they are all the things

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's helpful.

So then the other aspect is off

23

balance sheet, and the footnote there says that

24

there's a pending FASB ruling expected next

 31
1

year.

2

treated as off balance sheet, but it is expected

3

that service agreements will continue to be

4

treated as off balance sheet.

5

It says may or may not continue to be

So since that looks like it has some

6

uncertainty in it, I thought I'd -- and that's

7

what allows the yes answer there in the box, I

8

thought I'd ask a followup about what that

9

means.

10

MS. TRAMM:

Should I take a first stab?

11

Also Michael is probably in a good position to

12

comment as well, I think.

13

MR. BEITLER:

I think one point to make

14

about that bullet point is that FASB has been

15

reviewing this particular thing for three years

16

and --

17

MS. TRAMM:

More than.

18

MR. BEITLER:

19

MS. TRAMM:

20

MR. BEITLER:

I'm sorry?

Over.
Over three years.

There

21

is an expectation that FASB will actually make a

22

ruling sometime the end of the year, beginning

23

of the year, although there's no official

24

statement from them that that will occur, so

 32
1

we're simply noting that FASB is looking at this

2

particular issue.

3

If you want to --

MS. TRAMM:

Yes, so FASB has been

4

considering this for a long time.

5

expectation is that given the sort of

6

preliminary findings that they've issued for

7

comment that the Capital Lease, the Operating

8

Lease stand a very good chance of being treated

9

going forward as being on the balance sheet.

10
11
12

MR. HOFFMAN:

Our

I'm only asking about the

ESAs.
MS. TRAMM:

Yeah.

So they've also

13

separated out now in the last several of years

14

and delineated what constitutes, very precisely

15

with accounting rules applied, what constitutes

16

an Energy Service Agreement and why that would

17

not be considered an Operating Lease.

18

And so we've taken great, great

19

pains in our contract for the Energy Service

20

Agreement to delineate what we're doing from

21

what an Operating Lease does.

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

I have a question.

We

23

haven't seen that contract, right?

In other

24

words, that's still in the process of being

 33
1

drafted.

2

page term sheet.

3

details about what the ESA contract will

4

actually look like; is that right?

5

I know we got late last night this one
We don't have any other

MR. BEITLER:

No, there is a series of

6

documents that we're actually having a drafting

7

session after this meeting.

8
9
10

MR. HOFFMAN:

I just mean in terms of

what we've received.
MR. BEITLER:

Yes, in terms of what

11

you received, you received the two page, one and

12

a half page term sheet which is a summary of

13

terms for what is contained in a much lengthier

14

document.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's being drafted now?

16

MR. BEITLER:

That's correct.

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

So when you say

18

yes on the off balance sheet, it's expected,

19

although, let me ask one last question, if the

20

FASB surprised you and came out and said, you

21

know, ESAs won't come as off balance sheet,

22

would that change the recommendation here?

23
24

MR. BEITLER:

It would change the

accounting treatment, but I don't think it would

 34
1

change the recommendation.

2

MR. COAN:

Steve, can I just make a

3

mention just so people understand

4

municipalities, they follow GASB, not FASB, and

5

while sometimes GASB does do what FASB does,

6

there's no guarantee, so just because FASB might

7

come out with a rule doesn't mean that

8

municipalities have to follow that rule.

9

operate under GASB rules.

10
11

MR. HOFFMAN:

They

Has GASB issued a rule or

statement?

12

MR. COAN:

Not to my knowledge.

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

So there's a level of

14

uncertainty, but there's a level of expectation

15

that it would proper to treat that way, is that

16

my understanding?

17

MR. COAN:

Right.

And we also can look

18

at FASB rules, so we'll look at the rules for

19

Operating Leases versus Capital Leases and

20

follow those.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

22

just assess the risk.

23

MR. COAN:

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

So all we can do here is

Yes.
And your assessment of

 35
1

the risk is that this would be -- that GASB or

2

somehow there would be an obligation on the City

3

or the Trust to treat it in a different fashion.

4

MR. COAN:

Yes.

Like I said, keep in

5

mind we're structuring this more as a project

6

finance, and that's usually not on the balance

7

sheet of the local entity.

8

own.

9
10

MR. HOFFMAN:

It stands on its

So you describe the risk

as low?

11

MR. COAN:

Yes.

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I guess, David, the

13

other thing I would say is you asked about how

14

would you look at this in terms of weight.

I

15

think it's nice to have off balance sheet.

I

16

think it's nice to have it not impacted by the

17

rating agencies, but I think the cost is a big

18

deal, and it's low for the transfer of risk and

19

the fact you get the upside.

20

I would weigh those heavier

21

personally, and I think the City would look at

22

it in the same way than these two, but I think

23

these two are nice to have.

24

a shot at getting them, we want to go after

As long as you have

 36
1

them.

2

If it ended up that you had to, I

3

still think the risk transfer and the fact that

4

you get the upside and the rates are low is

5

great.

6

MR. BEITLER:

Alderman Thomas?

7

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

Thank you.

This is a

8

question.

9

were on talking about the cause, how do we come

10

up with the two interest rates being the same?

11

The interest rates and fees are not going to

12

change?

13

I'm going back to the slide that you

MS. TRAMM:

Yeah, so the first thing I

14

would say is that the reason that the Capital

15

Lease and the ESA are projected to be about the

16

same in terms of range is that when you have the

17

savings guarantor also involved in this kind of

18

a contract, you're essentially taking two puzzle

19

pieces that are a perfect fit for one another,

20

linking them together, the Energy Service

21

Contract and the Energy Performance Guarantees.

22

You're putting those two puzzle

23

pieces together and together they look exactly

24

like a Capital Lease or, you know, a very normal

 37
1

financial product for the market.

2

So they don't have, you know, the

3

fluctuating cash flows that either one of those

4

two things have on their own.

5

look about the same.

6

That's why they

Steve, do you want to talk a little

7

bit about, you know, the rates and how we expect

8

them to change over time?

9

MR. BEITLER:

Well, these are

10

indicative rates so that's why we have a range.

11

We believe that our rate will come in on a final

12

basis somewhere --

13
14

TREASURER NEELY:

What is the price

level?

15

MR. BEITLER:

16

MR. COAN:

It's MMD plus --

The lenders will look at a

17

variety of factors to price their rate.

18

might be a function of a municipal index called

19

MMD.

20

might also be their perception of risk.

21

would be a whole variety.

22

formulaic.

23
24

One

It might also be their cost of funds.

It

So it

It won't be a simple

And just so people know, we solicit
a wide range of both traditional and

 38
1

nontraditional investors so we will have a

2

number of indicative rates to look at.

3
4

MR. BEITLER:

Did we answer your

question?

5

TREASURER NEELY:

6

MS. TRAMM:

Yes.

So here is a slide

7

expressing the somewhat complicated deal

8

structure behind this.

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

There are -Before you get into the

10

complicated deal structure, the last meeting we

11

heard a complicated deal structure.

12

clarify that's gone, we can effectively ignore

13

it?

14

MS. TRAMM:

15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24

I want to

Yes.
That is one they

considered.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Just a clarification

question actually.
MR. BEITLER:

Are you looking for a

response or are we just -MR. HOFFMAN:

You responded.

I didn't

want to interrupt.
MS. TRAMM:

So this is what the ESA

looks like in terms of financial flows.

You'll

 39
1

see the Chicago Infrastructure Trust at the

2

center as the project sponsor and owner.

3

City of Chicago is the main project host.

4

The

Up at the top of the page they are

5

making payments based on the energy savings.

6

Once energy savings are realized, they make

7

payments.

8

no payments.

9

If they are not realized, they make

Complementing that, as I mentioned

10

it's sort of like two puzzle pieces that

11

perfectly fit together, in addition to that

12

payment, energy savings payment stream, there's

13

also a guarantee coming from our ESCO partners,

14

Energy Service Companies, that actually do the

15

work.

16

guarantee that it will meet a certain level of

17

energy efficiency.

18

They guarantee that work and then they

Because that guarantee is not made

19

to the City, it's made to another entity, the

20

project host, the Trust, that is what really

21

lends this off credit and off balance sheet

22

service agreement treatment.

23
24

MR. HOFFMAN:
there?

Can I pause you right

 40
1

MS. TRAMM:

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

3

Yes.
It's tax exempt though,

right?

4

MS. TRAMM:

It is.

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

And is there -- I'm just

6

not enough of an expert to understand these, but

7

I want to try to understand them.

8

But what's a bit confusing is that

9

what you just said shows that the reason it's

10

off balance is because it's not a City entity,

11

that ultimately the guarantee is being made from

12

the ESCOs, it's being made to us as a

13

nongovernmental entity, yet the City is

14

receiving the benefit of tax exempt treatment as

15

if it's a City debt or obligation.

16

So can you explain that what I'm

17

perceiving, perhaps wrongly, but perceiving as

18

an inconsistency between those two things?

19

MS. TRAMM:

So if you look at the

20

Trust role on this side, we are acting as a tax

21

exempt issuer under home rule enactment on

22

behalf of -- Do you want to get into details?

23

We have experts.

24

MR. BEITLER:

We have a series of

 41
1

attorneys in the room who are all -- -

2
3

MS. TRAMM:

I'll give it to the

experts.

4

MR. BEITLER:

Who wants to --

5

MR. WALLACK:

You can give it to me.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

In the interest of time,

7

I think that all -- given what Steve just said,

8

if it's clear to the experts that we, as an

9

independent non-for-profit entity can still act

10

as an effectively tax exempt issuer then I think

11

that satisfies my question.

12

MR. WALLACK:

Yes.

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

14

MR. BEITLER:

That was Jerry Wallack.

15

MR. FALK:

Yes.

Thank you.

Remember, the reason

16

it's not inconsistent is because on the one hand

17

you're talking about an IRS ruling and on the

18

other hand you're talking about treatment for

19

accounting purposes.

20

So the IRS has already weighed in

21

with revenue rulings on comparable circumstances

22

that we're going to rely on and we feel pretty

23

good about for purposes of the tax exempt

24

conduit approach.

 42
1

MR. WALLACK:

The IRS allows the City

2

as a home rule unit to designate the Trust as an

3

on behalf of issuer for the City.

4
5
6

MR. HOFFMAN:

Even though we're a

nongovernmental entity?
MR. WALLACK:

Even though you're a

7

nongovernmental entity, and there are IRS

8

rulings to that effect.

9
10

MR. FALK:

Particularly because you're

a nongovernmental entity you wouldn't need it.

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you very much.

12

MR. BEITLER:

I would just like to say

13

that there was a great deal of thought given to

14

this by all the individuals in the room here

15

today, particularly the attorneys who are seated

16

here, and it was quite a thorough analysis.

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you.

MR. SILVERS:

Can we put the slide back

19

up with the transaction structure?

20

say first that my cursory look in comparison

21

with other transactions of this type that I've

22

seen that this is very well thought out and the

23

numbers are good.

24

MS. TRAMM:

Thank you.

Let me just

 43
1

MR. SILVERS:

But I do want to ask one

2

question because the import of what the

3

discussion has just occurred is about risk.

4

seems to me that the risk that is in this

5

transaction is the risk that the contractors,

6

Noresco, Ameresco and Schneider Electric, turn

7

out not to be able to honor the guarantee.

8

analysis do you have of them, of their credit?

9

MS. TRAMM:

It

What

That's a great question.

10

They've been doing this for decades now,

11

guaranteeing this.

12

actually had a phone call earlier today with an

13

external party that guarantees the energy

14

performance of deals like this.

15

And so it's interesting I

These folks are all so large that

16

they can guarantee them on their own.

17

been doing so successfully in many, many markets

18

for many years.

19

with a smaller name, they would have to go to

20

this external firm with whom I was speaking

21

earlier today to have that energy savings

22

guaranteed because they would not be a reliable

23

guarantor.

24

They've

There are -- If we were working

MR. BEITLER:

They have all gone

 44
1

through a qualification process with the City to

2

verify that they have the financial ability to

3

be able to participate in these projects;

4

however, I think to your question, if you're

5

asking --

6
7

MR. SILVERS:

I'm asking what is their

credit rating.

8

MR. BEITLER:

-- 15 years from today

9

will they have the wherewithal to stand up and

10

provide the guarantee, I think that basically

11

they are very, very large companies and we would

12

hope that they would.

13
14
15
16
17

CHAIRMAN BELL:
that.

You don't know.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, you can't answer
The point is --

There's a term that --

I'm sorry, James.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

I think the real

18

question is what do we have today to validate

19

their creditworthiness.

20

credit report, we could have whatever, but I

21

think we ought to get that basically.

22
23
24

MR. SILVERS:

So we could have a

That's exactly what I

was asking.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, Damon, let me ask

 45
1

you because I think that I'm interested in your

2

view about what is and is not a risk here, so

3

hearing you say that that may be the one risk, I

4

would like to have us focus on that.

5

So one way to draft for that seems

6

to me would be to -- I see they are going to --

7

the summary we have says they will provide

8

performance bonds, and a performance bond is

9

only worth something to your point if there's

10
11

some creditworthiness to the entity.
So we could check their credit

12

worthiness now, but there could be a condition

13

in the contract that requires the

14

creditworthiness to stay at a certain level, and

15

if they fall below a certain level then we would

16

be -- we and the City would be free to switch

17

ESCOs or what have you or act in whatever way

18

the City decides if their creditworthiness gets

19

too low which means the performance bonds might

20

not be worth much.

21

you have more experience on this.

22

It's really a question that

MR. BEITLER:

So if I may interject.

23

If I could ask George Marquisos with the Public

24

Building who actually has done quite a bit of

 46
1
2

work with the ESCOs.
MR. MARQUISOS:

Just to clarify one

3

thing, the performance bond is just performance

4

of the construction so it terminates once

5

everything is completely installed.

6

performance guarantee associated with the energy

7

guarantee.

8
9

There's no

The second thing is when we procure
these ESCOs through a very open, elaborate

10

process, we examine their financials.

11

of the reason that these three were selected is

12

because they had such stellar balance sheets.

13

We have all their financials.

14

Building Commission I should say has it, and we

15

are happy to forward that to you.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

And part

The Public

That's helpful.

That

17

seems very satisfying in terms of the present

18

condition.

19

would you do as the PBC if three years from now

20

or five years from now that changed?

21

I think the only question is what

First of all, would you have a

22

process for checking that?

What if it came to

23

your attention that one of the ESCOs credit

24

rating or balance sheets were now weak and you

 47
1

might not have approved them originally?

2

would you do?

3

MR. MARQUISOS:

What

I think those terms

4

have to be built into the contract, so I'm

5

pretty sure that the lawyers would have to

6

figure that out as part of the performance

7

guarantee contract that should they fail, there

8

are recourses that you would seek, but I can't

9

tell you --

10

CHAIRMAN BELL:

11

insurance or something.

12

something that we could consider.

13
14
15
16
17
18

MR. BEITLER:

I mean, that's

And there is an insurance

component to the entire transaction.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Insurance doesn't mean

anything if the company doesn't exist.
CHAIRMAN BELL:
why you get it.

MR. SILVERS:

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:
insurance.

Yeah, it does.

That's

It's a separate insurance.

19

21

Buy guarantor's

Third party insurance.
You get a third party

You don't get it from them.

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

So is that part of the --

23

MR. BEITLER:

Yes, insurance is a

24

component of the transaction.

 48
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

This says liability

2

insurance and builder's risk insurance.

3

the insurance that was just being described?

4

MR. SILVERS:

Is that

The nature of these

5

structures is that in order for the whole thing

6

to work, there has to be -- there's risk built

7

into this.

8

to lay it off on somebody.

9

If we're laying the risk off, we got

I don't see anything wrong with this

10

structure here, and these are very large firms,

11

and as long as we -- and if we have the credit

12

analysis done here, that's a good place to

13

start.

14

It strikes me that the obvious

15

thing, and I think our Chairman is pointing to

16

this, is that there would be some contractual

17

language as there is as you typically find in

18

any kind of credit arrangement, that if these

19

people's creditworthiness deteriorates that

20

they have to do certain things -- we have

21

certain rights and they have to do certain

22

things.

23

CHAIRMAN BELL:

24

MR. SILVERS:

Right.
I'll leave it to the --

 49
1

I wouldn't presume to tell the team of lawyers

2

here exactly how to draft that, but I think this

3

is commercially standard.

4

commercially standard terms.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

6

MS. TRAMM:

These are

Right.

Thank you.

Okay.

So we'll

7

just review this.

8

of the respondents to our RFP did come back and

9

propose either an Energy Service Agreement or a

10

This page speaks to how many

lease, quite a few.

11

And the ESA structure, as you can

12

see, has gained quite a lot of traction and

13

really was quite a popular recommendation for

14

this deal, so we're recommending it in this case

15

for 2FM.

16

We're also recommending that Piper

17

Jaffray be selected as our placement agent for

18

this deal.

19

cost, offer the most favorable terms and

20

conditions for the deal and really just all

21

around best value.

22

They were found to be both the least

On this chart you can see their

23

estimated interest rate but also their fees were

24

both the lowest compared to the other two

 50
1

respondents which did come back with an Energy

2

Service Agreement or lease proposals in the

3

final round.

4

Stephanie?

5

TREASURER NEELY:

I don't know if all

6

the participants in the structure have been

7

determined yet, but is there minority

8

participants in the structure?

9

MR. BEITLER:

We're in the process of

10

determining other participants for minority

11

participation.

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I think you should just

13

say we've had the discussion, we know we need to

14

and we're going to go figure it out.

15

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

17

know it.

18

partner --

19
20
21

It's required.

It's that simple.

They

We've told them that we have to have a

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

It's required by the

City Council.
MR. BEITLER:

We had one minority firm

22

respond that was a bond firm but that doesn't

23

participate in ESAs so we're working with Piper

24

Jaffray to determine a minority firm that would

 51
1

be appropriate for this particular transaction.

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

I have a question on that

3

slide.

4

tax exempt ESA, right?

5

side of the chart.

6

other placement agents.

7

percentage here is 3.84 because Piper put down

8

an interest rate of 3.75 percent.

9

to understand that number.

10

So what we're talking about here is a

MS. TRAMM:

So we're on the left

This compares Piper and two
And it says that total

I just want

It's not because they put

11

that down.

12

lowest estimated interest rate after canvassing

13

their contacts as well as if you look at the

14

fees only line, they were by far the lowest.

15

It's because they both had the

MR. HOFFMAN:

And can you give us a

16

comfort level that when Piper came back and said

17

we think a 3.75 percent interest rate is

18

realistic, even though that sounds like it was

19

the lowest interest rate that you heard from

20

other respondents, that that's realistic and not

21

someone who's just coming forward wanting the

22

business and putting down the lowest?

23
24

TREASURER NEELY:
change today?

And why wouldn't that

(Unintelligible).

 52
1

MR. BEITLER:

So it's an indicative

2

rate and when they price, it will probably be

3

different.

4
5

CHAIRMAN BELL:
showing the range.

6
7
8
9
10
11

That's why you're

MR. BEITLER:

That's why we're showing

a range.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

And we're going to cap

them at a range, and if they can't do that rate,
then they got to come back.
MR. BEITLER:

But this was the

12

indicative rate on the day we closed the RFP

13

which is the standard methodology for how this

14

work is done.

15

And we had many, many, many, many,

16

many, many, many, many, et cetera, et cetera

17

discussions because Piper had a much better rate

18

across the board than the other respondents, and

19

it caused a significant amount of research to

20

make sure that we felt comfortable that Piper

21

would be able to deliver the appropriate rate in

22

line with the indicative rate, and we believe

23

today that we have confidence that Piper will,

24

in fact, do that.

 53
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I think we need to be

2

clear with everyone.

3

mean, they only last for so long and they will

4

change.

5

certain, and that's why the range, and we only

6

can go by what happened at the time we bid in

7

comparison -- comparing people in that time

8

frame because we know next week they will

9

change.

10

Rates are perishable.

I

That's the only thing we know for

MR. BEITLER:

I would like to add that

11

despite this being a small deal, it's actually

12

in many respects a difficult transaction because

13

it's one transaction that's really composed of a

14

lot of smaller projects and not all of the

15

projects necessarily have the same return

16

profile, so some projects return one year and

17

some projects return in 30 years, and so when

18

you go out to the market with an overarching

19

project like this that has a number of smaller

20

projects that have different return profiles, it

21

makes it much more difficult to price the deal

22

and get it as close to the indicative price as

23

you would hope.

24

However, again I believe that Piper

 54
1

will provide an excellent service to the Trust

2

and that we can have confidence that they will

3

do a good job.

4

MS. FERGUSON:

5

further clarification on this.

6

to me is Respondent 1 and Piper in this chart

7

both are quoting on a 15-year term, right?

8

middle one, Respondent 2, has proposed a

9

different term of 20.8 years; is that right?

10

MR. BEITLER:

11

MS. FERGUSON:

Steve, maybe just
What's puzzling

The

Right.
But for the same term to

12

have a hundred point basis difference in the

13

interest rate is significant.

14

figure out what, either to Treasurer Neely's

15

question earlier, what it's being priced off of

16

or what are the components of that interest rate

17

quote that make us comfortable that it is

18

achievable and realistic.

19

basis points off the same term is a lot.

20

MR. COAN:

I'm trying to

I mean, a hundred

I'll just say in preparing

21

a response we solicited half a dozen lenders

22

who participate in energy savings contracts and

23

these were the indicative rates we received.

24

Just so you know, Piper, again away

 55
1

from the qualifications, and I apologize for

2

the commercial, we do about 120 private

3

placements a year so we have a large group of

4

financing institutions we deal with, and I

5

suspect some of the other firms don't have as

6

large a sales force or contacts with the lending

7

community.

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

9

MR. COAN:

Yes.

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

11

MR. COAN:

12

John, you are with Piper?

What do you do there?

Municipal finance, public

finance.

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

We haven't met you so

14

it's nice to meet you and welcome.

15

forward to working together.

16

And Michael is your lawyer?

17

client, Michael, is Piper?

18

MR. COAN:

19

Your

No, Michael Dow works for

McGuire Woods.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

I know.

21

for McGuire Woods.

22

Piper.

23

are here representing someone.

24

Looking

I know he works

And your client, Michael, is

Who are you coming to -- I assumed you

MR. DOW:

I was brought with -- Piper

 56
1

brought me, right.

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

3

Piper or you were brought here.

4

You're with Piper.

5

So you're representing
That's fine.

That's fine.

So your point, John, is that the

6

comfort level that we should have with the much

7

lower interest rate is based upon effectively

8

your size, experience and access to lenders who

9

are telling you this is realistic?

10

MR. COAN:

Correct.

11

MS. FERGUSON:

So what you're saying

12

is that your access to that lender pool on the

13

right is larger and more robust than

14

Respondent 1?

15

MR. COAN:

Right.

16

MS. FERGUSON:

And affords you the

17

opportunity to tap into more aggressive interest

18

rates?

19

MR. COAN:

20

MS. FERGUSON:

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

22

Correct.
Okay.
Have you guys done ESAs

before?

23

MR. COAN:

We have.

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

With governments?

 57
1

MR. COAN:

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

3
4

With governments.
Can you give us an

example?
MR. COAN:

School districts in Kansas

5

and California have used an ESA structure, and

6

then we're currently doing one for the Federal

7

Government.

8

using the ESA structure.

The USDOT headquarters building is

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you.

10

MR. BEITLER:

I think that when you

11

look at the range of respondents that we talked

12

to, there were different types of firms that

13

responded, and I think that the rates were often

14

indicative of the type of firm that was

15

responding.

16

So in some cases it might have been

17

an energy firm -- an energy investing firm that

18

has a reed like stricture.

19

might have been a bank.

20

responded, and I think that their rates were

21

basically indicative also of the type of firm

22

that they were.

23
24

MR. HOFFMAN:

In other cases it

Different firms

I have a question on a

slightly different topic but on this chart.

So

 58
1

we're listed as the owner?

2

MR. BEITLER:

Yes, that's correct.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

Can you explain a little

4

bit about what that means and how you analyze

5

what the potential down sides or risks would be

6

of the Trust being owner?

7

There's a preliminary question in

8

there as well which is what the projects are,

9

what we are the owner of.

I know that when 2FM

10

came before us months ago, they had identified

11

about a hundred different buildings ranging from

12

City Hall to libraries to police stations and so

13

on.

14

Will the contract specify the actual

15

projects and what's to be done or is there -- is

16

that to be determined later?

17

what are we going to --

18

MS. TRAMM:

In other words,

So one of the things that

19

qualifies an Energy Service Agreement as an ESA

20

versus an Operating Lease is that the owner has

21

to have, and this is to the last question, the

22

owner has to have the ability to, you know, with

23

appropriate notice enter the building, control

24

the operation of but also substitute the

 59
1

measures that are taken or add on or suggest

2

additional measures to reap additional energy

3

savings.

4

So in addition to the ones that have

5

been scoped, the actual owner of this project

6

can decide at any point in time to say well,

7

this doesn't really meet our energy -- cost

8

effectiveness criteria or these other things do.

9

That's part and parcel of it being off credit is

10

ceding some of that control over exactly what

11

gets installed to create those negawatts to the

12

owner.

13

In terms of the risks of having the

14

Trust be the owner, there's really two levels I

15

think we have to address that at.

16

security interest that the financiers gave.

17

if we think about the ownership structure as

18

both being having a right if something goes

19

wrong in the transaction to claim the underlying

20

assets, there is being granted to the end

21

lenders in this model a UCC fixture filing, you

22

know, personal property filing so this security

23

interest line here.

24

that.

One is the

It is not titled.

So

It is

That's what being passed to the lender in

 60
1

case of default by the City.

2

I think Michael Dow is probably in

3

the best position to talk about ownership

4

specifically.

5

MR. BEITLER:

I think the City and the

6

Trust are trying to strike the correct balance

7

in terms of, for example, having access to a

8

building.

9

running around in a building, but at the same

10

time in order to meet the requirements of the

11

agreement, there are certain stipulations that

12

have to be made.

13

I mean, you can't just have anybody

So as we work through the language

14

of the agreements, we're trying to figure out

15

the correct balance to accomplish the goals so

16

that we can have an off balance sheet, off

17

credit transaction and at the same time afford,

18

you know, common sense requirements for the City

19

of Chicago and its structures in buildings.

20

We're going through that process.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

It sounds like good

22

principles, but it sounds like what I'm hearing

23

you say is that the answer to the question is

24

it's still to be determined.

 61
1

MR. BEITLER:

Well, it's not to be

2

completely determined.

3

be determined, but there is also a standard

4

methodology as to how an ESA is structured to

5

facilitate the off balance sheet, off credit

6

facet of any ESA; and, therefore, the Trust is

7

the owner of these assets, and then if we could

8

go back to the slide that's got all the -- Yeah.

9

Thank you.

10

There are the details to

Then ownership at the end of the

11

term can automatically revert to the City

12

through Trust abandonment of the property or the

13

City would have a fair market value purchase

14

option which could theoretically be a dollar,

15

although if you want the transaction to be off

16

credit, off balance sheet then you can't

17

negotiate that it is a dollar today, you have to

18

wait until the conclusion of the transaction and

19

then decide whether or not the value of that

20

property is a dollar.

21

So not everything, if you want an

22

off balance sheet, off credit transaction, not

23

everything can be addressed down to this I would

24

say the gnat's ass, some things --

 62
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

To use the legal term.

2

MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, putting that point

4

aside, have the different City facilities that

5

will be encompassed by this ESA been decided?

6

What I heard you say --

7

MR. BEITLER:

There is a list of all of

8

the sub projects that are to be accomplished in

9

this process, and that list is being attached to

10

the ordinance as well as to the various

11

agreements.

12
13

MR. HOFFMAN:

So it will be part of the

contract?

14

MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

So part of the contract

16

will say here are the hundred or so facilities.

17

And then will it also describe the work that's

18

expected to be done?

19

MR. BEITLER:

Yes, that's correct.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.

So when the Trust is an

22

owner of that subject matter ESA, and whether

23

it's City Hall, whether it's the 15th District

24

Police Station or whatever it's going to be,

 63
1

what does that mean, and what are the potential

2

down sides as an owner of some government

3

building?

4

understand what that means to be the owner of

5

it.

6

I'm just not sure -- I'm trying to

MR. BEITLER:

It means that you have

7

taken possession of property and then are

8

basically providing the use of that property.

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

the owner of the project itself.

11
12

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:
it.

That's

Not the building.

13
14

I thought we were just

CHAIRMAN BELL:
the City to manage.

15

Which we fully expect

That's basically it.

MR. HOFFMAN:

So property owners, even

16

partial property owners have liabilities and

17

exposure to things.

18

we're really like a property owner here, but I'm

19

not sure I understand --

20

That can't be the case that

CHAIRMAN BELL:

We're not a property

21

owner.

22

are not a property owner.

23
24

We have a financial interest in, but we

MR. HOFFMAN:
question.

That's what's behind my

I'm trying to get an explanation when

 64
1

we use the word owner what that actually means

2

in terms of the contract.

3

MR. DOW:

It means you hold the asset.

4

You hold title to the asset.

5

owner of the asset, however, any risk associated

6

with that ownership can be off loaded on other

7

parties.

8
9

You're the tax

For instance, the City is going to
insure the asset.

The City is going to maintain

10

and operate the asset.

11

install the asset.

12

contractually with these other parties to the

13

transaction, but you sit in the middle as just

14

the holder of the asset, you borrow the debt;

15

and from a financing perspective, your only

16

obligation to the lender is to pay other

17

revenues that are produced by the asset.

18

The ESCO is going to

You've limited your risk

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's, of course, our

19

intent is that there is no risk ultimately to

20

the Trust of being "the owner" of this asset

21

because of the arrangements you just described

22

and really our only ongoing obligation --

23
24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

And let's be clear on

the definition of what asset we're talking about

 65
1

here.

I think that's what's causing some

2

confusion.

3

project, correct, not the structure.

4

be sure everybody is clear with that.

It's the assets that are part of the

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yeah.

6

going to be owning City Hall.

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

8

MR. BEITLER:

9

Sure.

I want to

We're not

Thank God.

No keys will be passed

out.

10

MR. MORSCH:

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

No, you're not.
But I'm trying to clarify

12

that what I think you're implying from your

13

point is that there's no -- ultimately there's

14

no meaningful risk or legal obligation to owning

15

this asset or this project?

16

question.

17

That's the

Is that correct?

MR. DOW:

The structure is such that

18

any risk of ownership is off loaded onto

19

creditworthy parties, not the Trust.

20
21

MR. HOFFMAN:

structure, you mean these agreements?

22

MR. DOW:

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

24

When you say the

These agreements, correct.
Claire, were you saying

that we could change the projects?

When you

 66
1

say -- your point about as the ESA requires the

2

entity that is the owner to decide, it can be

3

substitute something.

4

substitute, we want a different facility or we

5

now think that what has been decided about the

6

way to renovate this fire station is wrong and

7

it should be renovated this way?

8

explain what you meant by the change?

9

MS. TRAMM:

Does that mean

Can you

It means that in order to

10

be not classified as an Operating Lease, it must

11

benefit from the credit and balance sheet

12

treatment that we're looking for, there's

13

basically -- you have to meet one of two

14

accounting rules.

15

One is either having control over

16

the operation of assets, so we have put in our

17

contracts ways that, you know, with appropriate

18

notice the Trust and its actors on behalf of can

19

enter and say tweak or tune up a furnace that

20

was installed under this contract or replace a

21

light bulb that was installed under this

22

contract.

23
24

The second thing is actually -MR. BEITLER:

May I?

Just to be clear,

 67
1

that could be the City who is acting on behalf

2

of the Trust --

3

MS. TRAMM:

4

MR. BEITLER:

5

Right.
-- in this particular

scenario.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

Really?

Because I'm sure

7

no one here wants to be doing that work, but

8

again it seems a little circular because you're

9

saying to get it off balance sheet, off credit,

10

it has to be an non-city entity, and so you have

11

to have a contract that says the Trust can come

12

in and fix the furnace, but then the Trust can

13

say no, we're going to effectively have the City

14

do that.

15

MS. TRAMM:

Yes.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

There's two questions.

17

One, doesn't that then defeat the reasoning

18

behind allowing it to be off balance or off

19

credit; and, second, I just want to make sure

20

that, you know, we're not -- the Trust is not in

21

a position to be sued when the furnace -- if the

22

furnace blows up, that as someone looks at the

23

contract and says well, look, the Trust had some

24

responsibility to maintain and didn't fulfill

 68
1
2

its responsibility.
MR. FALK:

David, it's Scott Falk.

3

your first point, the off balance sheet

4

treatment is an incredibly arcane technical

5

accounting issue.

6

by and large.

On

It is not a substantive issue

7

So there are certain hoops that you

8

have to jump through in order to get it treated

9

properly, but the fact that the actual technical

10

accounting owner can subcontract out the work on

11

the asset is not at all unusual and not

12

inconsistent with the concept behind the off

13

balance sheet treatment of the asset.

14

So I just don't -- I don't want to

15

conflate the issues of actual ownership with

16

accounting ownership because there is a

17

meaningful difference.

18

that are set up to be bankruptcy remote from the

19

principal owner of the asset that are set up

20

that way for off balance sheet treatment, but,

21

in fact, they have joint management, joint

22

decision makers who control both entities.

23

There's a lot of linkage of the two.

24

looks like it's all one in the same.

There are a lot of SPEs

It kind of

 69
1

But if you meet the technical

2

requirements for off balance sheet treatment as

3

an accounting matter then you've achieved your

4

objective.

5
6
7

MR. HOFFMAN:

How about the liability

point?
MR. FALK:

Well, best of luck to

8

anybody that wants to come after the Trust given

9

the balance sheet they just showed you.

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

11

MR. FALK:

Stand away.

But we're obviously going to

12

have appropriate indemnities.

13

MR. BEITLER:

Was the second answer

14

satisfactory?

15

indemnities aspect of it.

16

Stand away.

After the best of luck, the

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yeah.

I mean, I think

17

that it's one reason why I believe that the way

18

that contracts are drafted is important.

19

mean, what we've been given late last night is I

20

know a short summary of things so I think that

21

some of this depends on how the terms and

22

conditions come out.

23
24

MR. BEITLER:

I

If you would care to see

the contracts as they exist, we would be happy

 70
1
2

to forward them all to you.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Sure.

I think that part

3

of what makes sense to me is that once you've

4

gotten through a definition of the terms and

5

conditions of this, and I think that's set out

6

in the timeline, that, you know, we should be

7

hearing from you about those documents.

8
9

This is all happening last minute
and quickly, and I'm think that that's fine to

10

move forward with a good pace given how recently

11

this concept has been brought to us, but I think

12

some of these questions are going to ultimately

13

be answered by the details of the document.

14

MR. BEITLER:

Okay.

15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

16

MS. TRAMM:

Okay.

Okay.

I know you had one

17

other question.

18

second accounting rule that it could meet which

19

is other measures can be suggested or installed

20

at any point in time.

21

accounting rules that distinguish an ESA from an

22

Operating Lease.

23
24

We didn't really talk about the

So those are the two

So let's on that topic move forward
to the schedule, and it is our intention to

 71
1

close by the end of the year on this

2

transaction, if the Board approves it.

3

So given that, we are trying to meet

4

all of these listed dates for bringing forth

5

both the bid sheet, the draft ordinances,

6

bringing this to the City Council and Finance

7

Committee Chairman briefings and City's Finance

8

Committee, meaning before bringing it to a

9

Council vote on December 11th.

10

So it is -- it's been our intention

11

all along to spend the bulk of our time

12

reviewing these transactions during the RFP time

13

in August and September, which were the slides

14

we opened with, and then at this point to just

15

move as quickly as possible hashing out the

16

final details.

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

To be clear, the RFP was

18

to select a placement agent and as a result of

19

that we were lead over the last couple of months

20

to this ESA structure, right?

21

MS. TRAMM:

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.
But we don't have -- when

23

you say to approve the transaction, the only

24

thing we have in front of us about the

 72
1

transaction that has any details in it is the

2

document we received at midnight last night

3

that's the summary of the terms, right?

4

And, look, this is not criticism.

I

5

think that I am pleased with the presentation of

6

the ESA structure.

7

all the work that's been done makes a lot of

8

sense.

9

general outlines of the structure so don't take

10

I think the presentation and

I have a real comfort level with the

that as a criticism.

11

But when I'm looking at the

12

schedule, you know, we haven't seen any of the

13

details yet.

14

summary.

15

being put together, and it sounds like, and from

16

what, Steve, you told me otherwise, you expect

17

those details to be ready for review perhaps

18

fairly quickly, perhaps next week.

19

We're being presented with the

It sounds like the details are quickly

But if you are -- if the bid sheets

20

are due a week from today, meaning that you're

21

expecting financing entities to bid on this a

22

week from today, you are presumably sending them

23

something prior to that, right?

24

think that document is ready to sent out, nor

And I don't

 73
1
2

have we seen it.
So I do think that -- I'm looking

3

for some clarification about when things are

4

going to be sent out to Piper Jaffray.

5

MR. BEITLER:

Piper Jaffray has already

6

sent out a request for quotes from potential

7

investors, and we gave those investors, Piper

8

did, several weeks, and so that particular

9

response is due the 13th of November, so we have

10

been trying to move different events in parallel

11

with each other in order to reach a close by the

12

end of the year.

13

Basically though nothing has been

14

done at this point that would in any way

15

presuppose a decision one way or the other, not

16

only by the Board, but also by the City Council.

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

So when you say the

18

request for quotes has been sent out by Piper

19

Jaffray, does that -- I would assume that for

20

any bank or financing entity to bid on it, they

21

would have to see what all the terms and

22

conditions are.

23

whatever that document is --

24

So does the request for quotes,

MR. BEITLER:

Basically the summary of

 74
1

terms you received is a reflection in a shorter

2

way of the term -- the summary of terms that

3

Piper Jaffray forwarded out.

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

So isn't that document,

5

the request for quotes, the document that we

6

need to see to define what people are bidding

7

on?

8
9

MR. BEITLER:

seen that on a summarized basis.

10
11

Well, basically you have

MR. HOFFMAN:

You mean the thing we got

at midnight last that?

12

MR. BEITLER:

Yes, correct.

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

If this was just

14

reflecting a document that had previously been

15

sent out --

16

MR. BEITLER:

Well, more or less the

17

terms that are in that summary of terms are

18

reflected on the chart that is in this

19

presentation which everybody had seen

20

previously, so it's a function of if you wanted

21

more detail, we're happy to provide it.

22

is --

23
24

MR. HOFFMAN:

This

Well, Steve, to be clear,

I have said and others have said, including at

 75
1

the last Board meeting three months ago, that in

2

order to approve this transaction I believe we

3

were going to need to see the details of what

4

the transaction was.

5

This chart comparing Capital Lease

6

to ESAs doesn't provide the details of what the

7

transaction is.

8

midnight last night gets closer.

9

paragraphs, a few sentences about what summary

10

of the terms would be, and I think it's all a

11

step in the right direction.

12

This document we got at
There's a few

But I'm now hearing for the very

13

first time that a request for quotes that

14

effectively has the terms and conditions was

15

already sent out apparently to the marketplace

16

and respondents to bid on and they're expected

17

to bid it by next week.

18

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Let me try to help.

I

19

think they have to get out -- they have to find

20

out what the deal is going to be before we can

21

approve it.

22

some criteria that is consistent with what we've

23

said the whole time, and that is we got to

24

transfer the risk, we got to have favorable

I mean, they basically have set out

 76
1

rates, we have to protect the City and the

2

citizens, we have to -- so that's within sort of

3

the sheet they sent out to get financing.

4

Now, what's that going to result

5

into is a document that has to come back to us

6

to review in detail.

7

that we approve and that the City would want to

8

go forward with.

9

That would be the detail

Is that what you're planning on

10

doing in the November 13th through 20 time

11

frame?

12

MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

That's what that date

14

is.

Because you are going to see the detailed

15

document once they know what it is, but they

16

have to get out with the lenders and find out

17

what the market would bear so they can

18

incorporate that into the final document.

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

And that will be the

20

first time when we see the detailed terms and

21

conditions of this proposed transaction.

22
23
24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

You'll see all of

them.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Correct.

 77
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Including the

2

provisions that are in it that are consistent

3

with the ESA structure, which is a lot of it.

4
5

MR. HOFFMAN:

And if we decide not to

approve the transaction --

6

CHAIRMAN BELL:

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

Then we don't do it.

Right.

So people will

8

have to bid on it and the bid would be rejected

9

because of the terms and conditions.

10

You know, from the beginning we've

11

talked -- Let me make a process point.

12

the first time we're doing one of these, and I

13

don't believe this is the right way to do this

14

going forward.

15

This is

I object to this process.

From I think experience of these

16

deals, if we're going to be the authorizing body

17

here, we need to be shown what the proposed

18

terms and conditions are going to be with an

19

understanding of the costs and benefits of it

20

before it's sent out to the marketplace.

21

That shouldn't slow things down.

22

It's just a question of doing the work and then

23

bringing it before the authorizing body in

24

advance, otherwise you're wrapping something up

 78
1

with a bow and saying here, we want you to hurry

2

to approve it.

3

I don't think that's the right

4

process for these.

5

be a surprise to anybody.

6

something we've talked about for a year in terms

7

of what the process should be.

8

MR. BEITLER:

9

And, you know, it shouldn't
This has been

I think though the

marketplace actually sets the terms and

10

conditions of the deal, and so essentially if

11

you want to have the terms and conditions

12

brought forward to you, in essence, I can

13

hypothesize or anybody in the room can

14

hypothesize about what the terms and conditions

15

are, but the marketplace essentially sets what

16

the terms and conditions are, so you're

17

describing to some degree a chicken and the egg

18

conundrum.

19

Basically there is an established

20

methodology as to how the financial community

21

works in terms of doing these types of

22

activities, and you're in some sense asking to

23

change that establishment.

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

No.

No.

I understand

 79
1

your point.

2

extent that request for quotes or a bid document

3

is sent out that say hey, you bidder, have the

4

discretion about defining these terms that that

5

would change your price term or change your

6

willingness to do the deal.

7

Let me clarify.

Obviously to the

Of course then those are variable

8

terms and we can't know those variable terms

9

until they come in obviously.

10

So those you

can't see until the bid comes in.

11

But when you send out a document,

12

it's going to include certain set terms that are

13

part of what the City and the Trust are asking

14

these bidders to bid on, and that document,

15

which is sometimes an RFP or sometimes a term

16

sheet, lays out the terms we want you to use

17

within the definition of your bid.

18

So those aren't variable terms.

You

19

can't have the entity come back and change that

20

when you're asking them to bid it on.

21

set terms.

22

Those are

That's the document that I'm --

MR. BEITLER:

So then basically that's

23

my fault.

Essentially I could have given you

24

the term sheet that we sent out through Piper

 80
1

Jaffray approximately, I don't know, ten days

2

ago, perhaps seven days ago.

3

the exact timing.

4

have given you that particular term sheet

5

earlier.

6

particular term sheet because --

7
8
9
10

I don't remember

But that's my fault.

I could

I didn't realize that you wanted that

MR. HOFFMAN:

I don't know how I need

to be more clear.
MR. BEITLER:

I thought it was more --

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Well, wait a minute.

I

11

think we might be talking past each other.

12

think the term sheet that they had is consistent

13

with what the original RFP -- the RFP we sent

14

out, those same things we approved.

15

I mean, they're just being

16

reformatted for sending to this particular

17

market now that we moved from what we were

18

looking at before to ESA.

19
20
21

I

MR. HOFFMAN:

Do you mean the thing

back in the spring?
CHAIRMAN BELL:

Day one.

Day one.

22

When we set out the things in terms of terms and

23

conditions, we wanted low cost, we wanted

24

transfer of the risk, we wanted to make sure

 81
1
2

property wasn't transferred.
I mean, essentially it's those

3

things that -- the same Ts and Cs that this

4

current document has.

5

format wise.

6
7

They've just evolved

You want to add to that?

MR. FALK:

Thank you, James.

David, I want to make a corporate

8

governance point because I think David is sort

9

of questioning what approval is being requested

10

of the Board and whether they're competent to

11

make that approval.

12

I think it's important to

13

bifurcate the role between the narrow financial

14

terms that they're getting responses on on

15

November 13th and then the legal terms of the

16

documentation.

17

It was our collective judgment, the

18

advisors and the management team, you know,

19

because I think it's unconventional, that we

20

would not present to the Board the detailed

21

legal provisions of all the contracts.

22

There are at least four separate

23

contracts that are going to make up the package

24

of deal terms that allocate risk and obligate

 82
1

different parties and create rights for parties

2

as between the City, the Trust, the financing

3

parties and the ESCOs.

4

So it was our expectation that what

5

you needed to know as a corporate governance

6

matter was what are the financial parameters

7

that are going to expose the Trust financially,

8

and so that's why the term sheet and the range

9

that is set forth in the draft resolution that

10

are in the Board book identify what we're asking

11

for which is flexibility to price this up to

12

whatever it is, four and a half percent, 4.75,

13

whatever the number is in the Board resolutions,

14

and then if we're within that range, the Board

15

would, in fact, approve going forward on those

16

terms.

17

Understanding that on the legal

18

documentation, the relative rights and

19

responsibilities would be consistent with

20

exactly what James just described, which is the

21

historic term sheets that all the RFPs

22

reflected.

23

Now, if the Board really wants to

24

look at all the legal documents, which we had

 83
1

not anticipated, we can certainly send those

2

out.

3

corporate or nonprofit sector, we wouldn't

4

normally expect the Board to get into those

5

weeds, but if you want it, absolutely, you're

6

entitled to it.

Typically that wouldn't -- whether in the

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, let me just say,

8

when we say the historic term sheets, the term

9

sheets that were issued earlier looked nothing

10

like the ESA presentation that we're getting

11

today.

12

The presentation we got last week

13

from Kutak Rock that described what the terms

14

and conditions would be of a different structure

15

doesn't bear a resemblance to this.

16

a critique.

17

this new structure.

18

That's not

I think it's good that we've got

But let's be clear.

It's a new

19

structure.

20

relate to it are going to be different.

21

we got until midnight last night was this chart

22

that's up here that provides --

23
24

So the terms and condition that

MR. FALK:

And all

I'm sorry to interrupt you.

The RFP that went out on the ESA structure alone

 84
1

I think as Addendum No. 1 or Addendum No. 2,

2

that is exactly what's going to be in the ESA.

3

That was posted on the website and it was sent

4

to the Board.

5

terms.

6

for --

7

So that does contain the legal

It's consistent.

MR. HOFFMAN:

I mean, I can tell you

So that's not an answer

8

that I've heard from either meetings with Steve

9

or otherwise.

So that document is the terms and

10

conditions that the public can scrutinize and we

11

can scrutinize to figure out risk?

12
13

MR. FALK:

Yes.

To be clear, we're

going to have inches of paper.

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

Much more detail.

But that's an important

16

point you're making, Scott, which I haven't

17

heard before which is that when we are asked to

18

authorize something that's consistent with the

19

terms and conditions, it's consistent with what

20

is in that addendum to the RFP?

21

MR. FALK:

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

23
24

Yes.
Okay.

Is that in the

Board book?
MR. FALK:

Not this Board book, but it

 85
1

was in --

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

It wasn't because it was

3

since the last Board meeting.

4

MR. FALK:

5

think it was emailed around.

6

It was on the website and I

MR. HOFFMAN:

You're right.

Okay.

So

7

you're asking us to approve something that's

8

consistent with that specific document, that RFP

9

addendum in August or September?

10

MR. BEITLER:

11

MR. FALK:

Well, I mean --

The resolution asks you

12

approve on the basis -- on the terms consistent

13

with both the term sheet that was emailed out

14

last night and the presentation made today.

15

There's some elements of the

16

documentation that are in this slide book, but

17

they are all consistent with the RFP addendum.

18

MR. HOFFMAN:

It makes it very hard I

19

think to -- you know, last time we got an email

20

very late at night the night before the Board

21

meeting with information about the structure

22

last time, and this time we got this one page

23

term sheet, you know, at midnight last night,

24

and, you know, it's hard to -- with a new

 86
1

resolution, it's hard to ask us to do a decent

2

job of assessing costs and benefits and risks

3

when so much information is coming in at the

4

last minute which is what the last two Board

5

meetings have been.

6

So I think -- you know, look, I

7

would feel very differently about this if this

8

wasn't a new structure the first time we're

9

doing one of these and so on.

10

I think this is

going to get smoother as we go forward.

11

CHAIRMAN BELL:

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

So I've suggested -- I

13

mean, James, however you want to proceed, but I

14

still feel the same way that I did earlier in

15

terms of I think the -- I don't have any

16

objection to the schedule, but I do think that

17

the November 13th through 20th CIT board

18

decision, if necessary, should be part of the

19

structure in that you should come back to us

20

with a discussion that's going to include a

21

discussion of what the actual terms and

22

conditions are of the governing documents and

23

then, of course, the -- you know, whatever

24

terms, price terms are coming back from the

 87
1

recommended deals.

2

TREASURER NEELY:

Just to add to that,

3

according to Alderman Thomas the minority

4

participation has to be figured out, as you

5

said, Chairman, before it goes to the City

6

Council.

7

and 20th?

Will that be decided between the 13th

8

CHAIRMAN BELL:

9

MR. BEITLER:

What's the schedule?

We're working on the

10

minority participation now and everything has to

11

be in the ordinance as well, so basically that

12

will all be cited at that point.

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So it's either got to

14

be wrapped together or it's going to move, the

15

timetable is going to move.

16

It's that simple.

I don't think there's any doubt in

17

anybody's mind now that -- and, by the way,

18

there was doubt as to all that needs to be done

19

up until last week and so late breaking news,

20

minority participation was one of those issues.

21

We sent out the RFP initially and no minority

22

firms responded so --

23

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

One.

And, of course, they

 88
1

weren't selected so now we have to go back and

2

figure out how to carve out a role.

3

breaking news.

4

together.

5

Late

So we're trying to get all of it

David, I'm sorry, I thought you

6

realized that we were still operating under the

7

same principles in the attachment to the RFP in

8

terms of what they have been authorized to

9

negotiate, and even though we move from

10

instrument to instrument or structure to

11

structure, those haven't changed.

12

we want out of the deal.

13

That's what

So we need to figure out how to

14

pull all that together in that November time

15

frame or the timetable moves.

16

commitment.

17
18

Okay.

So that's the

Can you tell us anything more

about this?

19

MS. TRAMM:

Bring it on, yeah.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So I think we need to

21

make sure we have the wording and the resolution

22

consistent with what we've just said here to

23

make sure we include that we're going to have --

24

we clearly want to come back and review in

 89
1

detail the finals Ts and Cs and the final result

2

of what the market is giving us back before we

3

actually approve this thing.

4

And we have to have the other

5

components that talk to the minority

6

participation so we can have a complete package.

7

And we're going to shoot for that sometime in

8

the week of November 13th through 20th.

9
10

David, could you help us with the
resolution?

11

I think you've made some notes.

MR. HOFFMAN:

Sure.

I think consistent

12

with what you just said, James, I have some --

13

I'll make a motion to edit the language of the

14

resolution I think in the most minimal fashion

15

to state that point.

16

So in the first resolution paragraph

17

now therefore be it resolved that Trust is

18

hereby authorized, I would add at the end of the

19

paragraph after the word therewith "if so

20

approved in the future by the Trust and the

21

City."

22

In the -- two paragraphs further,

23

the paragraph that says further resolved that

24

the Executive Director of the Trust be in hereby

 90
1

is authorized to approve the energy performance

2

contracts, I would change the word approved to

3

develop the energy performance contracts.

4

It goes onto say consistent with

5

those described herein, and the summary of --

6

terms and conditions consistent with those

7

described herein, and the summary of terms

8

presented herewith and such other documents

9

necessary to appropriate in connection

10

therewith, and I would add "and to return to the

11

Board for approval of those agreements" at that

12

point.

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

There's a next part of

15

that paragraph that says the signature of

16

Executive Director upon such documents shall be

17

deemed conclusive evidence, and at the end of

18

that phrase I would just add, "once authorized

19

by the Board."

20

And we haven't talked about a new

21

independent financial advisor, but this says

22

that executive -- the last paragraph says the

23

Executive Director is authorized to select and

24

approve the terms of the engagement of one or

 91
1

more parties to act as the Trust's independent

2

financial advisor for Retrofit One, and I would

3

add "and shall report promptly to the Board

4

regarding that selection."

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

The general part

6

of that resolution, do we still need given what

7

we've just said at the top?

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

At the very end?
Yes.

General, resolved that in

11

order to fully carry out the intent and

12

effectuate the purposes of the foregoing

13

resolutions, any of the Trust's officers be, and

14

each hereby is, authorized to take all such

15

further actions.

16

I think this is standard -- Scott,

17

can you help me with this?

18

proforma language at the end of any board

19

resolution.

20

MR. FALK:

This the standard

Yeah, it applies to the

21

budget resolution also.

22

CHAIRMAN BELL:

That's fine.

And then

23

the budget, anything on that that you need

24

addressed so we can do both at the same time?

 92
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

3

budget resolution.

4

MR. FALK:

5

No.
We are okay with the

All right.
Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry, I

just want to get a clarification.

6

So as a corporate governance matter,

7

I'm not sure that you actually need any of those

8

resolutions now then because you're proposing

9

that nothing get approved until --

10

CHAIRMAN BELL:

But are we going to

11

give something to the Finance Committee of the

12

City Council?

13

MR. FALK:

Well, I think you're hitting

14

the exact issue I was going to address which is

15

the chicken or egg issue.

16

needs authority to negotiate these contracts,

17

and it needs to know that its Executive Director

18

has the ability to sign it.

19

I think your Trust

So, you know, I think your advisors

20

expected that the Board would get comfortable

21

today with the parameters outlined but give the

22

management team and their advisors flexibility

23

to negotiate terms consistent with those.

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Is that what you said?

 93
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

No.

Well, I think the

2

key point is that, you know, if you're thinking

3

that Steve should be able to sign and execute a

4

contract before coming back to us, I think

5

that's inconsistent with my understanding of how

6

we are to proceed.

7

TREASURER NEELY:

Are we trying to get

8

this done next week, the 13th, so a week from

9

today?

10

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yeah, in other words

11

gets what we have here to move it to introduce

12

it to the City Council knowing that we still

13

have work to be done.

14
15

ALDERMAN THOMAS:
it.

16
17

CHAIRMAN BELL:

It just goes to the

Finance Committee as I understand it.

18
19

They can introduce

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

You can introduce it

and it can be changed.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Absolutely.

We got to

21

final approve based on what comes back from the

22

market.

23
24

The issue is what needs to be
negotiated that you're alluding to, Scott?

 94
1

What contracts specifically are you talking

2

about?

3

MR. FALK:

There's the Energy Services

4

Agreement.

5

Contract with the ESCO.

6

agreement with the financing sources.

7

said the ordinance with the City, but I think

8

there may be a forth commercial agreement as

9

well.

10

There's the Performance Guarantee

CHAIRMAN BELL:

There's a loan
Steve

And they need to be

11

negotiated before we finalize the terms of the

12

agreement, is that what we're saying?

13

MR. FALK:

Well, I think that's one in

14

the same thing.

15

suggesting that he wants to see those documents

16

fully negotiated before he authorizes the deal.

17

I think that's what creates the chicken and egg

18

problem.

19

I'm not sure if David is

We can do it that way but it's -CHAIRMAN BELL:

The negotiation is

20

consistent with the terms that we've gone

21

through today and that we're okay with?

22
23
24

MR. FALK:

That would be our proposal,

yes.
MR. HOFFMAN:

When you say gone through

 95
1

today, I mean, again, you know, we didn't go

2

through the RFP addendum terms and conditions

3

which have been developed since the last Board

4

meeting and then we have this -- the only thing

5

that we have --

6
7
8
9
10
11

CHAIRMAN BELL:
I meant.

The term sheet is what

The term sheet.
MR. HOFFMAN:

But, you know, to say

that the agreement will be consistent with the
term sheet is -MR. FALK:

I don't mean to interject or

12

not, but if it would helpful to give a three or

13

four or five minute summary of the key terms of

14

the legal documents orally, we can certainly do

15

that right now.

16

I didn't mean to suggest to take up

17

anymore of your time, but if you would like

18

that, between Michael Dow and Jerry Wallack and

19

me, we can certainly do that.

20

MR. RAMIREZ:

21

I think you're still

going to need to see it.

22

MR. HOFFMAN.

No.

23

MR. RAMIREZ:

What they're questioning

24

No.

here as well is the (unintelligible) of it.

 96
1

This could certainly be introduced at City

2

Council before the Finance Committee.

3

question then becomes whether or not we give the

4

authority to the Executive Director to execute a

5

contract.

6

The

You can execute a contract

7

contingent upon whatever you want, maybe it's

8

coming back to the Board or whatever.

9

have a genuine issue, then we can say we got an

If you

10

issue with it as long as the people entering

11

into it on the other end know that it still has

12

to come to this layer of approval.

13

can still honor the timeline.

14

ways of doing it, that's all I'm saying, to move

15

forward.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

That way we

There's different

Yeah, I certainly would

17

like to put Steve in the best possible position

18

to have these discussions and do what he thinks

19

he needs to do to get to the right place, and,

20

you know, the way Jorge described it makes

21

perfect sense to me in terms of a contingent

22

approval.

23

You know, look, I think it's up to

24

you guys to figure out the right way to set up

 97
1

the ordering of this so that in my view we get

2

the chance to hear about the details, and again

3

which we, you know, in my view haven't heard

4

about today and deliberate and make a decision

5

about it.

6

MR. FALK:

Right.

And if we did take

7

time to describe to you the legal terms, they

8

would be unnegotiated documents.

9

haven't been selected, right?

The lenders

The performance

10

guarantee contract hasn't been presented to the

11

ESCOs.

12

We know what we want in those

13

contracts.

14

and the Trust, but as for the third parties to

15

those contracts, we haven't had those

16

negotiations.

17

We know what would satisfy the City

MR. HOFFMAN:

Sure.

Sure.

I understand.

That's the

18

variable terms.

19

there's some fixed terms which as you described

20

are apparently the ones in the RFP addenda and

21

then there are some variable terms that are

22

being negotiated, right?

23

MR. FALK:

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

As I said,

Yes.
Well, is there an issue

 98
1

with the process of, you know, according to this

2

timeline coming back for a CIT Board decision

3

between November 13th and 20th which presumably

4

is a decision about here's what we recommend

5

regarding these agreements, and here are the

6

terms and here is the interest rate and the

7

price.

8
9

MR. FALK:

I think the answer is it

depends on whether you want to see absolutely

10

fully buttoned down documents between the 13th

11

and the 20th.

12
13

MR. HOFFMAN:

What do you anticipate

showing us again?

14

MR. FALK:

I think negotiations are

15

unpredictable.

16

you whatever state they're in, you can see them.

17

Whether they will be all ready for signature and

18

approval by the Board --

19

I think if you want we can show

MR. HOFFMAN:

Let me try to make this

20

easy I think.

21

I don't feel that we need to see every jot and

22

tittle and every single thing finished.

23

not it.

24

I think there's an easy solution.

That's

But we're not -- what's been put in

 99
1

front of us is not close to that, right?

So if

2

you come back and it's what you're describing,

3

it's been negotiated, we've got a very clear

4

detailed statement of the terms and, you know,

5

there's a small amount of additional drafting to

6

do, that's fine.

7

I mean, I'm not, to be clear, asking

8

that we see it in a completely final form, but I

9

do think we need something more detailed than a

10
11

one pager.
TREASURER NEELY:

David, I think we

12

need to -- Mr. Chairman, just a point of

13

clarification.

14

I know this is not the first deal

15

that we're considering and the process hasn't

16

been ironed out yet, but it can't be stop and

17

go, stop and go either.

18

And so, David, I think you need to

19

be clearer on what you need to see because what

20

I'm hearing you saying is a lot of well, I don't

21

need that, but I do need this, I don't know if I

22

need that.

23

I agree with you in terms of getting

24

a term sheet at midnight the day before you make

 100
1

a decision probably is not a good process, but

2

it would probably be helpful to staff to outline

3

what you do need to make a decision.

4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I think a more

detailed -TREASURER NEELY:

What does that mean,

more detailed?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, all I can say is

that I don't know how to answer that because I
don't know what -CHAIRMAN BELL:

Well, let me try it.

12

Typically in a big corporation we give them a

13

two-page term sheet authorizing them to go

14

negotiate a big deal, meeting those --

15

MS. FERGUSON:

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

Right.
I would feel very

17

differently about this if this wasn't the Trust

18

doing its very first deal for the first time on

19

a type of project -- type of structure --

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yeah, all I'm saying is

21

there's no way to get to a deal until you

22

negotiate it.

I mean, that's my point.

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

Sure.

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

That's the issue.

 101
1
2

MR. HOFFMAN:

envision coming back with.

3
4

You tell me what you do

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

The parameters of the

term sheet.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

That's what these are,

6

the parameters under which we were authorizing

7

them to negotiate.

8
9

MS. FERGUSON:

Also keep in mind as a

trust -- I mean to James' or Chairman Bell's

10

point, in a normal corporate governance

11

standpoint, this would be exactly what you would

12

see, absolutely no more detail than this at a

13

board level to commence the negotiations and

14

finalize a commercially viable transaction that

15

meets the parameters that have been outlined in

16

and approved by this Board.

17

That is why, precisely why we have

18

retained these extremely competent experts in

19

the form of counsel and financial advisors, et

20

cetera, and competent staff to negotiate on our

21

behalf.

Right?

22

I think we can exercise our

23

fiduciary duties of oversight given the

24

parameters that we have -- the boundaries we've

 102
1

given them to operate under.

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

3

MS. FERGUSON:

They're met.
And if they come back

4

with documents that are somehow outside that

5

then, of course, they have breached their

6

duties.

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

8

back and get authority.

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, they have to come

I'm not sure I'm saying

10

anything that different.

11

schedule that you're going to come back to us

12

for a decision, and when you say, Stephanie,

13

what more detail, I guess I'm throwing the

14

question back to you.

15

When you have in the

What did you have in mind when

16

you're going to come back to us for a decision?

17

What did you plan to present to us?

18

was on board with that schedule of your coming

19

back to us.

20

MR. FALK:

I think I

If necessary meant or means

21

if we can't negotiate a deal within the

22

parameters presented to you.

23

CHAIRMAN BELL:

24

MR. FALK:

That we've authorized.

But we were not going to

 103
1

come back to you regardless.

2

we had your authority to get the deal done on

3

the terms as you understand them, and granted

4

you don't understand every detailed term, nor do

5

we expect you to, nor does your duty require you

6

to, but if we couldn't get it within the

7

parameters on the term sheets presented to you,

8

then we would have to come back, but short of

9

that, we expected to get final approval today.

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

So the plan was if

You know, look, if the

11

parameters that we're talking about is this one

12

pager sent at midnight last night, I don't --

13

I'm not --

14
15

TREASURER NEELY:

Let's just say that

the problem you had was with the one pager.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yeah, part of it.

17

TREASURER NEELY:

You can say that.

18

Part of our procedure can be that we can't get

19

documents midnight before a Board meeting.

20

that's the problem, just say that's the problem.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

22

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

23

pager.

24

rate parameters.

If

Well, that's not -And this is a two

The second page lays out the interest
It lays out the payment

 104
1

schedule.

2

TREASURER NEELY:

The interest rate

3

parameters aren't realistic because what's

4

relevant on that is just the cap because we

5

don't know what the interest rate is going to

6

be.

7
8
9
10
11

CHAIRMAN BELL:

They can't go over that

without coming back to us, that's the point.
ALDERMAN THOMAS:

And the resolution

also says that.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

Typically, I'm just

12

telling you, David, typically this is what we

13

would give the team to got out and do it.

14
15
16

TREASURER NEELY:

But not midnight the

night before.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

Well, sometimes it does

17

happen at midnight, but generally my point is is

18

that this is just an evolution of what we're

19

starting with and it gets more specific.

20

not -- I know it's coming up late in this, in

21

the midnight, but it is still pretty much what

22

we started with in terms of the key things we

23

had to have in the deal regardless of structure,

24

and now this has been formatted to fit the

It's

 105
1

structure we're at, but I think it's pretty

2

consistent.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I think you're

4

right that the general statements in this

5

summary are consistent with the goals from the

6

beginning.

7

conversation.

8

comfortable saying that we should just go ahead

9

and authorize a final document and you may not

10

Look, I don't want to belabor this
I think my view is that I'm not

come back to us at all.

11

As you say, it's only if necessary,

12

only if not within the general parameters laid

13

out here.

14

where you have to come back to us, and it needs

15

to be something more detailed, and I would

16

expect -- I think that would be normal as part

17

of what you're about to do; and, in fact, given

18

what you described, I think you're going to be

19

at a -- you are now or you soon will be at a

20

very detailed level.

21

I am more comfortable with a process

So coming back to us would be easy.

22

So, therefore, that's why I think the language

23

of the resolution that I suggested is as far as

24

I'm willing to go, but I don't want to hold this

 106
1

up.

2

MS. FERGUSON:

David, as a point of

3

clarification, what's really important in what

4

you stated, it would not be normal.

5

what you heard from all of us is it's not --

6

that would not be the normal process in a

7

governance context.

I mean,

8

I respect that it's your view and

9

your belief that it's what you would require,

10

but to imply that it would be normal from a

11

governance practice standpoint is not true.

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

But I don't think that

13

what is happening here for the Trust doing its

14

first deal when there's not much precedent for

15

this kind of trust, and when the structure is

16

not a structure that's been presented to us

17

before calls for just standard board governance

18

transactions where it's more, you know, really

19

run of the mill type of transactions that

20

boards have seen before or have seen this type

21

before.

22
23
24

So, look, I don't want to, you know,
stand in the way if -CHAIRMAN BELL:

Here's what I want to

 107
1

say.

What do we need in order to keep moving

2

forward?

3

That's what I'm trying to say.
MR. RAMIREZ:

Mr. Chairman, if I could,

4

I think part of it was what I said.

5

respect the timeline, we have to let the

6

Executive Director do his job and his team do

7

their job within the parameters that concerns

8

that some of our Board Members have spoke to.

9

In order to

If the deal is not done and they

10

can't negotiate the deal within those

11

constraints, then we have to come back to the

12

Board.

13

that have to survive the scrutiny of the City

14

Council, let's remember that, and the Finance

15

Committee.

16

There are additional layers put in place

So, you know, there are other layers

17

and ways in which we can get this thing done.

18

There are more hurdles.

19

one.

20

This isn't the last

So I would think in order to move

21

forward we would need to say all right, we can

22

get this thing going, go get the deal done with

23

the parameters, at the same time introduce it to

24

the City Council.

 108
1

You're not saying this is the end

2

all at City Council.

3

opportunity to change it depending upon what we

4

can negotiate and execute on their end in

5

negotiations.

6

We still have the

CHAIRMAN BELL:

And we can ask the

7

staff to bring back the detailed negotiated deal

8

to us before we decide to go forward with it,

9

right?

There's nothing that prevents us from

10

doing that, even though we have given the

11

authority to negotiate.

12

MR. BEITLER:

No.

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Once we negotiate a

14

deal with lenders and with ESCOs, we can still

15

decide not to do the project, right?

16

MR. COAN:

Yes

17

MR. BEITLER:

I think from a resolution

18

standpoint there is either the providing of

19

authority or there isn't the providing of

20

authority.

21

CHAIRMAN BELL:

22

within the parameters we lay out.

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Authority to negotiate

That's fine.
That's what we're going

 109
1
2

to give you.
MR. BEITLER:

Then the question is if

3

we negotiate a deal within parameters that are

4

laid out, what are you suggesting happens next?

5
6
7
8
9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

You bring back that

deal so we can look at it.
MR. HOFFMAN:

And explain how it's

within the parameters.
MS. BARRETT:

Mary Sue Barrett.

10

Clarification.

11

advise or for approval by the Board?

12

Is that in your view, James, to

CHAIRMAN BELL:

In my view it's not

13

necessary.

14

Board though that has different views.

15

Let's be clear.

MS. BARRETT:

I'm working with a

Do you want to have

16

filed with the Board for their individual

17

review or do you want to have a meeting to

18

discuss it?

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I think we want to

20

satisfy the issue David has brought up and that

21

is I want to see what the deal looks like once

22

you guys finally get down to what the deal is,

23

and you can't do that until you negotiate, I

24

understand that, and that's why I'm trying to

 110
1

understand what -- how -- what happens when you

2

do negotiate, and if we come back and you come

3

back and we don't like the deal, can we stop the

4

project or if you guys are saying that's bad

5

form, say it.

6

TREASURER NEELY:

But procedurally does

7

this Board have to approve it before it goes to

8

City Council?

9

something you haven't approved?

10

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Can City Council approve

No.

No.

So we're

11

not -- the whole point is that that's why the

12

thing goes to City Council, to the Finance

13

Committee to start their process on the 13th.

14

We get to look at it between the 13th and the

15

20th before the project says it's completed in

16

December, and if we see something in there that

17

we don't like, we change it or we pull it.

18
19

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

And amend it before

the Council.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

And amend it before

21

the Council approves or we say we're happy with

22

it and let the process continue.

23
24

MR. HOFFMAN:
for.

That's all I'm asking

 111
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

That's it.

I think we

2

can get there as long as -- I guess the issue I

3

want to be sure I'm clear on is we go through

4

and negotiate with lenders and we negotiate it

5

with the ESCOs and all those people that are

6

involved in this, and if we turn around and say

7

we're not going to do the deal subsequent to

8

that, even though they are within the parameters

9

we've laid out to you, is that bad form?

10

Is that going to cause us problems

11

going forward in terms of credibility with the

12

same audience we're going to be dealing with

13

from now on?

14

So we need to know that.

Say it.

15

So we got to give them authority to negotiate

16

within these parameters or we can't give them

17

authority.

18

MR. FALK:

Mr. Chairman, my suggestion

19

on the resolutions is to have a slight enodation

20

on what David suggested so let me read something

21

to see if it would be satisfactory.

22

On the now therefore be it resolved,

23

at the end of the paragraph, David, I think you

24

said something like if so approved in the future

 112
1

by the Trust and the City.

2

instead is to say at the end "subject to the

3

Board's review and satisfaction with definitive

4

documentation."

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

What I propose

Okay.

I don't want to

6

mince words.

I mean, if satisfaction means we

7

need to approve it, that's fine.

8

CHAIRMAN BELL:

If we're not satisfied,

9

we get to amend it or deal it.

10

MR. RAMIREZ:

I would think it would

11

mean if it was within the parameters, we get as

12

much clarification as we want up to our

13

satisfaction with the clarification.

14
15

MR. HOFFMAN:
you know --

16
17
18

Sure, but we might have,

CHAIRMAN BELL:

They got to ask us

anyway.
MR. RAMIREZ:

That's exactly right, if

19

it's outside the parameters.

20

here is not to move the goalpost with the people

21

we have to establish credibility with in the

22

financial community, you know, in the banking

23

community and wherever else.

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

The whole thing

I guess I would sum it

 113
1

up that we got to have confidence in our team to

2

negotiate this deal or not.

3

that point now.

4

perspective of what we want to see in the deal

5

and what it has to be before we're going to be

6

comfortable with it.

7

I mean, we're at

I think we've given them enough

I think we've done that.

8

the RFP does that.

9

term sheet.

I think

I think this does it, the

Granted it came last night, but I

10

think the general mindset of what this Trust

11

has been put together to do has been

12

incorporated in the RFPs since day one.

13

don't think that?

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

No, I think that things

15

have changed.

16

general principles have stayed the same.

17
18
19

You

I think I agree with you that the

CHAIRMAN BELL:

That's it.

That's all

I'm saying.
MR. HOFFMAN:

But I think in terms of

20

what the structure is going to look like or what

21

the terms are going to be, that has changed.

22

Only since the last board meeting has there been

23

an explanation --

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I got you, David.

I

 114
1

got you.

Because of the way the structures are,

2

those things have to be dealt with differently,

3

those general principles have to be dealt with

4

differently.

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.

6

CHAIRMAN BELL:

But if we give them the

7

authority to negotiate but staying consistent

8

with that in this new format, anything outside

9

of that they have to come back to us.

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, sure, but, you

11

know, look, I think as part of that what would

12

be required is them to come back and explain how

13

a document is within the parameters.

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

I got it.

We can have a discussion

16

of that.

And if we are all satisfied that it is

17

within the parameters, I absolutely am

18

comfortable with that, but I would like to have

19

that discussion and hear that explanation and be

20

given the chance to ask questions.

21

that's part of an approval process.

22

CHAIRMAN BELL:

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

24

opportunity.

Yes.

I think

Correct.

We have not be given that

 115
1
2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

the authority to negotiate.

3
4

MR. HOFFMAN:

7
8
9
10
11

Of course.

I'm all in

favor of that.

5
6

But we got to give them

CHAIRMAN BELL:

We're all in favor of

that.
Stephanie, what was your question?
TREASURER NEELY:

I just was confused.

The parameters have been set for the last
several months you're not comfortable with?
MR. HOFFMAN:

There aren't parameters

12

that have been set.

We had a Board meeting

13

three months ago and we were talking about a

14

completely different thing.

15

What we're talking about are terms

16

and conditions that are either set out in this

17

term sheet that were sent last night or in the

18

RFP addendum.

19

Those are the parameters.

And we haven't really had any

20

detailed discussion today or previously about

21

the RFP addendum that was issued in August.

22

haven't discussed that.

23
24

So it's fine.

We

I think that if those

are the parameters and if you're going to

 116
1

develop and negotiate a document that is

2

consistent with that, great.

3

that to us, show us how it's within the

4

parameters.

5

confident that we will approve it.

6

I have in mind.

7

Come back, explain

I think if that's the case then I'm
That's what

And we're -- I'm happy to do

8

whatever I need to do or we need to do so that

9

that moves in a quick process, and if that means

10

it's next week, that's fine.

11

CHAIRMAN BELL:

12

resolution we need now?

13

MR. FALK:

So what's the

I think before we finalize

14

this, Mr. Chairman, we should just make sure

15

with the City lawyers and ask them that the

16

timeline as adjusted as you're proposing doesn't

17

do damage to the ability to get this approved

18

through the Council.

19

we've touched base with folks who know the

20

internal processes.

21

I just want to make sure

Treasurer Neely had some good

22

insights because she's very familiar with that

23

process.

24

McDonald and David Winters and others have given

I just want to make sure that Jim

 117
1

us their insights on whether this is going to

2

impair our ability to get this done.

3

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

I would

4

just say that any amendment to an ordinance is

5

at the discretion of the Chair of the Committee.

6

They don't have to accept the amendment.

7

So I can't speak for how the Finance

8

Committee would -- because we're supposed to

9

give them a full month of time to review it so

10

if we change it, they wouldn't necessarily have

11

the time.

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

So if we pull it --

What would they have?

14

When you say a month to review it, they would

15

have the full documentation in front of them?

16

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

17

introduced an ordinance which has same

18

parameters that you've seen.

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

20

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

21

We've

This one pager?
Right.

If there were changes to those --

22

ALDERMANT THOMAS:

The term sheet.

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

24

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

The term sheet.
I'll

 118
1

ask the legal team to answer.

2
3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yeah, and we wouldn't

intend that because then it's a different deal.

4

MR. McDONALD:

I'm Jim McDonald.

I'm

5

Chief Assistant Corporation Counsel with the

6

City's Law Department.

7

The current expectation is the

8

City's ordinance would attach the Energy

9

Services Agreement.

It wouldn't simply be a

10

term sheet.

11

that agreement would be a substantially final

12

form.

13

And the expectation would be that

At introduction, as the Chief

14

Financial Officer said, that is an introduction,

15

that is not necessarily a final package, but to

16

have a substitute ordinance with a different set

17

of terms in the ordinance itself or a

18

substantially different exhibit, as Chief

19

Financial Officer said, would be up to the

20

Committee of the Council to decide whether or

21

not to accept it.

22

So it is in my experience working in

23

the Law Department at the very least not

24

preferable to introduce an ordinance with an

 119
1

expectation that it would change.

2

preferable to have a substantially finished

3

package that is introduced.

4

It is

As a legal matter, if the Committee

5

and the Council decided to adopt -- to take a

6

substitute ordinance and adopt the substitute

7

ordinance, that would be legally valid.

8

So as a legal matter, the substitute

9

ordinance is fine, but as a matter of Council

10

practice, it has been my experience that the

11

Council prefers -- it has not been preferred to

12

introduce an ordinance unless there's

13

substantial expectation that that is the final

14

agreement that is expected to be approved.

15

Now, again, just to be clear, the

16

ordinance would set out parameters, and the

17

exhibit would be substantially final, it would

18

not have to be final per se.

19

usual practice has been substantially final and

20

allow delegation to the Executive Branch to

21

negotiate the final terms of the transaction --

22

of any transaction, the ones I work on, within

23

the defined parameters of the ordinance.

24

been the practice.

That's not -- the

That's

 120
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

That was very helpful

2

James.

3

the City Council quite understandably is going

4

to have in front of it attached to the draft

5

ordinance a substantially final form of the

6

agreement.

7

saw them again, we wouldn't.

8

You know, one of my reactions to that is

If we went forward today and never

MR. McDONALD:

Just to be clear, I'm

9

sorry to interrupt, we have current plans not to

10

attach to the ordinance agreements that the City

11

is not a party to.

12

So the Guarantee Energy Performance

13

Contract between the ESCOs and the Trust is

14

not --

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

16

MR. McDONALD;

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

Just the ESA, exactly.
Just the ESA.
Fine.

They would be

18

getting a final form of ESA and if we don't see

19

any of this again and it goes to City Council,

20

and they say to the Trust Board, hey, what did

21

you guys think of agreement, and we say we

22

haven't seen it.

23
24

CHAIRMAN BELL:
can't do that.

I agree with you.

We

 121
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

That would be strange.

2

I'm glad the City Council is going to have a

3

certain amount of reasonable time to see the

4

documents.

5

given.

6

relatively quick fashion.

7

That's not something we've been

That's all I'm trying to set up in a

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I got it.

So when can

8

we have a reasonably final form package that

9

we're planning to send to the City so we can

10

review it before it goes to the City?

11

the question.

12

MR. BEITLER:

That's

Well, the issue with the

13

question is the latter clause before it goes to

14

the City, before it's introduced to the City

15

Council or -- because there are 15 people here

16

from the City with whom we've been collaborating

17

and negotiating on the four different agreements

18

that are required in order to make this occur,

19

so I'm not sure I understand --

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Let me be clear.

When

21

can we see the package we intend to send to the

22

City before it goes to the City?

23
24

MR. FALK:

So that's an easier request

because the only document that has to be done is

 122
1

the ESA because that's the only document the

2

City signed.

3

in full satisfaction of David's requests.

4

want to see all the documents.

5

That's not -- I don't think that's
He

So if by November 13th, the day the

6

ordinance is expected to be introduced to the

7

City Council, we need to get the ESA done, we'll

8

get it done.

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

10

MR. FALK:

That's fine.

Whether we get the full

11

package of documents done by then, I don't

12

know.

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's fine.

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I'm just trying to

15

satisfy the first question, that is, I would

16

hate to send something to the City that we

17

haven't send.

18

something to the City we haven't seen.

19

answers that piece.

20

In fact, we're not going to send
So that

And then if there's work to be done

21

with it and the work to be done is within the

22

boundaries of what's contained in the documents

23

we send to the City that have to take place

24

after we send that document, then that's okay.

 123
1

I think I can live with that.

2

But we just have to have the

3

understanding that the negotiations would have

4

to have those documents be consistent with the

5

things we're already send to the City.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

Jim, can I --

7

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

And I would suggest

8

by the time of the Finance Committee hearing

9

that you have substantially negotiated or

10

signed the rest of the documents because

11

questions will be asked about the rest of the

12

documents.

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I got it.

14

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

But it won't change

15

substantially the ordinance that we would be

16

considering.

17
18

MR. HOFFMAN:

And, Jim, on the

Alderman's point --

19

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

But that's more time.

20

That's a little bit more time.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

22
23
24

That's December 9th I

see.
But the Guarantee Energy Performance
Contract, as you said, while the City is not a

 124
1

party, this sheet says it's between the ESCO

2

contractors and the CIT for the benefit of the

3

City, do you think that, therefore, the City

4

Council would not need to see that substantially

5

completed document?

6

MR. McDONALD:

I don't think the City

7

Council would need to see it.

8

would be interested because we're not

9

authorizing execution of it by a City official,

10

I think it would be something, as the Alderman

11

has indicated, that we would -- speaking on

12

behalf of the City, we would be interested in

13

seeing what those final terms were.

14

We certainly

It's not going to be -- we certainly

15

wouldn't want to enter into a transaction for

16

the City with an ESA and have a GEPC, a

17

Guaranteed Energy Performance Contract,

18

underlying that.

19

inconsistent with it.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

That would be completely

And that's what I would

21

expect that we will hear from the City Council

22

is that if they don't need to see the actual

23

GPEC, they'll want some sort of detailed summary

24

of that, and my guess is that either you got

 125
1
2

that already or that's going to come.
And so I do think that it's

3

important to be -- you know, when the City

4

Council comes back to us and says so what did

5

you guys think of this, we need to have looked

6

it, whatever is going to be in front of them and

7

have a view about it.

8

So, Scott, to your question about

9

the other documents, I think it's fine if we

10

don't have the completed documents, but I do

11

think it would be normal for you to have

12

something that is a detailed summary of the, for

13

instance, the GPEC.

14

The Council is going to want to see

15

that I would think.

They're going to want to

16

see our recommendation.

17

and we recommend it to you.

18

recommend it to you.

Yeah, we looked at this

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

20

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

21
22

Here is why we

Yep, I agree.
You're going to be at

the hearings.
MR. HOFFMAN:

I suppose we should read

23

the documents.

But, look, there seems to be a

24

practical way to get to this, especially if we

 126
1

can get ourselves together quickly by phone, if

2

necessary.

3

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:

4

then there's no hope.

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

If you can't,

That's part of our job

6

here if everyone wants to move quickly now, we

7

should do that.

8
9

MR. BEITLER:

I just, for a practical

point, about getting together by phone, I'm not

10

precisely sure how to do that and meet the

11

public requirement of the open --

12
13
14
15
16

MR. HOFFMAN:

Public access conference

MR. BEITLER:

I'm not familiar with

line.

those, if there is such a thing.
MR. HOFFMAN:

It could be a publicized

17

conference call number.

18

that meets in Washington regularly, and I

19

participate by conference call and the public

20

can participate in that and the public can ask

21

questions.

22

I mean, I'm on a board

When I was on the Reform Commission,

23

we had some meetings where public access was

24

provided by phone.

I don't think it's ideal,

 127
1

but if you're saying we've got to do a

2

meeting in an expedited time frame that's a

3

special meeting then -- but anyway, I'll let the

4

city lawyers decide whether that's feasible or

5

not.

6

meeting.

If not, then we can have an in-person

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

8

MS. BARRETT:

9

calendar.

Yes.

So I'm looking at the

Sometime between November 15th and

10

December 1st, understanding the uncertainty of

11

the response deadline, but within that two-week

12

window we would be shooting for reconvening

13

either in person or do you want to do it after

14

the responses and before you bring it prior to

15

introduction at City Council?

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I thought the window

17

was the 13th to the 20th of November.

18

the window.

19

MS. BARRETT:

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

That's

Even shorter, okay.
So the question is can

21

it all be done by then and what do you have to

22

give today in order to make it happen in terms

23

of authorization from us or do you need

24

anything?

 128
1

MR. SILVERS:

Chairman, you might --

2

one other approach you might take here is --

3

convening a meeting seems challenging, is that

4

you could require the staff to provide the

5

documents, the actual legal documents at a

6

certain date or a certain date in advance of

7

some other date, and you could provide the on

8

call to Members of the Board, you would convene

9

in (unintelligible) any other problem that they

10

can go forward.

11

Now, my only experience I think is

12

very much like Diana's is that the board -- the

13

documents come forth that are consistent with

14

the term sheet, nobody is going to have a

15

problem.

16

But the structure I just conveyed

17

ensures that members of the Board see the full

18

documentation, have a chance to review it, and

19

if there is a real problem, you can convene, but

20

you don't have to.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

James, I want to give

22

you the discretion to decide what the most

23

expeditious and efficient way to do this is.

24

think you have a clear sense of where I'm

I

 129
1

coming from, whatever -- however you want to

2

exercise your discretion to give us the time to

3

see it, make a determination and then

4

communicate that.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

I guess we're

6

running out of time so we do have to make a

7

decision on it.

8

do the work, there's no question, but what I'm

9

not certain of is can we meet that timetable

I think we got to continue to

10

with the complete package for the City.

11

what I'm struggling with.

12
13
14

MS. BARRETT:

That's

Because you receive bids

the same day the City Council meeting is.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yes.

And we do want to

15

see what those are before it goes to the City,

16

and with that we would want to have a pretty

17

clear understanding of how the other documents

18

come together and the timing of it and that they

19

are going to be consistent with everything that

20

would need to have happen to make the documents

21

we send to the City accurate.

22

struggle with.

23
24

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's what I

This all assumes that

this, and I think we are all expecting that this

 130
1

calendar through December 19th is -- there's

2

some things set in stone, including a

3

December 19th closing and a December 11th City

4

Council vote.

5

reason for that?

Let me just ask what is the

6

CHAIRMAN BELL:

7

in this year, as I understand it.

8

MR. MORSCH:

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

This is just to get it

Yes.
Either we do or we

don't.

11

MR. KOCH:

There's some legal

12

significance.

13

markets.

14

may or may have not happen.

15

commercially impossible to do.

16

MS. FERGUSON:

17
18
19
20

There's a lack of exposure to

The longer this goes on, the less it
At some point it's

And rates are

perishable.
MR. KOCH:

James said it in a very

articulate way, they are perishable.
MR. BEITLER:

Additionally, there's

21

actually a penalty in the ESCO contracts that it

22

is exercised at the end of this year, that's a

23

hundred thousand dollar per ESCO as a result of

24

not exercising some sort of contract by the end

 131
1
2

of the year.
The ESCOs have agreed to set aside

3

that penalty if we act in a judicious manner and

4

go forward in some fashion or other with some

5

sort of transaction.

6

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

So I guess I

7

would like a motion that we would let these

8

guys, give them the authority to negotiate

9

within the parameters of the term sheet and get

10

these things final as quickly as possible, but

11

we are going to have to see this before it goes

12

to the City Council.

13

the documents.

14

13th or not.

15

We're going to have to see

I don't know if we can make the

I just don't know.

MR. BEITLER:

So, Mr. Chairman, counsel

16

has suggested that there's really, outside of

17

the budget and the independent financial advisor

18

components of the resolutions, no need to have a

19

resolution for that purpose.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

21

MR. BEITLER:

22

MS. FERGUSON:

Okay.

So -That presupposes then

23

that we are reconvening, and I thought I heard

24

you saying that we were trying to get to a place

 132
1

where we were authorizing moving forward

2

without having to reconvene but to see the

3

documents.

4

CHAIRMAN BELL:

The thing is is that

5

you're saying that you don't need -- the Board

6

doesn't need to give you authority to continue

7

to negotiate and you have been negotiating.

8

That's what you're saying.

9

MR. KARCZEWSKI:

10

CHAIRMAN BELL:

That's correct.
I think I want to give

11

you some top cover that the Board agrees you

12

should be negotiating because I don't think that

13

you have common understanding across this board

14

that you have had the authority to do what

15

you're doing, and so I want to clear that up by

16

giving you that authority to let you finalize

17

these documents.

18

extent.

19

I do want a motion to that

Then I want to make sure it's clear

20

that we want to have a review of the documents

21

before they go to the City.

22

motion.

23
24

MR. HOFFMAN:
motion.

That would be the

Yeah, I support that

I think that --

 133
1
2

MR. KARCZEWSKI:
approval?

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

4

MR. KARCZEWSKI:

5
6

And that review is

I didn't hear you.
That review is

approval?
CHAIRMAN BELL:

It would be approval to

7

move the deal to the City Council, let's put it

8

that way.

9
10

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's right.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I mean, we've given you

11

the negotiation authority, so if you negotiate

12

within that, I mean, we won't have to reapprove

13

it, but we will want to see that you've done

14

that, and so the review would, in all intents

15

and purposes, would be to move the documents to

16

the City, that we're comfortable that those are

17

the right things to provide to the City.

18

MR. FALK:

The issue frankly is that

19

we're going to have to have several law firms

20

write legal opinions that the banks are going to

21

be satisfied with that include authorization.

22

We're going to need to have an air tight

23

resolution that says that the Board

24

authorizes -- either authorizes management to

 134
1

execute whatever documents he darn well pleases

2

or that management is authorized to execute the

3

documents you've shown us.

4

So those are two choices, but we

5

have to have an absolute authorization.

6

think authorization to negotiate, we can write

7

that in, but that's not going to be --

8
9
10
11

CHAIRMAN BELL:
me what you need.

So I

I mean, you guys tell

That's what I'm asking.

What

do we need to move this thing forward?
MR. FALK:

What is in the Board book.

12

If we can't get, we should get it when you're

13

satisfied enough to give it to us.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

What I hear you saying,

15

Scott, is an outcome that I think we anticipate

16

giving to you once we've seen this package of

17

documents that has been described.

18

And presuming that we say we

19

approve, this is within the parameters,

20

absolutely, then you will have that.

21

be a resolution that will be as air tight as

22

either it says here or as you want it, more air

23

tight because we'll have seen the documents.

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yes.

There will

 135
1

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

At the time that you

2

review the documents, you need to approve or

3

disapprove authorization and that could be --

4

at the time of your review of documents, you

5

have a resolution that has to give approval for

6

them to --

7

MR. FALK:

That's right, Alderman.

8

We'll just defer these resolutions until you're

9

ready to sign off on documents, except we do

10

need a motion on the budget resolution and the

11

finances.

12
13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Can I get a motion on

those?

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

15

MR. MARQUISOS:

Second.

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Passed.

17

Okay.

18
19
20
21
22

So moved.

Anything else?

(No response.)
We are out of time so unfortunately
I'm going to have to close the meeting now.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Do you want to give time

for public comment?

23

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Is there any pressing

24

public comment before we do that?

 136
1

MR. MELLIS:

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

3

Not pressing.
Thank you.

All right.
