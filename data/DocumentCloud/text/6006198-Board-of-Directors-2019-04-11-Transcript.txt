23· ·series of conversations in each of our districts to
24· ·collaboratively a community policing strategic plan

 ·1· ·for each of the communities that we serve.
·2· · · · · · ·We've also held productive meetings with
·3· ·the federally-appointed independent monitoring team
·4· ·to help gain a mutual understanding of the
·5· ·oversight and evaluation process during this period
·6· ·of reform.
·7· · · · · · ·Planning and implementation efforts are
·8· ·also underway in several key areas of the consent
·9· ·decree, including training, supervision, and
10· ·accountability.· We will continue sharing our
11· ·progress towards sustainable reforms and consent
12· ·decree compliance throughout this process.
13· · · · · · ·That concludes my report.
14· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Thank you.
15· · · · · · · I will now call upon those members of
16· ·public who signed up in advance to speak.· When
17· ·your name is called, please step up to the
18· ·microphone.· We ask that you limit your comments to
19· ·two minutes.
20· · · · · · ·The first speaker is Elihu K. Blanks.
21· · · ·MR. BLANKS:· Hello.· Two minutes, okay.· Let's

23· · · · · · ·The margins of a territory can be aware
24· ·friction and uncertainty exists.· This is why I

 ·1· ·asked the Third District's southern border be
·2· ·extended south one block to encompass the Jewel
·3· ·shopping center at 75th and Stony Island, where
·4· ·violence, drug sales, and crime potential exists in
·5· ·my community.
·6· · · · · · · Third District is more home to this area
·7· ·because they're at 67th and South Chicago, whereas
·8· ·Fifth District is home to 100 on 111th Street.· So
·9· ·because this border at Jewel's, criminals know this
10· ·is a border.· It's not constantly covered by one or
11· ·the other districts.· I think, with my community
12· ·around me, criminals take advantage of that.
13· · · · · · ·We've seen crime there before and we've
14· ·acted on it.· We've asked Jewel's to increase
15· ·security, and I'm going to lose my two minutes.
16· ·But I ask that border be pushed south.· Or if you
17· ·can't push it south, at least tell one district to
18· ·cover the south end or the north end so that
19· ·somebody is always there to get our back.
20· · · · · · · One more thing.· I'm a cyclist.· I bike
21· ·downtown every day back and forth, wintertime,
22· ·summertime, and everything.· Please have the
23· ·mounted patrols on the south side of Lake Front
24· ·Trail.· Because when I cross over Navy Pier, I see

 ·1· ·them on the north side with the paramedics.

I

·2· ·don't see you guys on the south side too much.

I

·3· ·would love to see you guys mounted riding the south
·4· ·side.· Not just in your cars and police vans
·5· ·sitting there, but riding with us.· Those are my
·6· ·points, and thanks for hearing me out.
·7· · · ·MR. O'MALLEY:· Wait a second.· I have got a
·8· ·question.· When you say mounted, you mean the bike
·9· ·patrol?· Not the mounted patrol.· You mean the bike
10· ·patrol.
11· · · ·MR. BLANKS:· I mean cyclists.· They're there
12· ·once in a blue moon.· But they are not there as
13· ·constantly as when I go to the north, when I go up
14· ·to Diversey.
15· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Superintendent.
16· · · ·SUPERINTENDENT JOHNSON:· Do me a favor, can you
17· ·give your information to that officer in the back
18· ·and we will talk off line.
19· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Thank you.
20· · · ·MR. O'MALLEY:· Thank you.
21· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Mr. Grier.
22· · · ·MR. GRIER:· Good evening.· So I am here, as
23· ·many times in the past, to address an issue.· And
24· ·we feel that this is a very important public safety

 ·1· ·issue.
·2· · · · · · ·The issue before us is over the course of
·3· ·the past several months, years, there has been an
·4· ·allotment of bodies, young women of color in the
·5· ·urban side, south side, west side, that have turned
·6· ·up in garages, turned up in alleys, turned up in
·7· ·garbage cans.
·8· · · · · · ·We need the language to begin to change.
·9· ·And, Chief Johnson, we need this language to
10· ·change.· Because the reports, especially from the
11· ·murder accountability commission, Free and First
12· ·International is my organization, and we believe
13· ·that there is a serial killer in Chicago that is on
14· ·the loose.
15· · · · · · ·Their findings have said that there is an
16· ·excessive pattern, strangulation, asphyxiation.
17· ·More than 50 unsolved cases, for those who don't
18· ·know, of women of color whose bodies have been
19· ·found.· Chicago Police doesn't want to go that far
20· ·to say that there is a potential serial killer on
21· ·the loose, but we are suggesting, Chief Johnson,
22· ·that even if you don't make that determination,
23· ·that the language has to start to be out there for
24· ·public safety purposes.

·3· ·put together to start researching and investigating
·4· ·that.· Going to the spring, going into the summer,
·5· ·we would prefer to have the information out there
·6· ·for the public to dissimulate, rather than see the
·7· ·body count of young woman to continue to rise.
·8· · · · · · · 50 cases is too much.· We need
·9· ·accountability post haste.· It's got to stop.· It's
10· ·got to stop.· And we're seeing it more and more

·2· · · · · · · Superintendent Johnson, here's -- if you
·3· ·have nothing to hide, the track record of
·4· ·individuals sitting in that seat or not sitting in
·5· ·the seat since the investigation of Bland, Young
·6· ·and Spencer murders -- I already only got a minute
·7· ·and a half left already, but that is raising
·8· ·suspicions.· And to dispel those suspicions, a
·9· ·couple things.· Will you start wearing a wire?
10· · · · · · ·Number two, if you're afraid of getting
11· ·murdered, and that justification would be entirely
12· ·legitimate because so many people in the position
13· ·you're in who have actually started bearing the
14· ·burdens of the office have ended up murdered.
15· ·That's just the way it goes down.· Okay.· John
16· ·F. Kennedy, Terrence Eeky (phonetic), Pat Tillman.
17· · · · · · ·You stand up against -- you go back to
18· ·1915 in the Jewish ritual murder trial of beliefs.
19· ·There were seven percipient knowledge witnesses, a
20· ·night watchman and six children, four of whom ended
21· ·up dead a month through the trial.· The three
22· ·little children -- their teeth from chattering
23· ·because they stood up against world (inaudible).

 ·1· ·put the guy away, and they ended up with a hung
·2· ·jury.· And that was the last Jewish ritual murder
·3· ·trial.
·4· · · · · · ·The point is you're invited, if you can't
·5· ·find someone more Roman's 14 rhinoceros-like to
·6· ·follow me around, and then they'll have to kill me
·7· ·to kill you.· That invitation until you can find -·8· ·get the most rhinoceros-like, Romans 12, 13, 14,
·9· ·and follow that person around.
10· · · · · · ·But you got to bear the burden of the
11· ·office to save your soul.· Everyone in this room as
12· ·far as I know is a (inaudible) presumed reprobate.
13· ·I know I definitely was in that position at least
14· ·February 5 of 2000.· I don't know where I am now.
15· ·But my first obligation is to speak the truth in
16· ·charity, and to have no part of any work of
17· ·darkness.· And to be not overcome by evil, but to
18· ·overcome evil with good.· Everyone standing in this
