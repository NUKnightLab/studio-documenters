 (Item No. 1)
HUD uses the Performance Funding System (PFS) to determine a public housing authority’s
eligibility for an operating subsidy. The PFS is applicable to all public housing authority owned
units under an Annual Contributions Contract. The CHA is required to submit a PFS Calculation
detailing the total operating subsidy for fiscal year 2003. Based on the formula established by
HUD as a part of the Moving-to-Work Demonstration Agreement (“MTW Agreement”), the
CHA should request the operating subsidy in the amount of $176,472,397. In fiscal year 2002,
HUD experienced a $250 million shortfall in Operating Subsidies. In order to cover the prior
year shortfall, HUD is expected to fund all Public Housing Authorities at an estimated 90% proration. It is estimated that this will result in a $20.2 million decrease in CHA’s fiscal year 2003
Operating Subsidy. Unlike the procedure used in prior years, HUD has requested each Authority
to submit its PFS Schedule prior to the release of final pro-rations. This is being done in order to
determine the overall need of Public Housing Authorities. Upon release of the final pro-ration
amount, the CHA’s Comprehensive Budget will be adjusted accordingly.
Commissioner Ivers moved the adoption of the following resolution for Item 1:
RESOLUTION NO. 2003-CHA-41
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 12, 2003
requesting authorization to submit FY2003 Performance Funding System
Calculation to the Department of Housing and Urban Development and approval
of the FY2003 Funding System Performance Calculation;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners approves the FY2003 Performance System
Calculation and authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute
and submit the Performance Funding System Calculation and all necessary related
documents to the U.S. Department f Housing and Urban Development.

Motion to adopt said resolution was seconded by Commissioner Harris and the voting was as
follows:
Ayes:

Sharon Gist Gilliam
Hallie Amey
Leticia Peralta Davis
Earnest Gates
Dr. Mildred Harris
Michael Ivers
Sandra Young

Nays:
