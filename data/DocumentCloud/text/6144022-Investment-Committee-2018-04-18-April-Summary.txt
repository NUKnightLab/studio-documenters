MONTHLY NEWS AND INFORMATION FROM YOUR RETIREMENT BOARD

Retiree Brunch
The annual retiree brunch, that is co-sponsored by the Local 2 and the Retirement Board, will be held
on May 6, 2018, at De La Salle Institute located at 3434 S Michigan Ave. The doors will open at
10:00am and the event will begin at 10:30am. Please call Tugi at Local 2 (773) 536-0450 to register
for the brunch.
Service Credit Transfers
The deadline for applying for the service credit transfer from an Article 4 pension fund is May 8,
2018. Please visit our website at www.fabf.org for additional details and to view the application.
EMWQ Gift Fund
The EMWQ Retiree's, Widow's and Children’s Assistance Fund provides financial assistance to the
neediest retirees, widows and children of the Chicago Fire Department family. While Public Acts 990506 & 0905, which became law in 2016, helped raise the minimum annuity for retirees and widows
to 125% of the Federal Poverty Limit, the ever-increasing cost of healthcare and other necessities
continue to be a challenge for those whose income was at or near the poverty level.
The following are ways in which the EMWQ helps our neediest members:
 An annual gift to the neediest widows of the Chicago Fire Department receiving a pension of
$1,000 to $1,500 a month, and many of whom are without Social Security.
 An annual gift to the orphaned children of deceased members of the Chicago Fire
Department.
 Immediate cash assistance to the children of an active member of the Chicago Fire
Department who passes away in the line-of-duty or off-duty, as authorized by the EMWQ
Board.
 Administers memorial funds for all Chicago Fire Department line-of-duty deaths.
In December 2017, the EMWQ was able to distribute $638,775.00 to over 400 widows and 85
children of deceased Chicago firefighters and paramedics. While we are grateful for the tremendous
support we have received from organizations like Old Style, the Chicago Blackhawks Alumni and
events such as Battle of the Badges, the largest portion of the proceeds come from our active and
retired members.

 I would like to encourage everyone not already participating to make a modest contribution via
payroll or through their annuity checks. Together, we can continue to ensure that our neediest
members have a dignified retirement and ensure that those that are left behind know that they have
not been forgotten. Members can visit widowsandchildren.org or call Eileen Doherty at (312) 7265823 for more information about how to contribute.
Retiree Memorial
The Chicago Fire Department (CFD) firefighter and paramedic retiree memorial is a tribute to all
retired and deceased uniformed members of the CFD who have proudly served the citizens of
Chicago and the Chicago Fire Department for decades.
The memorial is located behind the flame at the Robert J Quinn Fire Academy.
The cost is $225/per name. CFD widows pay $150/per name.
For more information email cfdretireememorialpark@yahoo.com or call retired paramedics Doreen
Chambers @ 773-842-3142 or Eileen O’Connell @ 773-844-2541.
