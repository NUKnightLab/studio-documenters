DENNIS MANZKE, Chief of the Administrative Services Bureau, State 's Attorney's Office
requesting authorization to accept a supplemental grant award in the amount of $63,784.00 from the
Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICilA). This supplemental grant provided bridge funding
for Target Abuser Call Victim Assistance Program (TAC) partners, Life Span Center for Legal Services
and Advocacy and Hull House Association, until the federal grant from the Office on Violence Against
Women came through. The federal award, which also funds Life Span Center for Legal Services and
Advocacy and Hull House Association, was approved by the Cook County Board on November 18, 2003
and began funding the partner agencies on December 29, 2003. The supplemental grant from the Illinois
Criminal Justice Information Authority was attached to the underlying 2-year contract in order to expedite
the availability of funding for the partner agencies without creating a new program contract. This
supplemental award provided funding that supported the salaries and fringe benefits of two (2) domestic
violence court victim advocates from the Hull House Association as well as one (1) civil staff attorney
from Life Span Center for Legal Services and Advocacy. The Hull House advocates and the Life Span
civil attorney provided services to high-risk victims of domestic v iolence under the existing Target
Abuser Call Victim Assistance Program that currently funds two (2) TAC victim specialists. The total
amount for the subcontractors is $63,695.00. The additional $89.00 of the supplemental award covers the
increased audit cost as a result of the additional award. There is no match commitment for this
supplemental award.
The grant award was approved on May 6, 2003 by the Cook County Board of Commissioners.
Subcontract with Hull House Association: Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Funds provided through the
Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority: $39,796.00. Subcontract Period: July 14, 2003 through
December 26, 2003.
Subcontract with LifeSpan Center for Legal Services and Advocacy: Estimated Fiscal Impact: None.

Period: July 14, 2003 through December 26, 2003.

DENNIS MANZKE, Chief of the Administrative Services Bureau, State 's Attorney's Office
requesting authorization to apply for a grant renewal in the amount of $27 ,985.00 from the Illinois
Attorney General 's Office. This grant will provide continued partial funding for the Child Sexual Abuse
Specialist Program that is jointly funded by the Illinois Attorney General 's Office and the Department of
Children and Family Services. The one (I) full-time child sexual abuse specialist funded by thi s grant
focuses on providing victim services including crisis intervention with victims and families of victims,
identifying and making referrals for immediate and long-term counseling services, monitoring and
coordinating services for children who are wards of the state and working with the local and state
agencies involved with the victim as well as working directly with local and state law enforcement and
service agencies to provide training, technical assistance and consultation.
The estimated fiscal impact is the remaining salary and fringe benefits of the child sexual abuse specialist
that would not be covered by the anticipated grant awards from the Illinois Attorney General 's Office and
the Department of Children and Family Services.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $18,064.00. Grant Award: $27,985.00. Funding period: July 1, 2004 through

GRANT A WARD RENEW AL

Transmitting a Com munication, dated January 9, 2004 from

requesting authorization to accept a grant renewal in the amount of $284,676.00 from the Illinois
Criminal Justice Information Authority (JCJIA) for the Prosecutor Based Victim Assistance Services Juvenile Court Program. The program funds three (3) delinquency courtroom specialists and one (I)
transfer speciali st who work in the Victim Assistance Program at Juvenile Court.
This grant requires that the office match 25% of the grant award. The match contribution for this
program is both an in-kind match as well as a cash match. The in-kind match fully supports the sa lary
and fringe benefits of one (1) of the juvenile court victim specialists. Due to increasing hospitalization
and other fringe benefit costs, the current grant award received by the office does not cover the full fringe
benefit costs of the three (3) federally-funded juvenile court specialists. The $28,787.00 in cash matching
funding will support the remaining hospitalization costs of the three (3) federa lly-funded juvenile court
specialists.
The authorization to apply for this grant was given on December 2, 2003 by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $28,787.00 [Year I: $ 14,393.00. Required Match: In-kind. Over Match:

Vice Chairman Butler called on the first Developer, Edmund C. Woodbury, McCaffrey Interests.
Commissioner Maldonado asked what the cost to Cook County would be for rent or lease space on an
annual basis.
Edmund Woodbury of McCaffrey Interests stated that in the example that was used the rent came to
slightly under $ 16.00 per square foot.
Commissioner Ma ldonado asked for the amount for 300,000 square feet.
Edmund Woodbury stated that it would be $4.5 million per year for the holding period; which is the five
year period or the 30 year period. Mr. Woodbury further stated that at the end of the five year period it
would have to be paid off by the construction loan.
Commissioner Maldonado asked whether the calculation would be differen t after five years.
Mr. Woodbury stated that he would get the information to the commissioner.
Commissioner Steele asked what would the approximate balloon cost be after the fifth year.
Mr. Woodbury responded that the cost would be approximately $50 million, and that he would supply the
information to the commissioners.
Commissioner Steele asked whether the other hospitals in the area would be interested in renting space if
Cook County were to follow the recommendations of McCaffrey Interests.
Edmund Woodbury stated that he has not checked with the other hospitals, but it would be possible.
Commissioner Collins asked Michael LaMont what the County currently pays for square footage for the
same amount of space and could the County meet the need for space.
Michael LaMont stated that in terms of space the range is 350,000 to 400,000 square feet. He stated that
a cost estimate of that building had not been done; there are, however, older cost estimates from years
ago.
Commissioner Collins stated that before a decision is made she would like the County to do a cost
comparison in terms of present need/plans for additional space versus the cost were the space to be
offered by the developer.
Commissioner Silvestri asked what happens if the County proceeds with trying to save the building and
the County Board decides that they don' t want to replace the Fantus Clinic.

663

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 19, 2004

Joe Antunovich of Antunovich Associates, stated that the campus would be designed from the inside out.
He also stated that a needs analysis would need to be conducted first.
Commissioner Si lvestri asked what Mr. Antunovich would do with the nurses' building if the Cook
County Board decided to not replace it.
Mr. Antunovich stated that the needs go beyond the capacity of the administration building. He further
stated that his firm would form a team with Cook County to determine those answers together.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the issue of land coverage under the Illinois
Medical District Plan Unit Development, Mr. Antunovich stated the following: His firm was made aware
of a letter submitted by the group that planned the hospital campus in 1998. This letter stated that in
response to questions about open space from the City Planning Department, the County was in violation
of the site and that the County had exceeded the 40% maximum land coverage called for in the plan
development. Mr. Antunovich stated that the County consultants responded that the County was indeed
over the 40% limit and that under the current plan the County was at 45%. This meant that the
recommendation wou ld be to take down the old Cook County Hospital, thus reducing the land coverage
to 32% which would allow for future development of the garage and other things. Mr. Antunovich
recommended that they look at the master plan that they put together which includes keeping the u-shape
arrangement, and building the parking garage as planned for in the master plan and budgeted for it in the
2004 Capital Budget. In conclusion Mr. Antunovich stated that their proposal conforms not only with the
lllinois Statute for uses, but the City Planned Development requirements for land coverage which has less
land coverage than the 40% maximum building build-out that is called for in the plan development.

Commissioner Hansen asked whether there is a significant advantage in the developer undertaking a
project like this rather than the County.
Edmund Woodbury stated that the tax credits are the primary benefit to the County. The County could
save $13.6 million. The second benefit is economy accrued.
Commissioner Hansen asked Michael LaMont whether the $50 million figure was accurate for building a
new administration building.
Mr. LaMont stated that according to the 1998 study, to remodel 321,000 square feet of building was
projected to cost $49.7 million. At that time the cost projected for a new building of 236,000 square feet
was $40.1 million.
Commissioner Hansen asked what the advantage is of dealing with the project entirely medical as
opposed to another configuration.
Mr. Antunovich stated that it meets the goa ls of the Illinois Medical District Act that was passed for the
Medical District Campus. It also meets the City of Chicago guidelines that the site be used primarily for
medical uses.
In response to Commissioner Daley's question regard ing what the cost would be for a new Fantus Clinic,
Mr. Antunovich stated that the full development cost would be $48 million for the replacement of the old
Fantus Clinic.
Commissioner Daley asked whether, under the lease, the $4.5 million includes real estate taxes.
Edmund Woodbury responded no, because it would be a triple net lease.

664

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 19, 2004

Commissioner Peraica asked whether Cook County would be able to receive the proper zoning were the
old Cook County Hospital not demolished, but instead adapted for reuse.
Mr. Antunovich responded in the affirmative; the proposal illustrates the necessary compliance.
Commissioner Murphy asked if they were to go forward with the project how soon would they begin.
Edmund Woodbury stated that the starting point for a project like this is to do a purchase and sale or lease
agreement with the County and then a 24-month schedule would be outlined. The faci lity would be
available as early as 2006.
Chairman Sims asked the developers why they want to do this project.
Edmund Woodbury stated that from his perspective as a citizen this is a very significant building in the
City of Chicago. His firm has already worked on other significant buildings in Chicago and there is no
reason why the Cook County Hospital should be demolished. Further he stated that it can have a useful
life into the future.
Vice Chainnan Butler asked if there is any profit margin for the developers.
Edmund Woodbury responded yes. He stated that there are fees associated with doing the development.
Mr. LaMont asked approximately how much is factored in for the exterior of the building.
Mr. Antunovich stated that they had a general contractor who is experienced; with the addition of the
fa9ade around the wings they would be spending approximately $10.5 million in the repair, restoration
and replacement of the windows. The enclosure of the building, not including the roof, would cost $ 10.1
million in hard construction.
Mr. LaMont asked whether the cost included a critical inspection of the facade.
Mr. Antunovich stated that they have done a visual study of the outside of the building, and the results of
the estimate bore out their inspection.
Mr. LaMont stated that the cost of a critical inspection of the old Cook County Hospital is very high
because drops must be done on every square inch of the building. Some of the critica l inspection has
begun in the northeast corner in response to the City of Chicago's comp laint against Cook County. Mr.
LaMont stated that if the County does not respond to the City of Chicago by March 31, 2004, the building
must come down. The City of Chicago would require the County to do a critical inspection of the facade.
Mr. Antunovich stated that the costs are included for the critical inspection.
Vice Chairman Butler proceeded to call upon the Alexander Company to make their presentation.

Commi ssioner Steele asked Mr. Volini if he expects the County to come up with any fu nds for the
project.
Mr. Volini stated that his proposal states that Cook County would be the owner, developer and occupant.

Chairman Butler called on the first Developer, Edmund C. Woodbury, McCaffrey Interests.
Commissioner Maldonado asked what the cost to Cook County would be for rent or lease space on an
annual basis.
Edmund Woodbury of McCaffrey Interests stated that in the example that was used the rent came to
slightly under $16.00 per square foot.
Commissioner Maldonado asked for the amount for 300,000 square feet.
Edmund Woodbury stated that it would be $4.5 million per year for the holding period; which is the five
year period or the 30 year period. Mr. Woodbury further stated that at the end of the five year period it
would have to be paid off by the construction loan.
Commissioner Maldonado asked whether the calculation would be different after five years.
Mr. Woodbury stated that he would get the infonnation to the commissioner.
Commissioner Steele asked what the approximate balloon cost would be after the fifth year.
Mr. Woodbury responded that the cost would be approximately $50 milli on, and that he would supply the
information to the commissioners.
Commissioner Steele asked whether the other hospitals in the area would be interested in renting space if
Cook County were to follow the recommendations of McCaffrey Interests.
Edmund Woodbury stated that he has not checked with the other hospitals, but it would be possible.
Commissioner Collins asked Michael LaMont what the County currently pays for square footage for the
same amount of space and could the County meet the need for space.
Michael LaMont stated that in terms of space the range is 350,000 to 400,000 square feet. He stated that
a cost estimate of that building had not been done; there are, however, older cost estimates from years
ago.
Commissioner Collins stated that before a decision is made she would like the County to do a cost
comparison in terms of present need/plans for additional space versus the cost were the space to be
offered by the developer.

673

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 19, 2004

Commissioner Silvestri asked what happens if the County proceeds with trying to save the building and
the County Board decides that they don't want to replace the Fantus Clinic.
Joe Antunovich of Antunovich Associates, stated that the campus would be designed from the inside out.
He also stated that a needs analysis would need to be conducted first.
Commissioner Silvestri asked what Mr. Antunovich would do with the nurses' building if the Cook
County Board decided to not replace it.
Mr. Antunovich stated that the needs go beyond the capacity of the administration building. He further
stated that his firm would form a team with Cook County to determine those answers together.
In response to Commissioner Hansen 's question regarding the issue of land coverage under the Illinois
Medical District Plan Unit Development, Mr. Antunovich stated the following: His firm was made aware
of a letter submitted by the group that planned the hospital campus in 1998. This letter stated that in
response to questions about open space from the City Planning Department, the County was in violation
of the site and that the County had exceeded the 40% maximum land coverage called for in the plan
development. Mr. Antunovich stated that the County consultants responded that the County was indeed
over the 40% limit and that under the current plan the County was at 45%. This meant that the
recommendation would be to take down the old Cook County Hospital, thus reducing the land coverage
to 32% which would allow for future development of the garage and other things. Mr. Antunovich
recommended that they look at the master plan that they put together which includes keeping the u-shape
arrangement, and building the parking garage as planned for in the master plan and budgeted for it in the
2004 Capital Budget. In conclusion Mr. Antunovich stated that their proposal conforms not only with the
Illinois Statute for uses, but the City Planned Development requirements for land coverage which has less
land coverage than the 40% maximum building build-out that is called for in the plan development.

Commissioner Hansen asked whether there is a significant advantage in the developer undertaking a
project like this rather than the County.
Edmund Woodbury stated that the tax credits are the primary benefit to the County. The County could
save $13.6 million. The second benefit is economy accrued.
Commissioner Hansen asked Michael LaMont whether the $50 million figure was accurate for building a
new administration building.
Mr. LaMont stated that according to the 1998 study, to remodel 321,000 square feet of building was
projected to cost $49.7 million. At that time the cost projected for a new building of 236,000 square feet
was $40.1 million.
Commissioner Hansen asked what the advantage is of dealing with the project entirely medical as
opposed to another configuration.
Mr. Antunovich stated that it meets the goals of the Illinois Medical District Act that was passed for the
Medical District Campus. It also meets the City of Chicago guidelines that the site be used primarily for
medical uses.
In response to Commissioner Daley 's question regarding what the cost would be for a new Fantus C linic,
Mr. Antunovich stated that the full development cost would be $48 million for the replacement of the old
Fantus Clinic.

674

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 19, 2004

Commissioner Daley asked whether, under the lease, the $4.5 million includes real estate taxes.
Edmund Woodbury responded no, because it would be a triple net lease.
Commissioner Peraica asked whether Cook County would be able to receive the proper zoning were the
old Cook County Hospital not demolished, but instead adapted for reuse.
Mr. Antunovich responded in the affirmative; the proposal illustrates the necessary compliance.
Commissioner Murphy asked if they were to go forward with the project how soon would they begin.
Edmund Woodbury stated that the starting point for a project like this is to do a purchase and sale or lease
agreement with the County and then a 24-month schedule would be outlined. The facility would be
available as early as 2006.
Commissioner Sims asked the developers why they want to do this project.
Edmund Woodbury stated that from his perspective as a citizen this is a very significant building in the
City of Chicago. His firm has already worked on other significant buildings in Chicago and there is no
reason why the Cook County Hospital should be demolished. Further he stated that it can have a useful
life into the future.
Chairman Butler asked if there is any profit margin for the developers.
Edmund Woodbury responded yes. He stated that there are fees associated with doing the development.
Mr. LaMont asked approximately how much is factored in for the exterior of the building.
Mr. Antunovich stated that they had a general contractor who is experienced; with the addition of the
facade around the wings they would be spending approximately $10.5 million in the repair, restoration
and replacement of the windows. The enclosure of the building, not including the roof, would cost $10.1
million in hard construction.
Mr. LaMont asked whether the cost included a critical inspection of the facade.
Mr. Antunovich stated that they have done a visual study of the outside of the building, and the results of
the estimate bore out their inspection.
Mr. LaMont stated that the cost of a critical inspection of the old Cook County Hospital is very high
because drops must be done on every square inch of the building. Some of the critical inspection has
begun in the northeast corner in response to the City of Chicago's complaint against Cook County. Mr.
LaMont stated that if the County does not respond to the City of Chicago by March 31 , 2004, the building
must come down. The City of Chicago would require the County to do a critical inspection of the facade.
Mr. Antunovich stated that the costs are included for the critical inspection.
Chairman Butler proceeded to call upon the Alexander Company to make their presentation.
Commissioner Silvestri asked whether the capital development plan includes a new Fantus Clinic or a
new office medical building.

675

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 19, 2004

Mr. LaMont responded that it does not include a new medical office building; it includes funding for the
redevelopment of Fantus Clinic at its current location.
Commissioner Silvestri asked the cost of the redevelopment of the Fantus Clinic .
Mr. LaMont stated that it is in the range of $35 to $40 million.
Commissioner Steele asked David Vos of the Alexander Company, to explain what he means by a
" mortgage and note".
Mr. Vos stated that they would lease the land itself from Cook County. The building itself would be
purchased by the Alexander Company and then the County would finance the building for them, which
means that the money would be given to Cook County 30 years from now when the balloon is due. The
Alexander Company would be giv ing the County 10% of the cash flow so that any funds that come out of
the project through cash flow would be used to help retire the interest that would accrue over the 30 years.
Commissioner Steele asked what is the intended use of the buildings.
Mr. Vos stated that the buildings would be used for medical offices and residences that would be made
first available to people who work in the hospitals a nd in the medical buildings in the district.
Commissioner Steele asked how much revenue would be generated.
Mr. Vos stated that some of the units would be affordable and some market rate. The price range would
range between $83 1.00 and $1,200 for a one bedroom, and between $989 and $ 1,600 for a two bedroom.
Chainnan Butler called on HASA Corporation to make their presentation.
Commissioner Sims asked the developer why he wants to do this project.
Ed Bowe, of HASA Corporation , stated that he believes in historic restoration and the reuse of properties
that are not so distressed that they cannot be adaptively reused. He also thinks that it is potentially
economically a gain for his company. He noted that others will be investing with him.
Chairman Butler ca lled on Town & Country Utilities to make their presentat ion.
Commissioner Sims asked the developer why he wants to do this project.
Tom Volini of Town & Country Utilities stated his motivation derives from the fact that four of hi s close
family members have spent about 40 years working in the o ld Cook County Hospital building.
Commissioner Steele asked Mr. Volini if he expects the County to come up with any funds for the
project.
Mr. Volini stated that his proposal states that Cook County would be the owner, developer and occupant.

foot per net lease able square foot on the commercial and the offices.
Mr. LaMont stated that a large part of the financing of this project, whether it is by the County or a
private developer, is from the revenue stream from the expansion of the parking garage.

676

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 19, 2004

Mr. Volini stated that the attributable revenue is the commercial and office parking yield which is
$835,850 and the hospital parking yield that he is projecting according to a formula of 1,632 parking
spaces at $10.00 times one half times 365, which computes to $2,978,400.
