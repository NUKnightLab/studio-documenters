3. Discussion and Possible Action Regarding Legislative Matters
Regina Tuczak, Executive Director, summarized the status of proposed legislation that had been
separately prepared by the County and the Board of the Fund and which were intended to address the
funding status of the County Fund and the Forest Preserve District Fund. It was noted that Mr. John
McCabe, the Fund’s Legislative Representative was present and able to respond to any questions
that might arise related to the legislative process.
The Executive Director stated that the County had prepared legislation that proposed actuariallybased contributions from the employer, but also proposed changes to the composition of the Board,
codification of the administration of retiree healthcare benefits within a trust, along with other
matters. The proposed legislation was reviewed by Fund staff, external counsel and the Fund’s
health and actuarial consultants. Following these discussions, a table outlining various issues was
presented for the trustees’ consideration at a Special Meeting on May 10, 2019. With the Board’s
direction, two trustees, Fund staff and fiduciary counsel met with the County on May 17, 2019, to
discuss the issues raised by legislation that was proposed by the County. Subsequent to that
meeting, the Board also met with representatives from labor at the Chicago Federation of Labor, on
May 23, 2019, who shared similar concerns on components of the County’s draft legislation.
At the Board meeting on June 6, 2019, the Executive Director reported on the discussion with the
County on May 17, 2019, and shared the employer’s requests for clarification about certain matters
and its interest in continuing the dialogue.
At the Board meeting on June 6, 2019, the Board then authorized Fund representatives to prepare
3

 separate legislation for actuarially-based funding alone, as the matter of most significant concern to
the trustees, noting such legislation would not address board composition or healthcare issues. The
Board considered the support of labor for this legislation based upon comments from the May 23,
2019, meeting with labor representatives. Based upon similar legislation enacted for local funds, the
Fund’s staff worked with external counsel to prepare draft legislation which proposed a three-year
ramp and a funding level of 90% by 2062. The draft legislation was presented for the Board’s
consideration at their meeting on July 11, 2019. After review by the Board, it was determined that
the actuarial analysis needed for the legislation did not encompass all the relevant issues for the
County Fund and did not provide any analysis for the Forest Fund. The actuary was engaged to
provide further analysis needed for the proposed legislation.
The Executive Director reported that the Fund’s actuary had performed the analysis as requested and
was presented to the Board. She noted that in the actuary’s analysis, it was recommended that any
proposed legislation should, among other things, amortize the unfunded liability to achieve a 100%
funding level over 30 years. The trustees considered the draft legislation and the actuary’s analysis.
They also discussed the potential benefits and risks of pursuing legislation similar to other local
funds and legislation that would achieve a funding level of 100%. They noted that the proposed
legislation for 90% funding provided less employer contributions than the Intergovernmental
Agreement (“IGA”) for at least the County Fund, but that the IGA was negotiated annually and was
not codified. They also discussed concerns that legislation the Board had proposed in prior years for
100% funding did not advance before the General Assembly. They noted that the Board could
continue its discussions with the County on the employer’s proposed legislation, but also remain
active with the Board’s own funding legislation. The Legislative Representative advised that in
order for any proposed funding legislation to be successful, the Fund’s discussions with the County
and labor representatives should continue.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Fitzgerald that the Board authorize the
Executive Director and external counsel to request the Fund’s actuary to calculate the actuarial
required contributions necessary to obtain 100% funding of pension and healthcare liability
amortized over a 30 year period initiated with a three year contribution increase ramp for both the
County Fund and the Forest Preserve District Fund at a cost not to exceed $4,500, and that external
counsel prepare draft legislation incorporating the actuary’s analysis for such funding proposals.

4. Benefit Matters – Update on Furlough Legislation Calculation Considerations
The Executive Director stated that the Fund was in contact with the employer to establish the
procedures needed to allow employees to purchase service credit and/or salary credit for periods that
they were on furlough or received reductions in salary, respectively, as permitted by P.A. 101-0011
(“Furlough Legislation”). The Board had indicated that when the data certified by the employer was
different from the data maintained in PBMS, the Fund may need certification from the Comptroller
about the salary reduction amounts to be used.
4

 The trustees discussed that some salary assumptions submitted by the employees’ departments may
be based on subjective factors. The Comptroller would work with the Fund staff to reach some
resolution about how to address these discrepancies. Fund staff was directed to utilize the
calculation that provided the lower benefit for any member whose annuity was to be approved by the
Board at the next meeting because the benefit could be increased at a later time. Fund staff was also
asked to identify such members separately on the schedules presented for the approval of annuity
benefits.
5. Approval of Recommendation of Investment Committee – Investment Manager Fees
The Executive Director stated that the Investment Committee had directed Fund staff and Callan
Associates to contact identified investment managers for the purpose of renegotiating their fees,
based upon data supplied and various comparisons. She reported that these efforts were successful
and that MacKay Shields, Wells Fargo and Frontier Capital Mack agreed to reduce their annual fees
as presented to the Investment Committee at their meeting on July 22, 2019.
It was moved by Trustee Goode and seconded by Trustee Fitzgerald that the Board adopt the
recommendation made by the Investment Committee at their meeting on July 22, 2019, that the
proposal to reduce the investment manager fees due to MacKay Shields be accepted as presented,
and it is further moved that Fund staff shall take all action reasonably necessary to effectuate the
foregoing including the execution and delivery of any related written agreement on behalf of the
County Fund by the Executive Director.

6. Finance Matters
a. Presentation of GASB Reporting for Pension Amounts and Postemployment Healthcare
Amounts
The Executive Director stated that the Fund’s auditor, Legacy Professionals, LLP, had
prepared the 2018 Schedule of Postemployment Healthcare Amounts and 2018 Schedule of
Pension Amounts for both the County Fund and the Forest Preserve District Fund. The
employer has typically requested these reports for their financial statements in order to
comply with various GASB requirements. It was noted that since the implementation of
GASBs 68 and 75, the parties agreed that the employer could rely upon the Fund’s auditor’s
reports for purposes of compliance with the new rule. President Wilson noted that Legacy’s
procedures are part of a reciprocal arrangement with the County’s auditor RSM. Under the
agreement, the Pension Fund’s auditor, Legacy, relies upon certain RSM’s County payroll
audit procedures.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee Nevius that the 2018 Schedule
of Postemployment Healthcare Amounts and the 2018 Schedule of Pension Amounts for the
County Fund as audited by Legacy Professionals, LLP, be received and filed.

b. CAFR Distribution
It was reported by the Executive Director that the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports
(“CAFR”) were nearly completed and that they would be made available to any trustee upon
request.
7. Health Matters – Policy Implementation Request
The Executive Director reported that the Board required all disabled members under the age of 65 to
enroll in Medicare Parts A and B as of June 6, 2019. She stated that due to Medicare’s enrollment
requirements, many disabled members with only Part A coverage cannot obtain Part B coverage
until July 1, 2020. The Board considered allowing such members to continue coverage in the CCPF
Health Plan to July 1, 2020; such members would be charged the non-Medicare premium rate, until
they would be able to begin coverage under Medicare Part B.
6

 It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee Nevius that the Board allow disabled
members who participate in the CCPF Health Plan, and who are currently enrolled in Medicare Part
A, but not eligible for coverage under Medicare Part B until July 1, 2020, to continue CCPF Health
Plan coverage to July 1, 2020, and that any claims submitted by such members be paid on an
exception basis.

MOTION ADOPTED BY VOICE VOTE

8. Administrative Matters - Executive Director Report
It was reported by the Executive Director that she had confirmed with Segal Consultants and the
Fund’s fiduciary counsel that the Fund was required to pay the Patient Centered Outcomes Research
Initiative (“PCORI”) fee for the current year. Fund staff noted that under the current status of the
Affordable Care Act, this was the last year that the PCORI fee would be due.
She also reported that the Fund’s presentation before the County Board’s Pension Committee on July
18, 2019, at the request of Commissioner Bridget Gainer, was well received. One Commissioner
inquired about whether the Board would consider a life insurance option within the health benefits
plan. The trustees discussed that it did not have authority under the Illinois Pension Code to provide
a life insurance option and that it might be more advantageous for retirees to convert the insurance
provided to employees to a personal policy upon retirement.
The Executive Director stated that the Fund’s verification of ‘out-of-state’ annuitants continued, but
that it would extend the time for such annuitants to respond to September 15, 2019. She also
reported that it is the time of year in which various client requirement documents (“CRD”) must be
completed. These documents include plan specifications used by United Healthcare to ensure that
the appropriate coding of the benefits is in place for the subsequent year. As has been the Fund’s
practice, these documents will be signed directly by staff, as they are considered administrative plan
operations that do not require Board or Health Benefits Committee action. The CRD would be
reviewed by Segal Consultants before they would be signed on behalf of the Fund.
It was reported that the implementation of a casual business attire dress code for the summer was
appreciated by Fund staff and enabled them to continue to perform outstanding member service with
professionalism. The Executive Director stated that casual business attire has been allowed for the
staffs at other local public pension funds. The Fund would continue this practice on a permanent
basis after Labor Day, with the exception that more formal business dress would be required for staff
attending Board and Committee meetings and on such days as might be designated by the Executive
Director.
The trustees were advised that effective August 1, 2019, all email communications to the trustees
would only be sent to the email addresses assigned to them by the Fund. Some trustees have
confirmed that they have been able to use the Fund email, but others have not. The practice of
sending email communications to both the trustees’ personal email and Fund email addresses would
be discontinued. Instead, those trustees who still receive emails from the Fund directed to their
personal email addresses will be advised that they need to check their Fund trustee mail to read the
substantive communication most recently directed to them.

 The Executive Director advised the Board that the Health Benefits Committee would meet on
August 6, 2019 at 9:30 am. The Legislative Committee would meet on August 21, 2019 at 8:30 am
and would be followed by a Health Benefits Committee meeting at 9:30 am.
The Executive Director reported that she had received more detailed information about the invoice
received from Buck Consultants for services related to the transition to the new actuary in the
amount of $8,900 that had been presented to the Board at their meeting on July 11, 2019. The
trustees noted that Buck had performed the services requested by Fund staff in a three-page memo
for purposes of the transition.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Fitzgerald that the invoice from Buck
Consultants, LLC for $8,900 be paid by the Fund.
