 ACTION REQUESTED
Request that the Board of Directors adopt the following
resolution:
Resolution 2019-034 which will amend the functional classification system
by revising SR 94 (State Road) from a minor arterial to a major collector,
and CR 4 (Auburn Road) from a major collector to a local road

PREVIOUS ACTION
Recommended by the Planning and Programming
Committee and Transportation Subcommittee
5-81

 State Road (SR 94)

BACKGROUND

• From the River Road intersection
near the Medina County Line to
Edgerton Road (CR 63)
• Downgrade from Minor Arterial
(FC=4) to Major Collector (FC=5)
• Will match classification to the
south
• Total mileage is 1.46 miles

5-81

 BACKGROUND

ODOT requested to correct the classification of Auburn Road (CR 4)
in Geauga County by downgrading from a Major Collector (FC=05)
to a Local Road (FC=07) between the Portage County Line (Harner
Road) and Washington Street (CR 606).

5-81

 BACKGROUND

Functional Classification Revision Procedure:
•

Three steps in the evaluation process

•

All three steps must be met to recommend the functional classification
change

•

Recommendations that result from the evaluation process will proceed
through the committee process

•

After Board concurrence, the information will be forwarded to ODOT and
FHWA for further review and action

5-81

 BACKGROUND

Functional Classification Policy was adopted by the Board of
Directors in June 2014 (Resolution 2014-025)
Step 1
• Roadway attributes are compared against thresholds for the
requested functional classification change.
Step 2
• Determine if the current functional classification, as well as,
the requested functional classification is over or under
served by those functional classifications in its region
Step 3
• Functional Classification Accessibility – Density Analysis

5-81

 BACKGROUND

Step 1:
State Road (SR 94) functional classification revision request
• The current FC is minor arterial, which connects to a major collector
at the Medina County line.
• As per policy, a roadway of a higher classification should not connect
to a single roadway of lower classification.
• For a functional classification request to be recommended, all three
steps in the procedure must be met. Since State Rd does not meet
the requirements of step 1 to remain a minor arterial, there is no
need to continue to step 2.
5-81

 BACKGROUND

Step 1:
Auburn Road (CR 4) functional classification revision
request
• ODOT mistakenly extended the major collector classification of Auburn Rd.
to the Geauga /Portage County line.
• NOACA had previously analyzed this section of Auburn and recommended
it be classified as a local route.
• Does not meet the requirements to remain a major collector

5-81

 Recommendation:

BACKGROUND

• SR 94 (State Road) functional classification revision to a
major collector
• CR 4 (Auburn Road) functional classification revision to a
local road

5-81

 NEXT STEPS

Following Board adoption, staff will forward
recommendations to ODOT and FHWA for further review
and approval

5-81

 ACTION

Approval of Resolution 2019-034, which approves the
functional classification amendment recommendations:
• SR 94 (State Road) functional classification revision to a major collector
• CR 4 (Auburn Road) functional classification revision to a local road
