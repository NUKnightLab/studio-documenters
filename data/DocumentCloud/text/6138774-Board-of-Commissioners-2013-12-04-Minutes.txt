PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CONCERNING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONCEAL CARRY ACT IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, the Illinois General Assembly was required by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to enact a conceal
carry law and did so passing the Firearm Concealed Carry Act, giving the Illinois State Police 180 days to
implement a license system, and
WHEREAS, under the Act, local law enforcement agencies may object to an application if their objection is based
upon a reasonable suspicion that the applicant is a danger to him/herself or others, or a threat to public safety, and
WHEREAS, the license process is based on an already overburdened Firearm Owner Identification Card system;
and
WHEREAS, there are already 300,000 FOID card holders in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, in Cook County alone, nearly 4000 revoked FOID card holders still maintain their FOID card and
firearms compelling the Cook County Sheriff’s Office to dedicate a gun team to recovering FOID cards from
revoked possessors to protect the safety and welfare of the citizens of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the conceal carry license process as currently developed is likely to overburden local law enforcement
agencies and exacerbate an already devastating gun violence problem in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office seeks to educate the Cook County Board of Commissioners on the
financial and operational burden of the Act and establish a uniform procedure for identifying and objecting to
unsuitable concealed carry license applicants; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook County
hereby convene a meeting of the Cook County Board’s Law Enforcement Committee to consider the impact of the
Act on law enforcement agencies throughout Cook County.

Request: Approval of intergovernmental agreement
Good(s) or Service(s): Housing Counseling services for the Circuit Court’s Mortgage Foreclosure Mediation
Program.
Agreement period: 12/1/2013 - 11/30/2016.
Fiscal Impact: $4,399,731.00
Accounts: 310-260
Agreement Number(s): N/A
Summary: Under this intergovernmental agreement, the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA)
will
operate a toll-free housing counseling helpline service and manage and administer housing counseling services as a
part of the Circuit Court’s Mortgage Foreclosure Mediation Program. IHDA’s helpline provides critical information
to families facing foreclosure, assigns families to a HUD-certified housing counseling agency, and schedules
housing counseling workshops and appointments for families. Housing counseling services are provided
county-wide by IHDA’s 12 HUD-certified subcontractors which were selected after a rigorous application process.
Services provided by the subcontractors include: housing counseling workshops; one-on-one housing counseling
with families; assistance with applying for loan modifications; and identifying other options to avoid foreclosure
whenever possible. As of 9/30/2013, IHDA’s subcontractors assisted more than 130,000 families through
the
helpline, provided over 30,000 families with free one-on-one initial housing counseling sessions, and conducted
more than 200 housing counseling workshops throughout Cook County at which almost 6,000 families received
assistance. Each family receives an average of four, one-on-one counseling sessions.
The Illinois Housing Development Authority was originally selected to manage the program’s hotline and
counseling services with the initiation of the Mortgage Foreclosure Mediation Program in March 2010. A request for
proposal (RFP) was completed for these services earlier this year; IHDA provided the only proposal to the
programs’ hotline and counseling services components.

Summary: Since January 16, 2013, per an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between Cook County ("County"),
by and through the Department of Revenue ("DOR"), and the Office of the Cook County State's Attorney and the
State of Illinois, by and through its State Comptroller's Office, the County has participated in the Local Debt
Recovery Program, whereby the Illinois Office of the Comptroller has assisted in collecting unpaid debt owed to the
County. Authorization is hereby requested to amend the existing IGA. The amendments clarify the process for
administration of the program, usage of new software acquired by the Illinois Office of the Comptroller, notice
requirements and future amendments.
Since the IGA was originally executed, a small pilot program involving the Individual Use Tax has resulted in
collection of approximately $25,000 in outstanding debt for the County. We hope to include additional tax types to
increase the amount of collection over the coming year.
This Intergovernmental Agreement has been reviewed and approved as to form by the Cook County State's Attorney
Office.
