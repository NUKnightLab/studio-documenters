PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REGARDING THE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO
CONDUCT AN ADVICE AND CONSENT HEARING ON THE PRESIDENT’S NOMINATION
OF JUDGE MERRICK GARLAND TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
WHEREAS, the Supreme Court, in its capacity as the highest federal court in the United States, serves
an essential function resolving critical questions of law that affect our community, our economy, and all
citizens; and
WHEREAS, the Constitution of the United States provides that the Senate shall provide Advice and
Consent for appointments to the Supreme Court of the United States; and
WHEREAS, the Supreme Court vacancy caused by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia occurred on
February 13, 2016, 269 days before the 2016 presidential election; and
WHEREAS, the Senate has confirmed more than a dozen Supreme Court justices in presidential election
years, including five in the last 100 years; and
WHEREAS, the Senate’s constitutional duty to advise and consent on judicial nominees is one of its
most important and solemn responsibilities; and
WHEREAS, the Senate Judiciary Committee has never denied a Supreme Court nominee a hearing since
it began holding public confirmation hearings; and
WHEREAS, if the Senate refuses to consider a Supreme Court nominee until after the next President is
sworn into office, it will result in the longest Supreme Court vacancy since the Civil War; and
WHEREAS, every Supreme Court nominee who was not withdrawn by the President has received a vote
by the Senate within 125 days of the nomination announcement; and
Page 3 of 70

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

May 11, 2016

WHEREAS, since 1975, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation vote for a
Supreme Court nominee has been 70 days; and
WHEREAS, forcing the Supreme Court to function with only eight justices risks creating instances in
which the Court is evenly divided on the outcome of a case, preventing the Court from resolving
conflicting interpretations of the Constitution among different regions of the Nation and thereby
undermining the Supreme Court’s role as the final arbiter of the law; and
WHEREAS, President Obama has nominated Merrick Garland, Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, who has an established track record of building consensus
as a thoughtful, fair-minded judge who follows the law.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Senate should perform its constitutional duty to
provide advice and consent on the President’s Supreme Court nominee by:
1) Promptly scheduling a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee for Judge Merrick Garland, so
that he can be considered on his merits in an open and transparent manner; and
2) Holding a confirmation vote on the Senate floor, with opportunity for debate on Judge Merrick
Garland’s nomination; and
3) Working on behalf of the people of the United States to ensure that the vacancy on the Supreme
Court is filled without undue and unnecessary delay so that the Supreme Court can effectively serve
its essential constitutional function as the final arbiter of the law.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this resolution be sent to Senate Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Senator Richard Durbin, and Senator Mark Kirk.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
SUPPORTING THE RESIDENTS OF COOK COUNTY AND FUNDING EMPLOYMENT
OPPORTUNITY FOR RESIDENTS BY REDUCING THE SALARY OF EACH COOK COUNTY
COMMISSIONER AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF
COMMISSIONERS BY $10,000.00 PER ANNUM
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has recently taken the Community Stabilization
and Anti-Violence Act of Cook County under consideration; and
WHEREAS, an aspect of that legislation will raise the taxes on motor fuel by $0.04 per gallon; and
WHEREAS, the tax is expected to generate roughly $50,000,000.00 in additional revenues; and
WHEREAS, the proceeds of this tax shall be reserved, in large part, for the use of the Cook County Jobs
Council for the purpose of providing meaningful employment opportunities and employment training to
Cook County residents between the ages of 16 and 24; and
WHEREAS, stabilizing communities and reducing violence in the most vulnerable neighborhoods of
Cook County are critically important endeavors, requiring sacrifice from all residents of Cook County;
and
WHEREAS, residents of Cook County, too often, feel disconnected from the elected officials who serve
them; and
WHEREAS, elected officials should make a concerted effort to be an example for the communities who
have placed them in a position of power and responsibility; and
WHEREAS, the members of this Board of Commissioners and the President of the Cook County Board
receive generous salaries paid for from the tax dollars of the County; and
WHEREAS, in many instances, the salaries that the members of the Board of Commissioners receive are
not the sole source of income for the members; and
WHEREAS, the salaries that the members of the Cook County Board of Commissioners receive are
substantially greater than the median per capita income of Cook County which is $30,048.00 per year;
and
WHEREAS, the senior citizens of Cook County did not receive a Cost of Living Adjustment in their
Social Security Benefits for Fiscal Year 2016; and
Page 6 of 70

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

May 11, 2016

WHEREAS, the principle of shared sacrifice and the mandate to “do more with less” should apply not
just to the citizens of Cook County, but to the elected officials that represent them; and
WHEREAS, shared sacrifice in deed rather than in word will do much to strengthen the trust between
the elected officials of Cook County and the people of Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners do hereby support reducing their own salaries by $10,000.00 per annum for the purpose
of funding public works projects and creating meaningful jobs for the residents of Cook County who are
affected by high unemployment;
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the President intends to recommend the appropriation of the funds
saved by virtue of the aforementioned reductions in salary be especially dedicated to funding of
employment opportunities for residents of Cook County aged 16-24.

Sponsored by: RICHARD R. BOYKIN, County Commissioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
SUPPORT FOR ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY HOUSE BILL 4633 AND
CONDEMNATION OF LIFE INSURERS WHO REFUSE TO FIND BENEFICIARIES OF
UNCLAIMED BENEFITS
WHEREAS, the 99th General Assembly of the State of Illinois has recently considered House Bill 4633;
and
WHEREAS, House Bill 4633 will create the Unclaimed Life Insurance Benefits Act; and
WHEREAS, The Act will require all authorized insurers regulated by the Illinois Department of
Insurance to undertake good faith efforts to locate beneficiaries and make payment funds owed to those
beneficiaries; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners is entrusted with the responsibility for the
welfare of the residents of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, United States Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) has recently called upon Cook County-based
insurance company, Kemper Corp. to disavow the practice of withholding unclaimed beneficiary funds;
and
WHEREAS, Kemper Corp, an insurer with several subsidiaries, headquartered in Cook County, has $8
billion dollars in assets; and
WHEREAS, Kemper Corp. and its subsidiaries hold billions of dollars in unclaimed benefits; and
WHEREAS, Kemper Corp. and its subsidiaries profit and bolster their bottom line by intentionally
withholding beneficiaries’ rightful funds; and
Page 7 of 70

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

May 11, 2016

WHEREAS, At the same time that many of the residents of Cook County experience financial hardships
as a result of the death of loved ones, Kemper Corp. and other Insurers record massive profits; and
WHEREAS, The State of Illinois and 40 other states have recently filed suit against insurers to force
them to allow an audit; and
WHEREAS, Kemper Corp. has filed suit to stop Illinois from auditing its records of unclaimed benefit
payments; and
WHEREAS, the corporate entities of Cook County should hold themselves to the highest standards of
ethics, decency, and good corporate citizenship; and
WHEREAS, withholding unclaimed funds and making no efforts to locate beneficiaries, as well as
obstructing efforts to require compliance with Illinois law fall far short of these standards; and
WHEREAS, the practices of not locating or notifying beneficiaries and denying beneficiaries with a
rightful claim to life insurance proceeds could amount to the tortious act of conversion; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board will not sit silently while a corporate citizen of Cook County
perpetrates such harm on the residents of Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners do hereby support and encourage the 99th General Assembly of the State of Illinois in
the passage of House Bill 4633 and strongly encourage Governor Rauner to sign such legislation into
law; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners
strongly encourage Kemper Corp. and its subsidiaries to dismiss its suit against the State of Illinois and
fully submit to the State’s effort to audit their policy records; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners
condemn in the strongest terms, the actions of life insurers who sell policies to the residents of Cook
County and have willfully and wantonly withheld payment of claims and refused to find and notify
beneficiaries.
