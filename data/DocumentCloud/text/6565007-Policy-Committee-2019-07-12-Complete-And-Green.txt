BACKGROUND
Green Streets:
Green Streets reflect the transportation policy and design approach that minimizes
environmental impact by focusing on efforts to retain, treat and eliminate runoff at the
source using green infrastructure applications. Green infrastructure helps replicate natural
hydrologic functions like storage, detention, infiltration, filtration, evaporation, transpiration,
and uptake by plants, and can improve water quality and reduce runoff volumes. These
natural functions are often lost in transportation projects where impervious road surfaces
prevent rain water from soaking into the ground.

 BACKGROUND
City of Cleveland Heights
• Resolution No. 37-2018
•

Complete and Green Streets are roadways designed and operated to safely and
comfortably accommodate users of all ages and abilities, including cyclists,
pedestrians, transit riders, elderly, delivery and service personnel, and emergency
responders; and to reduce, accommodate and slow stormwater runoff as part of a
comprehensive stormwater management system.

BACKGROUND

NEORSD:

 

Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District Green Infrastructure Policy

We actively pursue opportunities across our program areas to advocate for strategic and
cost?effective impiemen tation and maintenance ofgreen infrastructure technoiogies and
innovations that protect, preserve, enhance and restore the naturalI hvdroiogic function of
our region?s watersheds. in addition, we seek to maximise the co-benefits provided by green
infrastructure projects including opportunities to expand urban naturalI areas, enhance air
quaiitv, and improve ofiife in Northeast Ohio.

 BACKGROUND
Why Develop a Stand Alone Complete and Green Streets Policy
•
•
•
•

5-1

To change practice, integrating the needs of all road users into everyday
transportation planning and design practices
To create a complete network of streets that serve all users
To ensure every transportation project becomes an opportunity to help create a
complete and green street
To implement NOACA’s Regional Strategic Plan

 BACKGROUND
Complete and Green Streets are not
• A design prescription
• A mandate for immediate retrofit

5-1

 BACKGROUND
Draft Complete and Green Streets Policy
• All projects requesting inclusion to the LRTP and/or TIP will be reviewed
against this policy for opportunities to expand complete and green streets in
the NOACA region.
• All projects requesting NOACA administered funds shall be required to
adhere to this policy and are therefore eligible for NOACA funding
participation to implement complete and green street recommendations.

5-1

 BACKGROUND
Goals of the Draft Complete and Green Streets Policy
• Create a comprehensive, integrated, and connected transportation network
that supports sustainable development and provides livable communities.
• Ensure safety, ease of use, and ease of transfer between modes for all users
of the transportation system.
• Restore the natural hydrologic function of the region’s watersheds.
• Provide flexibility for different types of streets, areas, and users.

 NEXT STEPS
Committee input will be used to further develop the
Complete and Green Streets Policy. The updated policy
will be brought back to the Committee at its October
2019 meeting.

5-1

 NOACA will STRENGTHEN regional
cohesion, PRESERVE existing
infrastructure, and BUILD a
sustainable multimodal transportation
system to SUPPORT economic
development and ENHANCE quality
of life in Northeast Ohio.
