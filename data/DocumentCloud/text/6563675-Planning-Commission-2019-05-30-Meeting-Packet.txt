Location: The site is located in Richfield Township, east of Brecksville Road, at the terminus of
Columbia Road.
Proposal: The applicant proposes to add approximately 1700 LF of proposed roadway to be
dedicated at the end of existing Columbia Rd, (approx. 1550 LF) to end in a cul-de-sac.
The applicant is requesting a variance from Subdivision Regulation 1108.10 (a) Cul-de-sac,
which states a commercial/industrial park cul-de-sac shall not be exceed 1,300’ in length.
The proposed roadway to go through parcel 4802322 and terminating in parcel 4802159.
The site is proposed to be serviced by Central Water (Cleveland Water) and Sewer (will tie into
Village of Richfield’s System).
Site History:
• Previous iterations of this site have come before the planning commission in the past.
This proposal though similar to previous proposals is a new design.
1a. Variance Request:

Summit County Planning Commission

Page 1 of 7

 Columbia Rd. – Preliminary Plan

The applicant is requesting a variance from Subdivision Regulation 1108.10 (a) Cul-de-sac, which
states a commercial/industrial park cul-de-sac shall not be exceed 1,300’ in length.
1108.10 Cul-De-Sac and Dead-End Streets (a) … In commercial/industrial parks cul-de-sacs
shall not be longer than one thousand three hundred (1,300) feet.

The following narratives were submitted in response to the questions posed in the variance
application. Staff comments are bold and italicized.
i.

Are there exceptional topographic or other physical conditions peculiar to this
particular parcel or land? If, so please explain.
The site borders the Ohio Turnpike to the south which limits connections to
surrounding roads.
The site has the Ohio Turnpike along the south and existing developments to the
north which prevent road connections, the only viable road connection would be
to Black Rd. which could be adverse to the existing residential neighborhood
located there. The existing roadway is already in excess of the permitted 1300 ft.

ii.

What is the unnecessary hardship which will result from a literal enforcement of
the Subdivision Regulation owing to the special conditions set forth in
subparagraph (i.) herein?
Since the existing road is already in excess of 1300 LF, the only way the subdivision
regulations could be enforced would be for Columbia Road to be extended thru to
Black Road. Residents in township do [not] want road extended east to meet up
with existing Columbia Road and Black Road Intersection. There are no other
streets abutting the property that could be connected into because of turnpike.
The existing roadway is already in excess of the permitted 1300 ft. the only viable
road connection would be to Black Rd. which could be adverse to the existing
residential neighborhood located there.

iii.

Did the special conditions specified in subparagraph (i.) result from previous
actions by the applicant? Please explain.
No, turnpike was pre-existing.
No.

iv.

Explain whether the variance requested is substantial.
We do not believe it is substantial since an emergency access will be established
between the end of cul-de-sac and existing Columbia Road at Black Road.

Summit County Planning Commission

Page 2 of 7

 Columbia Rd. – Preliminary Plan

The variance request is substantial, as the applicant is requesting an additional
1700 ft. of roadway on a roadway that is already 1550 ft. going well beyond the
permitted 1300 ft.
v.

Explain whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be substantially
altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a substantial detriment as a
result of the variance.
The character of the neighbor to the east would actually be altered more if the
proposed road was extended East to connect into existing Columbia Road & Black
Road Intersection since you would potentially have cut-thru and commercial traffic
more likely to pass thru the residential zoned areas.
The essential character of the neighborhood would not change with the granting
of the variance nor would adjoining properties suffer substantial detriment.

vi.

Will the variance adversely affect the delivery of governmental services, including
but not limited to, access by firefighting apparatus, law enforcement vehicles,
ambulance and emergency vehicles and similar services relative to ingress and
egress to the affected site and adjacent land?
No, a gated emergency access easement/drive will be extended out to existing
Columbia Road and Black Road Intersection ... final location still to be worked out
based on site planning of future industrial development planned on the east half of
the remaining land.
With the permanent cul-de-sac and emergency access drive out to Black Rd, this
variance would NOT adversely affect the delivery of governmental services,
including but not limited to, access by firefighting apparatus, law enforcement
vehicles, ambulance and emergency vehicles and similar services relative to
ingress and egress to the affected site and adjacent land.

vii.

Explain whether the Subdivision Regulation was in effect at the time of acquisition
of the property by the applicant and whether the applicant purchased the property
with the knowledge of the Regulation.
The end of the current public portion of Columbia Road already exceeds 1300 LF
(without cul-de-sac). This section of Columbia Road was planned as part of the
Friedman Industrial Park in 1965. At that time it was likely assumed that the road
would be connected thru to Black Road. The applicant is aware of this requirement
since this variance has been previously granted for this site.
Yes.

viii.

Explain whether the applicant’s predicament can be feasibly solved through some
method other than a variance.

Summit County Planning Commission

Page 3 of 7

 Columbia Rd. – Preliminary Plan

We do not believe it can, especially if the township residents to not want this street
connecting to existing Columbia Road.
The road could be extended to the corner of Black and Columbia Rd. however as
mentioned elsewhere that could adversely affect the residential neighborhood at
that intersection.
ix.

Explain how the variance from the Subdivision Regulations will not be contrary to
the public interest.
Based on opinions of the surrounding residents, they believe it is in their best
interest that the road not be extended east to connect to existing Columbia
Road/Black Road. Gated Emergency Access Drive, however, will be extended to
Columbia Road.
This variance would not be contrary to public interest as the access and use would
not pose a threat/concern to public safety or the character of the neighborhood.

x.

Explain how the spirit and intent behind the Subdivision Regulations will be
observed if the variance is granted.
Since an emergency access road/easement will be constructed to provide a
secondary means of access to the development, we think the spirit of the regulations
is still observed.
The spirit and intent of the following purposes and objectives of the Regulations
as listed in § 1101.02:
(a)
The proper arrangement of streets or highways in relation to existing or
proposed streets and highways and the thoroughfare plan.
This variance request is for a longer cul-de-sac than the subdivision
regulations allow for. The cul-de-sac would prevent industrial traffic from
going through adjoining residential neighborhoods.
(b)
Adequate and convenient open spaces for traffic, utilities, access for
firefighting apparatus, recreation, light and air, and the avoidance of
congestion of the population.
With the permanent cul-de-sac and emergency access drive out to Black
Rd, this variance would NOT adversely affect the adequate and
convenient open spaces for traffic, utilities, access for firefighting
apparatus, recreation, light and air, and the avoidance of congestion of
the population.
(c)
The orderly, efficient, and appropriate development of land.
This variance request is for a longer cul-de-sac than the subdivision
regulations allow for. The cul-de-sac would prevent industrial traffic from
going through adjoining residential neighborhoods.
(d)
The orderly and efficient provision of community facilities at minimum cost
and maximum convenience.
This would not impact the orderly and efficient provision of community

facilities.
Safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian movement.
This variance request is for a longer cul-de-sac than the subdivision
regulations allow for. The cul-de-sac would prevent industrial traffic from
going through adjoining residential neighborhoods.
The promotion of public health, safety, comfort, convenience, prosperity,
and general welfare, and the protection of the environment.
This variance request is for a longer cul-de-sac than the subdivision
regulations allow for. The cul-de-sac would prevent industrial traffic from
going through adjoining residential neighborhoods.
The accurate surveying of land, preparing and recording of plats.
This would not impact the accurate surveying of land, preparing and
recording of plats.
The equitable handling of all subdivision plats by providing uniform
procedures and standards for observance by both the approving authority
and Developer as defined herein.

Explain how the requested variance is the minimum variance to the Subdivision
Regulations that will allow for a reasonable division of land.
This proposed length of street will be adequate to be able to subdivide the land on
the east half of the development while providing frontage to the west (Union Sand
Portion) and middle portion of the development--providing options for subdividing
future lands for future development and industrial tax base.
The existing roadway is already in excess of the permitted 1300 ft. the only viable
road connection would be to Black Rd. which could be adverse to the existing
residential neighborhood located there.

Staff Comments: Variances are to alleviate unnecessary hardships imposed by literal enforcement
of the subdivision regulations due to exceptional topographic or other physical conditions peculiar
to a parcel.
•

The existing roadway is already in excess of the permitted 1300 ft. the only viable road
connection would be to Black Rd. which could be adverse to the existing residential
neighborhood located there.

Staff Recommendation: Staff recommends the SCPC APPROVE the Variance Request.
1b. Preliminary Plan
The applicant proposes to add approximately 1700 LF of proposed roadway to be dedicated at
the end of existing Columbia Rd, (approx. 1550 LF) to end in a cul-de-sac. The proposed
roadway to go through parcel 4802322 and terminating in parcel 4802159.The site is proposed
to be serviced by Central Water (Cleveland Water) and Sewer (will tie into Village of Richfield’s
System).

Agency Comments Italicized text indicates quotations from submitted agency comments.
Summit County Engineers Office: Andy Dunchuck, 05/21/2019:
1. Columbia Road is being extended by approximately 1,700’ and the overall length of
the cul-de-sac will be approximately 3,250’. Subdivision Regulation 1108.10 (a)
states a commercial/industrial park cul-de-sac shall not be exceed 1,300’ in
length. Therefore, a variance for cul-de-sac length will be required. Should we
require an emergency access lane be paved?
2. Between reverse curves C11 and C12 there is a proposed tangent length of
87’. Subdivision Regulation 1108.05 requires a minimum tangent length of 100’
between reverse curves. Therefore, either a minor redesign of the alignment or a
variance for tangent length between reverse curves is required.
3. The Traffic Impact Questionnaire must be completed to determine if any additional
studies or improvements are warranted.
4. There must be an onsite overland flow path to the stormwater management basin
for the 100 Year Storm Event.
5. A minimum 12’ wide maintenance access driveway from the road to the stormwater
management basin and a minimum 20’ wide driveway around the perimeter of basin
is required. The maximum cross slope of the driveway shall be 10:1 with a maximum
slope of 15% and shall be constructed with suitable material (approved by the SCE) to
prevent rutting of maintenance vehicles. A minimum 20’ wide easement is required
over the driveway.
6. A 20’ wide easement extending beyond the limits of the 100 Year Storm Elevation is
required around the perimeter of the stormwater management basin.
7. All requirements of the SCE Stormwater Drainage Manual, Current Edition must be
satisfied.
Richfield Township Zoning Department: Laurie Pinney 05/21/2019: Richfield Township has
received notice that the Columbia Rd Extension Phase 1, preliminary plan, Richfield Township is
on the agenda for review by the Planning Commission at their May 30, 201g meeting. The
proposal is for approval of road, water, sewer, stormwater and utility infrastructure. No
subdivision of land (lot splits) or construction of buildings, fences, walls, parking or other
structures has been proposed in association with this review and no zoning approval is required.
It was noted at the March 20, 2019 Concept Plan meeting that township legal counsel has
advised that jurisdiction for access management is with the summit county Engineer and
Richfield Township zoning Regulations Section 420-4'J Traffic Management requiring that all
traffic in this district must access only West Columbia Road to the State Route 21 {Brecksville
Road) intersection is outside the authority of zoning.
Additionally, there was discussion during the May 15, 2019 Site Visit/Viewing regarding future
construction of a bufferwall between the Light Industrial-Office (LI-O) district and adjacent
residential property. No zoning application has been made for a bufferwall or any other

within ten (10) feet of the rear lot line and ten (10) feet of side lot lines.
An accessory building shall be located in line with or behind the main structure, and no
closer than twenty (20) feet to the principal structure. The total square footage of any
accessory building in any district shall be limited to a maximum of 1200 square feet.
Total number of accessory buildings shall be limited to 2 buildings per lot.

 Summary of the changes proposed:
• An increase of size accessory buildings from 900 sq. ft. to 1200 sq. ft.
• Stating the total number of accessory buildings per lot shall be limited to 2 buildings.
Staff Comments: The applicant has proposed that the Boston Township Zoning Resolution
Section 403 Accessory Buildings be amended to increase the allowed size of accessory
buildings and to state the number of accessory buildings allowed per lot.
• The Township may want to consider a setback from property lines for accessory
buildings as the current and proposed text say that they may be built within 10 feet of
rear and side lot lines. Having a setback of at least 2 ft. would keep structures off of
property lines and allow enough room for maintenance responsibilities without
encroaching on adjoining property.
Recommendation: Staff recommends to the Summit County Planning Commission that the
proposed text amendments be APPROVED.
