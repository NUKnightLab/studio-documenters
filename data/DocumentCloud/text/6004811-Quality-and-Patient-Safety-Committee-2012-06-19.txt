Report from System Chief Medical Officer
A. Update on Oak Forest Health Center
B. Update on Get Yourself Tested (GYT) Program (Attachment #1)
Dr. Terry Mason, System Chief Medical Officer, provided an update on the following subjects.
Dr. Mason noted that this would be the last meeting at which Chairman Ansell would preside, as his term as
Director is ending at the end of the month. He thanked Chairman Ansell for his time and efforts, and for his
focus and attention on the subject of System quality.
Dr. Mason stated that the System is now entering almost the first-year anniversary of going before the Illinois
Health Facilities and Services Review Board and tendering the opportunity to suspend all inpatient operations at
Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County. With regard to activities relating to the Oak Forest Health Center, he
noted that efforts are underway relating to the demolition for the first floor, to put in the new diagnostics center
and on work relating to other service offerings that will be on the first floor. He stated that there have been
some staffing issues, particularly in the Immediate Care Center, for some of the higher patient volume shifts
(afternoon and evening shifts). There have been some discussions held regarding looking at changing some of
the hours, particularly during the day and on Saturdays, to better line up the diagnostic capabilities with the
times open. Dr. Mason noted that Dr. Claudia Fegan, Chief Medical Officer of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of
Cook County, has been in discussions with others in management to review the possibility of supplementing
some of the staffing in the Immediate Care Center, while efforts continue to work through the process of hiring
additional people.

III.

Report from System Chief Medical Officer (continued)
Dr. Mason provided an update on an initiative involving the subject of reducing the amount of medical red bag
waste at the System; he noted that the cost of managing red bag waste is more than one hundred times as much
as the cost of managing waste in regular bags. He provided information on the results of the initiative, which
indicated a significant decrease in red bag waste (Attachment #2); the initiative involved the review of existing
practices and the education of staff on the proper use of red bags and appropriate identification of waste for red
bag disposal.
Dr. Ashlesha Patel, System Director of Family Planning Services, provided an update on the activities relating
to the 2012 System-wide Get Yourself Tested (GYT) initiative. The Committee reviewed and discussed the
information.

IV.

Report from System Interim Chief Nursing Officer
Tanda Russell, System Interim Chief Nursing Officer, provided an update on the subject of bed closures in the
nursing units at Stroger Hospital. As reported at the May Committee Meeting, of the twenty-eight (28) beds
that had been closed in order to provide safe staffing levels since December, twelve (12) beds remained closed;
however, those remaining beds have now been reopened. She added that recruitment efforts will continue, in
order to raise the hours per patient day on the Medical-Surgical units. Once those efforts are successful, further
efforts will be made regarding recruiting for the remaining positions in other areas of the System, including
those positions in the critical care areas and Emergency Department.

V.

Report from System Director of Quality and Patient Safety
Barbara Farrell, System Director of Quality and Patient Safety, stated that staff teams from Provident and
Stroger Hospitals, composed of approximately sixteen (16) individuals, will be attending the national
collaborative hosted by the National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems (NAPH).

VI.

 What Can We Do?
•  Passive treatment has not impacted rates –
Active intervention is necessary
–  Grant funding
–  Improve access / Normative testing
–  Year round initiatives for testing/treatment
–  Education / Community outreach
