Summary: Thank you for the opportunity to submit a request for assistance through the No Cash Bid Program.
We are pleased to submit one (1) parcel for your consideration.

This unoccupied commercial property is located in close proximity to the Village Hall, under 1/10th of a mile

clubs and organizations or possible expansion of Village offices for ease of providing streamlined services.
Therefore, the Village will file for tax exempt status on the property if tax deeds are obtained. The Village also
intends to retain ownership of the parcel and therefore will not be applying with a Third Party.
The Village will retain legal counsel to assist with completion of the application, title search, tax deed petition
and will bear all other costs related to the acquisition of these parcels through the No Cash Bid (NCB) Program
and agrees to file NCB reports on the status of each parcel for five (5) years or until development is complete,

PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: Keith R. Sbrial, AICP, Village Manager, Village of Brookfield
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location: Village of Brookfield
Volume and Property Index Number:
075, 18-03-214-030-0000.
Summary: The Village of Brookfield, Illinois (the “Village”) hereby requests no-cash bid acquisition of
the following parcel. This Request Package contains one (1) PIN referred to herein as the “Property.”
The Property is located at 8834 Ogden Avenue in the Village of Brookfield. The Property is improved
with a single-story commercial structure used as part of a retail facility selling custom countertops
operating as the Marble Place. The Village seeks to acquire and hold the Property for redevelopment
pending a future proposal by a yet-to-be-determined developer for commercial use of the Property.
Acquisition of the Property through the Cook County No-Cash Bid Program will benefit the Village by
potential redevelopment of a commercial, tax-generating use of Property. Commercial development of
the Property will benefit the Village by increasing the Village’s property and sales tax base and by
offering additional employment opportunities to local residents.

If the Village is successful in acquiring the Property through the No-Cash Bid Program, it will file for tax
exempt status and will maintain the Property as tax exempt until such time as it is conveyed to a third
party for redevelopment. The Village represents that there currently exists no Third Party Request by a
developer, organization, or other private party which would result in the Village’s conveyance of a
certificate of purchase for, or perfected tax deed to, the Property to such a developer, organization, or
private party.
The Village will bear all legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of this parcel. The Village
agrees to submit an annual report on the status of this parcel for five (5) years or until development is
complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No-Cash Bid Ordinance.

Summary: Please accept this letter as the Village of Glenwood’s application to participate in the Cook
County No Cash Bid Program for the 2017 County Scavenger Sale for the parcel of property identified.
This request package is for the one (1) PIN listed above. The PIN is a vacant, unoccupied lot that does
not contain any structures. It is the Village of Glenwood’s desire to obtain title to this property through
the County’s No Cash Bid Program so that the property can be redeveloped by a private entity, returned
to the property tax rolls and create additional employment opportunities within the Village. This parcel is
in the Village of Glenwood’s Main Street Tax Increment Financing District. Accordingly, TIF incentives
as allowed by the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act would be available to incentivize the
acquisition and redevelopment of this parcel by a private entity.

In the event this application is approved, it is the Village’s intent to file the necessary documents that are
required to obtain a tax-exempt status for the property. The Village will continue to maintain this tax
exempt status for the property as long as the Village continues to own it. Please be advised that the
Village does not have any agreement to convey the perfected tax deed for the property to any developer,
organization or other private party. The Village also has not entered into any negotiations with any
developer, organization, or other entity pertaining to this property. The Village’s is not acting on behalf
of any third party requestor.
In the event this application is approved, the Village has by resolution authorized me to proceed to obtain
the tax deed. It will be the Village’s responsibility to bear all legal and other costs that are necessary for
its acquisition of the property through the tax deed process. The Village understands and agrees that it
will need to comply with the reporting requirements of the County’s No Cash Bid Ordinance. This will
require the Village to submit No Cash Bid Reports on the status of the parcel for the later of either five
(5) years or the completion of the development.

(32-03-400-022-0000) went out of business on December 22, 2015. It is the Village of Glenwood’s
desire to obtain title to this property through the County’s No Cash Bid Program so that the property can
be redeveloped by a private entity, returned to the property tax rolls and create additional employment
opportunities within the Village. The rear portion of the requested PIN is also adjacent to other property
the Village previously acquired using the No Cash Bid process such that these properties could be
marketing together to promote future redevelopment opportunities. This parcel is also in the Village of
Glenwood’s Main Street Tax Increment Financing District. Accordingly, TIF incentives as allowed by
the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act would be available to incentivize the acquisition and
redevelopment of this parcel by a private entity.
In the event this application is approved, it is the Village’s intent to file the necessary documents that are
required to obtain a tax-exempt status for the property. The Village will continue to maintain this tax
exempt status for the property as long as the Village continues to own it. Please be advised that the
Village does not have any agreement to convey the perfected tax deed for the property to any developer,
organization or other private party. The Village also has not entered into any negotiations with any
developer, organization, or other entity pertaining to this property. The Village’s is not acting on behalf
of any third party requestor.
In the event this application is approved, the Village has by resolution authorized me to proceed to obtain
the tax deed. It will be the Village’s responsibility to bear all legal and other costs that are necessary for
its acquisition of the property through the tax deed process. The Village understands and agrees that it
will need to comply with the reporting requirements of the County’s No Cash Bid Ordinance. This will
require the Village to submit No Cash Bid Reports on the status of the parcel for the later of either five
(5) years or the completion of the development.

of Glenwood’s desire to obtain title to this property so that it can demolish the hazardous structure
located on this property and continue to hold this property for flood control purposes.

Summary: Please accept this letter as the Village of Glenwood’s application to participate in the Cook
County No Cash Bid Program for the 2017 County Scavenger Sale for the parcels of property identified.
In the event these parcels are not eligible for the No Cash Bid Program, the Village is alternatively
requesting that an Over-The-Counter tax certificate be issued and assigned to the Village of Glenwood.
This request package is for the three (3) adjacent PINs listed above. The requested PINs are contiguous
parcels that contain a vacant dilapidated abandoned commercial site that was previously occupied by a
restaurant that has been closed for three (3) years. At the time the property was abandoned, the Village
attempted to work with the business occupying the parcels to see if it could utilize available TIF
incentives to improve the structure so that the restaurant can continue to operate. Ultimately, the Village
concluded that the costs of rehabilitating this structure so that it could continue to be useable as a
restaurant was far more than the value of the entire site. The structure on this property has continued to
deteriorate and the Village believes that it is now in a dangerous condition. It is the Village of
Glenwood’s desire to obtain title to this property so that it can demolish the hazardous structure located

Summary: I am delighted to submit this letter of request for the City of Harvey’s interest in Cook
County’s No Cash Bid Program to the Cook County Board of Commissioners. There are a total of
eighty-nine (89) Parcels of vacant land listed in our request and they are as follows. The City’s request
will be indicated in our Resolution to be introduced at the April 10, 2017 Council meeting. The City of
Harvey requests eighty-nine (89) parcels of vacant land for the redevelopment of our major
thoroughfares and Downtown Business District areas.

The City will retain legal counsel and pay all costs for tax deeds. There is no Third Party Requestors
statement. The City of Harvey will file for tax exempt status for each parcel granted in our request. The
City will report as required to the Cook County Bureau Economic Development annually on each parcel
for five (5) years or until the development is completed, whichever occurs last. If a City of Harvey lien is
cleared by the no cash bid, the City agrees to this in that the future redevelopment is more valuable to the
City than the cost of the municipal lien. If a Cook County lien is on a parcel, the City agrees to reinstate
the lien after the tax sale for the County with an intergovernmental agreement to be recorded.

Summary: This second of two (2), one (1) year renewal options will allow the first time implementation
of the Cook County Sweetened Beverage Tax Ordinance which was approved by the Board of
Commissioners November 2016. Due to the high volume of notifications that must be mailed, DOR is
requesting temporary assistance with the initial paper based and manual first year implementation of the
Sweetened Beverage Tax, including the administration of the one-time floor tax return for inventory on
hand, which will involve outreach to over 70,000 businesses. In addition, the temporary staff will assist
with the increased call volume from taxpayers and return processing until the implementation of the
modernized Integrated Tax Processing System. The use of temporary staff for these more administrative
duties will allow the current compliance staff to focus on their revenue generating enforcement tasks.

Cook County Procurement Code.

BOARD AGENDA

April 12, 2017

Summary: In 2013, Cook County leveraged pricing discounts available to volume purchasers by
aggregating its technology needs with the City of Chicago. A joint City-County RFP was issued and
representatives from both government entities recommended that CDW Government LLC be awarded.
The contract allows County elected official IT departments to procure necessary software and equipment
through an online ordering system.

This Board subsequently approved a contract increase in 2015 to facilitate grant-funded purchases by the
Department of Homeland Security, and additional purchases for other offices under the President and
separately elected officials. The Board next approved an increase and first of two (2) renewal options
available in the contract to allow County agencies to continue to procure necessary software and
equipment in 2016. Both contract increases were accompanied by corresponding amendments to reduce
the mark-up cost for any newly added software items.
The Bureau of Technology now requests the second of two (2) renewal option for one-year and increase
to the contract in order to sustain County IT requirements for all elected official IT departments while an
ongoing replacement RFP process is completed.
This contract was awarded through a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) process in accordance with
the Cook County Procurement Code. CDW Government was awarded based on established evaluation
criteria.

The vendor has met the Minority- and Women-owned Business Enterprise Ordinance via full MBE/WBE
waiver.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: On 2/5/2013, the Cook County Board of Commissioners approved a ten-month contract with
Heartland Human Care Services, Inc. to manage the Cook County Juvenile Detention Reduction Project
(DRP) to serve court-involved, moderate and high-risk youth in jeopardy of imminent referral to the
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center due to non-compliance with court orders.

The DRP augments the court’s nationally recognized Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative which is
a continuum of community-based services that judges and probation officers may use to divert at-risk
minors from detention.
Both the Initiative and the DRP programs allow minors to remain in their
communities and engage in pro-social interventions. The DRP currently provides services to youth living
in targeted Chicago communities. The contract provides a wide range of interventions and mentoring,
including educational, therapeutic and recreational programming, which responds to the needs of the
juveniles who are referred to participate in this project. Heartland partners with 13 faith-based and other
community based-agencies to facilitate direct access to services and care. Since the beginning of the
project, more than 3,750 referrals have been processed for DRP services.
This contract was renewed with the approval of the Cook County Board in 2014, 2015 and 2016. This
extension is requested while a Request for Proposal (RFP) is re-issued to continue DRP.
This is a Sole Source Contract pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.
