timeframes during which NASC uses the fields, and noted that the fields ar open to the
public otherwise. Mr. Baechle noted that NASC is willing to invest approximately
$100,000 in improvements to the facilities to include a restroom and equipment storage
shed, which is why the County is willing to accept the longer than normal contract term.
In response to questions from Ms. Means, Mr. Baechle noted that NASC maintains
appropriate insurance, and that the McKinney soccer fields are the best condition of any
of the soccer fields in the County. Mr. McKain explained how purchasing sometimes is
accomplished by participating in existing Commonwealth contracts, which may expedite
the purchasing process. Mr. Baechle noted that an access road may have to be moved
in order to keep traffic at a distance from some of the facilities, but that this can be done
in-house.
In response to a question from Ms. Kirk, Mr. Baechle noted that the contemplated
construction should be completed in 2 years or so.
A motion was made by Kirk, seconded by Means, that this matter be Affirmatively
Recommended. The motion carried by a unanimous vote.

V. Adjournment
The meeting was adjourned at 4:52.
