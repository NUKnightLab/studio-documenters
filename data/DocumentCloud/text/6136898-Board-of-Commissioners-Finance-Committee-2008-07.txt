COOK COUNTY ASSESSOR, James M. Houlihan, by Michael A. Stone, Chief Deputy
Assessor, transmitting a Communication, dated June 4, 2008:
requesting authorization to accept a grant award in the amount of $73,000.00 from the
MacArthur Foundation for support of affordable housing programs related to The
Preservation Compact. The grant is a vital part of the Assessor’s Office’s initiative to
improve operations and increase awareness of certain property tax advantages available
to affordable housing. The funds would be used to improve necessary information
systems and to target housing agencies, developers and the general public though
awareness programs. If these actions are not taken, Cook County risks losing thousands
of units of affordable housing every year, while demand for such housing is projected to
only increase for the foreseeable future.
This grant does not require a cash match. As such, the grant will have no fiscal impact on
Cook County.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award: $73,000.00. Funding period: June 1,
2008 through May 31, 2011.
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents, and determined the fiscal
impact on Cook County, if any.
* Referred to the Committee on Finance on 7/1/08.

* The next regularly scheduled meeting is presently set for Wednesday, September 3, 2008.
