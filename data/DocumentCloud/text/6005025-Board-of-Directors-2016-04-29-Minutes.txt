Marge in her own right was an elected official; she served in many different capacities and provided a great deal of
service to the community of Cook County and the larger community. Lew could not be present this morning due to
some scheduling issues, but Chairman Hammock shared with him this body’s desire to recognize his work on this
Board, and to recognize his wife for her many contributions to the community.

Resolutions honoring Lewis M. Collens and Marjorie Collens. THE MOTION CARRIED

The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
It was noted that request numbers 6 and 8 remain pending review by Contract Compliance; it was also mentioned
that request numbers 9 and 16 were withdrawn at the Finance Committee Meeting.
Elaine Lockwood Bean, Chief of the Cook County Bureau of Asset Management, provided additional information
regarding request number 5, which was a request to amend, extend and increase the contract with Clayco,
Incorporated, for development team services relating to the Central Campus Redevelopment. She stated that,
with regard to controlling cost overruns, this project is being done a little differently from the traditional
design/bid/build process. For this project, the County contracted with a design builder. The benefit of that is that
the builder is at the table during the design process, so they are a part of the team; any issues they might have are
being resolved in the beginning. In addition to that, the County has hired an independent cost estimator, so every
time a budget is received at all of the milestones, the independent cost estimator reviews each and every detailed
cost. Although cost overruns are not anticipated, should there be any issues with that, they will be reported back
to this body.
Director Junge, seconded by Vice Chairman Butler, moved the approval of the Minutes of
the Meeting of the Finance Committee of April 22, 2016. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

During the discussion of the information on slide 10, regarding Medical Staff Committees, Director Junge inquired
as to the reason why there are no committees for Behavioral Health. Dr. Fegan responded that it is not a mandated
committee; it was explained that many of the committees listed are required, either by The Joint Commission or by
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It was noted that Behavioral Health does report in through Quality
and to all of the departments. Dr. Fegan stated that Director Junge’s question is reasonable; she and staff will review
the matter. Director Richardson-Lowry asked which of the Committees listed are not mandated. Dr. Fegan
responded that she will provide that information through the Chair.
During the discussion of the information on slide 13, regarding Medical Staff Demographics, Directors Estrada and
Velasquez requested that data be provided on the Hispanic medical staff; the information presented included data on
race, but did not include data on ethnicity.

WAYNE M. LERNER, DPH, ERICA MARSH, MD, MARY B. RICHARDSON-LOWRY,
CARMEN VELASQUEZ AND DORENE P. WIESE, EdD, DIRECTORS
WHEREAS in June of 2013, Lewis M. Collens was appointed by the President of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, and confirmed by the Board of Commissioners, to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of the
Cook County Health and Hospitals System; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Collens played an integral role in the governance of the Health System, which demands a considerable
time commitment from its volunteer Board members; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Collens graciously lent his vast expertise to the Health System by serving as the Chair of the Health
System Board’s Quality and Patient Safety Committee from August 2013 through November 2014, as Chair of the
Health System Board’s Finance Committee from December 2014 through March 2016, and as a member of the Health
System Board’s Human Resources Committee from December 2014 through March 2016; and
WHEREAS, while serving on the Health System Board of Directors, Mr. Collens was a part of the leadership team that
grew CountyCare, an Illinois Medicaid Demonstration Project, which established a network of providers that adds to
CCHHS’s current sites and consists of all of the Federally Qualified Health Centers in Cook County and nearly every
hospital, including the five academic medical centers. With more than 130 access points, this extensive network allows
CountyCare members the ability to access care close to their home and within a network of care utilized by their primary
care provider. CountyCare has achieved considerable success providing an unprecedented opportunity for low income
adult residents of Cook County to have access to care. Because of CountyCare and the Affordable Care Act, for the first
time in the Health System’s history, there are more insured patients than uninsured; and
WHEREAS, following the transition of CountyCare from being a Demonstration Project to becoming a County
Managed Care Community Network, which essentially created a new role and function for the Health System in
operating a health plan for the CountyCare members, as Chair of the Health System Board’s Finance Committee, Mr.
Collens was intimately involved in ensuring CountyCare’s success; and
WHEREAS during his tenure with the Health System, Mr. Collens earned the genuine respect of his fellow Board
members for his keen insight, attention to detail, and knowledge in the areas of finance and legal affairs; and
WHEREAS the Health System’s leadership team held Mr. Collens in high regard and appreciated his strength and
support, as well as his ability to lead with integrity and objectivity.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Directors of the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System, on behalf of the more than five million residents of Cook County served by the Health System, does hereby
gratefully acknowledge Mr. Collens for his extraordinary abilities, outstanding leadership and unwavering commitment
to the transformation of the Health System in order to maximize access to quality medical care to all residents of Cook
County.

WHEREAS, Marjorie Collens served with distinction in many roles over the course of her life: wife, mother, supporter
of the arts, community leader and elected official; and
WHEREAS, in her role as a wife, Marjorie Collens represented the finest example of a fully engaged and supportive

she recognized the vital role that the arts play in civic life. She played a major role in the effort to start what is now

used her skills to benefit others in many philanthropic endeavors; and

Evanston’s Seventh Ward from 1984 to 1991; and
WHEREAS, when Marjorie Collens died in early December, she left behind a family, countless friends and a
community enriched for having known her.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Directors of the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System does hereby extend its deepest sympathies to its fellow Board member Lewis M. Collens and his son Steven and
daughter-in-law Caralynn on the loss of their cherished wife and mother, Marjorie Collens; and

CHICAGO – U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) today held a roundtable discussion with Illinois public health officials and
medical experts to discuss the urgent need for Congress to pass the President’s $1.9 billion emergency funding request
to help treat and prevent the spread of the Zika virus. In the absence of Congressional action, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) has begun diverting funding and resources away from Illinois and other states to support
Southern states where the Zika threat is higher. The Illinois Department of Public Health and the Chicago Department of
Public Health will lose a total of $2 million in Public Health Emergency Preparedness grants as a result.
“Taking money from one state to give it to another to deal with a public health threat is no way to govern,
especially when the President submitted a supplemental request to combat the Zika virus nearly three months
ago. We should pass a Zika supplemental so Illinois and other states can keep the funding they need to deal
with current public health threats – like Elizabethkingia – while receiving additional funding to help prepare for
the summer months and the Zika threat,” Durbin said. “While Chicago is further north and at a lower risk for the
spread of the mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus, we are not at zero risk and we are a major transportation
hub. There is still a lot we do not know about this disease and we must be diligent. The cases of Zika are
continuing to grow and inaction and further delay put pregnant women and children in jeopardy.”
"Zika virus can cause serious disease, more than we anticipated," said Dr. Sharon Welbel, Director of Hospital
Epidemiology and Infection Control, CCHHS. "Local funding is critical for a number of reasons; we must educate
individuals in our communities about how to avoid infection, educate clinicians about how to identify and manage the
disease in their patients and how to report to local authorities. Counseling for pregnant women will be monumental. In
order to do this we need money for state health department laboratories and diagnostic testing, as well as tools for
monitoring and reporting the disease efficiently."

Multi-year funding is needed now for the CDC and state/local health departments across the nation to prepare and
respond before the summer mosquito season arrives, and to better understand the threat, educate providers and
communities, conduct vector control, and develop a vaccine.

In the time since the President asked Congress for funding to help prepare for and combat the Zika virus, more than
1,000 Americans in 42 states have contracted the virus, including more than 90 pregnant women. In Illinois, 13 people
have contracted the virus, including at least two pregnant women. Since then, the CDC confirmed that Zika during
pregnancy can causes severe birth defects like microcephaly and that the virus can be sexually transmitted.

Earlier this month, Durbin led a coalition of 42 Senators in sending a new letter to Senate Republican leaders calling for
immediate passage of President Obama’s emergency supplemental funding for Zika. The letter called on the Senate
Appropriations committee to mark-up the President’s emergency funding request as soon as possible to ensure swift
passage by the full Senate and House.

Last week, Durbin also joined Senators Bill Nelson (D-FL), Harry Reid (D-NV), and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) in introducing
legislation to fund the Administration’s $1.9 billion request to combat the Zika virus. The funding would be used to
improve state vector control, surveillance, lab capacity and outbreak response, accelerate efforts to develop a vaccine,
and expand education and access to women’s health planning services.

The healthcare industry is facing unprecedented attacks from Ransomware viruses that are crippling
information systems and impacting patient care. Existing security measures and strategies that have long
protected healthcare organizations in the past are unable to detect and clean this new virus before it executes
its payload. Under the leadership of CIO Donna Hart, the Health information Systems team has
been instituting new procedures and monitoring systems around the clock in an effort to protect from
such an attack that has required some hospitals to pay hefty ransoms to regain access to their servers.

The system?s Food as Medicine initiative has expanded to include food insecurity screening at the Logan Square,
Cottage Grove and Robbins health centers. The Cottage Grove team distributed 223 food 'prescriptions? to
patients screened as food insecure to access the Greater Chicago Food Depository's Fresh Truck and on its
recent visit 125 patients filled their 'prescription?. Those accessing the Fresh Truck could obtain fresh fruits and
vegetables for their household, which represented more than 545 individuals at the Cottage Grove visit alone.
The Fresh Truck is scheduled to visit each of these clinics three times over the next six months. will
expand food insecurity screening system-wide by the end of the year. Patients are connected with the Food
Depository?s hotline to apply for the State's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Upcoming Fresh
Truck Visits:

On April 18-19, 2016 the National Stepping Up Summit, sponsored by the National Association of Counties
The Council of State Governments Justice Center and the American Association Foundation,
met in Washington DC. The summit brought together county executives, health system and public safety
leaders with a focus on reducing the number of people with mental illnesses in jails. Dr. Shannon participated in
the summit along with Commissioner Robert Steele, Commissioner Gregg Goslin, Dr. Nneka Jones Tapia from
the Cook County Sheriff?s office, Patricia Rodriguez of Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC) and
Letty Close, Executive Director of Government Affairs. The delegation will continue to meet to further
this critical initiative under the leadership of the Cook County Justice Advisory Council (JAC).

Consumer Reports has issued an analysis of cesarean section rates at hospitals across the country.
The report found wide variation in C-section rates in U.S. hospitals for first-time mothers with low-risk deliveries,
ranging from 11% to 53%. The data was taken from submissions by hospitals to a third-party organization.

The data submitted by Stroger Hospital reported the hospital's C?section rate as 31%. This is the hospital?s total
C-section rate and includes all medically?necessary C-sections for women with high-risk pregnancies and
deliveries, and/or a history of previous Cnsections. Stroger Hospital?s C-section rate for mothers having their first
cesarean delivery is 17%. Our reporting system does not allow us to calculate the number based strictly on the
definition Consumer Report?s used but a manual review of records indicates the Stroger number is likely lower
than even the 17%. Additional reporting fields have been included in electronic medical record system
to enable more accurate reporting of this specific metric in the future.

 

As a Level Regional Perinatal Center, our staff have extensive expertise in caring for women with high risk
pregnancies and deliveries. As such, Stroger receives referrals from community hospitals in the perinatal
network for the care of high-risk pregnancies with complex obstetrical and medical problems which certainly
contributes to why many of those hospitals are able to report lower c-section rates.

Legislative Update

State

Federal

In May, Illinois will begin its 11th month without a comprehensive state budget in place.

Prior to leaving Springfield last week, the Senate passed an appropriations bill that includes money to fund some
social service and other general revenue funded programs, including services for victims of abuse and sexual
assault and persons living with the Illinois Poison Control Center, and local health protection grants.
This bill passed the Senate unanimously. The House is expected to consider this appropriations bill when they
return to Springfield.

The Senate also unanimously passed 53384, which permits hospitals governed by the Illinois Open Meetings Act,
including to go into closed session for matters protected under the federal Patient Safety and Quality
Improvement Act and the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Special thanks to
the Senator Tony Munoz who sponsored the bill and led the effort in the Senate. The bill now awaits action in
the House.

The House and Senate return to Springfield on May 3, 2016. The General Assembly is scheduled to adjourn on
May 31, 2016.

While Congress will be in session on and off for the remainder of the year, it is unlikely any major legislation will
pass until after the November election.

The House Committee on the Budget released their draft budget resolution last month. it was immediately
opposed by the House Freedom Caucus creating enough opposition that it is unlikely the full House of
Representatives will pass the item. The Senate Committee on the Budget is expected to release their draft
budget resolution soon.

While Budget Committee resolutions are not law, they provide a framework for other committees to use
throughout the year. Health provisions in the House Committee on the Budget resolution includes repeal of the
ACA and Medicaid expansion, block grants for Medicaid and support of a work requirement for Medicaid benefit
eligibility.

Last month, the House Committee on Energy Commerce passed HR4725 (the Common Sense Savings Act of
2016). HR4725 would end Medicaid for lotteryjackpot winners, eliminate enhanced Medicaid for prisoners,
lower the maximum amount states could charge in providerfees, eliminate ACA enhanced match rates,
and end the Prevention and Public Health Fund. HR4725 passed committee on a partisan vote, but no action

has been taken on the House floor. Representative Jan Schakowsky spoke out strongly against the legislation

and stated that this was just a way to shift the costs from the federal government to the states.

On April 15, 2016 members of the Illinois delegation sent a letter to the Administration expressing Cook
County?s concerns with the then pending Medicaid managed care rule. Senator Durbin and Representative
Schakowsky took the lead on behalf of Cook in organizing the delegation letter. On April 25,
2016 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) released the Medicaid managed care rule. is
currently reviewing the rule and assessing the impact on the System.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for at both the State and Federal ievel.

CCHHS Medical Staff I April 29, 2016

 RVUs: Relative Value Units
• Medicare sets reimbursement rates for each Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) code assigned to every physician encounter
• Physicians’ services are counted in RVUs
• Based on:

– Physician work (expertise, time and technical skill)
– Practice expense (cost to operate a medical practice)
– Professional liability insurance expense (relative risk of services/cost
to insure against the risk of loss in providing the service)

35

Page 89 of 97

CCHHS Medical Staff I April 29, 2016

 RVUs and Medical Practice
• RVUs can be used as a measure of physician performance
in order to calculate physician compensation
• Advantages of using RVUs as a measure:
– RVU is independent of physician charge schedules, patient
insurance coverage, reimbursement fee schedules assigned
by any payor for any CPT code, or the practitioner ability to
collect reimbursement for any physician encounter
– RVU method of measurement reflects the reality that every
patient encounter is not equal
