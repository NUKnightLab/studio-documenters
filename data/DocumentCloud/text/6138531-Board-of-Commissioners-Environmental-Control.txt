resources; and
(4) Recognizing the desirability of uniform and consistent pollution abatement, regulations, programs
and enforcement, this chapter is being enacted.
(b) The environment in which we live is a basic natural resource of the community. The purity of this
resource has been increasingly threatened with the incidental by-products of processes and activities
which constitute modern technology. Heating plants, vehicles, industrial processes, and various phases
of everyday living contribute increasingly to contamination of the environment. That such
contamination, if unchecked, works to the detriment of all by affecting health, property, and the
appearance of the community, is now a well-accepted fact.
(c) Cook County in its rapid growth since World War II is becoming a completely urbanized part of the
Chicago Metropolitan Area. As such, it is both generator and recipient of environmental contaminants
which are increasing, and will continue to increase unless appropriate measures are taken.
Page 19 of 218

 (d) To prevent this from happening, the people of the County, acting through their elected representatives,
have declared that environmental control legislation is both reasonable and desirable.
(e) This chapter constitutes the above mentioned legislation. It applies to all existing and new pollution
sources within the County, except within the corporate limits of the City of Chicago. It has been written
to be comprehensive, fair to all concerned, and consistent with the latest scientific and technical
knowledge available. With its adoption, the chapter will secure for present and future citizensresidents
of the community an environment which is clean, healthful and wholesome.
(f) The administration and enforcement of this chapter falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of
Environmental Control. Effective December 1, 2017, the Department of Environmental Control will
be renamed and referred to as the Department of Environment and Sustainability.

 (a) After any person has been previously notified of three or more violations of this chapter within any
consecutive 12-month period in respect to the emission of smoke, particulate, or other matter by the
same piece of equipment in excess of the emission limitations herein provided or in respect to
violations of other requirements provided in this chapter, such person shall be notified in writing to
show cause before the Director on a day certain, not less than 20 days from date of service of such
notice, why the equipment or process causing such violations should not be sealed. The Director may
refer the violation notice to the Cook County Department of Administrative Hearings for a hearing to
be conducted by an administrative law officer or an administrative law judge following all rules and
procedures set forth in Chapter 2, Article IX of the Cook County Code. This last notice herein provided
for may be given by mail, directed to the last known address of the person to be notified, or if such
person or the whereabouts of such person is unknown, then by posting a notice on or near the premises
at which the violations shall have occurred. Upon the date specified in the notice such person may
appear at such hearing in person or by representative, with or without counsel. If such person fails to
appear at such hearing or if upon such hearing the administrative law officer or administrative law
judge shall find and determine that the violations are due to defective equipment or equipment which
is incapable of being operated within the maximum emission limitations established by or under this
chapter, or that corrective measures previously ordered by the Director have not been employed to
eliminate the causes producing the violations, the administrative law officer or administrative law
judge may enter an order revoking any certificate or permit outstanding for such equipment or process
and directing that the same be sealed by an inspector or other authorized agent of the Director. In
making the finding and determination hereinabove referred to, the administrative law officer or
administrative law judge shall, in the case of smoke density or opacity measurements, take into
consideration whether the equipment is capable of being operated within the particulate matter
limitations provided in Division 3 of this article.
(b) Upon notice and hearing, if notice and hearing has not previously been provided, the Director may
order that the use of any fuel-burning, combustion, or process equipment or device shall be
discontinued and may seal such equipment or process:
(1) When a certificate of operation is refused in the case of any original, annual, or subsequent
inspection, because the person required to procure such certificate has not complied with the
provisions of this chapter;
(2) In the case of movable equipment, or portable boilers, or vehicles, when immediate correction of
a condition causing a violation of this chapter is not made by the operator of such equipment,
portable boiler, or vehicle when ordered to do so by the Director or authorized representative.
Sec. 30-213. - Violations and penalty.
(a) Persons liable.
(1) Unless otherwise specifically provided, the owner, the owner's agent for the purpose of managing,
controlling, or collecting rents, and any other person managing or controlling a building or
premises, in any part of which there is a violation of the provisions of this chapter, shall be liable
for any violation therein, existing or occurring, or which may have existed or occurred, at or
during any time when such person is or was the person owning or managing, controlling, or acting
as agent in regard to the buildings or premises. Wherever used in the provisions of this chapter,
the term "owner" shall include any person entitled under any agreement to the control or direction
of the management or disposition of the building or premises or of any part of the building or
premises where the violation in question occurs.

 Unless otherwise specifically provided, where the violation of the provisions of this chapter
involves a motor vehicle, the owner or the owner's agent for the purpose of managing or
controlling the vehicle, and any other person managing or controlling the vehicle shall be liable
for any violation therein, existing or occurring, or which may have existed or occurred, at or
during any time when such person is or was the person owning or managing or controlling, or
acting as agent in regard to the vehicle. Wherever used in the provisions of this chapter, the term
"owner" shall include any person entitled under any agreement to the control or direction of the
management or disposition of the vehicle.
(2) The liabilities hereunder imposed on an owner shall attach to a trustee under a land trust, holding
title to such building, structure, or premises without the right of possession, management, or
control, unless the trustee in a proceeding under the provisions of this chapter discloses in a
verified pleading or in an affidavit filed with the court or the Department of Administrative
Hearings, the name and last known address of each person who was a beneficiary of the trust at
the time of the alleged violation and of each person, if any, who was then acting as agent for the
purpose of managing, controlling, or collecting rents, as the same may appear on the records of
the trust.
(b) Penalty clause. Any person, firm, or corporation or agents, employees or contractors of such who
violate, disobey, omit, neglect or refuse to comply with or who resist enforcement of any of the
provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fines of not less than any of the values detailed in the
following table but not more than $10,000.00. Violations of the ordinance not listed in the following
table are subject to fines not less than $300.00 and not more than $10,000.00. Collected fines will go
to the Cook County Environmental Management Fund. A separate and distinct offense shall be
regarded as committed each day on which such person continues or permits any such violation, or
failure to comply exists after notification thereof. In addition to such fines and penalties, the permit or
certification of operation of such person, or of the offending property, may be suspended or revoked
as hereinbefore provided.
Any person, firm, or corporation that issues a check or other draft to the Department or the Department
of Revenue that is not honored upon presentment because the drawer does not have an account with the
drawee, or because the drawer does not have sufficient funds in his account, or because the drawer does not
have sufficient credit with the drawee, shall be liable in the amount of $25.00 and shall be liable for interest
upon the amount at the rate of nine percent annually.
The Director shall refer a violation citation seeking a fine to the Cook County Department of
Administrative Hearings for a hearing to be conducted by an administrative law officer or an administrative
law judge following all rules and procedures set forth in Chapter 2, Article IX, of the Cook County Code.
In determining the amount of the fine the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
The Director shall refer a violation citation to the Cook County Department of Administrative Hearings
for adjudication seeking a fine, collection of compliance fees owed to the Cook County Department of
Environmental Control., and, if applicable, a $25.00 fee for all checks and drafts not honored by a financial
institution. The Cook County Department of Administrative Hearings shall set the matter for a hearing to
be conducted by an administrative law judge following all rules and procedures set forth in Chapter 2,
Article IX, of the Cook County Code. In addition to assessing a fine, the administrative law judge may, as
a sanction, order the respondent to pay any outstanding compliance fees alleged in the citation and found
by the administrative law judge to be due and owing to the Department. In determining the amount of the
fine the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
(1) The gravity of the offense,
Page 55 of 218

 (2) The respondent's past history with respect to compliance with the provisions of this chapter,
(3) The respondent's financial situation,
(4) The extent of respondent's cooperation,
(5) The likelihood that the respondent will violate the provisions of this chapter in the future, unless
deterred from doing so by the imposition of the maximum fine, and
(6) Any other factors relevant to the circumstances relating to the violation.

been sealed at the direction of the Director, the seal shall not be broken or removed except on written order
of the Director. The breaking or removal of this seal without such order shall be a violation of this chapter.
Sec. 30-215. - Public nuisance cessation and abatement.
(a) Definitions.
(1) For the purposes of this section, "imminent and substantial risk to the public health or safety or
to the environment" shall include a threat to human health or safety or to the environment that is
expected to occur within a reasonably short time, or that is present now, although the impact of
the threat may not be felt until later.
(2) For the purposes of this section, "cease and desist" or "cessation" shall mean stopping or
suspension or bringing an end to a particular course of action or conduct, including, but not limited
to, the closure of any business or part of any business or the closure or dismantling of any
equipment.
(3) For the purposes of this section, "abate" or "abatement" shall include the remediation or correction
of any activity or condition that amounts to a public nuisance or a violation of any of the
provisions of this Code which are under the jurisdiction of the Director or the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder or the conditions of any permit or authorization issued thereunder,
including, but not limited to, the controlling, sealing, removing or disposing of any such activity
or condition.
(4) For the purposes of subsection (b)(4) of this section, "current threat" shall mean an emergency
that (i) poses a direct and serious threat to human health, public health or safety or to the
environment, and (ii) which is occurring now.
(b) Emergency cessation and abatement.
(1) Emergency cessation—Authority. The Director is hereby authorized to issue an emergency
cessation order to any person who the Director concludes is:
Page 57 of 218

 (i)

Causing, creating or contributing to any activity or condition that poses an imminent and
substantial risk to the public health or safety or to the environment; or

(ii) Operating a facility or conducting an activity without a required permit or other written
authorization issued by the Director.
(2) Emergency abatement—Authority. In the event that the Director concludes that any person is
causing, creating or contributing to any activity or condition that has created, or is creating, an
imminent and substantial risk to the public health or safety or to the environment, then the
Director may order such person to abate the risk within a time frame prescribed by the Director.
(3) Duty to comply. Upon service of an order issued under this subsection (b), the person to whom
the order is issued shall immediately comply with the requirements of the order. The duty to
comply with such order shall arise at the moment of service of the order and shall continue until
the time of cancellation, if any, of such order by the Director, or until the order automatically
expires in accordance with subsection (b)(9) of this section. Submittal of a demand for hearing as
set out in subsection (b)(6) of this section shall not relieve any person of the duty to comply with
the order issued by the Director.
(4) Authority to abate.
(i)

If the person to whom an order was issued under this subsection (b) does not comply with
the requirements in the order as ordered by the Director, then the Director may undertake
any abatement activities reasonably necessary to correct any imminent and substantial risk
to the public health or safety or to the environment.

(ii) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the Director from acting without
issuing an emergency abatement or emergency cessation order, where issuing such order is
not practicable and the activity or condition poses a current threat to public health or safety
or to the environment, nor shall this section be construed to deny any common law right to
anyone to abate a nuisance.
(5) Cancellation of order. The Director shall cancel a cessation or abatement order issued by the
Director in accordance with this subsection (b) when the Director determines that the person to
whom an order was issued has complied with the requirements in the order as ordered by the
Director. Cancellation of the Director's order shall be made in writing and shall be served in the
same manner as an order or notice may be served.
(6) Demand for a hearing. The person to whom an order was issued pursuant to this subsection (b)
shall have 14 calendar days from the service date of the order to notify the Director, on the
appropriate form as provided by the Director, of her or his demand for a hearing. Failure to notify
the Director of a demand for a hearing in accordance with this subsection shall constitute a waiver
of the opportunity for a hearing.
(7) Initiation of a hearing. Within seven calendar days of receiving a demand for a hearing on the
appropriate form as provided by the Director, the Director shall initiate an administrative hearing
in the department of administrative hearings, specifying the basis for the order, any related
violations alleged in the order, and any allegation of noncompliance with such order. At the time
of initiating such hearing, the Director shall serve notice upon the person demanding the hearing.
Said notice shall set out the date, time, the location of the hearing, and an explanation of the

out in subsection (b)(7) or subsection (b)(8) above, then the order that would have been the subject
of such hearing shall expire at 11:59 p.m. on the fourteenth calendar day after the date on which
the Director received notice of the demand for a hearing or at 11:59 p.m. on the hearing date
scheduled upon mutual consent of the parties.
(c) Nonemergency cessation and nonemergency abatement.
(1) Nonemergency cessation—Authority. The Director is hereby authorized to issue a nonemergency
cessation order to any person, in the event that the Director determines that any such person is
violating any of the provisions of this Code which are under the jurisdiction of the Director or the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or the conditions of any permit or authorization
issued thereunder, but such violation does not pose an imminent and substantial risk to the public
health or safety or to the environment as defined in subsection (a)(1) above.
(2) Nonemergency abatement—Authority. If the Director determines that any person is violating any
of the provisions of this Code which are under the jurisdiction of the Director or the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder or the conditions of any permit or authorization issued
thereunder, but such violation has not created, or is not creating, an imminent and substantial risk
to the public health or safety or to the environment as defined in subsection (a)(1) above, then the
Director may provide the person with a written order to address and correct the violation(s) within
a time frame prescribed by the Director.
(3) Cancellation of order. The Director shall cancel a cessation or abatement order issued by the
Director in accordance with this subsection (c) when the Director determines that the person to

(c) shall comply with such order as ordered by the Director; provided, however, that if the person
contests the order, she or he shall notify the Director within 15 calendar days from the service
date of the order, on the appropriate form as provided by the Director, of her or his demand for a
hearing. If the person notifies the Director of her or his demand for a hearing in accordance with
this subsection, the order shall be stayed by the Director until the department of administrative
hearings issues a final determination finding the person liable for one or more of the violations,
or not liable for any of the violations, specified in the Director's order, or affirming or vacating
the Director's order. Failure to notify the Director of a demand for a hearing in accordance with
this subsection shall constitute a waiver of the opportunity for a hearing, and the person to whom
the Director issued an order shall comply with the order and shall not recommence any operations
or activities prohibited by such order unless the order is cancelled by the Director.
(5) Initiation of a hearing. Within 30 calendar days of receiving a demand for a hearing on the
appropriate form as provided by the Director, the Director shall initiate an administrative hearing
in the department of administrative hearings, specifying the basis for the order, and any related
Page 59 of 218

 violations alleged in the order. At the time of initiating such hearing, the Director shall serve
notice upon the person demanding the hearing of the date, time, the location of the hearing, and
the penalties for failure to appear at the hearing. Upon the conclusion of the hearing, in addition
to the finding of liability or no liability and imposing of fines and penalties consistent with this
section, the administrative hearings officer shall have the authority to affirm or vacate the
Director's order.
(6) Expiration of order. If a hearing is not initiated in accordance with the terms set out in subsection
(c)(5) above, then the order that would have been the subject of such hearing shall expire at 11:59
p.m. on the thirtieth calendar day after the date on which the Director received notice of the
demand for a hearing.

not comply with the requirements in the order as ordered by the Director, and does not notify the
Director of her or his demand for a hearing as provided in subsection (c)(4), or (ii) if any person

Secs. 30-327324—30-350380. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - EPISODES
Sec. 30-351. - Generally.
(a) This division is designed to prevent, during periods of atmospheric stagnation, ambient air pollution
concentrations from reaching levels which could cause significant harm to the health of humans.
Emissions which do not normally cause established air quality standards to be exceeded might well be
capable of producing dangerously high concentrations of pollutants during periods of atmospheric
stagnation. Such periods, generally of a few days duration, occur whenever high atmospheric pressure,
very low wind speeds, and a temperature inversion exist in the same place at the same time. These
conditions prevent normal ventilation of the air both horizontally and vertically, and pollutants released
into the atmosphere are literally trapped near their sources.
(b) In highly industrialized areas, if atmospheric stagnation persists, pollutants can reach unusually high
levels and a serious threat to public health may result. During recorded episodes of atmospheric
stagnation, an increase in the number of cases of illness and death has occurred with substantial
evidence that air pollution was the cause.
Sec. 30-352. - Monitoring.
(a) For purposes of this division, monitoring stations used to determine watch, alert, or emergency levels
shall be officially recognized stations located in any portion of the Federally designated air quality
control region in which a part of the County is included and shall be located according to guidelines
for establishment of air quality surveillance networks as developed by the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, and shall use measurement methods or equivalent methods as officially authorized
by that agency.
(b) If any monitoring station registers air contaminant concentrations in excess of any episode level and
if weather conditions indicate that such concentrations would not be expected, proper operation of the
sampling equipment at these stations will be verified by the Department before the concentrations are
used to declare any watch, alert, or emergency level.
Sec. 30-353. - Determination of actions required.
Page 75 of 218

 To the maximum degree practicable, emission control actions taken pursuant to this division shall be
consistent with the extent of any air pollution alert or emergency. When the Department determines that
the existence of any episode level is exclusively caused by one or more specific emission sources,
emission control action steps applicable to such source or sources shall be taken. When the Department
determines that the existence of any episode level is exclusively caused by one or more specific air
contaminants, action shall be taken to reduce the concentration of such contaminant or contaminants.
Sec. 30-354. - Episode levels.
(a) An episode may be initiated with any of the following four levels, which are, in order of increasing
severity of air contamination:
(1) Watch.
(2) Yellow alert.
(3) Red alert.
(4) Emergency.
(b) During an episode, the Department, through its monitoring facilities, may declare different levels
throughout the County as the Director or representatives deem necessary.
Sec. 30-355. - Areas affected by watch, alert, or emergency.
A watch shall be declared for the County portion of the air quality control region of which it is a part,
excluding the municipality of Chicago, if any part of the air quality control region meets the watch criteria
set forth in Section 30-356(b). When part of the County has acceptable air quality but air contaminant levels
at one or more monitoring stations are high enough to call for alert or emergency action, corridors of the
region shall be defined depending upon meteorological factors, emission inventory data, and mathematical
simulation modeling, alerts or emergencies shall then be declared for one or more of these individual
corridors.
Sec. 30-356. - Episode action watch.
(a) Requirements for initiating watch. The Director or designated representative shall declare an episode
action watch when:
(1) An air stagnation advisory is received for any area within the State; or
(2) Any two-hour average of pollutant or product specified by this section at any monitoring station
is equal to or greater than any watch level and the official National Weather Service forecast for
the next 24 hours does not indicate substantial improvement of conditions which cause
atmospheric stagnation.

episode action plans, giving significant lead time for alert actions of emission reducing
consequence that an episode action watch exists and that they may be required within a short time
to take action to reduce emissions.
(3) The public shall be notified by radio and/or television that meteorological conditions are such that
there is substantial danger of an air pollution alert; that the public may be asked within a few
hours to take steps to minimize air pollutant emissions; and that persons suffering from respiratory
or heart conditions should take appropriate precautions.
Sec. 30-357. - Yellow alert.
(a) Requirements for initiating yellow alert. The Director or designated representative shall declare a
yellow alert whenever:

(1) No person shall cause, suffer, allow or permit the emission of particulate matter in any one hour
from any source in excess of the amount shown in Section 30-382(b)(1), Section 30-382(c)(1), or
Section 30-382(d)(1), whichever is applicable, for the process weight rate allocated to such source
or in excess of 0.1 grains per standard cubic foot of exhaust at any given time during the process
where Section 30-382(b)(1), (c)(1), or (d)(1) is not applicable.
(2) Process weight per hour, or process weight rate, is the actual weight or engineering approximation
thereof of all materials except liquid and gaseous fuels and combustion air, introduced into any
process per hour. For a cyclical or batch operation, the process weight per hour will be derived
by dividing the total process weight by the number of hours in one complete operation from the
beginning of any given process to the completion thereof, excluding any time during which the
equipment is idle. For a continuous operation, the process weight per hour will be derived by
dividing the process weight for a typical period of time.
(3) Where the nature of any process or operation or the design of any equipment is such as to permit
more than one interpretation of this regulation, the interpretation that results in the minimum value
for allowable emission shall apply.

Page 85 of 218

 (4) For purposes of this section, the total process weight from all similar process units at a plant or
premises shall be used for determining the maximum allowable emission of particulate matter
that passes through a stack or stacks.

Subdivision III. - EPISODES
Sec. 30-410. - Generally.
(a) This division is designed to prevent, during periods of atmospheric stagnation, ambient air pollution
concentrations from reaching levels which could cause significant harm to the health of humans.
Emissions which do not normally cause established air quality standards to be exceeded might well be
capable of producing dangerously high concentrations of pollutants during periods of atmospheric
stagnation. Such periods, generally of a few days duration, occur whenever high atmospheric pressure,
very low wind speeds, and a temperature inversion exist in the same place at the same time. These
conditions prevent normal ventilation of the air both horizontally and vertically, and pollutants released
into the atmosphere are literally trapped near their sources.
(b) In highly industrialized areas, if atmospheric stagnation persists, pollutants can reach unusually high
levels and a serious threat to public health may result. During recorded episodes of atmospheric
stagnation, an increase in the number of cases of illness and death has occurred with substantial
evidence that air pollution was the cause.
Sec. 30-411. - Monitoring.
(a) For purposes of this division, monitoring stations used to determine watch, alert, or emergency levels
shall be officially recognized stations located in any portion of the Federally designated air quality
control region in which a part of the County is included and shall be located according to guidelines
for establishment of air quality surveillance networks as developed by the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, and shall use measurement methods or equivalent methods as officially authorized
by that agency.
(b) If any monitoring station registers air contaminant concentrations in excess of any air quality index
level and if weather conditions indicate that such concentrations would not be expected, proper
operation of the sampling equipment at these stations will be verified by the Department before the
concentrations are used to declare any watch, alert, or emergency level.
Sec. 30-412. - Determination of actions required.

Page 112 of 218

 To the maximum degree practicable, emission control actions taken pursuant to this division shall be
consistent with the extent of any air pollution alert or emergency. When the Department determines that
the existence of any air quality index level is exclusively caused by one or more specific emission sources,
emission control action steps applicable to such source or sources shall be taken. When the Department
determines that the existence of any air quality index level is exclusively caused by one or more specific
air contaminants, action shall be taken to reduce the concentration of such contaminant or contaminants.
Sec. 30-413. - Air Quality Index Levels
The Department may communicate to the public the level of air quality throughout suburban Cook
County per the Air Quality Index.

Subdivision V.ARTICLE IX. - GREEN CONSTRUCTION
Sec. 30-441950. - Board of Commissioners findings.
(a) Diesel exhaust particle pollution poses a clear and present health risk to the people of Cook County.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency has classified diesel exhaust as a likely human
carcinogen, and has identified diesel particulate matter and diesel exhaust organic gases as toxic air
pollutants. Diesel exhaust is also a prime contributor to airborne fine particle pollution that is linked
to premature death and other serious cardiovascular and pulmonary problems such as heart attacks,
abnormal heart rhythms, atherosclerosis, stroke, asthma attacks, permanent respiratory damage and
retardation of lung growth in children.
(b) Cook County is a U.S. EPA designated nonattainment area for fine particulate matter pollution.
(c) The health impacts from diesel emissions particularly affect children, the elderly, and people with
weakened immune systems.
(d) Particularly high concentrations of diesel emissions often occur in heavily traveled transportation
corridors, intermodal yards, bus depots, and construction sites; these diesel "hot spots" often are found
in densely populated, urban areas, disproportionately impacting ethnic minorities and people of lower
economic status.
(e) Diesel engine crankcases also are a source of emissions that can seep into the cabin and expose vehicle
drivers and passengers to harmful diesel emissions.
(f) Diesel exhaust also contains black carbon emissions, which contribute to global climate change.
(g) Reduction of diesel emissions can help address these human health and environmental problems.
(h) The United States Environmental Protection Agency has enacted requirements over the past few years
requiring the substantial reduction of emissions from new diesel engines in both heavy-duty highway
vehicles and land-based nonroad equipment. However, these regulations do not apply to any of the
over 11 million existing diesel engines in the United States, most of which emit substantially more
pollution and often remain in service for ten to 30 years, depending on the type of engine and
equipment.
(i)

Practical, cost-effective measures to substantially reduce diesel particulate emissions are available
today, and can be applied to many existing diesel engines. The same technology that limits diesel
pollution from new diesel engines can be retrofitted onto existing engines or applied in new
replacement engines to reduce diesel emissions by 85 percent or better.

(j)

Therefore, the purpose of this ordinance is to minimize the public health risks from exposure to diesel
particulate emissions as expeditiously as practicable.

Page 120 of 218

 DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY
Sec. 30-450. - Noise and vibration control dDefinitions.
(a) The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article shall have the meanings ascribed to
them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Acoustical terminology. All acoustical terminology shall be that contained in ANSI S1.1 "Acoustical
Terminology."
ANSI means the American National Standards Institute or its successor bodies.
ARI means the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute or its successor bodies.
ASHRAE means the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers or
its successor bodies.
ASTM means the American Society for Testing of Materials or its successor bodies.
Decibel (db) means a unit used in sound measurements to relate on a logarithmic basis a given sound
intensity to a standard reference intensity.; abbreviated "db."
Director means the Director of Environmental Control of the County of Cook.
Discrete tone means a discrete tone is a sound wave whose instantaneous sound pressure varies
essentially as a simple sinusoidal function of the time.
Fluctuating noise means a noise whose sound pressure level varies significantly but does not equal the
ambient environmental level more than once during the period of observation.
IEC means the International Electrotechnical Commission or its successor bodies.
Impulsive noise means a noise characterized by brief excursions of sound pressure (acoustic impulses)
which significantly exceed the ambient environmental sound pressure. The duration of a single impulse is
usually less than one second.
Intermittent noise means a noise whose sound pressure level equals the ambient environmental level
two or more times during the period of observation. The time during which the level of the noise remains
at an essentially constant value different from that of the ambient is on the order of one second or more.
ISO means the International Standards Organization or its successor bodies.
Maximum level continuous or semi-continuous vibration means the root mean square (rms) value of
the oscillatory particle motion of the structure or land area involved with the transducer oriented to produce
a maximum indication.
Motor vehicle means any passenger vehicle, truck, truck-trailer, trailer or semi-trailer propelled or
drawn by mechanical power.
Nonsteady noise means a noise whose level shifts significantly during the period of observation.
Peak level of an impulsive sound means the maximum excursion of the sound pressure level as detected
by methods and instruments approved by the Director and described in any of the Department's Suggested
Guidelines for control of Noise and Vibration when published.

Page 121 of 218

 Peak level impulsive vibration means the vector sum of the instantaneous peak level of all three
components, one vertical and two horizontal of the earthborne impulses measured at or beyond the
boundaries of the emitter's property.
Period of observation means the period of observation is the time interval during which acoustical data
are obtained. The period of observation is determined by the characteristics of the noise being measured
and should also be at least ten times as long as the response time of the instrumentation. The greater the
variance in indicated sound level, the longer must be the observation time for a given expected accuracy of
the measurement.
SAE means the Society of Automotive Engineers or its successor bodies.
Sound level means a general term for the metered value root mean square of the pressure of an air
borne sound as measured under a defined condition of frequency weighting and meter response rate. With
a conventional sound level meter the duration time of the sound should be much longer than the response
time of the meter. In most cases, levels in this article are specified as measured with "A" scale standard
frequency weighted responses and are always then noted as db (A) (standard reference level as in "sound
pressure level" below is always implied). Peak levels of impulse sounds are always specified as measured
with flat, nonweighted, or "C" scale response. Such peak levels are noted as db only, not db "C," and "C"
weighting is defined as a flat, "unweighted" response. Peak values as specified in this article are the absolute
values of the maximum instantaneous sound pressure levels attained throughout the duration of any impulse
sounds not the root mean square equivalents and require a special meter which can capture and store for
display these maxima. See peak level of an impulse sound.
Sound pressure level means the sound pressure level in decibels, of a level, in decibels, of a sound is
20 times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the sound to the reference sound pressure.
Unless otherwise specified, the effective root mean square pressure is to be understood. The reference sound
pressure is 20Un/m2. (Often used interchangeably with sound level.)
Steady noise means noise whose level remains essentially constant (i.e. fluctuations are negligibly
small) during the period of observation is a steady noise.
Vibration means a vibration is the oscillatory motion of the particles of a solid, propagated as a wave,
which is felt through physical contact rather than heard. Any vibration can, however, under proper
conditions produce a radiated audible sound wave, but this is to be considered a secondary, separate
consequence herein, unless specifically cited.
Zoning district means those districts established by Appendix A, Zoning.
Sec. 30-451. - Penalty.
Any person found guilty of violating, disobeying, omitting, neglecting, or refusing to comply with,
or resisting or opposing the enforcement of any of the provisions of this article, except when otherwise
specifically provided, upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not less than $25.00 nor
more than $300.00 for the first offense, and not less than $50.00 nor more than $500.00 for the second
and each subsequent offense, in any 180-day period, or shall be punishable as a misdemeanor by
incarceration in the County jail for a term not to exceed six months, or by both fine and imprisonment. A
separate and distinct offense shall be regarded as committed each day on which such person shall
continue or permit any such violation, or failure to comply as permitted to exist after notification thereof.
Sec. 30-452. - Public performance exemption.
Page 122 of 218

 The operational performance standards established by this ordinance shall not apply to any public
performance being conducted in accordance with the provisions of a special permit granted by the County
for the conduct of a public performance.
Sec. 30-453. - Excess noise or vibration declared a public nuisance.
Any emission of noise or earth-shaking vibration from any source in excess of the limitations
established in or pursuant to this article shall be deemed and is hereby declared to be a public nuisance, and
may be subject to summary abatement procedures. Such abatement may be in addition to the administrative
proceedings, fines and penalties herein provided. The Director is empowered to secure the institution of
legal proceedings for the abatement or prosecution of emissions of noise and earth-shaking vibration which
cause injury, detriment, nuisance or annoyance to the public or endanger the health, comfort, safety or
welfare of the public, or cause or have a natural tendency to cause injury or damage to public property.
Such legal proceedings may be in addition to the administrative proceedings, fines and penalties herein
provided.
Sec. 30-454. - Other private or public nuisance action not impaired.
Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair any cause of action, or legal remedy therefor, of
any person or the public for injury or damage arising from the emission or release into the atmosphere or
ground from any source whatever of noise or earthshaking vibration in such place or manner, or at such
levels, so as to constitute a common-law nuisance.
Secs. 30-455—30-457. - Reserved.
Sec. 30-458. - Scavenger operations.
All scavenger operations in the unincorporated areas of Cook County, commercial and municipal, shall

to those contact periods wherein the collection function is in progress in R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-5A, R6, R-7, R-8, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4 and C-5) and contiguous portions of I-1, I-2, I-3 and 1-4 zones and are not
intended to include or confine such functions as start up and shut down operations at the central operating
point (transfer station, sanitary landfill, incinerator, etc.) or the transit time of the first trip to and the last
trip from the defined collection areas. Noise levels in such central operating points shall be governed by the
property line values applicable for the location ( Sections 30-464 through 30-467). The exemptions on
engine operation when parked of Section 30-460(a) shall apply as will the restrictions on new vehicles of
Section 30-460(b) and vehicle use of Section 30-460(c)(1). When under severe conditions it can be shown
to the satisfaction of the Director that operation outside these hours is in the overall public interest or
operationally essential, special variance can be requested for such period as can likewise be shown
necessary.
Sec. 30-459. - Use of construction equipment.
It shall be unlawful for any person to use any pile driver, shovel, roller or other mechanical apparatus
operated by fuel or electric power in building or construction operations between the hours of 6:00 p.m.
and 7:00 a.m. except for emergency work on public service utilities, within 600 feet of any building used
Page 123 of 218

 for residential or hospital purposes. An exception to this rule can be made at the discretion of the Director
and special operating hours permitted when to the Director's satisfaction it can be shown that more extended
work hours would in any given case be in the overall public interest or technically essential, such as
continuous cement pouring.
Sec. 30-451460. - Idling of motor vehicles; nNew motor vehicle noise; performance; motor vehicle use
noise performance; muffler modification.
(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to cause or permit the operation of the main engine of any vehicle
when parked or standing, except for the following:

(2) Whenever operation of the main power train is essential to a basic function as with, but not
necessarily limited to, premixed cement trucks, platform lift trucks, compactor refuse trucks,
certain varieties of dump trucks and the like, while function is in action.
(3) Whenever weather conditions justify the use of heating or air-conditioning systems for the welfare
and safety of any occupants (or future passengers in the case of public vehicles stopped in turn
around or other such waiting areas) or when such low temperatures prevail that the startup of
public conveyances or service vehicles might not otherwise be feasible.
(4) Whenever the need for operation of refrigeration equipment on trailers carrying perishable
contents is recognized, but then must conform with the appropriate boundary levels involved by
location and most especially so when parked overnight in any district adjacent to occupied
residences. In general when parked, the use of auxiliary power sources shall be subject to the
same general caution regarding applicability of other noise level restrictions for operation of the
main engine and when the vehicle is in motion shall be considered simply as a component of the
overall resultant sound level as specified by Subsection (c)(1) below or in the case of private
travel trailers with auxiliary air conditioning by Subsection (c)(3) and these latter, even while
legally parked are subject to the same lot line and zone noise level restrictions described above.
(5) Whenever main or auxiliary engines are operated for emergency repairs, or when properly housed
for professional maintenance (subject to appropriate boundary level restrictions) and the
occasional maintenance such as cleaning and flushing of the radiator and associated circulation
system and/or seasonal change of antifreeze, cleaning of the carburetor or the like of a personally
owned auto by a private citizen.
(b) No person shall sell, or offer for sale, a new motor vehicle that produces a maximum noise exceeding

Sec. 30-468. - R-1—R-6, B1—B-5 and I-1 Zone vibration standards.
No person located in an R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-5A, R-6, R-7, R-8, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5 or I-1
Zone shall cause or permit by the operation of impact tools, improperly balanced rotating equipments or
any other source the propagation of earthborne tremors, continuous or intermittent vibrations or sharp
impulses and shocks into any structure involving regular human occupancy whether by virtue of residence,
occupation, commerce, recreation or other such reason, such that continued daily exposure is involved and
Page 132 of 218

 located on any property in the aforesaid zones (neither from one property lot to another within any one
zone, nor from any property lot in one zone to any property lot in another zone of any of the three
designated) of an intensity perceptible without the aid of instruments in the sense that the maximum
amplitude of such vibrations shall never equal that level commonly referred to in the art as "imperceptible"
or "threshold of perceptibility," or indistinguishable from the ambient, whichever is higher. (In terms of an
instrumented decision in the latter case, the presence or absence of the given vibration shall not produce
any change in the metered value of the ambient to show compliance, i.e., for a violation not to exist).
Propagation of vibrations into I-1, I-2 and I-3 Zones shall be prescribed by the rules pertaining within these
zones as set forth below.
Sec. 30-469. - I-2 Zone vibration standards.
No person located in an I-2 General Industrial Zone, where higher energy operations such as impact
extrusion, forming and stamping or any other such activity occurs, shall propagate into any structure
involving regular human occupancy for any lawful reason as noted above and thus daily exposure and
located in any R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-5A, R-6, R-7, R-8, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5 and I-1 Zone
earthborne tremors, vibrations, etc., more than barely perceptible without the aid of instruments in the sense
that the maximum amplitude involved can equal but not exceed by more than one db that level known in
the art as "imperceptible" or "threshold of perceptibility" or of such level that they are barely distinguishable
from the ambient, whichever is greater. (In terms of an instrumented decision in the latter case, the presence
or absence of the given vibration shall not cause a change of more than one db from the metered value of
the ambient, e.g., introduction of the vibration of which a resident has complained shall not produce an
increase in excess of one db in the meter reading obtained at the person's residence). Vibration levels
propagated within I-2 Zones may enter into the "just perceptible" or "barely perceptible" levels (save for
personnel immediately involved with the operation of the source equipments where clearly perceptible
levels may be unavoidable), but shall not approach levels and durations of exposure for any personnel that
could result in discomfort or fatigue or in any other way produce a state endangering safety or welfare.
Sec. 30-470. - I-3 and I-4 Zone vibration standards.
The same general conditions for propagation of vibrations and earthborne tremors into R-1, R-2, R-3,
R-4, R-5, R-5A, R-6, R-7, R-8, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5 and I-1 Zones as described above for I-2 Zones
shall hold for operations located in I-3, heavy manufacturing and I-4, Motor Freight Terminals, save that
since even higher energy operations such as heavy forging, impact forming and stamping of large parts, the
constant ingress and egress of heavy trucks and the like are involved the maximum amplitude of vibrations
propagated into the R-1—R-8, C-1—C-5 and I-1 Zones may exceed the level commonly known as
"imperceptible" or "threshold of perceptibility" and enter into the range commonly identified as "just
perceptible" or "barely perceptible," but not by more than a maximum of three db, or of such a level as to
equal but not exceed the ambient, whichever is greater. (In terms of an instrumented decision in the latter
case the presence or absence of the given vibration shall not cause a change of more than three db from the
metered value of the ambient). The propagation of vibrations within I-3 and I-4 Zones shall be governed as
are vibration within I-2 Zones.
Sec. 30-471. - Regulations for impulse noise and vibration resulting from controlled detonations.
(a) Standard regulations.
(1) Earth tremors. No person shall cause or permit as the result of such controlled and earth confined
explosions as are employed in quarrying, earth-moving, tunneling, road building, excavating and
the like the propagation of earth tremors and impulse vibrations of the closest structure beyond
Page 133 of 218

 the emitter's property line which result in a particle velocity in/sec based on frequency HZ in any
of three components, longitudinal, vertical, or transverse components in excess of the graph
shown at the end of this section.
(2) Airborne impulse sounds. No person as the result of any such blasting activities indicated above,
including continued daily exposure, shall propagate at or beyond the boundaries of the emitter's
property, air blasts and impulsive sounds which when measured at or beyond the boundaries of
the emitter's property involved are found to have a peak sound pressure level in excess of 125 db.
(b) Preemption of control of very high level impulses by State or Federal legislation involving potential
damage to living creatures.
(1) Under no circumstances shall any person cause or permit the propagation beyond the property
lines involved in any permanently located operation such a quarrying (or in the case of operations
of potentially variable location such as construction, road building and the like beyond the
boundaries of any control zone established by State or Federal legislation) of earthborne
vibrations or air borne impulse sounds which shall exceed any safety limits or damage risk criteria
set forth now or in the future by any State or Federal legislation involving the health, safety or
physical injury of humans, domestic animals, farm animals or wildlife as shall be specified in any
such legislation.
(2) Within the property limits of such fixed operations, or within the control zones of operations of
variable location, the production of such earth tremors or air blasts, or provision of protective
measures therefrom shall be regulated by such State and Federal labor and safety laws as apply
to any and all personnel involved.
(c) General specifications. All measurements taken to determine the quantities specified above shall
utilize instruments and methods which meet the approval of the Director and which may be specified
in any Suggested Guidelines for Control of Noise and Vibration published by the Department and such
appropriate and applicable standards as are proposed, preliminary and/or adopted and issued by such
appropriate and qualified groups as IEC, ISO, ANSI, CHABA (National Academy of SciencesNational Research Council, Committee on Hearing, Bioacoustics Biomechanics) and the like.

Sec. 30-771962. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this ordinance is to establish a program for recycling and salvaging of construction and
demolition waste consistent with the Cook County Solid Waste Plan. This ordinance is intended to
introduce reuse and recycling requirements that will help achieve Cook County's goal to:
(1) Reduce the amount of construction and demolition waste generated at the source;
(2) Regulate the salvage and transport of salvageable construction and demolition material and to
prevent the improper disposal of construction and demolition debris within the County of Cook;
and
(3) Recover materials for the purpose of recycling and reuse that would otherwise be discarded and
return them to the economy.
Sec. 30-772963. - Findings.
(a) The County finds and determines that:
(1) The County is committed to protecting the public health, safety, welfare and environment and in
order to meet these commitments it is necessary that the County promote the reduction of solid
waste and reduce the stream of solid waste going to landfills.
(2) The debris generated in construction and demolition projects accounts for a significant portion of
the materials disposed of in landfills and a large percentage of such debris is comprised of
materials particularly suitable for recycling.
(3) The reuse and recycling of certain portions of construction and demolition debris is essential to
further the County's efforts to reduce solid waste.
(4) Except in unusual circumstances, it is feasible to divert an average of at least 70 percent of all
construction and demolition debris from construction and demolition projects.
