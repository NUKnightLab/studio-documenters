PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
PUBLIC UTILITIES
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Title 5, Public Utilities, Chapter
2, Franchises, Sections 5-2A-1, 5-2A-2, 5-2A-4, 5-2A-6, 5-2A-9, 5-2B-1, 5-2B-2, 5-2B-4, 5-2B-9 and
Appendix A of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as Follows:
5-2A-1: - New Licenses.
Upon receipt of a properly completed license application and a non-refundable one thousand five hundred
dollars ($1,000.001,500.00) application fee the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (FPD) will begin
initial administrative processing of the application for consideration by appropriate FPD staff. FPD Staff
shall then review the application and attached plans to determine the applicable License Review Fee and
feasibility of granting the requested license to the applicant. Applications will be reviewed based on,
among other things, the potential damage construction or operation of the proposed facilities could have
on FPD property, location of the proposed facilities, type of facilities proposed, and number of trees to be
impacted. Based on this review the FPD may reject the request outright or may request revisions to the
proposed plans that would make the proposal acceptable to the FPD. Under no circumstances will licenses
be issued for areas that are dedicated Illinois Nature Preserves, high quality natural areas identified by the
FPD and shown on the FPD's GIS system as "license exclusion zones", or areas covered by conservation
easements.

Sec. 5-2A-2. Acceptable Application and Plans.
If the submitted (or revised) application and plans are found to be acceptable by the FPD staff, the FPD
will draw up a license that, if approved by the Board of Forest Preserve District Commissioners, would
grant the licensee authority to locate, operate, and maintain the facilities for which the application and
plans were submitted. Said license will include, among other things, the term for which the license will be
issued, the fee that the FPD will charge for issuance of the license, any moneys that will be paid for tree
mitigation associated with the license, and any charges for "out of pocket" expenses incurred by the FPD
to determine whether the license is acceptable. Said license will be forwarded to the applicant for their
review and approval before being submitted to the Board of Forest Preserve District Commissioners
(Board) for final approval. If the applicant decides to withdraw its application after review of the proposed
license or if the Board does not approve the proposed license, the "out of pocket" expenses will still be due
and the FPD will bill the applicant for said expenses. If said fees are unpaid, the FPD will accept no further
license applications from that applicant. Said applicant can regain its application privileges by paying one
hundred (100) percent of the fees owed along with a penalty fee of fifty (50) percent of the original amount
owed. If the license is approved by the Board then all fees will be paid to the FPD at or before the time the
finalized license is delivered to the Licensee.
Sec. 5-2A-4. License Fee.
In addition to those special fees as may be recommended by District staff, the fee for licenses issued under
this Article will be determined by multiplying the acres used by the cost per acre. Acres used will be
calculated by multiplying the linear footage shown on the license application (or revised application) by
the width required for future maintenance of the facilities. The minimum width will be fifteen (15) feet for
all licenses regardless of the facilities installed or location of said facilities. Requests for widths above
fifteen (15) feet must include an explanation justifying the need for additional width. The minimum license
fee will be five (5) percent of the cost per acre for the current year. Additionally, a Youth Education, Land
Acquisition and Restoration (YELAR) Program Fee of five seven and one half (57.5%) percent of the cost
per acre, and a License Review Fee, shall be assessed against all licenses issued. Cost per acre, minimum
license fee, License Review Fee and YELAR program fee figures can be found in Appendix A at the end
of this Article. All fees due will be paid as a lump-sum up-front one-time payment, unless otherwise
approved by the Board.
Sec. 5-2A-6. Renewal of Existing Licenses.
Any license previously issued by the FPD that expires while this Article is in force will be renewed at a
rate fifty (50) percent lower than that specified for issuance of a new license, unless otherwise approved by
the Board based upon District staff recommendations for a license exceeding twenty-five (25) acres and/or
when in staff opinion the license can generate additional revenue for the District. The minimum renewal
license fee will be five (5) percent of the cost per acre for the current year. Additionally, a Youth
Education, Land Acquisition and Restoration (YELAR) Program Fee of five seven and one half (57.5%)
percent of the cost per acre and a License Review Fee shall be assessed against all licenses issued. Cost per
acre, minimum license fee, License Review Fee and YELAR program fee figures can be found in
Appendix A at the end of this Article. The Licensee must submit a non-refundable license renewal

application fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) to the FPD at least six (6) months prior to the expiration
date of said license to confirm its interest in continued operation and maintenance of the facilities for
which the license was originally issued. If the applicable license renewal application fee and prior notice of
the Licensee's intent to renew is not received by the FPD at least six (6) months prior to the expiration of
the existing license, the FPD will mail the Licensee a "Removal Notice" at their last known address
notifying the licensee to remove their facilities from FPD property the license will be considered expired
and Licensee may be required to remove their facilities from FPD property per the terms of the license. If
the Licensee wishes to renew a license for which it hasalready received a "Removal Notice" expired, the
FPD will may allow the renewal, but the fee for the renewal will be based on the formula used to
determine the fee for issuance of a new license. All fees due for license renewals will be paid as a
lump-sum upfront one-time payment, unless otherwise approved by the Board.
Sec. 5-2A-9. Youth Education, Land Acquisition and Restoration Program Fee (YELAR).
A YELAR Program Fee of five seven and one half (57.5%) percent of the cost per acre shall be assessed
for all new and renewal licenses issued. The fee will help support youth education programs including, but
not limited to, the Mighty Acorns, and High School Programs, Land Acquisition and Restoration activities.
Cost per acre and YELAR program fee figures can be found in Appendix A at the end of this Article.
Sec. 5-2B-1. New Licenses.
Upon receipt of a properly completed license application and a nonrefundable five hundred dollar
($500.00) application fee the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (FPD) will begin initial
administrative processing of the application for consideration by appropriate FPD staff. FPD Staff shall
then review the application and attached plans to determine the applicable License Review Fee and
feasibility of granting the requested license to the applicant. Applications will be reviewed based on,
among other things, the potential damage construction or operation of the proposed facilities could have on
FPD property, location of the proposed facilities, type of facilities proposed, and number of trees to be
impacted. Based on this review the FPD may reject the request outright or may request revisions to the
proposed plans that would make the proposal more acceptable to the FPD. Under no circumstances will
licenses be issued for areas that are dedicated Illinois Nature Preserves, high quality natural areas
identified by the FPD and shown on the FPD's GIS system as "license exclusion zones", or areas covered

Sec. 5-2B-2. Acceptable Application and Plans.
If the submitted (or revised) application and plans are found to be acceptable by the FPD staff, the FPD
will draw up a license that, if approved by the Board of Forest Preserve District Commissioners, would
grant the licensee authority to locate, operate, and maintain the facilities for which the application and

District(s): 6
Summary: RFP 16-31-109 consists of approximately one hundred and thirty three (133) acres of
comprehensive tree and invasive brush removal at Thornton-Lansing Road and Jurgensen Nature
Preserves. The Jurgensen block was identified by the Natural and Cultural Resources Master Plan as the #2
priority for restoration in the Preserves. Given the ecological sensitivity of the area, expertise in forestry
and the usage of herbicide in a manner that limits the impact to non-target species is paramount.
The Forest Preserves of Cook County (the “Preserves”) assembled a review panel comprised of various
Forest Preserve staff, which determined Homer Tree Service’s proposal to be the most responsible and
responsive, with particular strengths in experience, proposed approach, cost, and capacity to perform all
aspects of the work. Three (3) proposals were received.
The restoration work performed by this contract achieves progress towards the Preserves’ goal of restoring
30,000 acres by 2040, as recommended by the Next Century Conservation Plan in 2014. The project is
being funded in part by a grant from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.

Summary: This request is for time only. A pre-qualified pool of architectural and engineering design
firms executed term agreements for an original term of three years that provided for design and
construction management services for capital improvement projects. Because some capital projects
extended beyond December 2015, the contract date for architects and engineers was extended to allow the
same firms to continue with construction management through final project completion. In addition, as
approved by the Board, the Preserves used the pool for new design and construction management services
totaling $25,000.00 or less, provided, that tasks orders for any new services awarded did not exceed
$150,000.00 for any one vendor in the pool. At this time some of the task orders that have been awarded
will extend beyond December 2016 and an additional extension is requested to complete open task orders.
No new task orders will be executed under the existing term agreements.

does not require any increase in the original contract authority.
