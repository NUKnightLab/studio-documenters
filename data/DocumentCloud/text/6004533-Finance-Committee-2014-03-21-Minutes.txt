III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to request number 1, Dr. Martell provided information regarding the reason why the Illinois
Department of Public Health (IDPH) did not renew the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Grant Program in
FY2014. Previously, IDPH provided for two components – the actual vaccine program, and a component for a
follow-up or assessment of providers. She stated that the discontinued component is not for the actual vaccine
program – it pertains to the component for follow-up or assessment of providers. With the Affordable Care
Act (ACA), individual providers are no longer eligible to be VFC providers, so the follow-up/assessment
component was no longer needed.
With regard to request number 2, Dr. Fegan and Mr. Kiplinger provided additional information. Director
Gugenheim inquired regarding the actuarial basis for setting the limit, and whether this includes renal
transplants. Dr. Fegan responded that the first few months of CountyCare have demonstrated that the
population has increased needs. The usual expectation is for one organ transplant per 100,000 enrollees – this
has already been exceeded. Mr. Kiplinger stated that renal is covered; however, frequently these patients
revert to another form of insurance. Dr. Fegan stated that the State of Illinois, unlike many states, has
covered renal failure-related services, even in the undocumented – not transplants, but dialysis and care. In
response to a question regarding “first dollar coverage,” Mr. Kiplinger stated that, under this, they pay the
initial claim, then the reinsurance will cover the System up to a certain amount. Director Hammock stated that
it would be helpful to receive a bit more of an explanation for this item; Chairman Carvalho suggested that,
perhaps at the Board Meeting, Mr. Glass could flesh this matter out a little more1.
With regard to request number 4, Director Hammock requested clarification as to whether this was a request to
extend the contract. Ms. Besenhofer responded that this should be a request to amend and increase the contract
with The Washington Group; the transmittal will be amended to reflect that correction.
Director Hammock, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 9. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
C. Any items listed under Sections III and IV
IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare

UNANIMOUSLY.

VI. Report from Chief Financial Officer
A. Financial Reports – through November 2013 (Attachment #3)
John Cookinham, System Chief Financial Officer, provided an overview of the information contained in the
Financial Reports through November 2013. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the review of the reports, Mr. Cookinham provided an update on the plan regarding the FY2013 audited
financial statements. He stated that, in the last couple of years, the County has issued its financial statements
by the end of May, usually by May 31st. The auditors have indicated that they will have drafts for review by
early April. They are now on site, beginning their work.
Director Hammock, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved to receive and file the
Financial Reports through November 2013.

Re: Purchase of Certainlnsurance for CountyCare Program

This memo provides background information and requests your approval of the payment up to $3,978,000
for the purchase of insurance covering against liability for the cost of services relating to organ transplants
required by persons who enroll in the CountyCare Program. The coverage to be purchased will be
provided by PartnerRe, as placed by the County?s Broker, Mesirow Financial, and will be priced on a PMPM
basis.

As you know, the must provide or arrange a range of inpatient and outpatient services for
CountyCare members. Because services related to transplantation surgery are extremely expensive, it is
recommended that the purchase a policy of insurance that will provide ?rst dollar coverage for
these services, should they be required. This will insure against the potential of loss resulting from
signi?cant expenses that may exceed the reimbursement received by the County for the operation of the
CountyCare Program.

Thank you for your consideration. APP Rov?

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended November 30, 2013. This discussion
focuses on the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current
month. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of
the CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Starting this fiscal year 2013, we have added the
Medicaid Expansion. Collectively, these entities provide primary, intermediate, acute,
and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to pay. The Bureau of
Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2012 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and Cook County Board Officials
collaborated to cut Medicaid costs, help county taxpayers, and transform Cook County’s
hospital system by jump-starting national health care reform in Cook County. In
November, 2012 the federal governmnent approved the 1115 Medicaid Waiver for Cook
County, allowing CCHHS to enroll more than 115,000 individuals who will be eligible
for Medicaid in 2014 into a Cook County network with no cost to the state of Illinois.
An Medicaid Expansion allows the Cook County’s Health System to early enroll certain
uninsured patients into Medicaid. Specifically, these are patients who are not currently
eligible for Medicaid, but who will be eligible in 2014 under the Accountable Care Act.
Many of these individuals are patients who already are being treated by our system
without compensation. The Waiver is funded entirely by the federal government.

 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the twelve months with overall
revenue of $1,046,557 and overall expenses was $1,048,249.
Net Patient revenue for the twelve months was $725,458.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
EHR incentive program revenue was $8,288.
Other revenue was $9,102. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.
Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
General
As compared to November 30, 2012, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
November-2013 reduced by 17 to 105 days. Additionally, there was a 2 day increase in
this figure, as compared to the previous month’s figure.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage, including Medicaid
Expansion and MANG applications;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Total billed accounts grew by $24.955M (8.5%) as compared to the November-2012
balance. As compared to the previous month, this figure increased by $1.803M (0.6%).
The growth in this figure indicates a decreasing number of accounts are completing the
collection process, which includes charity care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
6
Page 24 of 55

 upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for Medicaid Expansion patients is made
through a per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of November-2013 decreased
by $0.361M (-4.1%), as compared the November 30, 2012 balance and decreased by
$0.763M (-8.3%), as compared to the previous month’s balance. This decrease indicates
that more inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous
month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for Medicaid Expansion patients is made
through a per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of November-2013 increased by $3.149M (2.0%) as
compared to the November 30, 2012 balance. This figure grew by $3.319M (2.1%)
compared to the previous month’s total.
The increase in this number indicates fewer accounts had the collection process
completed than in the previous month and that a lower number of accounts are being
removed from active accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity
care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
up on the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for Medicaid Expansion patients is made
through a per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts decreased by $6.486M (-37.4%) by the end
of November-2013, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30,
2012. This balance was $5.501M (-33.75%) less than the previous month’s balance.
This change indicates that more outpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as
compared to the previous month.
7
Page 25 of 55

 The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of November-2013 grew by
$21.807M (15.7%), as compared to the balance as of November 30, 2012. This figure is
$1.516M (-0.9%) less than last month’s figure.
The decline in this figure indicates that more Out-Patient accounts had their collection
and write-off related activities completed, as compared to the prior month.
The reduction of internal bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a growth in
the billed accounts receivable.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

The above data does not include bad-debt write-offs; it includes only the amounts
written-off directly to charity care.

Operating Expenses at the end of twelve months was $1,048.249M broken down as
follows:
Salaries and Wages - $508.938M
Benefits - $132.251M
Supplies - $114.582M
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $218.399M
Insurance - $24.496M
Depreciation - $34.101M
Utilities - $11.924M
Services Provided by Other County Offices - $3,559

Page 26 of 55

 Nonoperating Revenue was $302.282M. The largest portions of this are attributed to
cigarette tax in the amount of $144.338M and property tax in the amount of $72.201M.
Sales tax revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the
underlying sales transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois Sales Tax represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet
received from the state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales
transaction to the receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

settlements this fiscal year.

Notes:
- ER Elopes are patients who leave without being seen by a physician.
- "Medicaid-Pending" assumes 30% of the Self-Pay accounts accepted by the eligibility vendor will be successfully converted to Medicaid accounts.
- The "Payer Type" represents the financial class in which the patient presented to CCHHS; it is not necessarily the final financial class for the patient, especially for Self-Pay patients.
