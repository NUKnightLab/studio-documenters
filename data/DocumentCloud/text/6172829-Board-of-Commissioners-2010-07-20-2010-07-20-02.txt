APPROVAL OF REVISED 2010 COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve and adopt the 2nd Quarter Revised
2010 Comprehensive Budget.
EXPLANATION
The Chicago Housing Authority is required to submit for approval by the Board, a balanced
annual Comprehensive Budget detailing each of the following: General Fund, Section 8 NonMTW, HOPE VI and Other Funding Programs, and the use for these funds.
The FY2010 budgeted expenditures have been revised from $1,031,372,033 to $983,016,147,
resulting in a $48,355,886 decrease. The major changes by funding source are explained below:
•

General Fund. Total revenues and associated expenditures decreased by
$61,435,450 for a fund total of $802,662,718. The reduction is due to changes in the
cash flow schedule for various construction projects and costs savings related to ADA
work, both at various sites and, less than anticipated costs per voucher for HAP.

•

Section 8 Non-MTW Fund. Budget remained unchanged at $7,875,729.

•

Hope VI. Total revenues and associated expenditures decreased by $8,004,161 for a
fund total of $41,884,424. The reduction is due to a change in the cash flow for both
Rockwell Gardens and Park Boulevard Mixed Income properties.

•

Other Funding. The total revenues and associated expenditures increased by
$21,083,725 for a fund total of $130,593,276. This increase is primarily due to the use
of additional American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Funds (ARRA) to fund
Altgeld Phase IV and the creation of various summer jobs through awarded grants.

The estimated sum of all revenues for fiscal year 2010 and the amount of the fiscal year 2010
Fund Balance available for appropriation in the fiscal year is equal to the estimated sum of all
expenditures to be made or incurred during the fiscal year and the amount of all unpaid liabilities
at the beginning of the fiscal year 2010.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the Chicago Housing Authority to adopt the
Revised 2010 Comprehensive Budget.
