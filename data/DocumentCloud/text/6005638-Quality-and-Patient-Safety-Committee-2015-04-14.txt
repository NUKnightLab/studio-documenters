III.

Report from Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
Dr. Krishna Das, Chief Quality Officer, provided a brief update on regulatory and accreditation matters. A survey
by representatives from the Department of Justice is currently underway at Cermak Health Services. Additionally,
she noted that Stroger Hospital remains in the window for its next full accreditation survey by The Joint
Commission; the survey will occur anytime between now and November.

B. Metrics (Attachment #1)
Dr. Das reviewed the presentation on Metrics. The Committee discussed the information.
With regard to slide 3, it was noted that the variance regarding room turnaround time is calculated in percentage
difference, rather than a straight calculation of the difference between actual and target, like the other measures.
Dr. Das stated that this measure is an exception; the other data is presented as percentages, but this one is
presented in minutes. Board Chairman Hammock noted that it is easier to understand if the variance for that
measure is reflected in minutes.

Report from Chief Quality Officer
B. Metrics (continued)
The Committee discussed the subject of immunization rates for the Health System’s patients. Dr. Das stated
that the System’s immunization rate is low, as it is in many hospitals that serve safety-net populations. There
are a variety of reasons that drive this low rate. She noted that, when this data is reported to the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), staff takes out the patient refusals; therefore, the numbers reported to
CMS are considerably higher. In the data presented to the Committee, the refusals have not been removed.
Dr. Das stated that there is a System-wide initiative for both inpatient and outpatient services that triggers the
ordering of vaccinations; the ordering rate is very high in the inpatient setting, which is being reported here. But
when staff attempts to administer the vaccines, there is a high refusal rate. Ms. Merryweather commented that
many hospitals have overcome such refusal rates; perhaps there can be a collaboration with those hospitals to
figure out what they have done to overcome it. Director Marsh noted that, while a provider should respect
patient autonomy, if a patient’s refusal due to fear of the vaccine is not based on truth, some type of patient
education would be beneficial to help them understand that, in general, this is a very safe vaccine. Dr. Das
concurred; she stated that all clinicians needed to try to bridge that gap.
The Committee discussed potential ways to present the data that will show whether there is movement in the
right direction. Director Marsh noted that she likes to see the monthly data, but it is the variance that poses a
problem; she added that perhaps it could be based on mean performance. Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief
Executive Officer, provided information on tools used internally to see actual statistical changes that create real
trends. Board Chairman Hammock suggested averaging the months by quarter to display one number, rather
than including the actual numbers for each month; he noted that it is up to Dr. Das and Chairman Gugenheim to
figure out the best way to present the data. Director Marsh stated that, given that the focus is not necessarily on
how far the numbers currently are from target, rather, the focus should be on whether the numbers are moving in
the right direction, perhaps another column could be added to indicate that.
Director Lerner stated that, when he looks at the data, he is more interested in knowing what project
management is doing to create turn-around. Dr. Das responded that the administration has committed to
presenting an in-depth report on operational efficiency within the next few months.

IV.

IV.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Presentation on clinical training affiliations (continued)
Director Lerner stated that he believes that the Board needs an education on this topic; the broad impact that
Cook County Hospital, now Stroger Hospital, has historically made on health professional education and health
care research, has been totally underplayed. This program provides a great example of inter-institutional
collaboration and community benefit, which people need to emphasize, as well. He hopes that some time is
taken at the Board level to talk about this academic role, broadly speaking, so people understand the System’s
role.
While reviewing the information on slide 12 regarding the upcoming visit by representatives of the
Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) for the Clinical Learning Environment
Review, Dr. O’Brien stated that he received notification that the representatives will be here on April 28th and
29th. At the exit debriefing, the reviewers will present their findings to Dr. Shannon and other members of the
administration; official notice is expected about six weeks later.

B. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees
i. Provident Hospital of Cook County
ii. John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
Dr. Pierre Wakim, of Provident Hospital of Cook County, presented a report on behalf of Dr. Anwer
Hussain, President of the Executive Medical Staff (EMS) of Provident Hospital of Cook County. He stated
that the Credentialing Committee and Executive Medical Staff met last week; additionally, they held their
quarterly meeting. They remain focused on issues to improve quality, decrease length of stay in the
Emergency Department, and improve throughput.
Dr. Ozuru Ukoha, President of the EMS of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, indicated that the
EMS was scheduled to meet later that day. He noted that, with regard to the medical staff appointments
presented to the Committee for consideration today, despite the fact that EMS would typically approve them
at their meeting, EMS has approved them in advance by way of electronic poll.

 Rationale for Educational Agreements

 Why Do Residents Go To Multiple Hospitals (or Why Do

Multiple Hospitals send their Residents Here)?



Sending hospital’s resident needs experience not offered at their
hospital (Toxicology).
Receiving

p
needs services of residents in a p
particular area
(Orthopedics or ENT).

 When A Receiving Hospital Needs Services-They Pay Salary

and Benefits.


 Receiving Hospital Improves care by providing direct care 24/7
 Cheaper than having your own residency program.
 Sending Hospital
 Residents improve - see different patients/stages of disease
 Residency program’s reputation is enhanced.
