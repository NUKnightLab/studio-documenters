RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION CALLING ON THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
TO REMOVE THE PROVISION THAT REQUIRES SENIORS IN COOK COUNTY
TO REAPPLY FOR THE SENIOR CITIZEN HOMEOWNER’S EXEMPTION EACH YEAR
WHEREAS, more than 284,000 senior citizens in Cook County benefit from the Senior Citizen
Homeowner’s Exemption each year, a valuable and important form of property tax relief; and
WHEREAS, the Senior Exemption can reduce a senior’s property tax bill by several hundred dollars; and
WHEREAS, in tax year 2007, the Cook County Assessor’s Office stopped requiring seniors 65 years or
older to apply annually for the Exemption and therefore saved additional processing and mailing costs;
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Assessor’s office recently mailed 300,000 application to remind Senior
Citizens that they must apply for the Senior Citizen Exemption each year; and
WHEREAS, the Assessor’s office verifies the Exemption whenever a deed transfer occurs on a property
receiving the Exemption; and

RESOLUTION continued
ITEM #1 cont’d
WHEREAS, the Exemption has no income requirement and requires only that the taxpayer be 65 or older
and own the house that is their principal residence; and
WHEREAS, legislation passed by the General Assembly requires seniors to reapply every year for the
Exemption, creating an unnecessary obstacle for them; and
WHEREAS, this requirement was mandated only for Cook County and does not apply to any other
Assessor’s officer county office in Illinois; and
WHEREAS, this requirement will place an unfunded mandate on the County and require the County to
expend unnecessary funds for publications, mailings and administration of the exemption during an
economic period where any and all unnecessary expenses to taxpayers should be taken under high
consideration; and
WHEREAS, every time a major change in an exemption application process has occurred it has resulted
in confusion and missed property tax savings, especially for those exemptions specifically targeted for the
senior citizen population.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners and the
Cook County Assessor urge the General Assembly to promptly reconsider this provision imposed upon
the senior population of Cook County and remedy this provision by enacting further legislation allowing
for the Assessor to maintain the practice of verification they have installed which allowed for automatic
renewal of this valuable property tax relief for Cook County senior citizens.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT #311327
Transmitting a Communication, dated February 10, 2011 from
JOHN P. SCHNEIDER, Director, Department of Economic Development
Bureau of Community Development
respectfully submitting this Resolution regarding Brian J. Kamstra’s request for a Class 8 property tax
incentive located at 536 East 162nd Street, South Holland, Illinois. The applicant’s business is merchant
servicing. As the tenant, Select Merchant Services, Inc. sells and leases credit card transaction equipment.
Brian J. Kamstra requests approval of the tax incentive based on the special circumstances that the
property has been vacant for less than 24 months; is being purchased for value; and that substantial
rehabilitation will be completed under the Class 8 Ordinance. The subject property’s location in Thornton
Township helps qualify its eligibility for Class 8 as it is in one of the five pre-determined communities
automatically eligible for Class 8. This Resolution is required so that the company can complete its
application to the Assessor of Cook County.
