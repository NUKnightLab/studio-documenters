VII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (Attachment #10)
Dr. Shannon provided an update on several subjects; detail is included in Attachment #10.
A. Federal Update
Susan White and Jonathan Sheiner, of the lobbying firm of Susan J. White & Associates, provided an update on federal
matters. Mr. Sheiner highlighted the federal budget process, and Ms. White discussed possibilities of changes to come to
the Medicaid Program and other issues that affect CCHHS, based on the changes in Congress and in the White House in
January.
Ms. White stated that she has been in touch with leadership on both sides of the aisle, in both the House and Senate; what
is happening now is a work in progress. She has heard about the possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA); the
incoming President-Elect and leadership are very serious about that at certain levels. President-Elect Donald J. Trump
has said some different things on that subject, and has indicated the possibility of repealing and replacing it. She noted
that a lot of Republican governors who have implemented the Medicaid expansion have begun to raise concerns on that
subject.
Ms. White stated that it is expected that the Senate will be taking a vote on January 3rd on a budget resolution, which is
the first step of the budget process and sets the blueprint and direction on what they want to do. Essentially, the budget
resolution is how they communicate their decisions on what will be done with the insurance exchanges, Medicare,
Medicaid, etc.; it also directs the House and Senate committees that write legislation to take X number of cuts to whichever
programs, or however the resolution directs.
The second step of the budget process is budget reconciliation; this involves writing legislation that reconciles with the
numbers from the blueprint. Although it would be challenging for them, based on the volume of work involved, they may
do this very quickly. They wanted to implement the budget resolution so the President would have something to sign by
the end of January or beginning of February. She has heard that the process could be slowing down, or they may instead
take some elements that are simpler so they can have something that the President can sign. She noted that they have a
shell of the budget resolution that passed in the House last year, so they have something to work with.
Ms. White provided information on what she has seen in terms of Medicaid proposals. She has seen an idea to allow
states flexibility to receive Medicaid funding in a block grant or to take it in the form of a per-capita cap. Under a percapita cap, each beneficiary category would be capped at a certain amount. If they cap Medicaid in some way, it is not
known whether the expansions and money contained in the ACA for those expansions would be included.
Something to also consider is the fact that the Medicaid expansion started out at 100% federal match, whereas the basic
Medicaid Program in Illinois is a 50% match; the discussion around the 50% match is expected to come into the mix if it
goes in the direction of potentially determining the baseline for every state. Other states that are currently set at 50%
match include California, New York, Minnesota, Florida and Texas.
Chairman Hammock inquired whether the budget reconciliation can be passed on a partisan basis. Ms. White responded
that only 51 votes are needed in the Senate for passage. The big question now is whether all of the Republican votes are
there. Mr. Sheiner noted that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is required to score all of these provisions, which
takes time; the CBO is also a part of the critical process.
Chairman Hammock noted that one of the topics being discussed is whether health insurance coverage will continue to
be mandatory. He asked whether that is a regulatory or dollars and cents question. Mr. Sheiner stated that currently, the
insurance mandate is backed up by a tax, and that was a very important part of the Supreme Court’s decision; therefore,
it was subject to the reconciliation bill. He noted that insurance companies are concerned with the possibility of removing
the mandate, because that will impact the risk pools.

VII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (continued)
Director Suleiman Gonzalez inquired whether this is a possible best scenario - they go through their process and there is
a symbolic signing and symbolic discussion, but changes could be minimal. Ms. White responded that if they get to the
point of having actual legislation that the President can sign, big changes may be seen. For example, if Medicaid is
changed from a means-tested entitlement program to a block grant or per-capita cap, it then becomes a baseline fight for
the state’s allocation.
In response to a question from Director Suleiman Gonzalez regarding whether the work requirement for Medicaid
beneficiaries proposal is gaining traction, Mr. Sheiner indicated that information to date leans towards that decision being
made at the state level. With regard to a question regarding the Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Ms. White stated
that there is a lot of bipartisan support for that program; she believes that there is a will to get the program reauthorized
this year, but they have a busy calendar, which makes it a challenge.
Director Estrada inquired why, other than politics, is there an urgency to repeal the ACA, and who stands to win? Ms.
White responded that those questions will likely be posed and discussed, and perhaps will be part of what slows down the
process at some point; she noted that there has been some discussion about getting an economic impact analysis done on
the subject.
Chairman Hammock stated that, with regard to the mandate question, a lot has been heard about the failed insurance
exchanges; this applies to the group of people whose income level makes them ineligible for Medicaid and who do not
have employer-sponsored insurance. This group may not like to pay for the insurance, or cannot afford it. It seems to
him that one of the early possible targets would be to simply eliminate the mandate. The impact of that would presumably
be that hospitals would be expected to provide more charitable care. Even if Medicaid does not change at all, that segment
could force the provision of more charitable care, which he believes would continue and accelerate. That is one of his
more major concerns, perhaps more so than what happens to Medicaid. Dr. Shannon concurred; the consequences are
plausible - uni-directional dumping of patients who are uninsured to the public system.
Director Richardson-Lowry requested that, in the future, when any economic impact analysis or study on this subject is
done and available, that it be passed along to the Board. Additionally, she inquired as to how the CBO scores are
communicated. Mr. Sheiner responded that, once they are publicly issued, they are posted and available on their website.
Chairman Hammock clarified that, in terms of the order of the federal administration’s focus, they seem to be focused on
the ACA, immigration, infrastructure, and tax reform. Ms. White concurred; as an overlay to all of this, is the funding of
the basic government. The Continuing Resolution passed by Congress in December, which funds federal operations, runs
out in April - where will the tensions be?
Chairman Hammock concluded that, for next year’s budget, the Board is probably going to need to spend some extra time
on it; those discussions will start in July, and more information will be available at that time about potential impacts to
CCHHS.

on three topics while attending the conference.

IMPACT 2020 Objective 4.2

Ancy Jacob was recently named our Advanced Practice Provider of the year. Though has a number of
outstanding nurses and physician assistants that do fine work, Jacob, who has been on the palliative care team
for over two years, was chosen for the award because of the "selfless, competent, valuable, compassionate? she
gives her patients. Those words come from physician assistant Ratna Kanumury, who was recently featured in
an article on Media Planet about the future of healthcare.

IMPACT 2020 Objective 4.2

others in this environment.

IMPACT 2020 Objective 4.2

Patient Experience

We recently received two patient thank-you notes for trauma and trauma services in the Pediatric Intensive
Care Unit (PICU), thanking them for the kindness and expertise the staff have shown to so many patients. One
of the thank?you notes comes from a couple who has written to us every Thanksgiving since our trauma unit
saved their son?s life 23 years ago. The note expresses gratitude for the many Sunday dinners, family vacations
and graduations the couple has had with him mwem 79

 

in addition, here?s an excerpt from a grandfather thanking the trauma PICU unit:

From the time the patient arrived at the Trauma Center, she was given outstanding treatment; once the
patient arrived there were eight doctors who worked tirelessly to save the patient. After all of their
work, the patient was transferred to the 4th floor PICU where she was treated with outstanding care
until she parents decided to have her organs donated to other children so they would get the
gift of life. The patient will live on because of the organ feel your staff of PICU doctors, PICU
nurses, trauma center doctors, and the Illinois Medical District Guest House Foundation extended and
provided excellent care to the patient and showed compassion to the grieving family members.

The grandfather especially wanted to recognize the team - Dr. Abayomi Akintorin, Dr. Oyinade Akinyede,
nurse manager Chinyere Okoroh, Dr. Peter Nguyen, Dr. Ani Shah, Dr. Joanna Tylka and Rev. Carol Reese.

Activities and Announcements

Staff have developed action plans for nearly all of the 130 initiatives/milestones outlined in Impact 2020. More
than half of the initiatives/milestones are identified for partial or full completion in 2017. Leadership will review
progress on a basis with periodic reporting as appropriate through relevant Board committees.
it is anticipated that the board will receive a full status report in May or June to assist in informing the 2018
budget. it should be noted that staff are closely analyzing the impact of possible changes under a Trump
Administration to the Affordable Care Act and developing initial plans as appropriate. This may require a
reprioritization of the initiatives and objectives to better assign resources. Any significant changes will be
brought to the Board for discussion and approval.

On Thursday, December Senator Richard Durbin hosted a roundtable to discuss the local impact of
congressional Republicans plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act ??without replacing it-?-in early January. The
roundtable was held at and included Dr. Shannon, AJ. Wilhelmi, President CEO of the Illinois Health 
Hospital Association; and Stephanie Altman, Director of Health Care Justice at the Sargent Shriver National
Center on Poverty Law. More than 30 health care advocates attended the event. Initial media clips attached.

On Tuesday, November 15?, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and other
elected and appointed officials joined in the official ribbon cutting for the Community Triage Center in
the Roseland neighborhood. The CTC, a first-of?its kind clinic in Chicago, offers a safe place for individuals in
crisis due to a mental health or substance abuse condition to receive care 24 hours a day, 365 days a year
regardless of the individuai?s ability to pay.

The CTC offers an alternative place where people suffering from a behavioral health crisis can find stabilization
and treatment services, rather than a hospital emergency department or a jail. In addition to stabilizing,
assessing and treating each patient, the licensed social workers and nurses who staff the CTC will provide
patients with case management and make ?warm? hand-offs for ongoing community-based mental health and
substance use services through our behavioral health consortium.

Patients will be able to walk?in to the CTC without an appointment. New orders enacted by the Chicago Police

On November 15, 2016 the Cook County Board approved the FY2017 Appropriations Ordinance which included a
Sugar Sweetened Beverage Tax of one cent per fluid ounce. The FY2017 Health Fund Tax Allocation was
approved at a slight increase over the approved by the Board in August 2016.

The Illinois General Assembly returned to Springfield for the Fall Veto Session November 15?16, 2016 and
November 29-December 1, 2016. Little to no progress was made on the state budget. As of early December, the
state bill backlog was at $10.4 billion.

The state stopgap budget that provided a partial year of funding for state services, with the exception of K-12
funding which was funded for 12 months, expires on December 31, 2016. Without a new budget agreement,
state universities and social services will face an uncertain financial future starting January 1, 2017. Medicaid
funding for providers and managed care entities will continue through agreed court orders and consent decrees.

Legislators are expected to return to Springfield on January 10 and will have two days of "lame duck" session
days before new and returning legislators are sworn into the 100th session of the Illinois General Assembly on
January 12, 2017.

The Governor is scheduled to deliver his State of the State address on January 25, 2017 and his annual budget

address on February 15, 2017.

With the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States changes are expected in health care policy.
Democrats picked up seats in both the House and Senate, Republicans maintained control of both chambers.

President-elect Trump has nominated Congressman Tom Price (R-GA) as secretary of the Department of Health
and Human Services (HHS) and Seema Verma to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS.)
Congressman Price has been a vocal critic of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and has consistently voted to repeal
it. He is a proponent of turning over control of Medicaid to the states through either block grants or per capita
caps.

Ms. Verma comes to CMS from the State of Indiana, where Vice President-elect Pence is currently governor and
where she led the redesign of lndiana?s Medicaid expansion. Ms. Verma is a proponent ofgreater state control
of Medicaid and using market forces such as co?pays and health savings accounts to generate more efficiency
from the Medicaid program.

Congress will likely move early next year on legislation to repeal the ACA. What is not yet clear is the extent of
the repeal, its timing and the programs to replace the expansions of coverage.

On December 9,2016 Congress approved and the President signed a Continuing Resolution (CR) that expires on
April 28, 2017. This will allow the newly elected President to propose a budget and the new Congress will then
work with those guidelines.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for at both the State and Federal level.

Upcoming Survey and Results of Stroke Accreditation
Please remember, the Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County (ACHNj/Stroger
Hospital is in a window for survey by The Joint Commission.

The Joint Commission accredited Stroger Hospital as a Primary Stroke Center after a visit at the end of
August. Sfroger's designation as Primary Stroke Center distinguishes the hospital's ability to provide the
essential elements of care that improve long-term outcomes for stroke patients.

Reporting through 

Staff are asked to log any safety events or ?good catches" into our electronic event reporting
piatform. EMERS helps us track potential areas of vulnerability and trends in safety and quality. Reports
in are easy to fill out and typically take only ten minutes. The link to is available on the

Intranet, or by ciicking here.

Leaders To Know: Zorina Oakley, Pharm.D. and Lorna Pryor, Pharm.D.

Zorina Oakley, Pharm.D. is the Director of Inpatient Pharmacy for Cook County Health Hospitals
System. Lorna Pryor, Pharm.D. is Director of Outpatient Pharmacy. Both run ?huddles" in their
pharmacies under CaTanya Norwood?s leadership. These huddles are 5? to i5?minute meetings where
the pharmacists review any issues written in the logbook. issues addressed include staffing, medication
inventory and new problems. Oakley and Pryor say these huddles, which are conducted two or three
times a day, have improved patient safety in their pharmacies.

?Departmental huddles are a great way for a team to take a few brief minutes to review any potential
quality or safety issues that have arisen, or probiems they might anticipate. Not only do huddles allow
the team to address potentially harmful situations, but they also help keep safety top of mind for
everyone,? said Dr. Krishna Das, Chief Quality Officer. ?l encourage every team to explore having shift
huddles regardless of what area they work in.?

Fire Safety Life Safety

All health care providers must be vigilant about fire safety and utilize proven strategies to keep our
patients and ourselves safe, according to Director of Life Safety Lezah Brown?Ellington, What
increases our risk of fire danger?

. Storage too close to the sprinkler heads. Sprinklers are designed to deliver water from the
ceiling in case of a fire. But there must be a clear path between objects in the room and the
sprinkler heads: there should be no objects within i8 inches of the sprinkler head.

. Penetration in the walls. Stroger has fire-resistant walls throughout the building to prevent fire
from spreading. A hole in the wall, though, can allow smoke and fire to travet from one part of
the building to another. Alert 8&0 to repair any penetrations immediately.

0 Blocking fire doors. in the event of a fire alarm, doors will close automatically to prevent the
transfer of heat and smoke throughout the hospital. Placing objects in front of the doors can
prevent closure and increase risk that fire can spread-putting patients and staff in jeopardy.

. Reducing the width of the corridors. Keeping facility corridors clear of objects at atl times will
make it easier for people to evacuate a building more quickly when necessary.

. Inadequate lighting. Emergency lights must be visible, so people can see the nearest exit.
Managers in clinical areas are encouraged to fill out the Hazard Surveillance Form to identify
potential risks in their area. Please contact Dr. Das with any questions at 3i2-864-7208

aggONS RUCTION 

Welcome to the first issue of Construction Update, latest newsletter to keep employees informed of all
the construction projects throughout the system. As previously reported, has embarked on a very
ambitious plan to renovate, rebuild or relocate many of our facilities to better serve our patients. In the past
year or so, we have completed the following projects:

. A new dental suite at Prieto

Complete remodel and upgrade of the mammography suites at Provident

- State-of-the-art center at Provident to provide broad range of ophthalmology services

- Development of the Community Triage Center in the Roseland community

Additionally, the new central registration and same day surgery projects When you say ?Central
are nearing completion. We look forward to improving the patient flow Campus", what do you mean?
in both these areas in the coming months.

The Central Campus

Stroger. Following registration, they complete their pre-op processes and 
change into their gowns before going up to the third floor procedure
areas. The changes happening on the third floor will centralize all of these processes and make for a far better
experience for our patients. it will also improve flow for our staff. We expect to complete these changes by
March. At that time, Clinic will be renovated to accommodate the Allergy, Anti-coagulation and Asthma
clinics.

 

The next phase of this multi?year plan contemplates significant upgrades to services provided on the Central
Campus and the Provident campus as well as the Oak Forest, Logan Square, Vista and Cicero health centers.

This first issue of Construction Update focuses heavily on the activities taking place on the Central Campus to
prepare for the new 9-story, 282,000 square foot Central Campus Health Center (CCHC) at the corner of Polk and
Damen. This new clinical and administrative building, expected to open in late 20l8, will allow to
significantly improve outpatient services, reduce operating costs, avoid costly capital renewals for dilapidated
buildings, and increase clinical and administrative efficiency. The new CCHC will replace the Fantus Clinic,
Administration Building and the Hektoen Administration Building, all of which have far surpassed their useful lives
for both our patients and our staff. Site preparation is occurring every day with groundbreaking scheduled for
early December. Some specific happenings include the relocation of the oxygen tanks from behind Stroger to an
area near the Wood Street parking lot. This project has started and will unfortunately impact traffic in front of
Stroger until complete. In the coming weeks, construction fencing will be installed at Damen and Polk and
construction trailers will begin to appear. Traffic delays on Polk Street are expected as construction equipment
will be entering and exiting the job site.

This new building will allow us to better compete with other health systems but we cannot suspend our efforts to
improve the patient experience until 2018. Over the next six or seven months, all services currently in Fantus will
be relocated. Most services will move into Stroger and some will remain in Stroger permanently. We are excited
about the creation of a women and children's center on the fourth floor of Stroger that will provide significant

children?s center will include outpatient services such as prenatal and pediatric primary and specialty care as
well as inpatient services such as labor and delivery and and pediatric inpatient care.

 

COOK COUNTY EALTH

 

 

Additionally, space is being constructed for case management staff on floors 6, 7 and 8 in Stroger which will
allow our social work team to be closer to the patients they serve.

As we work to relocate patient services, we fully understand that this will result in space constraints, busy
elevators and more foot traffic particularly at Stroger. We are asking for your understanding and cooperation as
we undertake this exciting project that will provide a much improved patient care environment for everyone.
As construction begins throughout the hospital, we are asking that employees use the staff elevators in Stroger
to ensure our patients and visitors are not subject to delays.

stroger and Fantus Pharmacy Changes

patients while Stroger houses a second outpatient pharmacy as well as a separate pharmacy that serves
