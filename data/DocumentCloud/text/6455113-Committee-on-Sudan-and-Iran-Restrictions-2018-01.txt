____________________________________________
ROLL CALL
The meeting was called to order at 12:30 PM. The roll was called and a quorum was present.
Following the taking of the roll Mr. Atwood recognized Ms. Monica-Kaye Gamble to the meeting, and
welcomed her as the IIPB’s new Executive Director
DISCUSSION OF CHANGES IN SUDAN/IRAN RESTRICTIONS
Discussion commenced among the committee regarding changes in recognition of Sudan and Darfur by
the Federal government, and whether such changes by the Federal Government might cause the IIPB to
amend its List of Forbidden Entities. Ms. Gamble advised that based on her research, the Federal
Government has taken no action that might cause the IIPB to adjust the List of Forbidden Entities.

DISCUSSION OF IDENTIFICATION OF FORBIDDEN ENTITES RELATED TO CURRENT SUDAN/IRAN
RESTRICTIONS

Based on information transmitted to the Board and the recommendation of the Executive Director, the
Committee recommended that the Board remove the firm Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd. (“ “K” Line”) from
the list of Forbidden Entities.
DISCUSSION OF SUDAN/IRAN LIST VENDOR
The Committee discussed the relationship between the IIPB/ISBI/Glass Lewis/ISS. Members of the
committee expressed concerns regarding failure of ISS to fully disclose perceived conflicts of interest
related identification of companies that boycott Israel. The Committee agreed that this was a
-1-

 meaningful topic for discussion, but given that matter included issues beyond the scope of the
Committee, the discussion should be tabled until the meeting of the full Board.
PUBLIC COMMENTS
None

which was yet to be scheduled.
