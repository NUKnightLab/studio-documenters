Re: American College of Surgeons Hospital Participation Agreement

Respectfully requesting authority to execute a hospital participation agreement with the American
College of Surgeons for trauma data sharing and ACS benchmarking services.

This contract with ACS is necessary in order for the John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County to
remain a veri?ed Level 1 Trauma Center. Although the annual fee for this contract is $12,000.00, this
contract is being presented for your consideration due to requirement of an indemni?cation

clause in the accompanying business associate and data sharing agreement that would make each party
responsible for the impact of its own data breach.
