RECOGNIZING MAY 1, 2014 AS NATIONAL LAW DAY
WHEREAS, Law Day is a national day set aside to celebrate the rule of law. Law Day underscores how law and
the legal process contribute to the freedoms that all Americans share. Law Day also provides an opportunity to
recognize the role of courts in this democracy and the importance of jury service to maintaining the integrity of the
courts; and
WHEREAS, Law Day has its origin in 1957, when American Bar Association (ABA) President Charles S. Rhyne
envisioned a special day for celebrating our legal system; and
WHEREAS, on February 3, 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower established Law Day by issuing a Proclamation
proclaiming it “fitting that the people of this Nation should remember with pride and vigilantly guard the great
heritage of liberty, justice and equality under law which our forefathers bequeathed to us”. Every President, since
President Eisenhower has issued an Annual Law Day Proclamation; and
WHEREAS, on April 7, 1961, Congress passed a Joint Resolution, designating May 1 as Law Day. The theme
of the 2014 Law Day is “American Democracy and the Rule of Law: Why Every Vote Matters”; and
WHEREAS, the right to vote is the very foundation of government by the people. For this reason, striving to
establish and protect every citizen’s right to vote has been a central theme of American legal and civic history.
Much of the struggle for voting rights began decades ago, but the work is far from complete and citizen’s right to
cast a ballot remains at risk today; and
WHEREAS, this Law Day occurs on the eve of the 50th anniversaries of two (2) landmark pieces of legislation the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Speaking on the Voting Rights Act, President
Lyndon B. Johnson observed, “Every American citizen must have an equal right to vote. There is no reason which
can excuse the denial of that right. There is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to
ensure that right”; and

WHEREAS, Law Day, May 1, 2014, will provide an opportunity to reflect on the importance of a citizen’s right
to vote and the challenges we still face in ensuring that all Americans have the opportunity to participate in our
democracy.

THE COOK COUNTY COMPANION ANIMAL AND CONSUMER
PROTECTION ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, pet stores selling live animals have traditionally been a sales outlet for young dogs, cats, and rabbits
bred commercially in puppy mills, kitten mills, and rabbit mills both within the United States and abroad; and
WHEREAS, according to the Humane Society of the United States, it is estimated that 10,000 puppy mills produce
more than 2,400,000 puppies a year in the United States and that nearly all pet store puppies, kittens and many pet
store rabbits come from puppy, kitten and rabbit mills, respectively; and
WHEREAS, puppy mills are mass breeding facilities that churn out puppies with an emphasis on profit over
welfare. These mills usually house dogs in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions without adequate veterinary
care, food, water and socialization. Puppy mill dogs do not get to experience treats, toys, exercise or basic
grooming; and
WHEREAS, the inhumane conditions in puppy and kitten mill facilities lead to health and behavioral issues as well
as congenital and hereditary illness and disease. Puppy mill puppies often arrive in pet stores and their new homes
with various diseases including giardia, parvovirus kennel cough, heartworm and distemper. These diseases can
lead to excessive veterinary costs both upfront and down the line; and
WHEREAS, rabbits are often treated inhumanely in the breeding mills and because rabbits can multiply every 28
days, rabbit mills are particularly prone to problems of overcrowding. These animals are often viewed as
disposable, and after the Easter holiday it’s estimated that as many as 80% of rabbits sold as Easter or springtime
pets are abandoned by their owners; and
WHEREAS, the lack of enforcement resources at local, state and federal levels allow many inhumane puppy,
kitten, and rabbit mills to operate with impunity. According to a spokesman from the United States Department of
Agriculture, due to budget constraints, the Illinois Department of Agriculture employs only seven inspectors that
are charged with overseeing more than 1,300 dog dealers, kennel operators and pet shop operators; and
WHEREAS, every year millions of cats and dogs are euthanized in our nation’s animal shelters because there are
more pets than there are responsible homes for them. Puppy and kitten mills contribute to pet overpopulation and
cause countless animals lifetimes of suffering in squalid wire cages; and

WHEREAS, according to information obtained from the Illinois Department of Agriculture regarding publicly run
animal care and control facilities located within Cook County, in 2011 these facilities impounded 19,442 dogs and
cats that were not reclaimed by the owner, and euthanized 6,618 of these animals (roughly 34% of total). In 2012
these facilities impounded 22,679 dogs and cats that were not reclaimed by the owner, and euthanized 8,035 of
these animals (roughly 39% of total); and
WHEREAS, between 2011 and 2012 there was an increase of 3,237 dogs and cats impounded and not reclaimed
by the owner and a 5 percent increase in the rate of euthanasia; and
WHEREAS, this Ordinance specifically addresses the retail sale of dogs, cats and rabbits in pet stores and will not
affect a consumer’s ability to obtain a dog or cat of his or her choice directly from a breeder, a breed specific rescue
organization or a shelter; and
WHEREAS, across the country, thousands of independent pet stores as well as large chains operate profitably with
a business model focused on the sale of pet services and supplies and not on the sale of dogs and cats. Many of
these stores collaborate with local animal shelters and rescue organizations to offer space and support for
showcasing adoptable homeless pets in need of a forever home; and
WHEREAS, on March 5, 2014, the Chicago City Council overwhelming approved a similar ordinance that allows
for the commercial sale of dogs, cats and rabbits in the City of Chicago only if they are sourced from shelters and
other humane adoption centers, effectively ending the sale of pets from animal mills in the interest of the health and
well-being of animals and local consumers alike; and
WHEREAS, in the United States and Canada alone, over 40 cities have enacted ordinances addressing the sale of
puppy and kitten mill dogs and cats, including: Chicago, Los Angeles, California; San Diego, California;
Albuquerque, New Mexico; Austin, Texas; Brick, New Jersey and Toronto, Canada; and
WHEREAS, current Federal and State of Illinois laws and regulations do not properly address the sale of
commercially bred dogs, cats and rabbits in the County’s business establishments; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners believes it is in the best interests of the County to adopt
reasonable regulations to protect the citizens of the County who may purchase dogs, cats or rabbits from a pet store,
help prevent inhumane breeding conditions, promote community awareness of animal welfare, and foster a more
humane environment in the County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 10
Animals, Article I, In General, Sections 10-1 through 10-3 of the Cook County Code of Ordinances is hereby
amended as follows:

retail center with a grocery store component to continue operations at its current location
and maintain its staff, and that without such designation the retail center with grocery store
component would not be economically viable, causing the property to be in imminent risk
of becoming or continuing to be vacant and unused. With regards to the retail
development enterprise, the retail development enterprise that will occupy the premises
submits evidence of hardship supporting a determination that the Amended Class 6a
designation is necessary for the retail to be developed, and that without such designation

copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing the Amended Class 6a
eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date
an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Amended Class 6a. If the Ordinance
or Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at
that time, a letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that an
Ordinance or Resolution supporting the incentive has been requested.
c. A copy of the Ordinance or Resolution or letter confirming that an Ordinance or Resolution has
been requested, whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor’s Office

validate such a finding that the property is deemed “qualified” for the purpose of the Amended
Class 6a and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of the County Resolution
validating such a finding that the property is deemed “qualified” for the purpose of the Amended

but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request
the class change to Amended Class 6a.
e. The Assessor shall provide rules for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Amended Class
6a incentives granted as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the
Amended Class 6a site. In such reports, recipients shall be required to certify whether the retail
center with grocery store component or the retail development enterprise continues its operations
at that location. In addition, recipients of Amended Class 6a incentives shall be required to report
to the Assessor within 30 days if the retail center with grocery store component or the retail
development enterprise ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports will be
forwarded by the Assessor’s Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to
members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within the
time established by the Assessor’s rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating

development enterprise ceases operations at that location, then the Amended Class 6a incentive
granted shall terminate.

regarding the retail development enterprise and will continue for a period of 12 years or until the
retail center with grocery store component or the retail development enterprise ceases operations
at that location if that occurs sooner.

h. This incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten percent
assessment level pursuant to Section 74-64(7), if the following requirements are met:
i. The property can continue to be deemed “qualified” for the purposes of the Class 6a;
ii. The applicant notifies the Assessor’s Office of intent to request renewal of the incentive
from the municipality or the County Board, if the real estate is located in an unincorporated

iii. The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the premise

including the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are
substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified
land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square

the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on
the parcel.

a.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or Resolution expressly
stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive
provided by Class 6b is necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 6b application
to the Assessor. A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing
the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later
than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution
is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a
letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or
Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested.

b.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested, whichever is filed
with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board
for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts.

c.

Class 6b applications for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and other
structures must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of such new
construction or substantial rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 6b incentive. With respect to
abandoned property, the Class 6b application must be made to the Assessor prior to the
commencement of the reoccupation of the vacant and unused property.

d.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein,
the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 6b,
unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant
and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be
included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. If the
Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a
County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling
Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance
to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide
a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special
circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such
a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the
time of filing the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the
Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b.
If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b eligibility application, the applicant shall
instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming
that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the instance where
real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or

the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding
that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of a Class 6b under the TEERM Program if
there has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and
unused for at least 12 continuous months. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification
of the special circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and
consenting to the Class 6b application under the TEERM Program. If the Ordinance or Resolution is
that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that
the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect
shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required
finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding
that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution
to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist,
as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the
Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an
assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the
time of the Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding
special circumstances has been requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program: In the instance where real estate does not meet the
definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case
may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed
"qualified" for purpose of Class 6b under the SER Program if:
1.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same location for a minimum
of ten years prior to the date of application for the SER Program;

2.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of hardship supporting a
determination that participation in the SER Program is necessary for the industrial enterprise to
continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to
be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused; and

3.

The applicant is not receiving another Cook County property tax incentive for the same
property.

The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special circumstances, and
a determination that the applicant's participation in the SER Program is necessary for the industrial
enterprise to continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to be in
imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance
supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a
municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property
is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be
obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of
special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is
deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A
certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a
certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is
deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b

appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the
Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the
County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special
circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program or SER Program under a Class 6b application must be received
by the Assessor's Office on or before November 30, 2018 to receive consideration.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Class 6b incentives
granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports, recipients shall be required to certify whether the
industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application continues its
operations at that location. In addition, recipients of Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to the SER
Program shall be required to report to the Assessor within 30 days if the industrial enterprise that
occupied the premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that location. A copy
of such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for
distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports
within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period
relating to the nonfiling. Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the
time of the SER application ceases operations at that location, then the Class 6b incentive granted
pursuant to the SER program shall terminate.
e.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed,
or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy, or in the case of
incentives granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, from the date of the notice of approval. In the
case of incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program, this classification shall continue for a period
of 12 years from the date of the notice of approval, or until the industrial enterprise that occupied the
premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that location if that occurs sooner.

f.

Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program, this incentive may
be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten percent assessment level pursuant to
section 74-64(7), if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of intent to request renewal of the incentive from the
municipality or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
the County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is
necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class
6b; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Assessor's
Office before the expiration of the ten-percent assessment level period.

g.

Class 6b incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER Program are not
renewable. For all other Class 6b incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited as long as
the property continues to apply and meet the requirements for Class 6b.

h.

A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected
districts.

If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to
Section 74-64(7). After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this division.

j.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper review of
all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class 6b.

k.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 6b
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 6b site. A
copy of such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board
for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such
reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the
period relating to the nonfiling.

(8)(9) Class C. Real estate which is to be used for industrial or commercial purposes, including abandoned
property, as defined in Section 74-62, including the land upon which such property is situated; or vacant
land; where such real estate because of contamination has undergone environmental testing and
remediation and has received a "No Further Remediation Letter" from the site remediation program.
a.

To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No Further Remediation
Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation objectives based on the industrial or commercial
use.

b.

The owner of the property is rendered ineligible for the Class C classification by having previously
owned or operated the site, directly or indirectly, or having been a partner or being associated through
a family or business relationship with anyone who has owned or operated the site, which ownership
or operation caused the contamination which was remediated pursuant to a site remediation. A
present owner who can successfully demonstrate that the owner was not responsible for the
contamination may be eligible for Class C classification.

c.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an ordinance or resolution expressly
stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive
provided by Class C is necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class C application
to the Assessor. A certified copy of the ordinance or resolution must be filed at the time of application
for the Class C classification. A copy of that ordinance or resolution, whichever is submitted, will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of
the County Board from the affected districts.

d.

To qualify for the Class C classification, an application for Class C classification must be made
within one year of the receipt of the "No Further Remediation Letter." Where an application for Class
C classification encompasses less than all of the contiguous property owned by the applicant upon
which remediation has been completed, the one year limitation will be waived for any subsequent
separate application for Class C classification for the remainder or for additional portions of the
property, provided that such subsequent application is made within seven years.

e.

Additionally, to qualify for the Class C classification, the estimated remediation costs, including site
investigation, testing, oversight, remediation and removal costs, monitoring, and engineering and
legal fees associated with the remediation process, must total at least $100,000.00, or alternatively,
must total at least 25 percent of the market value of the real estate as determined by the Assessor's
property record card in the year prior to the remediation, whichever is less.

The initial Class C classification shall continue for a period of 12 years for both industrial and
commercial property. For industrial property, this incentive may be renewed during the last year a
property is entitled to a 16 percent assessment level, if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is
necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class
C; and

3.

A copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office of the
Assessor before the expiration of the 16 percent assessment level period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply
and qualify for Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment on or before the
adoption date of the ordinance from which this division is derived will be eligible for this
renewal term at the end of their original incentive period subject to the above requirements.
The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to
members of the County Board from the effected districts.

g.

If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class C treatment, but the assessment level is
higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16
percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the
resolution and renewal application. However, if, as of that effective date, the taxpayer's assessment
is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years,
no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no
renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section
74-64. After such ten-year period expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert
to the applicable classification under this division.

h.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the commercial
Class C incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to renewal and the real
estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.

i.

The Assessor shall review the application and supporting documentation to determine eligibility for
the Class C classification. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to
ensure proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the
benefits provided under the Class C classification.

j.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class C
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class C site. Such
reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's
rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(9)(10) Class 7a. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, comprising a qualified commercial
development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in an area in need of commercial
development, where total development costs, exclusive of land, do not exceed $2,000,000.00, consisting

of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or
abandoned property, as defined in this division, including the land upon which such property is situated;
or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation
has added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the
rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible
for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the
total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein,
the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a. The finding
of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the
resolution or ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 7a application. Not withstanding the
foregoing, special circumstances may not be determined to justify finding that a property is deemed
"abandoned" where:
A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or
B.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant
and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

Such resolution or ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the ordinance or
resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a and a resolution to that
effect shall be included with the Class 7a eligibility application filed with the Assessor.
b.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed,
or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy. After such 12-year
period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.

c.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 7a
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 7a site. Such
reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's
rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(10)(11) Class 7b. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, as defined in this division, comprising
a qualified commercial development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in an
"area in need of commercial development", where total development costs, exclusive of land, exceed
$2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon
which they are situated; or abandoned property, as defined herein, including the land upon which such
property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent
such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land
qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The
amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the

withstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not be determined to justify finding that a
property is deemed "abandoned" where:
A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or
B.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant
and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

Such resolution or ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the ordinance or
resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b and a resolution to that
effect shall be included with the Class 7b eligibility application filed with the Assessor.
b.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed,
or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy.

c.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 7b
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 7b site. Such
reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's

property, as defined in this division, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all
buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has
added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation.
a.

b.

Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the
improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square
footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the
parcel. Such real estate must be either obtained through the Cook County Tax Reactivation Project
or must be located in one of the following designated geographical areas:
1.

An area which has been certified as in need of substantial revitalization in accordance with the
provisions of Section 74-65(b);

2.

An enterprise community as proposed and approved by the County Board on June 22, 1994, or
the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, and the municipality in which such real estate is
located, or, if in an unincorporated area, the County must by lawful Resolution determine that
such real estate is consistent with an overall plan for the rehabilitation of the area; or

3.

Any one of the following five townships: Bloom; Bremen; Calumet; Rich; and Thornton.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein,
the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 8, unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or

Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance
to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 and provide
a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special
circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such
a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 need not be filed at the
time of filing the Class 8 application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later

When the Class 9 classification is due to expire or is terminated by action of the owner or the
Assessor, the property owner shall, in a manner and form determined by the Assessor, notify all Class
9 tenants of the date of the termination of Class 9 classification. Once the Class 9 classification is

(13)(14) Class S. Real estate otherwise entitled to Class 3 classification under this division, consisting of land
and existing buildings and structures, which is has been subject to a Section 8 contract renewal. The
portion of the land and building eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the number of
Section 8 units bears to the total number of units. The proportion shall be applied only to property used
for residential purposes, and not to portions of the property, if any, used for commercial purposes.
a.

Property qualifies for the Class S classification if its Section 8 contract has been renewed pursuant
to one of the following alternatives:
1.

HUD has approved renewal of the Section 8 contract under the mark up to market option, after
finding that:
i.

The property has received a physical inspection score of at least 60, in an inspection by
HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center, confirming that the property is decent, safe,
sanitary and in good repair with no uncorrected exigent health and safety (EHS) violations;

ii.

The property does not have a low- and moderate-income use restriction that cannot be
eliminated by unilateral action by the owner. If, however, the current rent is lower than the
use restriction, HUD may use the mark up to market option to increase the rents to the use
restriction level, which would be a renewal qualifying for the S classification; and

iii. A rent comparability study conducted by HUD has demonstrated that comparable market
rents are above 100 percent of the HUD Fair Market Rent.
2.

HUD has approved a contract renewal for five years of the Section 8 contract under the mark
up to market under HUD's discretionary authority, after finding that the property meets at least
one of the required criteria:
i.

A vulnerable population is affected,

ii.

There is a low vacancy rate in the area, which would make tenant based assistance difficult
to use, or a lack of comparable housing, or

iii. The project is a high priority for the local community, as demonstrated by a contribution
of state or local funds to the property.
3.

b.

HUD has approved renewal of a Section 8 contract for a not for profit corporation under any
available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal
Policy Guidelines.

Additional requirements for qualification for the S classification are:
1.

At least 20 percent of the living units must be Section 8 units for qualifying low and moderateincome persons.

2.

The owner must agree to retain at least the existing number of Section 8 units for at least five
years after the expiration of the expiring or expired Section 8 contract.

renewal and a copy of the executed renewal contract.

d.

Any property which, as of November 23, 1999, has an existing Section 8 contract with a mark up to
market option may apply for Class S classification for the any portion of the 2001 assessment year
encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term, including any
renewals approved with the mark up to market option. The classification shall continue until the
expiration or termination of the Section 8 contract.

e.

f.

Any property which, as of (DATE AMENDMENT APPROVED), has an existing Section 8 contract
renewal may apply for Class S classification for any portion of the 2006 assessment year
encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term, including any
renewals approved with the mark up to market option, mark up to market option under HUD's
discretionary authority or a Section 8 contract that has been renewed by a not-for-profit corporation
under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8
Renewal Policy Guidelines. The classification shall continue until the expiration or termination of
the Section 8 contract.
The incentive may be renewed if the Section 8 contract is again renewed under any of the following
three options: 1) the mark up to market option; 2) the mark up to market option under HUD's
discretionary authority; or 3) by a not-for-profit corporation under any available option under HUD's
renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines. Upon filing an
application with HUD, no less than 120 days prior to termination of the contract, for renewal of the
Section 8 contract, the taxpayer shall provide notice to the Assessor's Office of its application for
renewal. The taxpayer shall provide a copy to the Assessor's Office of HUD's approval of the contract
renewal, or notification of other action.
The Assessor's Office shall adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided
under Class S.

(14)(15) Class L. Real estate which is to be used for commercial or industrial purposes and which is
designated as Class 3, Class 4, Class 5a or Class 5b pursuant to this division; is a landmark or contributing
building; and has undergone substantial rehabilitation. The substantial rehabilitation must constitute an
investment by the owner of at least 50 percent of the building's full market value as determined by the
Assessor in the assessment year prior to the commencement of the substantial rehabilitation.
a.

Generally, the incentive shall apply only to the building and will not apply to the land underneath the
building. However, if the entire building has been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous
months prior to the filing of the eligibility application with the Assessor, the land upon which the
building is situated shall also be eligible for the incentive.

1.

Has determined that the incentive provided by Class L is necessary for the substantial
rehabilitation of the property;

2.

Supports and consents to the granting of the incentive; and

3.

for the Class L incentive. This recommendation will specify the project's budget and proposed
scope of work and will specify that the project will meets or exceeds the Standards of the United
States Department of the Interior for Rehabilitation, Preservation, Restoration, and
Reconstruction of historic properties.

A certified copy of the ordinance or resolution need not be filed with the Assessor at the time the
Class L eligibility application is filed but the ordinance or resolution must be filed with the Assessor
no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class L.
If the ordinance or resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application is filed, the applicant

f.

Additionally, to qualify a landmark building or contributing building for Class L classification, an
eligibility application must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of
substantial rehabilitation. After the substantial rehabilitation has been completed, the preservation
commission shall review the project to determine that it is eligible under Subsection (14) of this
section. The applicant must supplement the eligibility application with a copy of the determination
of the preservation commission prior to classification of the real estate as Class L.

g.

The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such substantial
rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.

met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is

percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the
resolution and renewal application. However, if as of the effective date, the taxpayer's assessment is
higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years,
no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no
renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section
74-64. After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable
classification under this division.

j.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the commercial

conservation, blighted or renewal area or an area encompassing a rehabilitation or redevelopment plan or
project adopted under the Illinois Urban Renewal Consolidation Act of 1961, as amended, or the

Federal Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the County Board
on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, or the Commercial District Development
Commission Ordinance of the City of Chicago or designation of like effect adopted under any similar
statute or ordinance;
(2) Real estate taxes within the area, during the last six years, have declined, remained stagnant or potential
real estate taxes are not being fully realized due to the depressed condition of the area;
(3) There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation of the
commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably timely basis if granted
Class 7a or 7b designation and will therefore result in the economic enhancement of the area;
(4) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation will materially assist
development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of the area and the commercial development project would
not go forward without the full incentive offered under Class 7a or 7b; and
(5) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation is reasonably expected
to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and employment opportunities within the

case may be, has determined that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this section are present and
that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 7a or 7b
application to the Assessor. A certified copy of such ordinance or resolution shall be included with the Class
7a or 7b application at the time of filing the application with the Assessor. A copy of the ordinance or
resolution, whichever is submitted, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board
for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts. The application shall include
any other information deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the commercial
development project qualifies for the Class 7a or 7b classification and shall bear the expense of doing so.
(c) Inasmuch as the County desires to encourage economic development in the neighborhoods of the County,
support the increased use of the incentive by smaller projects and to limit the expense of such applications, the
Assessor shall liberally construe the requirements of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this section for Class 7a
applications.
(d) The Assessor shall adopt rules, including a provision to ensure a proper review of the application and
supporting data.
(e) Certification of a commercial development project shall not be denied by reason of insufficient size if it
otherwise qualifies hereunder. In determining what constitutes the "full incentive offered" as provided in
Subsection (a)(4) of this section, consideration may be given to any lawful intergovernmental participation
agreements under which the project developer has agreed, as a precondition to Class 7a or 7b certification, to
share a portion of future profits with the appropriate taxing districts.
(f) For Class 7a applications, where the Assessor finds that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this
section exist, the Assessor shall, within 60 days after receipt of the application and necessary supporting data,
certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7a treatment under this division.
(g) In order to determine Class 7b applications, upon receipt of the application and all the necessary supporting
data, the Assessor shall forward it to the Economic Development Advisory Committee of the County. The
Committee shall within 30 days return the application to the Assessor with a finding stating whether the
conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this section are present. The Assessor shall review the application,
supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate facts. Where the Assessor finds the conditions
of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this section exist, the Assessor shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the
Committee's findings, certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7b treatment under this
division.
(h) Class 7a and 7b certifications shall lapse within one year from the date of issuance unless new construction or
substantial rehabilitation, or in the case of abandoned property, reoccupation of the commercial development
project has commenced prior to its expiration.
(i)

To be certified as an area in need of substantial revitalization for purposes of Class 8 classification it is
necessary that:
(1) The municipality in which the area is located or, if an unincorporated area, the County determine by lawful
resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for
private enterprise to accomplish the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area
without public assistance and encouragement, or a determination of similar import;
(2) The municipality or, if in an unincorporated area, the County apply to the Assessor for certification of the
area as one in need of substantial revitalization;

(3) Upon receiving an application to certify an area as in need of substantial revitalization, the Assessor shall
review the application, supporting data and other appropriate factors relevant to a determination of the
severity of the economic conditions of the area. In determining whether the "in need of substantial
revitalization" requirement is met, the Assessor shall give strong consideration and substantial weight to
the fact that an area is located in a Federal empowerment zone or enterprise community, as proposed and
approved by the County Board on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994.
(j)

Upon finding that existing factors convincingly demonstrate that the area is in need of substantial revitalization,
as defined in this division, the Assessor shall grant such certification to the area. In making this determination
statistical data relevant to the surrounding area as well as the specific area for which certification is sought
may be considered. The surrounding area for the City of Chicago shall be the community area as defined in
this division; for all other areas in the County it shall be, where applicable, the municipality in which the area
is located.

(k) If a municipality within an Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the County Board on June
22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, determines by municipal resolution that the area is in
a state of economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish the
necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public assistance and
encouragement, or a determination of similar import and submits a request for Class 8 certification, such
certification shall be automatic pursuant to this division. However, each property eligible for a Class 8 incentive
within the certified area must file an application in a timely manner.
(l)

Any Class 6a incentive that is still active can be renewed. The Class 6a incentive is defined in this division.
The renewal procedures described in Section 74-63 apply to Class 6a as well.

Sec. 74-66. Property in two or more classes.
Where a single parcel of real estate is partially included in two or more of the above-described classes, each
portion shall be assessed at the assessment level herein prescribed for that class.
Sec. 74-67. Assessor's status and progress report.
A written report on the status and progress of the implementation of this division, or any amendments thereto,
and all rules promulgated by the Assessor hereunder, shall be submitted by the County Assessor to the President
and County Board annually on or before December 1.
Sec. 74-68. Classification system to apply with tax assessment year.
(a) The incentive provisions of this division provided to qualifying parcels of real estate for Class 6a, Class 6b,
Class C, Class 7a, Class 7b and Class 8 shall expire on December 31, 2015, unless otherwise reviewed by
action of the County. Real estate granted a Class 6, Class 6a, Class 6b, Class 7 or Class 8 classification on or
before December 31, 1994, shall retain such classification under the terms and conditions of this division prior
to January 1, 1995. Real estate for which an application for Class 6a, Class 6b, Class 7 or Class 8 classification
is filed with the Assessor on or before December 31, 1994, and which thereafter is determined by the Assessor
to be eligible for the classification under the terms and conditions of this division after January 1, 1995, shall
be entitled to receive such classification under such terms and conditions.
(b) Real estate granted a Class 6a, Class 6b, Class 6c, Class 7a, Class 7b or Class 8 classification on or before
December 31, 1999, shall retain such classification under the terms and conditions of this division prior to
January 1, 2000. Real estate for which an application for Class 6b, Class 6c, Class 7a, Class 7b or Class 8
classification is filed with the Assessor on or before December 31, 1999, and which thereafter is determined

by the Assessor to be eligible for classification under the terms and conditions of this division existing prior to
January 1, 2000, shall be entitled to receive such classification under such terms and conditions.
(c) Real Estate granted a Class 6a, Class 6b, Class 7a, Class 7b or Class 8 classification on or before December
31, 2004, shall retain such classification under the terms and conditions of the Ordinance prior to January 1,
2005. Real estate for which an application for Class 6b, Class 7a, Class 7b or Class 8 classification is filed with
the Assessor on or before December 31, 2004, and which thereafter is determined by the Assessor to be eligible
for classification under the terms and conditions of this Ordinance existing prior to January 1, 2005, shall be
entitled to receive such classification under such terms and conditions.
Sec. 74-69. Applicable assessment level.
The assessment level applicable to real estate classified under incentive Classes 6a, 6b, C, 7a, 7b, 8, 9 and L
shall in no event exceed the assessment level which otherwise would have been applicable to such real estate under
the remaining assessment classes provided in this division.
Effective date: This ordinance amendment shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

JOB ORDER CONTRACT
Department:

Office of Capital Planning and Policy

Summary: The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, as authorized by the Cook County Chief Procurement
Officer, plans to participate in the Cook County’s Job Order Contract (JOC) program to complete the three (3)
capital projects listed below. JOC is a quantity based procurement process that allows facility owners to
complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and construction projects with a single, competitively bid contract.

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

April 9, 2014

The JOC process generally involves first selecting a pool of potential contractors through a competitive
procurement process, and then identifying projects for such selected contractors.
The County has already completed a JOC competitive procurement process, and it has created the pool of
generated contractors to perform certain projects generally associated with Maintenance, repairs, replacement and
routine work.
The JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group. The Gordian Group
maintains an area price book, which captures the prices for specific construction work items within this region.
JOC contractors bid against the prices included in the price book. The cost, therefore, of any work performed by
the contractor is a contractor markup form the price book. The Gordian Group would receive 5% administrative
fee from Cook County based on the total project cost of the work. The Gordian Group will manage the JOC
process and will verify that all proposals and work are compliant with the terms and conditions outlined in the JOC
contract within the County.
The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, proposes to assign the projects listed below to the Gordian
Group to share with participating JOC contractors.
Project Descriptions:
1. 7th Floor North MIS Server Farm Renovation -This project creates a secure, and energy efficient data center
to be shared by multiple agencies by reconfiguring the computer room and surrounding print and mail areas. This
will eliminate the high cost of supporting user agencies “mini” data rooms located in many County buildings.
2. Morgue Sinks and Scales Replacements -This project will provide updated sinks and scales, eliminating
delays in the intake & autopsy process, so the morgue can function efficiently. Also the existing decomp cooler
requires HVAC upgrades to maintain temperature as well as the option to provide freezing temperatures.
3. Oak Forest Hospital (Homeland Security Building) Roof & Tuck Pointing - This project will provide tuck
pointing to the roof, creating a stable mounting surface for radio communication antennas. This will prevent water
infiltration.
Budgets:
7th Floor North MIS Server Farm Renovation
$803,000.00

City-owned garage located at 1528 S. Loomis, utilized for washing County vehicles, under a verbal agreement for

Chicago/Cook County collaboration initiative, the City has agreed to provide County with alternate space allowing
the Sheriff’s Office to continue its SWAP related activities in the area.
The City is responsible for all costs of operating the building and the Premises including utilities, custodial

Under the proposed license, Harper College would offer motorcycle safety education

accidents and injuries in the State of Illinois. These courses were previously offered at the site by the University
of Illinoi-Urbana at Champaign.
At the end of last year’s training season the Illinois Department of Transportation, Division of Traffic Safety
realigned its training region boundaries, making Cook County its own training region. Harper College has taken
over the responsibility formerly held by the University of Illinois-Urbana at Champaign for all training conducted
in Cook County.
Harper will utilize a portion of the northeast parking lot for placement of a mobile classroom and equipment
trailer belonging to Licensee and as a riding area for students enrolled in the Program. At season’s end both units
will be stored at Harpers campus in Palatine. Cook County residents have expressed appreciation for the County’s
cooperation in providing a site for this very popular program.

Reason: Allow Facilities to rent additional institutional equipment
From Account(s): 200-450 $30,000.00
To Account(s):

200-638 $30,000.00

Total Amount of Transfer: $30,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds in
order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what was the
balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent on 3/25/2014 that account #638 would need additional funds. The balance on
2/25/2014 in account #638 was $16,936.00
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts that
were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account #450 was chosen because of the amount of funds that have not been encumbered.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred, delayed,
or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in the account that
funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally budgeted
in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
This account was chosen because of the unobligated amount in the repair building and institutional supplies.

Summary: Through an amendment to Contract 08-45-256, the County desires to lower the cost of telephone
calls that detainees in County facilities place to their friends, private defense counsel, and families. In 2008, the
County awarded a competitively procured contract to Securus Technologies, Inc., to provide pay telephone service
to detainees and investigative tools for the County Sheriff.
The proposed amendment will significantly lower the cost of detainee phones. Specifically, the amendment will:
(a) eliminate the current $1 per-call connection fee for detainee calls; (b) lower the per-minute call rate from
$0.20/min to $0.175/min; (c) eliminate the $1.99 monthly fee that cellular phone call recipients incurred when
receiving detainee calls; and (d) strengthen the contractor’s obligations around reporting, service levels, and
transitioning out at contract expiration.

The Chief Procurement Officer concurs
Summary: DDW & Associates/REB Storage Systems International was selected from two (2) vendorbids
received through the open market bid process. The contract for the rental of shelving was approved by the
County Board on 2/4/2009. The vendor designed, installed, and anchored the shelving to the 89th Street
warehouse floor. The temporary storage shelving system is needed by the Clerk of the Circuit Court to maintain
a total of 3,072 pallets of court documents until space is made available at the new Cicero Record Center.
Due to the fact that the new Cicero Record Center construction is still in process, we believe that it is more cost
effective and efficient to retain the expertise and services of the current vendor.
If the current contract were to be rebid, the County would incur additional costs for the reconstruction of
shelving, or reloading of pallets, and incur possible increases in labor costs needed for staff to search for the
location of pallets/documents during the reconstruction. Additionally, the Clerk of the Circuit Court would
experience delays in the retrieval and delivery of court documents during the reconstruction of the shelving.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
ADULT ORAL HEALTH CARE
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII, Section 6 (a) of the
1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its
government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, this country’s strength and ability to prosper is grounded in the health and safety of its people. For
many years now millions of Americans could not afford adequate healthcare. The Affordable Care Act affords us
an opportunity to provide and improve health care services to every American; and
WHEREAS, while the passage of the Affordable Care Act has moved this country in a direction for all people to
have health insurance, it would be remiss of us not to acknowledge the need for adjustments as a program of this
magnitude is implemented; and
WHEREAS, the Affordable Care Act excludes adult oral health care services while it covers many essential health
benefits. It has been acknowledged by oral health care agencies and professionals that oral health care is essential
to insure overall quality of health; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Surgeon General refers to dental disease as a silent epidemic. In 2000 the U.S. Surgeon
General issued a report on the Oral Health of American, in it the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial
Research showed the link between general health and oral health. The report went on to say that many systemic
diseases and conditions have oral manifestations. These manifestations may be the initial sign of clinical disease
and as such serve to inform clinicians and individuals of the need for further assessment. More importantly, the
report notes that the oral cavity is a portal of entry as well as the site of disease for microbial infections that affect
general health status; and

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

April 9, 2014

WHEREAS, it is also acknowledge by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that the lack of access
to dental care is extremely important because left untreated oral disease can lead not only to pain, infection and
tooth loss, but also contribute to an increased risk for serious medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and
poor birth outcomes; and
WHEREAS, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention there are threats to oral health across
one’s lifespan. Nearly one-third of all adults in the United States have untreated tooth decay. One in seven adults
aged 35 to 44 years has gum disease, this increases to one in every four adults aged 65 years and older; and
WHEREAS, according to Oral Health America, the older adult population is the fastest growing segment of the
United States and many are facing a dire situation when it comes to oral health. Accordingly, by 2030 there will
be 72+ million older adults in the U.S., most won’t have access to dental care, impacting overall health; and
WHEREAS, a 2013 study, issued by Advance for Nurse Practitioners and Physicians Assistants, reported that
30% of older adults lose their teeth, 23% have gum disease, 50% have untreated cavity and that there are 30,000
oral and pharyngeal cancers diagnosed annually; and
WHEREAS, the American Dental Association (ADA) states that oral health is essential for a healthy America.
The ADA further states that no law, regulation or mandate will improve the oral health of the public unless
policymakers, patients and dentists work together with a shared understanding of the importance of oral health and
its relationship to overall health; and
WHEREAS, the ADA states that prevention pays and that the key to improving and maintaining good oral health
is by preventing oral disease.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners
calls upon the President of the United States, the House and Senate to consider adult oral health care coverage
under the Affordable Care Act; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of the Resolution be tendered to the President of the United
States of America, the House and the Senate.
