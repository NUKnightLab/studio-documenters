TO: The Honorable Members of the Board of Trustees
Laborers? Annuity and Bene?t Fund of Chicago 

FROM: Robert S. Molaro Associates -
RE: Spring?eld Update

IDATE: December 14, 2018

0 The fall Veto Session 2018 for the 100th General Assembly adjourned on November 29th and is scheduled
to reconvene on January 7, 2019. The old GA. is scheduled to meet for two days before the new 101St 
General Assembly is sworn in on Wednesday, January 9, 2019.

0 It is possible that a minor capital bill, regarding roads and bridges, can be moved during the ?nal two days.
However, the incoming Governor would rather wait until the new session.

0 In the past Veto session, the House and Senate voted, with a super majority, to oven'ide the Governor? 
veto on 30 bills.

0 The new Governor has indicated that he will be pushing for a statewide $15 an hour minimum wage.
However, his of?ce has recently stated that the Governor will be reaching out to small businesses and local
elected officials to get their input before a bill IS introduced.

0 The new Governor has also stated that a major capital bill for local and statewide infrastructure is one of his
main priorities for this upcoming session.

0 HB 166, which contains the technical changes that were in HE 4811 and which were necessary to
implement last year?s funding law (P.A. 100-23), was passed by both houses and sent to the Governor on
December 12, 2018.

0 HB 5342 has now become Public Act 100-1144. The Governor had vetoed this bill, which allowed a
former ?re?ghter, who is now an Alderman, to transfer his MEABF service credits as an Alderman to the
?re?ghters fund. Both Houses overrode his veto and the bill became law on November 30, 2018.

 INTRODUCTION
The Trustees have adopted an anti-harassment
policy. However, as the list of high-profile sexual
harassment claims continues to grow, the State of
Illinois now requires sexual harassment training for
those registered as lobbyists. Since despite our best
efforts the LABF is required to register as a lobbyist,
we present this training today as a best practice,
although most of you may have already had some
training like this from the City of Chicago.

Taft Stettinius & Hollister LLP

 INTRODUCTION
Today’s Topics
• Employees’ legal right to a harassment free workplace.
• Define “harassment,” examine “sexual harassment,”
and appropriate and inappropriate behavior.
• Review the Board’s obligation to comply with the
LABF’s anti-harassment policy.
