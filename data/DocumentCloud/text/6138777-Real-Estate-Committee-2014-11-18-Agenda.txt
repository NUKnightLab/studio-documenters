PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, in August of 2013, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (“U.S. Army Corps”) issued an
Integrated Feasibility Report and Environmental Assessment for the Upper Des Plaines River and Tributaries of
Illinois and Wisconsin (the “Report”);
WHEREAS, the Report sought to create a comprehensive plan for addressing flooding and stormwater along the
Des Plaines River; and

 WHEREAS, the Report proposed a variety of remediation measures along the Des Plaines river, including the
creation of a reservoir within the Aptakisic Creek watershed, in Lake County, Illinois, near the Village of Buffalo
Grove; and
WHEREAS, in October, 2013, the Village of Buffalo Grove passed a resolution opposing the siting of the reservoir
at Aptakisic Creek; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Army Corps issued a “Documentation of Changes to the Draft Integrated Feasibility Report
and Environmental Assessment” (the “Documentation of Changes”) in response to the Village of Buffalo Grove’s
resolution;
WHEREAS, the Documentation of Changes removed the proposal for a reservoir within the Aptakisic Creek
watershed and proposed the creation of two reservoirs at Fullerton Woods and the Harry Semrow Driving Range
within the Forest Preserve District of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Forest Preserve District of Cook County were never presented
with and have not ruled upon the proposal within the Documentation of Changes;
WHEREAS, the proposed creation of the reservoirs is not supported as a land use under law and is against the
mission and land use policies of the Forest Preserve District of Cook County; and

County Board of Commissioners convene a public hearing to discuss the proposed creation of reservoirs at
Fullerton Woods and the Harry Semrow Driving Range; and

PROPOSED LICENSE REQUEST
Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (“the Preserves”), as Licensor
to grant a License to The Village of Niles, Illinois (“the Village”) to locate, operate and maintain a 72-inch storm
sewer and outfall structure to the North Branch Chicago River. The storm sewer is part of a storm water relief
program that also includes a detention basin and bioinfiltration facility on other village property. The sewer will
capture storm water runoff to relieve flooding and to reduce the combined sewer overflow discharge. The request
also includes licensing the existing combined sewer overflow structure for which no license or agreement is known.
The Village will also construct a new ADA crosswalk on Caldwell Avenue at Cleveland Street with push button
activated flashers, and a new paved trail connection, along the route of the new storm sewer, to the existing North
branch Trail. The crossing will improve accessibility and safety and provide an alternative to the current use of the
FPCC driveway and parking lot to access the trail..
