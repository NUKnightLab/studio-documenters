We regret to inform you that the End Stage Renal Disease Advisory Committee meeting has been
cancelled for October 9, 2018 from 10:30 am. to 12:30 pm. due to the Governor signing House

Disease Advisory Committee (ESRD) has been disbanded effective August 19, 2018. We regret
any inconvenience this cancellation or disbandment may have caused.
