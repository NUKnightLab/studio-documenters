Overview
●
●

Engagement with Divvy and other city programs (e.g. CDOT Bikeways, Bicycling Ambassadors) to discuss bike

organizations to increase Divvy use in
low to moderate-income communities.

COMMUNITY ASSETS
●
●

●
●

Community models “green modes”
Preschools, elementary schools, high
school, 3 colleges within walking and
biking distance of dense residential
areas and Red Line, Metra, Lakefront
Trail, on-street bike routes
Three hospitals + extensive social
service, healthcare, faith networks
Many independent businesses and
four major concert/event venues

 COMMUNITY ASSETS
Wildly successful historic lakefront
Sunnyside Mall & Uplift Plaza
Partial protected lanes on Broadway
Clarendon, Margate, Chase, Buttercup Parks
US Bike Route—Lakefront Trail + Lawrence
CTA Red Line & northernmost 24-hr E/W bus
Cemeteries (really!)

 BIKE NETWORK ISSUES / CHALLENGES—UPTOWN
Lakefront is destination for all Chicago
(neighbors often oﬀ the radar)
Traﬃc volume and “Drive head”
“Accidental arteries” leave little room for
safe cycling and walking
Flooded viaducts, streets, sidewalks
Distrust of government decision-making
due to recent projects risks access to
valuable community info and support.

 MBAC COMMUNITY REGION PRIORITIES
●
●
●
●

●

Coordinate, connect, and protect pedestrian, bike, bus, and train access
Focus on most vulnerable users of public space and give special
attention to wintertime riding and walking conditions
North Lake Shore Drive Study Project designs that respond to concerns
about pedestrian/bike safety and historic coastal park setting
Resolve new conﬂicts and issues from Lakefront Trail Separation
(petition to restore Lakefront Trail bike path to earlier route between
Montrose and Foster, correct Montrose crossing and lost ADA access)
Extend Glenwood Greenway to improve Rogers Park biking safety

 NEXT STEPS
Rolling forward!

● Explore possibility of
connecting North Lake Shore
Drive Study Project with
MBAC members interested in
discussing bike trail design.
● Explore possibility of Park
District response to 200+
petitioners who want to
restore the Lakefront Trail
bike path between Montrose
& Foster to its earlier route.
