III. Action Items
A. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, July 22, 2016
Director Butler, seconded by Director Richardson-Lowry, moved to accept the
minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting of July 22, 2016. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration.
With regard to request number 2, Mr. Elwell stated that CCHHS has an existing contract with this company, formerly
known as Emdeon. Their staff used to take Medicaid applications and used a particular tracking software; now
CCHHS personnel does all that work, but the tracking software continues to be used. While the administration
believes that there is other software out there, a decision was made to stay with the current software for now, because it
has so much history. He noted that, eventually, the administration will evaluate other software to be used for this
purpose and will issue a Request for Proposals.

 III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to request number 4, Mr. Elwell stated that these services are related to ongoing negotiations with
managed care entities. This firm was used for the negotiations with Valence, and their services will be used for two (2)
or three (3) other contracts being completed. Additionally, negotiations will soon be started with the MHN group; for
the first time, MHN will go “at risk,” so this is to provide funding for this firm’s advice. The administration will take a
slightly different technique in utilizing the firm’s services – CCHHS has a very strong legal department, and the
administration believes that a lot of the legal work can be done internally, using the firm on a consultant basis, rather
than as frontline help.
With regard to request number 9, Mr. Elwell stated that this is a sole source contract for software that provides
customized learning modules for CCHHS physicians relating to the Cerner System.
With regard to request number 10, Mr. Elwell stated that this is a sole source contract for robotics at Oak Forest
Central Fill Pharmacy, for the mail order pharmacy business. Automed Technologies, Inc. is the manufacturer of this
equipment and the sole provider of maintenance for this system.
Director Butler, seconded by Director Richardson-Lowry, moved the approval of
request numbers 1 through 14, subject to completion of review by Contract
Compliance, where appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Any items listed under Section III and VI

Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed the report, which included metrics and Financial Statements

Board Chairman Hammock inquired regarding the expenses under the category of Court Reporting, within the
information on Other Purchased Services (Slide 5). Mr. Elwell stated that that category includes services relating
to physician dictation / medical records. Board Chairman Hammock requested that the category be re-labeled and
broken out to provide a better description of those services.

Page 2 of 77

 V.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer (continued)
The Committee discussed the information on Slide 10, regarding Days of Cash on Hand. Mr. Akpan stated that the
information reflects 25 days of cash on hand, which is alarming; he noted that he recently received a large check
from the State that had been delayed – if that check had been booked into the system, the days of cash on hand
would have been closer to 42 or 43 days. He would like to see that number at approximately 60 days. He noted
that, for the later part of the year, there are larger checks that will come in; he is expecting a much better month for
cash in August.

VI. Budget / Strategic Plan (Attachment #3)



Introduction of CCHHS FY2017 Preliminary Budget
Introduction of Three (3) Year Financial Forecast: FY2017-2019

Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, provided introductory comments on the subject. Following are his
verbatim comments.
I would like to set the context for the budget by taking us back to the strategic plan you approved
a couple of weeks ago. It is important for the Board and public to know, that to view the strategic
plan not as a fantasy or pie-in-the-sky, but as something critical to set the foundation and
direction of the organization over the next 3 years. It is the blueprint we are using for FY2017,
as you will see.
It is critically important for everyone to understand that, if we don’t animate and make real this
strategic plan, then we face a real threat. The Health System has a long and proud mission of
serving everyone who walks into our doors, but to protect that mission - certainly, while talking
with leadership at this organization this week, this is the piece that I’ve tried to anchor with
clinical leaders - the most important thing is growing to serve and compete in the modern
environment we find ourselves in.
I think that the Health System deserves a chance to compete. There’s no other system in the State
that provides the amount of uncompensated care that we do, and most think that they’re already
providing their fair share. I think we’ve earned the right and developed the competence to
continue to care for the patients we’ve long cared for who are uninsured, but now many of those
individuals have coverage and choice, and we have to earn their loyalty. As you’ll see, with 63%
of our patients now covered, it is critical for the organization to continue to evolve into a modern,
integrated, patient-centered organization.
The budget that we have prepared and will share with you this morning allows us to continue on
that path, but it also reflects the reality of limited resources. It is important to note that what
you’re going to see presented this morning is a result of not everyone in the organization getting
what they wanted and asked for. But I’m grateful to Mr. Elwell and Mr. Akpan, who led our
executive team and their departmental leaders to do everything they could to squeeze efficiency
into the budget for FY2017. This is a challenging budget - at the same time we’re investing to
grow, we need to assess and budget appropriately for areas where growth is unlikely and where
we may be able to realize dollar savings. If we’re serious about transformation, we will be able
to get there but it is going to take everyone doing his or her part to make sure our patients are
receiving the high-quality care they deserve. And it will take everyone understanding that there's
a three (3) year plan guiding us to our long-term success.

Page 3 of 77

 I’m grateful, particularly to Chair Hammock and to Chair Estrada, for their continued leadership
and guidance. They’ve given us important and meaningful feedback on the budget you’re going
to see today. I’m very grateful to Mr. Akpan, Mr. Elwell and to the entire executive team who met
over the course of the last few months with every department, sometimes multiple times. Those
meetings were frank conversations about the challenges that the organization faces. They were
reality-based, and required oftentimes walking away with a better understanding of what that
department’s priorities were, but also the recognition that we couldn’t do everything for
everyone.
In the end, I believe we’ve crafted a budget that enables the organization to continue the
momentum that we’ve seen for the last few years. It is now up to us to carry through on that. I’ll
stress that in my messaging this week internally to leadership across the organization that focus
on growing to serve and compete really is focused on three major themes: 1) improving access to
the high-quality expert care that our clinical staff provides; 2) improving the patient experience,
and this is going to be critically important for our success going forward, when two-thirds of the
people we serve have choice; and 3) recognizing that today, when we are receiving a significant
amount of the revenue for the organization from care that we provide to individuals who are
insured through other Medicaid managed care plans, we are in many ways an expensive system,
and we’ve got to find ways to get the costs in our System down. I think we’ve got the ability to do
that. I think we’re blessed with a medical staff that thinks carefully about utilization of resources
and diagnostic testing, and choices they make and work-ups that are thoughtful in bringing
evidence-based practices to their care, but I think that we can do better, as we’ve got to be able
to reduce the costs in our System if we want to continue to be attractive to other managed care
organizations.
Dr. Shannon and Mr. Akpan reviewed the presentation provided on the Introduction of the CCHHS FY2017
Preliminary Budget and Three (3) Year Financial Forecast: FY2017-2019, which included information on the

 VI. Budget / Strategic Plan (continued)
During the discussion of Slide 9, Director Junge inquired regarding what is included in the category of CountyCare
External Expenses. Mr. Akpan responded that it includes expenses for other network providers and for everything
external (external pharmacy, Third Party Administrator expenses, etc.).
During the discussion of Slide 12, in response to a question from Board Chairman Hammock regarding potential
ways to increase primary and specialty care visits, Dr. Shannon provided the following examples: initiating
conversations with other plans about whether CCHHS sites might be good places for their plan members; creating
the capacity; and spreading the availability by flattening out clinic schedules and expanding hours. Board
Chairman Hammock inquired regarding whether metrics would be available to report on primary care and specialty
care access on a monthly basis. Dr. Shannon responded in the affirmative.
During the discussion of the information on salaries and benefits on Slide 17, Chairman Estrada stated that
discussions have previously been held regarding the fact that non-union staff do not receive the 4.2% salary
increases and step increases that the union staff receive; he noted that some way to compensate those non-union
staff needs to be figured out. Mr. Akpan agreed. He stated that this creates salary compression at the top for many
of CCHHS’ leaders; those leaders supervise employees whose salaries oftentimes have surpassed the leader, due to
collective bargaining agreement-negotiated increases and step increases. Chairman Estrada inquired whether the
cost to address that inequity has been figured into the budget. Mr. Akpan responded in the negative; discussions
have been held, but no action taken, on ways to address this that would be performance-driven and volume-driven.
Dr. Shannon stated that this has been a significant challenge, because many of these individuals have had static
salaries since 2008; they received a little bit of an improvement last year, but then there was a freeze of an
anticipated increase that was planned for the managers. He would like to come back to this Board at some point to
talk about a self-funding reward plan, where financial targets are hit and quality, safety and patient experience
outcomes realized, and there is an ability to share some of that hard-earned revenue with managers – aside from
that, and that is a long-range strategy that is going to take some time to work out, what the administration continues
to do is to urge the County Commissioners to consider appropriate increases for non-unionized staff. Part of the
challenge related to that is that there is a sense sometimes that the staff at CCHHS is very well-paid - long
conversations could be held about that - but the piece that the administration points out is that the managers are
usually highly experienced, highly educated and highly attractive to other health care organizations because of their
experience. Board Chairman Hammock asked staff to – not as a part of this budget - inform the Committee or
Chair of what pay increases for non-unionized senior staff of 2%, 3% and 4% would each approximately total. Dr.
Shannon responded that this information will be provided.
Addendum to these minutes: Information from the Public Hearings held on the CCHHS FY2017 Preliminary Budget,
held on Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 9:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M. is attached to these minutes for informational
purposes.

managed by the County?s Office of Risk Management, which expired on June 30, 2016. The Office of Risk
Management recently awarded a new contract for County-wide insurance brokerage services with Mesirow
Financial which began July 1, 2016.

Given the RFP process for the County?wide brokerage contract, entered into a stop-loss policy coverage
for six months, from January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, to be coterminous with the County?s brokerage
contract. As this process is now complete, we the existing stop?loss policy to

3.

Supportive of CCHHS, happy that dental services were recently implemented at Prieto Clinic
Supportive of staffing changes planned for ACHN
Concern – some staff at Prieto Clinic who are not bilingual, do not speak Spanish. 85% of the clinic
patients are Spanish-speaking, Spanish-speaking LPNs were replaced with LPNs who don’t speak Spanish

Kathi Franklin

•

President, Access to Care Program

Written testimony attached
In support of continued funding by CCHHS of the Access to Care Program
Main reason why Access to Care members are not eligible for CountyCare – usually because they’re over
the income threshold

Margaret Stapleton
•

Member, Prieto Community Board

Representative, Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law

In support of several CCHHS initiatives, including
o Community Triage Center;
o Behavioral Health Consortium

Jennifer Casey

•
•

Representative, Proviso Leyden Council for Community Action, Inc.

Representative, South Suburban Council on Alcoholism

In support of CountyCare Plan
She assists her clients in understanding and accessing their benefits under the CountyCare Plan by
accessing information on the CountyCare website. She suggested that education be provided for members
on what the Plan includes and how to navigate it to access information and services
Some issues have been experienced with transportation – she has been having problems getting clients
picked up. Additionally, some of her clients are homeless, which poses a problem under the existing
mechanism for transportation (may need some tweaking).

Following the comments made by Ms. Casey, Director Richardson-Lowry suggested that an education session be
provided for the hundreds of CountyCare partners, to further educate them on the CountyCare Plan.

lam Kathi Franklin, President of Access to Care. Thank you for the opportunity to speak here today and
thank you for your support of the Access to Care program.

Access to Care is a non?profit primary health care program for low income, uninsured and under insured
residents of suburban Cook County and northwest Chicago. We are a community based program with
over 600 physicians who volunteer their time to serve Access to Care members. Because of this, we are
able to assign members of Access to Care to a primary care physician in their own community. They
may have an unlimited number of office visits to their Access to Care doctor for a $5 co-pay. They are
also able to get an unlimited number of routine lab tests and x-rays for a $5 co-pay and prescription
medications for $15-$40 co-pays.

Access to Care is very cost efficient. We are able to provide an unlimited number of physician office
visits, lab tests, x-rays and prescription drugs for $786 a year per person. We use existing infrastructure
and a network of donated discounted services to maximize Cook County donations. Last year, Access to
Care had donated services and discounts amounting to nearly $5,000,000.

ATC is very community based. We have relationships with community wide social service agencies,
townships and municipalities, chambers of commerce, associations, faith based organizations and
service oriented clubs. Through the first three quarters of 2016 we have attended nearly 250 events or
meetings.

Access to Care clients are not eligible for CountyCare. About half of the Access to Care members are
immigrants who are not eligible for County Care either because they have not been in the country
legally long enough or they are undocumented. Of the other half, many tend to be in some kind of life
transition. They may have experienced job loss, a recent divorce, or a death or illness in the family that
has caused a loss of income. During these difficult times, their focus is on keeping a roof over their
heads and food on the table. Many times, we have heard a client say that they had to choose between
medicine and food or medicine and rent. This is a choice that no person should have to make and with
Access to Care they do not.

Access to Care members are adults who generally wait until they need to see a doctor to look for
resources. When clients come to us it is usually because they are sick and usually chronically ill. The
most frequent diagnoses are exactly what you would expect them to be; diabetes and hypertension.
ATC keeps them out of the emergency room. Through Access to Care they are able to manage their
illness so that they can continue to work and take care of their families.

Thank you for your support and commitment to Access to Care and thank you for the opportunity to
speak here today.

TESTIMONY TO THE COOK COUNTY HEALTH HOSPITAL SYSTEMS BOARD
August 24, 2016

My name is Mark Matusik and i am the Board Chair for the Access to Care program and Sr. Director of Health
Outcomes for Walgreens. First, I want to thank you for supporting and funding Access to Care in the past and
to urge you to continue that support.

Access to Care has been serving the uninsured and under-insured working poor for 28 years. Access to Care
provides a medical home to uninsured or under-insured patients in which they can see their Access to Care
doctor an unlimited number of times per year for a $5 co?payment. They may also receive unlimited lab tests,
x-rays and prescriptions drugs through Access to Care.

it is a very efficient program because it relies on existing infrastructure, which includes donated and heavily
discounted services. Last year, Access to Care received nearly $5,000,000 in donated services. Access to Care
has always been an efficient, cost?effective public-private partnership allowing County dollars to go further
because they are used by a non?profit organization to get donated and discounted services from the private
system.

The implementation of the Affordable Care Act has helped a great many people get coverage who had not
previously had it. However, 9% of Cook County residents remain uninsured and many more people now have
insurance but with a deductible that is unaffordable and a barrier to accessing vital healthcare. Access to Care
is here to help these people who remain in need.

I would like to briefly share the story of one Access to Care member who dramatically illustrates the benefits
of the work we do. At a recent Access to Care event, a Latina woman who appeared to be approximately 60
years old approached Access to Care?s outreach staff. When the outreach worker asked her if she was familiar
with the program, she smiled warmly and said that she was not only familiar with Access to Care, but was very
grateful and indebted to us. Prior to joining Access to Care she had not seen a doctor regularly for 27 years.
She pointed out that she had severe untreated diabetes that resulted in the loss of her foot 5 years earlier as
well as a couple of fingers. The diabetes had begun to affect her eyesight as well. In the two years that she
has been an Access to Care member, her health has improved dramatically. She is getting the care and
attention she needs and feels that Access to Care has saved her life. Her husband, who has anxiety, is also a
member of Access to Care and has been going for regular doctor visits thereby improving his health issues.
She thanked us and told us that Access to Care has been a blessing for her family.

Not all Access to Care clients have a medical history quite this severe, but the majority do have chronic
illnesses with diabetes and hypertension being among the most common. Access to Care helps these people
manage their illness before it progresses into more dire health outcomes. if this woman had joined Access to
Care years ago, perhaps she would not have lost her foot and fingers. The need for Access to Care is great,
thousands of people remain uninsured!

The Access to Care leadership is also working to find alternative funding sources and have met with several
large hospital systems in Suburban Cook County and have hired a Development person to assist in furthering
our fund-raising strategies.

Thank you for listening and for your consideration of this plea.

Comments on Proposed FY17 Budget

My name is Dan Boris, Research Director of SEIU Local 73, a union of over 28,000 members in
and Northwest Indiana, with over 1500 members at Cook County Health and Hospitals

System.

SEIU Local 73 members work hard every day, night, weekends, and holidays, to provide
quality health services to the residents of Cook County. We know we can provide quality
services when given the right direction and support.

We are optimistic about the county?s plans to in-source the management of inpatient
transportation and environmental services. The same should also be done for food
services. Sodexo has not performed a good job, and we support the immediate
cancelation of its contract with 

The continued use of outsourced management, temporary workers, and sub?contractors
is inefficient, has led to low morale, and has been a drag on efforts of the County
hospital system to improve the patient experience.

We expect that in its final budget, will make the right decisions not only in
environmental services and transportation, but also in staffing professional, technical
and technologist positions. Not only should cancel its contract with Sodexo, but
the health system also investigate the comparative effectiveness of providing health
services using temp agencies like Smith Thomas Williams, LLC, Maxim Health Services,
Allied Health Professionals, The Nurse Agency, Nursefinders, LMR Nursing Services,
Advanced Care Services, and Community Health Solutions, instead of using qualified
dedicated Cook County staff.

The following statistics highlight why bringing work back in-house is the smart thing to do for
both patients and taxpayers:

There are over 56 budgeted vacant positions, funded at more than $2.4 million dollars,
where has spent $700,000 in overtime in the same departments and job titles so
far this year.

Twenty five patient care attendant positions, which were fully funded in the FY16
budget, have been left vacant all year.

In the first quarter of 2016, spent over $6 million dollars on high priced
temporary staffing agencies, where the fully loaded hourly rate of in-house staff often
costs less.

Temp agency workers do not contribute to the Cook County Pension.

Temporary staff often have higher turnover than Cook County employees, in fast-paced
team-based care teams where communication and coordination are critical.

In conclusion, and as stated earlier, we are optimistic by the trajectory that management
is taking to bring work back in-house to improve the quality of the patient experience and
provide cost-effective health services to the residents of Cook county, without regard to ability

to pay.

But more work must be done. The members of SEIU Local 73 continue to look forward to
continuing to engage with Cook County to do just that.
