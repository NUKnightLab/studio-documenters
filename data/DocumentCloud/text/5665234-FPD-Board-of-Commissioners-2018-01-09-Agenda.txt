Summary: The Preserves is bidding out a contract for row crop production at select sites which were
historically used for agricultural purposes prior to acquisition by the Preserves, and as such, do not exist in
an ecologically natural state. Farmers will have use of the property for seeding one or more of the
following row crops: wheat, oats, soybeans, and/or corn. This practice allows the Preserves to generate
revenue, while at the same time preventing invasive plant species from taking over fallow land. It is the
Preserve’s intention to restore fallow land wherever possible and these farming practices are a good
method to keep these lands in a more manageable condition until a restoration project can take place on
the site. The contract term for row crop farming is a period of one (1) year, with four (4) one-year
renewal options to be exercised by the General Superintendent or his/her designee, which gives the
Preserves the option to discontinue farming practices in order to restore these lands to a natural condition.
