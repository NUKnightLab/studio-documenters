Nicolette N. Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer
2018 Refunding and New Money Transaction Results

Background: On Monday, September 17, 2018, the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA)
successfully refinanced $178.8 million of water system bonds and $207.7 million of sewer
system bonds. This resulted in water system gross cashflow savings of $30.9 million ($24.9
million of present value savings, or 13.9%) and sewer system gross cashflow savings of
$54.0 million ($34.5 million of present value savings, or 16.6%) over the remaining life of
the bonds. In addition, GLWA issued $81.6 million of new money sewer bonds for the Local
System, achieving a very favorable long-term average interest cost of 4.03% for 30-year
debt and meeting the project funding target of $91 million.
Analysis: By all measures this was a very successful transaction. The financing team has
prepared a synopsis of the transaction (attached) which will be reviewed at the Audit
Committee.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

 Springing Amendment to GLWA Master Bond Ordinances
In conjunction with the refunding transactions, GLWA continues to implement a “springing amendment” in both the Water and
Sewer bond ordinances related to the Debt Service Reserve Fund (“DSRF”) requirement.
 Springing amendment would allow GLWA the option to reduce the reserve requirement when:
− Senior lien rating is in AA category or higher by two rating agencies
− Confirmation that the reduction in the DSRF will not result in a downgrade
− 51% of the outstanding bondholders have consented to the provision


GLWA has funded the DSRFs for both water and sewer system bonds (senior and second lien) with a combination of bond
proceeds and surety bonds by a qualified credit provider



Cost of maintaining bond proceeds in the DSRF is high
−

Interest rates on debt are higher than GLWA can invest the DSRF money



Existing sureties are scheduled to begin expiring in 2022, which may require GLWA to put in more cash to the DSRF or fund
new surety policies, both at potentially higher costs



The springing amendments could significantly reduce the cost to GLWA when it obtains AA category ratings

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

Nicolette N. Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer

Impact of 2018 Bond Transaction Results on Feasibility Forecast

Background: On Monday, September 17, 2018, the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA)
successfully refinanced $178.8 million of water system bonds and $207.7 million of sewer
system bonds. This resulted in water system gross cashflow savings of $30.9 million ($24.9
million of present value savings, or 13.9%) and sewer system gross cashflow savings of
$54.0 million ($34.5 million of present value savings, or 16.6%) over the remaining life of
the bonds. In addition, GLWA issued $81.6 million of new money sewer bonds for the Local
System, achieving a very favorable long-term average interest cost of 4.03% for 30-year
debt and meeting the project funding target of $91 million.

Analysis: With the results of the transaction now known, the feasibility forecast for the
final official statements will be updated based upon the savings realized. The Foster Group,
feasibility consultant for the transaction, has provided the attached analysis to explain the
impact on the forecast and to present a summary of key updates that will be reflected in the
final official statements.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

MEMORANDUM
Series 2018 GLWA Revenue Bonds
Preliminary Results Summary
To:

September 18, 2018

Nicolette Bateson

From: Bart Foster
The attached exhibits are designed to is provide a high-level summary of the results from
yesterday’s pricing the above captioned GLWA bond sale(s). By way of background, the
Preliminary Official Statements for the bond sales contained five-year financial forecasts that
we developed as part of our responsibilities as Feasibility Consultant for the transactions.
Those forecasts produced projected financial plans that embraced the Authority’s strategic
objective to improve the financial position of the Water and Sewer utilities. Specifically, the
financial plans were designed to reduce the traditional heavy reliance on debt to finance capital
improvements by employing more “pay go” strategy via utilization of the Improvement and
Extension (“I&E”) Funds of the utilities.
The original financial forecasts set forth in the Preliminary Official Statements were
accompanied by supporting materials, including the “Preliminary Feasibility Report
Introduction” memorandum we submitted on August 20, 2018. As noted in all of that material,
the preliminary forecasts did not reflect any potential debt service savings associated with the
refinancing portion of the Series 2018 Bonds. It did, however, include the estimated impact on
debt service of the new money portion of the Series 2018 Sewer Bonds (to finance Local
DWSD Sewer System capital improvements), and of future projected bond sales during the
five-year forecast period to finance Regional System capital improvements for both the Water
and Sewer Systems.
The principal objective of this discussion is to illustrate the impact on the financial forecasts
of the refinancing savings achieved by the pricing of the Series 2018 Bonds. The updated
forecasts reflect the pricing results, and will be set forth in the Final Official Statements. As of
this writing it is our understanding that the Final Official Statements will be posted on
September 20.

 Series 2018 GLWA Revenue Bonds
Preliminary Results Summary

September 18, 2018
Page 2

Water Bond Sale Highlights:
• The Series 2018 Water Bonds are entirely refunding bonds issued for purposes of
achieving debt service savings. No “new money” proceeds were generated.
• The Series 2018 Water Bonds refinanced certain existing outstanding bonds maturing
from 2019 through 2029.
• The total debt service savings achieved was almost $31 million, which equates to
almost $25 million on a net present value basis.
• The refinancing generates approximately $2.8 million of annual debt service savings
for FYs 2019 through 2029, and approximately $14 million in total for the five-year
forecast period.
• Our original five-year forecast anticipated:
o Issuance of approximately $11 million of additional revenue bonds to finance
Regional Water System capital improvements;
o Increasing “all in” Water debt service coverage ratios from 1.41 to 1.51 during
the forecast period.
• Our updated five-year forecast:
o Maintains the original “top line” revenue projections;
o Redirects the debt service savings towards deposits to the I&E Fund;
o Eliminates the need to project ANY additional bond sales for Regional Water
System capital improvements during the five-year forecast period;
o Results in “all in” Water debt service coverage ratios that are approximately
2 points higher than the preliminary forecast.
Sewer Bond Sale Highlights:
• The Series 2018 Sewer Bonds contain both new money and refunding elements.
• The new money debt service is not materially different than envisioned in the
preliminary forecast.
• The Series 2018 Sewer Bonds refinanced certain existing outstanding bonds maturing
from 2019 through 2029.
• The total debt service savings achieved was over $54 million, which equates to almost
$35 million on a net present value basis.
• The refinancing generates approximately $4.9 million of annual debt service savings
for FYs 2019 through 2029, and almost $25 million in total for the five-year forecast
period.
• Our original five-year forecast anticipated:
o Issuance of approximately $257 million of additional revenue bonds to finance
Regional Sewer System capital improvements;

o Increasing “all in” Sewer debt service coverage ratios from 1.23 to 1.40 during
the forecast period.
Our updated five-year forecast:
o Maintains the original “top line” revenue projections;
o Redirects the debt service savings towards deposits to the I&E Fund;
o Reduces the projected additional bond sales for Regional Sewer System capital
improvements during the five-year forecast period by almost $40 million, to a
total of approximately $217 million;
o Results in “all in” debt service coverage ratios that are approximately 4 points
higher than the preliminary forecast by the end of the forecast period.

The accompanying exhibits are designed to illustrate the executive summary observations
above. We are prepared to further discuss this matter at your convenience.

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager
Re:

Proposed Change Order No. 2
Contract No. GLWA-CS-010 Water Residential Assistance Program (WRAP)

Background: The Water Residential Assistance Program (“WRAP”) provides sustainable
funding for qualifying low-income residents served by the Great Lakes Water Authority’s
(“GLWA”) customers. The program is funded by GLWA at an amount equal to 0.5 percent
of budgeted revenues with the FY 2016 funding level of $4.5 million combined for water
and sewer services, $4.7 million in FY 2017, $4.9 million for FY 2018 and $4.9 million for
FY 2019.

The scope of funding includes a) payment assistance and b) water audit and water
conservation measures. Eligible residential customers with a past due bill and/or who are
in active shut off can receive assistance with paying down arrears and receive $25 toward
monthly bill payment assistance ($300 annually) and up to $700 for arrearage assistance
annually. High volume water users can receive a one-time home audit and home water
conservation services up to $1,000. Maximum annual assistance per household is $2,000.
To participate in WRAP, an applicant must have household gross incomes at or below
150% of the federal poverty income thresholds. Customers with water usage at or above
120% of the average residential usage are eligible to participate in a water audit and install
water conservation measures. WRAP participants are also encouraged to participate in
both financial coaching and water conservation workshops as well as other support
services.

The program is administered by Wayne Metro Community Action Agency (Wayne Metro), a
nonprofit agency. The WRAP began providing assistance to customers of GLWA on March 1,
2016 and has the potential to serve over 100 communities within the GLWA service area.
In order to assist qualified households each community must opt into the program and sign
a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Wayne Metro. To date, 75 communities have
opted into WRAP.

Page 26

 Justification: The WRAP is funded each fiscal year, based on 0.50% of budgeted revenues
for that fiscal year. The contract with Wayne Metro (GLWA CS-010) specifies the not to
exceed administrative fee amount based on the anticipated allocation of assistance dollars
to each county. This change order extends the GLWA CS-010 through June 30, 2020 and it
increases the contract amount based on the total budgeted WRAP funding amounts from

 Investment Performance Report – June 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Executive Summary

PORTFOLIO RECAP
¾ Safety – The overall portfolio is diversified amongst cash, bank deposits, U.S. Treasuries, Federal Agencies, commercial paper, SEC-registered
money market funds, and a local government investment pool. The total credit profile of the pool is strong with over 98% of the assets invested in
bank deposits or securities that are rated within the two highest short and long-term rating classifications as established by S&P.
¾ Liquidity – The portfolio’s liquidity has increased compared to last quarter with approximately 66% of the total assets maturing overnight.
¾ Return – The overall yield increased to 1.84% as of June 30, 2018 versus 1.72% at March 31, 2018. The Authority earned $13,207,619 in
investment income for fiscal year 2018 on a book value basis. Based on the current interest rate environment, the investment income earned for the
previous quarter, and assuming that the Authority maintains the same investable balances for the next fiscal year, we are projecting that the Authority
will earn approximately $17.1 million in investment income for fiscal year 2019.
¾ Compliance – The aggregate portfolio is in compliance with the Authority’s investment policy and Michigan Public Act 20.

The accounts at Comerica Bank get an earnings credit to offset bank fees. The funds and earnings in the Retainage account are held on behalf of the contractors and do not belong to GLWA. The
funds and earnings in the Flint Security Deposit account are held on behalf of the City of Flint and do not belong to GLWA. Note that market values move inversely to interest rates, and the recent
rise in yields has led to the overall market value being less than the book value. In addition to the totals listed above, there also exists surety bonds in the amount of $331,914,579 as of 6/30/2018.

Great Lakes Water Authority
Investment Strategy

GLWA INVESTMENT STRATEGY
¾ The portfolio is in compliance with the Authority’s investment policy
¾ To date, the Authority has continued to invest its funds in assets concentrated in a mixture of short and intermediate-term
investments to ensure sufficient liquidity; there was a slight increase in funds maturing overnight at the end of June to cover
debt service, debt reserve, and pension obligation payments and requirements
¾ The aggregate portfolio was yielding 1.84% at the end of June*
– This compares to the 1.80% yield of the Bank of America / Merrill Lynch 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as of
6/30/2018, which is a comparable market indicator
¾ The Authority continues to implement a disciplined investment plan to provide improved safety and diversification and putting
every dollar to work
¾ For the first quarter of FY 2019, the investment strategy steps to be taken includes seeking opportunities to invest intermediate
and longer-term funds based on refined cash flows (specifically for the Water and Sewer Emergency Repair & Replacement
Funds, the Water and Sewer Improvement & Extension Funds, and the Water and Sewer Budget Stabilization Funds)
¾ The Authority will continue to work with its investment advisor to identify strategies to maximize future investment income while
meeting the objectives of safety and liquidity
¾ Assuming that the Authority maintains the same investable balances for FY 2019 and the interest rate environment remains in a
similar range, we conservatively expect to earn approximately $17.1 million in interest income in FY 2019
* Current market yield as of June 30, 2018.

 Investment Performance Report – June 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Market Overview and Outlook

ECONOMIC HIGHLIGHTS UPDATE
¾ Federal tax cuts and expanded federal spending accelerated the pace of growth in the second quarter.
¾ Labor market conditions remained positive as the economy added 213,000 jobs in June; the average for the second
quarter was 211,000, which is above the level that is normally required to absorb new entrants into the job market.
¾ This strength led the Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) to tighten monetary policy again at its June meeting
by increasing the overnight Federal Funds target rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a new range of 1.75% to
2.00%, even as most FOMC members warned of the potential increased risks posed by new trade policy.
ECONOMIC IMPACT ON PORTFOLIO
¾ Given the strength of the U.S. economy, we expect the Fed to hike rates at least once more this year; new tariffs on
imported goods could put further pressures on U.S. prices in the short run, thus supporting the Fed’s action of moving
rates higher, and that would be beneficial to the Authority’s portfolio.
¾ Our view in the near term is that the commercial paper sector offers value to the Authority’s portfolio as economic and
earnings growth balance the increase in corporate debt levels.
¾ By contrast, Federal Agency yields remain very close to matched-maturity Treasuries, for the most part, and offer little
opportunity for the Authority’s accounts.
¾ The Fed rate hike in coming months has boosted money market rates well into the 2.00% range and, as bank deposit
rates have lagged, short-term Treasuries and commercial paper are quite attractive for the Authority’s liquid funds.

Portfolio Mix
Cash / Money Market vs. Investments
¾ The Authority's liquidity requirements fluctuate each month based on operational requirements, capital funding, and debt payments. Based on a
review of historical activity and refinement of cash flow projections, the Authority has set an average target of 45% cash/money market accounts
and 55% investments for the portfolio holdings.
¾ The chart below compares the monthly allocation of the portfolio holdings to the 13-month average and the target. The increase in the cash/money
market holdings for June of 2018 is related to the fiscal year end debt and pension requirements.

The accounts at Comerica Bank get an earnings credit to offset bank fees. The earnings in the accounts at First Independence Bank is credited to the contractors and not the Authority. The funds in
the Flint Security Deposit account are held on behalf of the City of Flint and the earnings do not belong to GLWA. The Bank of America / Merrill Lynch 3-Month Treasury Bill is an unmanaged index
tracking the on-the-run Treasury Bill. The index is produced and maintained by Bank of America / Merrill Lynch & Co. YTM @ Cost is the expected return, based on the original cost, the annual
interest receipts, maturity value and the time period from purchase date to maturity, stated as a percentage, on an annualized basis. YTM @ Market is the rate of return, based on the current market
value, the annual interest receipts, maturity value and time period remaining until maturity, stated as a percentage, on an annualized basis.

 Investment Performance Report – June 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Demonstration of Yield to Maturity vs. Duration
As of June 30, 2018
¾ The comparison agencies included in the list below were selected based on type and/or other non-performance based criteria to show a broad
range of water entities/utilities. This peer group list does not represent an endorsement of any of the public agencies or their services. The types of
funds (e.g., bond proceeds, debt service, etc.) and duration of the overall portfolios listed below as well as the various differences in permitted
investments and allowable credit capacity in state statutes (i.e., the ability or non-ability to invest in long-term corporate credit) will have a direct
impact on the corresponding yields at market.
¾ The overall yield of the Authority’s aggregate portfolio compares favorably to those of other short-term indices (i.e., the S&P LGIP index and the 3month U.S. Treasury index).
¾ The Authority does not have a potential for a longer duration portfolio when compared to other similar water entities/utilities as the Authority’s
covenants limits and restricts its ability in managing assets to a longer-term strategy.

* The Authority generally does not realize losses on its investments. However, on March 9, 2018, PFM purchased a 6-month commercial paper investment,
thinking that the amount could be fully invested to the October 1st payment date. Upon reviewing the Sewage SRF Debt Service account with the Authority in
mid-March, it was determined that the amount necessary for the April 1st payment was different from what PFM had previously calculated. Therefore, a
portion of the commercial paper investment was sold to ensure that the required liquid funds were available on the April 1st payment date.
These figures are based upon actual interest earned and posted to the Authority’s various accounts via book value and does not include any earnings credit rate tied to the Authority’s bank deposits.

FOMC Statement Highlights

June

13

• Information received since the FOMC met in May indicates that the labor market has
continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate.
Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has
declined. Recent data suggest that growth of household spending has picked up,
and business fixed investment has continued to grow strongly.
• In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee
decided to raise the target range for the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points
(0.25%) to 1.75% – 2.00%.
• The Committee noted that further gradual increases in the target range for the
Federal Funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of labor market
conditions and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2.0% objective over the
medium term.

 Investment Performance Report – June 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Market Overview and Outlook

FIXED INCOME MARKET – ECONOMIC HIGHLIGHTS
¾ Despite the myriad of global headwinds to economic growth, including global trade wars and geopolitical uncertainty, the
strength and resolve of domestic economic themes continued to rule the day:
– U.S. GDP grew at 2.0% in the first quarter of 2018 with year-over-year growth up to 2.8%
– Inflation trended higher, as the personal consumption expenditures (“PCE”) core price index grew at 2.0% year-overyear for the first time since 2012
– The labor market saw continued strength as the U.S. unemployment rate reached a multi-decade low of 3.8%
(before bouncing back to 4.0% in June), job growth remained robust, and wages trended modestly higher
– The S&P 500 index grinded out a 3.4% return for the quarter
– The Fed increased short-term rates by an additional 0.25% in June and is expected to continue to pursue additional
gradual rate hikes over the near term
¾ U.S. Treasury yields increased during the quarter, but the impact varied widely by maturity:
– Yields on maturities 3 years and under rose by about 20 – 25 basis points (0.20% – 0.25%), the result of the widely
anticipated Fed rate hike in June
– Yields on longer-term maturities rose by much less: the 10-year Treasury rose by 12 basis points while the 30-year
Treasury bond rose just 2 basis points (0.02%), the result of modest inflation expectations, moderating growth
prospects, and persistently low global interest rates
– As a consequence, the yield curve flattened to a new post-recession low
¾ In what we viewed as a well-choreographed interest rate environment, we continued to strategically position portfolios with a
modestly-defensive duration bias relative to benchmarks. However, with rates near multi-year highs, there were also
opportunities to selectively capture higher yields in some parts of the yield curve when rebalancing portfolios or participating
in new issues

 Investment Performance Report – June 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Market Overview and Outlook

FIXED INCOME MARKET – ECONOMIC HIGHLIGHTS
¾ Most investment-grade sectors contributed positive excess returns (returns in excess of similar-duration Treasuries) to fixed
income portfolios for the quarter.
– Federal Agency yield spreads remained very narrow throughout the quarter. Limited incremental yield in
combination with light issuance and diminishing supply influenced our continued preference to reduce allocations to
Agencies. Generally, the Agency sector generated returns similar to Treasuries in the second quarter of 2018,
except for longer-maturity issues where wider yield spreads resulted in underperformance.
– Short-term, high-quality commercial paper investments continued to offer considerable value relative to not only
similar-maturity government securities but also somewhat longer Treasury maturities. The combination of
incremental income and the interest rate risk protection offered by this sector’s shorter duration continued to benefit
investment portfolios
¾ In light of continued economic growth, inflation near the Fed’s symmetric target of 2.0%, and strong labor market conditions,
the Fed appears poised to raise rates further. As a result of the expectation for 1 or 2 additional hikes in 2018 and 3 to 4
more in 2019, our view remains that the general trend of interest rates will be to increase gradually over the near-term.
Therefore, we plan to maintain a defensive duration posture to mitigate a portion of interest rate risk relative to benchmarks.
¾ The outlook for some of the major investment-grade fixed-income sectors are as follows:
– Federal Agency securities remain expensive, as most maturities offer less than five basis points of incremental yield
relative to U.S. Treasuries. We will continue to reduce exposure to Agencies in maturities where spreads are tight,
seeking better value in either Treasuries or other sectors. Over the past quarter, however, the 2 – 3 year portions of
the Agency curve experienced modest widening that may create some opportunities in the third quarter of 2018.
– Short-term money market investors continue to reap the rewards of current monetary policy tightening and higher
overnight target rates. Further, the yield curve for high-quality commercial paper is quite steep and attractive,
offering opportunities to extend maturities and to add allocations in this space.

Trust Receipt & Disbursement Report for Preliminary Activity as of July 31, 2018

Background: The trusts established pursuant to the Master Bond Ordinance (MBO)
outline a flow of funds that governs the priority of the application of cash receipts from
both the regional wholesale (i.e. Great Lakes Water Authority or GLWA) and local retail (i.e.
Detroit Water & Sewerage Department) activities which are further separated by the water
system and the sewage disposal system. 1
This report provides an ongoing status of the net cash flow of both organizations (GLWA
and DWSD) to fund their allocated share of Master Bond Ordinance requirements in
accordance with the leases for the regional systems. This report begins with the
operational effective date of the GLWA on January 1, 2016.

Analysis: The attached tables summarize activity along three lines: Local System Activity,
Regional System Activity, and Combined Activity accompanied by a series of charts that
further breakdown this activity by fund, inflows, and outflows. Activity is reported as
preliminary until the June 30, 2018 fiscal year is closed.

Water collections for both the local and regional systems remain steady through June and
July. Although net July activity for Water reports a slightly negative change, this appears to
be a temporary status due to the timing of payments made. The regional Sewer system
also reports a negative change this period due to payment timing where there are very few
customers and the timing of payments made generates noticeable swings in net activity.
Regional Sewer is best reviewed over longer timeframes. Local Sewer activity remains
negative but reflects improved collections over the two prior periods. The annual County
tax settlement payment will also help improve net activity for the Local Sewer system this
first quarter.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

The Master Bond Ordinance is online at http://www.glwater.org/board/organizational-documents/ (see
“compiled” documents dated August 10, 2016. A graphic depiction of the MBO Flow of Funds is at
http://www.glwater.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Master-Bond-Ordinance-Flow-of-Funds-Graphic-version1010-16.pdf).

snapshot to inform decision makers and stakeholders.  This is important as we and approach the implementation of the FY 2019–2023 Capital 
Improvement Plan (CIP). 
During the development of the FY 2019‐2023 CIP plan, the FY 2018 CIP was reforecast to align with anticipated spend.  The FY 2018 realignment 
has been reflected in this report. 

Report Contents and Organization 
This report is divided into two sections:  one for the Water System and one for the Wastewater System as identified in the table of 
contents.  Each section includes analysis and reporting of the following: 
Percent of Spend Compared to Budget and Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) Requests:  Presentation of spend information is 
necessary to report our progress on CIP projects. 
Analysis of Projects with Largest Percent of Spend and Otherwise Noteworthy Projects:  A combination of commentary and 
analysis provides further insight into risk factors and project status.  An excerpt from the CIP for each of the selected projects 
follows the commentary as further background information. 
Construction Work‐in‐Progress Rollforward:  This table provides a list of all projects in the CIP along with status or financial 
activity.  This table may be used to revisit priorities, workload, and phasing. 
Budget Amendments / Allowance & Program Analysis:  This information identifies the specific usage and the reallocation of 
allowance and program budgets to CIP projects

Financial Information 
All project amounts are unaudited and are “pre‐close”.  This means that direct contractor costs are generally included in these totals with most 
pay estimates entered through June 30, 2018.  There may, however, be some pay estimates that lag.  The totals do not include indirect 
overhead.   

Budget vs. Plan 
Generally, GLWA’s CIP projects span two or more fiscal years.  The GLWA Board of Directors adopts a biennial “budget” and a five‐year capital 
improvement “plan”.   
 The adopted budget relates to operations and maintenance expense, annual fixed commitments such as debt service, and incremental
adjustments to reserves. The budget provides authority to spend within defined amounts.  The budget is also referred to as the
“revenue requirement” for the utility.
 The CIP “budget” for the same biennial budget period above is based on the first two years of the CIP.  Funding for these projects are
established in the financial plan through a combination of bond proceeds and Improvement & Extension fund reserves
 The five‐year capital improvement plan is a rolling plan that is updated at an administrative tracking level as projects move from
estimated to actual bid numbers.  An updated mid‐cycle CIP would be presented to the Board for approval if the prioritization strategy
was revised and/or the plan was in need of material revisions.

Future Enhancements 
This report presents information that is readily available.  Currently under development are enhancements that will provide the opportunity for 
improved CWIP reporting. 
Monthly Capital Spend Projections – Implementation of an integrated master schedule of projects utilizing Primavera P6 is underway.  
The integrated master schedule, which is intended to be updated monthly, will provide a monthly snapshot of cost and schedule 
information related to the execution of projects as compared to our plan.  In addition to an increased visibility to project status and 
spend, this joint effort with our engineering partners will also allow for improved accuracy of our Key Performance Indicator on rate of 
spending and more reliable communication with Treasury regarding monthly capital spend projections to allow for investment 
optimization. 
 
Direct Labor Capitalization – Technology solutions have been procured to improve direct labor capture accuracy, timeliness and ease in 
which labor costs are captured.  This solution named BigTime, was successfully launched on the previously anticipated date of July 1, 
2018. 
 
Indirect Labor Capitalization – An effort to identify and capture indirect labor related to the capital process remains underway.

WATER SYSTEM 
Percent of Spend Compared to Annual Budget and Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) Requests 
The rate of spend of is a key performance indicator.  The development of the FY 2019‐2023 CIP included a realignment of projected spend for 
FY 2018 and forward to accurately forecast planned spend. The Water system spend is 92.4% of the FY 2018 realigned budget.  While the ratios 
for FY 2017 of 37.9% and for FY 2018 of 33.6% are lower than a simple benchmark of 80% the FY 2019 CIP Net Budget is funded at 100% and 
anticipated to achieve spending in full.  Numerous project designs have already and/or will soon complete that will allow for increased 
construction spend to occur in FY 2019.  The effort associated with the development of new spend projections and ongoing effort of monitoring 
spend are anticipated to result in 100% spend in FY19.

Project Description:  The Water Works Park Chlorine System has experienced numerous issues with leaks and unreliable service.  The project 
was initiated to replace the entire system with chlorine equipment that had been demonstrated effective at the other four water treatment 
plants. 
 
Purpose:  Replace the existing system that poses risks to human health and the environment.  The leaks of highly hazardous chlorine gas pose 
unacceptable risks to GLWA staff and potentially the public. 
 
Status:  Project is proceeding ahead of schedule.

Allowances are established to provide funding related to unanticipated pipeline and equipment failures that require immediate repair and 
rehabilitation to continuously meet level of service requirements.  Allowances can also be allocated to projects with anticipated or actual spend 
in excess of CIP budget. 
Programs are established to provide funding related to specific capital improvements that are system specific, reoccurring, and vary from year 
to year. 
Below are the allowances and programs within the Water System.

Budget Amendment Reporting 
 
Scope:  Budget amendments seek to properly allocate funds from the allowance and programs within the Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) for 
the budgeted years by the reallocation of funds from the budgeted allowance or programs level to the actual project level. 
 
Process:  Steps are listed below. 
 
1) Properly identify projects that utilize funds from the allowance or programs 
2) Reallocate the funds from the budgeted allowance or programs level through a journal entry 
3) Attach documents that support the reallocation (CIP funding request, contract transmittal, or change orders) 
4) Create, review, and approve budget amendment journal entry

WASTEWATER SYSTEM 
Percent of Spend Compared to Annual Budget and Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) Requests 
The rate of spend of is a key performance indicator.  The development of the FY 2019‐2023 CIP included a realignment of projected spend for 
FY 2018 and forward to accurately forecast planned spend. The Water system spend is 98.5% of the FY 2018 realigned budget.  While the ratios 
for FY 2017 of 55% and for FY 2018 of 38.1% are lower than a simple benchmark of 80% the FY 2019 CIP Net Budget is funded at 100% and 
anticipated to achieve spending in full.  Numerous project designs have already and/or will soon complete that will allow for increased 
construction spend to occur in FY 2019.  The effort associated with the development of new spend projections and ongoing effort of monitoring 
spend are anticipated to result in 100% spend in FY19.

Re:

Monthly Revenue & Collections Report for August 2018

The Monthly Revenue & Collections Report includes the following.

2.
3.
4.

FY 2018 Retail and Wholesale Sewer Revenue
FY 2018 Retail and Wholesale Water Revenue
City of Highland Park Billings and Collections
Water & Sewer System Wholesale Accounts Receivable Aging Report

Note: Wholesale customer revenues are billed by the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA).
Pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement between the City of Detroit and the Great Lakes
Water Authority, the Detroit Water & Sewerage Department (DWSD) serves as GLWA’s agent
for billing activities for the City of Detroit retail customer class. All revenues collected by both
GLWA and DWSD are deposited in a trust account in accordance with the GLWA Master Bond
Ordinance.

1. FY 2018 Retail and Wholesale Sewer Revenue Report

Table 1A summarizes the unaudited FY 2018 billed revenues through June 30, 2018 and do not
reflect collections of those revenues. It should also be noted that the revenues are shown in the
month that the billed flow was accrued and not the following month when the bills are usually
sent out to customers.
DWSD Retail Billings: Table 1A also shows the FY 2018 sewer usage and billed revenue which
are provided by DWSD staff. As of June 30, 2018, the DWSD usage was at 100.15% of the
budget and billed revenue was at 99.46% of budget.
GLWA Wholesale Customer Billings: Table 1A shows the FY 2018 sewer billed revenue. As a
result of the sewer rate simplification which provides a more stable revenue stream, the
wholesale sewer customers are billed a fixed monthly fee. The results of this effort can be seen
as the billed revenue is at 100.00% of budget through June 30, 2018. Table 1A shows the FY
2018 combined DWSD and GLWA Wholesale sewer billed usage and billed revenue. Based on
the combined, the GLWA Sewer System had billed revenues of 99.73% of budget as of June 30,
2018.Table 1A summarizes the unaudited FY 2018 sewer revenues billed through June 30,
2018.

 DWSD Retail Billings: Table 1B shows the FY 2019 sewer usage and billed revenue which are
provided by DWSD staff. Due to DWSD’s reporting software transition, the updated DWSD
billed usage and billed revenue information for July 2018 were not available. The July 2018
numbers will be included in next report provided at the October 2018 Audit Committee meeting.
GLWA Wholesale Customer Billings: Table 1B shows the FY 2019 sewer billed revenue. As a
result of the sewer rate simplification which provides a more stable revenue stream, the
wholesale sewer customers are billed a fixed monthly fee. The results of this effort can be seen
as the billed revenue is at 100.00% of budget through July 31, 2018.
Total System Billings: Table 1B shows the FY 2019 combined DWSD and GLWA Wholesale
sewer billed usage and billed revenue. Based on the combined, the GLWA Sewer System had
billed revenues of 100.0% of budget without the July 2018 DWSD billings.

Table 2A summarizes the unaudited FY 2018 billed revenues through June 30, 2018 and do not
reflect collections of those revenues. It should also be noted that the revenues are shown in the
month that the billed flow was accrued and not the following month when the bills are usually
sent out to customers.
DWSD Retail Billings: Table 2A also shows the FY 2018 water usage and billed revenue which
are provided by DWSD staff. As of June 30, 2018, the DWSD usage was at 96.36% of the budget

60% of the customer revenue requirement to the monthly fixed charge. As of June 30, 2018,
the billed usage was at 101.77% of budget and billed revenue at 102.98% of budget. As noted
in Table 2A, revenues and usage from the City of Flint are included as they were assumed in the
FY 2018 Budget.
Table 2A shows the FY 2018 combined DWSD and GLWA Wholesale sewer billed usage and
billed revenue. Based on the combined, the GLWA Sewer System had billed revenues of
101.31% of budget as of June 30, 2018.

 DWSD Retail Billings: Table 2B shows the FY 2019 water billed usage and billed revenue which
are provided by the DWSD staff. Due to DWSD’s reporting software transition, the updated
DWSD billed usage and billed revenue information for July 2018 were not available. The July
2018 numbers will be included in next report provided at the October 2018 Audit Committee
meeting.
GLWA Wholesale Customer Billings: Table 2B shows the FY 2019 water billed usage and billed
revenues. Starting FY 2016, wholesale water charges were re-structured to create a more stable
revenue stream by using a historical rolling average to project customer volumes and allocating
60% of the customer revenue requirement to the monthly fixed charge. As of July 31, 2018, the
billed usage was at 110.30% of budget and billed revenue at 105.85% of budget. As noted in
Table 2B, revenues and usage from the City of Flint are included as they were assumed in the
FY 2019 Budget.
Total System Billings: Table 2B shows the FY 2019 combined DWSD and GLWA Wholesale
water billed usage and billed revenue. Based on the combined Retail and Wholesale Water
billings, the GLWA Water System had billed usage of 110.30% of budget and billed revenues of
105.85% of budget without the July 2018 DWSD billings.

--Approximately $80 million sewage disposal system revenue senior lien bonds, series 2018A at 'A';
--Approximately $129 million sewage disposal system revenue refunding senior lien bonds, series 2018B
at 'A';
--Approximately $43 million sewage disposal system revenue refunding senior lien bonds, series 2018C
(federally taxable) at 'A';
--Approximately $156 million water supply system revenue refunding second lien bonds, series 2018A at
'A-'.
The bonds are scheduled to price the week of September 17 via negotiated sale. Proceeds will be used
to refund certain GLWA sewer system and water system (the systems) debt for interest savings, fund
certain Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) sewer system capital expenditures, and pay
costs of issuance.
In addition, Fitch has affirmed the following outstanding GLWA bonds, including bonds previously issued
by the city of Detroit (the city) and the Michigan Finance Authority, MI on behalf of DWSD and assumed
by GLWA:
--$1.9 billion in senior lien sewer revenue bonds at 'A';
--$752 million in second lien sewer revenue bonds at 'A-';
--$1.6 billion in senior lien water revenue bonds at 'A';
--$668 million in second lien water revenue bonds at 'A-'.
The Rating Outlook has been revised to Positive from Stable.
SECURITY
Senior lien water and sewer bonds are separately secured by a first lien on net revenues of each
respective system. Second lien bonds are separately secured by a second lien on the net revenues of
each respective system after payment of senior lien bonds.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
POSITIVE OUTLOOK ON SOLID FINANCIALS: The Outlook revision to Positive from Stable reflects
solid fiscal 2016 and 2017 financial results related to GLWA's initial operations of the systems, outpacing
prior expectations. Changes in rate-setting practices as well as accumulation of reserves under the
master bond ordinances have enhanced prospects for achieving forecast expectations and help to
adequately insulate GLWA from high city of Detroit retail delinquencies.

LEASE REINFORCES SEPARATE OPERATIONS: All system funds and accounts are separate and
distinct from other city funds, including Detroit's general fund. The lease of the systems by GLWA
provides further assurance that system operations will remain independent of the city.
HIGHLY LEVERAGED DEBT PROFILE: The systems' debt load is expected to remain elevated for the
foreseeable future as a result of legacy issuance and ongoing borrowing. Over the longer term, greater
use of pay-as-you-go capital funding is expected to alleviate debt pressures to some degree.
EXPANSIVE SERVICE TERRITORY: The systems provide essential services to a broad area. The water
system covers almost 40% of Michigan's population, while the sewer system includes about 30% of
Michigan's population. The majority of GLWA's revenues come from suburban customers.
STRONG RATE-ADJUSTMENT HISTORY: The governing bodies have instituted annual rate hikes in
support of financial and capital needs. Continued annual adjustments are included in the forecast and
will be needed to meet rising debt service and sustain financial performance.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
SUSTAINED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING GAINS: Sustained operating enhancements, improved
liquidity and moderating leverage could lead to a rating upgrade over the course of the next couple of
years. Alternatively, GLWA's failure to maintain the improved operational and financial performance of its
water and sewer utilities due to insufficient revenue recovery or higher than expected costs could result
in a change in Outlook back to Stable.
CHANGES TO DEBT PROFILE: Increases in debt issuance levels due to revisions in the capital plan or
reductions in operating cash flow would be viewed unfavorably, given the already high leverage of both
systems.
CREDIT PROFILE
GLWA entered into 40-year leases of DWSD's water and sewer systems (except for the local city
infrastructure), as well as a water and sewer services agreement (combined lease agreements) with the
city in June 2015. The lease agreements became effective on Jan. 1, 2016, at which point GLWA
assumed operational control of all leased assets of the regional water and sewer systems; the leases
also conveyed an interest in all revenues of both the water and sewer systems (including both the
regional and local city retail systems). At the same time, GLWA assumed all liabilities of the water and
sewer systems, including all outstanding indebtedness of the city related to the respective systems.
Fitch believes the leases and supporting documents effectively codify the legal separation between the
systems and the city, and insulate the systems from being included in any future city bankruptcy
proceedings, if one were to occur. DWSD continues to own and operate the city retail water and sewer
systems and serves as GLWA's agent with regards to the rate setting, billing and collection of city retail
accounts. However, GLWA can terminate DWSD's agent responsibilities in the event of nonperformance
by DWSD as described in a Water and Sewer Service Agreement (the WSSA) between the city and
GLWA.
Key terms of the agreements, which are embedded in GLWA's financial projections, include a $50 million
annual lease payment to the city, although such moneys may only be used at the city's option to fund
pay-go capital improvements related to Detroit's local water and sewer systems or DWSD-related debt
service associated with the local systems and/or GLWA regional systems. An assistance program is also
funded and replenished annually as part of GLWA's budget for low-income customers throughout

GLWA's service territory. In addition, a budget stabilization fund is funded from city retail customers to
ensure moneys are available to meet the city's portion of GLWA's annual revenue requirement. Deposits
required to fund the lease payment and other created accounts like the assistance account occur
subsequent to payment of debt service; however, these are added costs that ratepayers must absorb.
STRONGER FINANCIALS DRIVE OUTLOOK CHANGE
Audited fiscal 2017 results yielded Fitch-calculated total debt service coverage (DSC) for the water
system of 1.6x, coverage of full obligations of 1.3x (which includes all transfers including the lease
payment) and liquidity of 539 days cash, all of which are considered favorable for a wholesale provider
under Fitch's criteria. Fitch's calculations include both GLWA and DWSD operating revenues and
expenses given the requirements under the trust indenture, leases and related agreements. Water
system DSC for the year was higher than previously forecasted in part due to higher than expected bad
debt recoveries. Preliminary fiscal 2018 financial results point to continued solid performance for the
water system with total DSC of 1.5x and coverage of full obligations of 1.3x (slightly ahead of the prior
forecast). The most recent forecast anticipates financial results through fiscal 2023 commensurate with
fiscal 2018 results.
For fiscal 2017, Fitch-calculated total sewer DSC was just under 1.5x, coverage of full obligations was
1.2x and days cash was 172, all of which are considered favorable for wholesale utilities. Sewer system
DSC was also higher for the year than previously anticipated. Total sewer system DSC for fiscal 2018 is
expected to be weaker than the prior year at slightly less than 1.2x (coverage of all obligations at 1.0x)
as the system received around $20 million less than expected from DWSD. GLWA is working with
DWSD to formulate a plan that is expected to be completed by fiscal 2019 Q1 whereby this amount will
ultimately be paid to GLWA by DWSD. GLWA attributes the lower than expected collections to one-time
events associated with a legal settlement over historical drainage charges (including actions to credit
various customer accounts) as well as modifications to phase-in newly adopted drainage program
charges. GLWA's latest forecast through fiscal 2023 estimate improved results from 2018 levels
beginning in fiscal 2019 and continuing thereafter. A trend of sustained favorable DSC, liquidity and
stabilizing leverage could lead to a rating upgrade for both systems over the near-term.
Financial results have stabilized and improved over the past several years from previously poor levels,
including years where total DSC for each of the systems was below 1.0x. Gains in financial results are
attributable to GLWA and DWSD's efforts to both enhance revenues and cut operating costs. On the
revenue front, GLWA adopted changes with its suburban water customers beginning in fiscal 2016 to
revise purchase estimates and shift to an increasing amount of fixed monthly charge recovery (60%
versus 40% the prior year). These changes are similar to the implementation of a rate simplification
initiative for suburban sewer customers effective for fiscal 2015 that identifies each customer's
proportionate costs based on historical average shares, with such shares billed monthly and locked in for
three years before being subject to recalculation.
DWSD also has been working extensively to reduce retail delinquencies through outreach and
aggressively pursuing shut-offs, although 60-day and greater past due accounts from active customers
remain abnormally high (44% excluding customers not on payment plans). GLWA's budgeting and
accumulation of $7.5 million in the budget stabilization fund as of fiscal 2017 help to mitigate GLWA's
exposure to delinquent city customers.
SYSTEM LEVERAGE REMAINS HIGH
Fitch expects leverage for both systems to remain high for the foreseeable future but that it will decline in
time given increased use of pay-go sources and principal amortization that exceeds planned annual

issuances. For fiscal 2017, GLWA's long-term debt per capita totaled $697 for water and $1,381 for
sewer (excluding the lease obligations), both of which are considered high per Fitch's criteria. For the
same period, debt to net plant assets was also elevated for both systems at 130% and 116% for water
and sewer, respectively, while debt to funds available for debt service was 9.5x for water and 9.8x for
sewer (all excluding the lease obligations). Principal payout is relatively typical for sector credits at about
80% over 20 years for both water and sewer, including debt and contractual pension obligations.
The consolidated GLWA regional and DWSD local 2019-2023 capital improvement plans (CIPs),
including regional budgeted capital outlays, total $979 million for water (down 11% from the fiscal 20172021 CIP) and $748 million for sewer (down 9%). While GLWA's CIPs for the regional water and sewer
systems total just $659 million and $562 million, respectively, GLWA's revenues fund the DWSD CIPs
through the lease payments and debt issued by GLWA for the local projects (including the new money
portion related to this sale). Funding for the consolidated CIPs is expected to be provided by
approximately 40% debt proceeds and 60% pay-go for the water system and 60% debt/40% pay-go for
the sewer system, with the amount of pay-go representing a significant amount of current resources for a
wholesale entity.
Projected capital costs have risen from prior CIPs before the system leases were executed as a result of
the updated water master plan approved by GLWA's board in August 2016, the first update since 2004.
An outcome of the plan includes decommissioning one of the water treatment plants (accounting for over
15% of system capacity) along with other system optimization. The updated water master plan results in
significant near-term investment; however, these costs are expected to moderate over time and
ultimately result in over $400 million in capital cost avoidance as well as reduced operating costs by $2.4
million per year.
Sewer CIP costs have also increased in recent years as GLWA has been going through an update to the
sewer master plan, which is expected to be finalized in the 2019-2020 timeframe. While the sewer costs
are less refined than the water costs, certain initial estimates from the planning levels have been added
to the CIP at this point.
BROAD SERVICE AREA ENHANCES SYSTEM STABILITY
The water system is a regional provider serving around 3.8 million people or almost 40% of Michigan's
population, including the city's population of around 675,000. The system serves the city via DWSD on a
retail basis and 127 communities through 87 wholesale contracts and provides service to Genesee
County Drain Commissioner through a reciprocal backup contract. The service territory consists of 1,760
square miles covering all or a portion of eight counties in southeast Michigan.
The sewer system is a regional provider serving around 2.8 million people or around 30% of Michigan's
population, including the city. The system serves the city via DWSD on a retail basis and 76 communities
through 18 wholesale contracts. The service territory consists of 944 square miles covering three
counties in the Detroit-Warren-Dearborn metropolitan statistical area.
Population and customer growth for both systems have experienced modest annual declines for a
number of years. Detroit's population in particular has experienced continuous decline, but suburban
areas have picked up most of the migration. Wealth levels in the city are low (less than 50% of the U.S.
average) while poverty (39%) and unemployment levels (9.3% as of June 2018) are high, although
figures for the metropolitan area overall, which includes the city as well as the suburban customers, are
generally in line with state and national averages.

Security: Senior lien sewer and water bonds separately secured by a first lien on net revenues
of each Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) sewer and water system. Second lien bonds
separately secured by a second lien on the net revenues of each system.

Purpose: To refund certain GLWA sewer system and water system (the systems) debt for

capital expenditures for Detroit and pay costs of issuance.

Final Maturity: Sewer? July 1, 2048; water? July 1, 2029.
Key Rating Drivers

Positive Outlook on Solid Financials: The Rating Outlook revision to Positive from Stable
reflects solid fiscal years 2016 and 2017 financial results related to initial operations of
the systems, outpacing prior expectations. Changes in rate-setting practices as well as
accumulation of reserves under the master bond ordinances have enhanced prospects for
achieving forecast expectations and help to adequately insulate GLWA from high city of Detroit
retail delinquencies.

Lease Reinforces Separate Operations: All system funds and accounts are separate and
distinct from city funds, including Detroit's general fund. The lease of the systems by GLWA
provides further assurance that system operations will remain independent of the city.

Highly Leveraged Debt Pro?le: The systems? debt load is expected to remain elevated for the
foreseeable future as a result of legacy issuance and ongoing borrowing. Over the longer term,
greater use of pay-as-you-go capital funding is expected to alleviate debt pressures to some degree.

Expansive Service Territory: The systems provide essential services to a broad area. The
water system covers almost 40% of Michigan's population, while the sewer system includes
about 30% of Michigan's population. The majority of revenues come from suburban
customers.

Strong Rate Adjustment History: The governing bodies have instituted annual charge
increases in support of financial and capital needs. Continued annual adjustments are included
in the forecast and will be needed to meet rising debt service and sustain financial performance.

Rating Sensitivities

Sustained Financial and Operating Gains: Sustained operating enhancements, improved
liquidity and moderating leverage could lead to a rating upgrade over the course of the next
couple of years. Alternatively, failure to maintain the improved operational and
financial performance of its water and sewer utilities due to insufficient revenue recovery or
higher than expected costs could result in a change in Outlook back to Stable.

Criteria (November 2017)

 

 

Changes to Debt Profile: Increases in debt issuance levels due to revisions in the capital plan
or reductions in operating cash flow would be viewed unfavorably, given the already high
leverage of both systems.

Credit Profile

GLWA entered into 40-year leases of water and sewer systems (except for the local
city infrastructure) with the city in June 2015 (the lease agreements). The lease agreements
became effective on Jan. 1, 2016, at which point GLWA assumed operational control of all
leased assets of the regional water and sewer systems; the leases also conveyed an interest in
all revenues of both the water and sewer systems (including both the regional and local city
retail systems). At the same time, GLWA assumed all outstanding indebtedness related to the
respective regional and local water and sewer systems.

Fitch believes the leases and supporting documents effectively codify the legal separation
between the systems and the city, and insulate the systems from being included in any future
city bankruptcy proceedings, if one were to occur. DWSD continues to own and operate the city
retail water and sewer systems and serves as agent with regards to the rate setting,
billing and collection of city retail accounts. However, GLWA can terminate agent
responsibilities in the event of nonperformance by DWSD as described in a Water and Sewer
Service Agreement (the WSSA) between the city and GLWA.

Key terms of the agreements, which are embedded in financial projections, include a
$50 million annual lease payment to the city, although such moneys may only be used at the
city?s option to fund pay-go capital improvements related to Detroit?s local water and sewer
systems or DWSD-related debt service associated with the local systems and/or GLWA
regional systems. An assistance program is also funded annually as part of budget. In
addition, a budget stabilization fund is funded from city retail customers to ensure moneys are
available to meet the city?s portion of annual revenue requirement. Deposits required
to fund the lease payment and other created accounts such as the assistance account occur
subsequent to payment of debt service; however, these are added costs that ratepayers must
absorb.

Stronger Financials Drive Outlook Change

Audited fiscal 2017 results yielded Fitch-calculated total debt service coverage (DSC) for the
water system of 1.6x, coverage of full obligations of 1.3x (which includes all transfers under the
indenture including the lease payment) and liquidity of 539 days cash, all of which are
considered favorable for a wholesale provider under Fitch?s criteria. Fitch?s calculations include
both GLWA and DWSD operating revenues and expenses given the requirements under the
trust indenture, leases and related agreements. Water system DSC for the year was higher
than previously forecast (estimated at 1.4x in 2016) in part due to higher than expected bad
debt recoveries.

Preliminary fiscal 2018 financial results for the water system point to continued solid
performance, with total DSC of 1.5x and coverage of full obligations of 1.3x ahead of
the prior forecast). For the year revenues were $20 million over budget (a positive 5%
variance), driven primarily from higher than expected receipts from Flint, Genesee County and
DWSD retail accounts. On the expense side, cash transfers for expenses matched
budgeted amounts. The most recent forecast anticipates financial results through fiscal 2023
generally commensurate with fiscal 2018 results, without including any potential savings from
the current transaction.

For fiscal 2017, Fitch-calculated total sewer DSC was just under 1.5x, coverage of full
obligations was 1.2x and days cash was 172, all of which are considered favorable for
wholesale utilities. Sewer system DSC was also higher for the year than previously anticipated
(estimated at 1.3x in 2016). Total sewer system DSC for fiscal 2018 is expected to be weaker
than the prior year at less than 1.2x (coverage of all obligations at 1.0x) as the system
received around $20 million less than expected from DWSD. Despite the lower collections, total
revenues were only around $13.5 million lower than budget (negative 2.5% variance). Similar
to the water system, cash transfers for equaled budgeted amounts for the year.

GLWA is working with DWSD to formulate a plan that is expected to be completed by fiscal Q1
2019 whereby the shortfall in sewer collection amounts will ultimately be paid to GLWA by
DWSD. GLWA attributes the lower than expected collections to one-time events associated
with a legal settlement over historical drainage charges (including actions to credit various
customer accounts) as well as modifications to phase in newly adopted drainage program
charges. latest forecast through fiscal 2023 (which also does not include any savings
from the current refunding transaction) estimate improved results from 2018 levels beginning in
fiscal 2019 and continuing thereafter. A trend of sustained favorable DSC, liquidity and
stabilizing leverage could lead to a rating upgrade for both systems over the near term.

Financial results have stabilized and improved over the past several years from previously poor
levels, including years where total DSC for each of the systems was below 1.0x. Gains in
financial results are attributable to GLWA and efforts to both enhance revenues and
cut operating costs. On the revenue front, GLWA adopted changes with its suburban water
customers beginning in fiscal 2016 to revise purchase estimates and shift to an increasing
amount of fixed charge recovery (60% versus 40% the prior year). These changes
have led to more accurate forecasting of revenues (for fiscal 2017 billed revenues and volumes
were around 102% of budget each) and are similar to the implementation of a rate
simplification initiative for suburban sewer customers effective for fiscal 2015 that identifies
each customer?s proportionate costs based on historical average shares (Le. a 100% fixed
charge), with such shares billed and locked in for three years before being subject to
recalculation.

DWSD also has been working extensively to reduce retail delinquencies through outreach and
aggressively pursuing shut-offs, although 60-day and greater past due accounts from active
customers remain abnormally high (44% excluding customers not on payment plans). 
budgeting and accumulation of $7.5 million in the budget stabilization fund as of fiscal 2017
help to mitigate exposure to delinquent city customers.

System Leverage Remains High

Fitch expects leverage for both systems to remain high for the foreseeable future but will
decline in time given increased use of pay-go sources and principal amortization that exceeds
planned annual issuances. The vast majority of debt is fixed rate and there are no swaps
outstanding, limiting interest rate and third-party credit risks.

For fiscal 2017, GLWA's long-term debt per capita totaled $697 for water and $1,381 for sewer
(excluding the lease obligations), both of which are considered high per Fitch?s criteria. For the
same period, debt to net plant assets was also elevated for both systems at 130% and 116%
for water and sewer, respectively, while debt to funds available for debt service was 9.5x for
water and 9.8x for sewer (all excluding the lease obligations). Principal payout is relatively
typical for sector credits at about 80% over 20 years for both water and sewer, including debt
and contractual pension obligations.

The consolidated GLWA regional and DWSD local 2019?2023 capital improvement plans
(ClPs), including regional budgeted capital outlays, total $866 million for water (down 11% from
the fiscal 2017?2021 and $748 million for sewer (down While for the
regional water and sewer systems total just $659 million and $562 million, respectively,
revenues fund the DWSD through the lease payments and debt issued by
GLWA for the local projects (including the new money portion related to this sale). Funding for
the consolidated is expected to be provided by approximately 40% debt proceeds and
60% pay-go for the water system and 60% debt and 40% pay-go for the sewer system, with the
amount of pay-go representing a significant amount of current resources for a wholesale entity.

Projected capital costs have risen from prior before the system leases were executed as a
result of the updated water master plan approved by board in August 2016, the first
update since 2004. An outcome of the plan includes removing treatment processes from one of
the water treatment plants (accounting for over 15% of system capacity) along with other system
optimization. The updated water master plan results in significant near-term investment; however,
these costs are expected to moderate over time and ultimately result in over $400 million in
capital cost avoidance as well as reduced operating costs by $2.4 million per year.

Sewer costs have also increased since before the system leases were executed as GLWA
has been going through an update to the sewer master plan, which is expected to be finalized
in the 2019?2020 timeframe. While the sewer costs are less refined than the water costs,
certain initial estimates from the planning levels have been added to the CIP at this point.

Broad Service Area Enhances System Stability

The water system is a regional provider serving around 3.8 million people, or almost 40% of
Michigan's population, including the city?s population of approximately 675,000. The system
serves the city via DWSD on a retail basis and 127 communities through 87 wholesale
contracts and provides service to Genesee County Drain Commissioner through a reciprocal
backup contract. The service territory consists of 1,760 square miles covering all or a portion of
eight counties in southeast Michigan. Water supplies, which are derived from the Detroit River,
Lake Huron and Lake St. Clair, are more than sufficient to meet the perpetual needs of the
service territory. Similarly, combined treatment capacity by the system?s five plants greatly
exceeds current and future projected demand levels. The capacity margin will decline with the
decommissioning of one of the treatment plants but is still expected to be more than sufficient
over at least the next 20 years. GLWA faces no issues relating to the water system and is in full
compliance with the federal Lead and Copper Rule.

The sewer system is also a regional provider serving around 2.8 million people, or
approximately 30% of Michigan's population, including the city. The system serves the city via
DWSD on a retail basis and 76 communities through 18 wholesale contracts. The service
territory consists of 944 square miles covering three counties in the Detroit-Warren-Dearborn
metropolitan statistical area. Like the water system, sewer treatment capacity is more than
sufficient to meet average demands, but wet weather flows can exceed system capacity. As a
result GLWA operates certain combined sewer overflow facilities to manage these events.
GLWA is in material compliance with its discharge requirements, although GLWA is a party to
an administrative order dating back to 2011 requiring certain corrective measures relating to
biosolids handling.

Population and customer growth for both systems have experienced modest annual declines
for a number of years. Detroit's population in particular has experienced continuous decline, but
suburban areas have picked up most of the migration. Wealth levels in the city are low (less
than 50% of the US. average) while poverty and unemployment levels as of June

2018) are high, although figures for the metropolitan area overall, which includes the city as
well as the suburban customers, are generally in line with state and national averages.

The Great Lakes Water Authority's (GLWA) Water Enterprise (A2 stable) has maintained
strong financial metrics in recent years and we expect this to continue. A combination of
GLWA's commitment to raising rates and stabilization of the customer base supports an
expectation of continued and moderate revenue growth. The system's healthy liquidity and
debt service coverage balance a very high debt burden. At the same time, the enterprise has
resources available to support capital spending in ways other than issuing debt. Though we
anticipate more borrowing in the coming years, continued revenue growth should moderate
the system's debt burden. The authority has achieved operating efficiencies by reducing staff
and right-sizing treatment facilities. The system's sizable service area and scale of operations
remain credit strengths, though there are and will remain economic weaknesses in certain
areas of the customer base. Activity in the City of Detroit (Ba3 stable) accounts for a large
share of annual revenue and the retail system in the city is still contending with leaks and
water losses. We do not expect addressing these challenges will be a significant burden as
long as revenue growth and the underlying economy remain healthy. An economic setback in
the region, however, could intensify operating challenges.
On August 31, 2018 we upgraded to A2 and A3 from A3 and Baa1 GLWA's senior and second
lien water revenue debt, respectively.

Credit strengths
» Very large system that provides essential water services to approximately 38% of the state’s population
» Commitment to annual revenue enhancements to support sound debt service coverage and healthy liquidity
» Implementation of operational efficiencies, including right-sizing of personnel and water treatment capacity

Credit challenges
» Declining water consumption trend given economic and demographic weaknesses in portions of the service area, as well as general
conservation efforts
» High leverage will moderate slowly given outstanding capital needs and plans to issue additional debt
» High combined operating needs and fixed costs leave little margin to miss revenue targets in order to maintain strong liquidity and
expand pay-go capital financing

Rating outlook
The stable outlook incorporates our expectation that key financial metrics will remain favorable and mitigate high leverage of pledged
revenue.

Factors that could lead to an upgrade
» Sustained expansion and diversification of the service area’s economic base
» Growth in revenue that continues to outpace borrowing so as to moderate leverage of pledged resources

Factors that could lead to a downgrade
» Renewed economic stress that pressures consumption and revenue trends
» Material reduction to the system’s liquidity or debt service coverage ratios
» Growth in leverage of the water system’s net revenue

Profile
The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) is the regional wholesale provider of water and sewer services to southeast Michigan
(Aa1 stable). Fully established in 2016, GLWA is an incorporated municipal authority operating under the guidance of a six-member
board consisting of one appointee each of the counties of Macomb (Aa1 stable), Oakland (Aaa stable), and Wayne (Baa2 stable), two
appointees of the Mayor of Detroit, and one of the Governor of Michigan. The water enterprise treats water from Lake Huron, Lake St.
Clair and the Detroit River and distributes treated water to a service area population of approximately 3.8 million.

Detailed credit considerations
Service area and system characteristics: very large service area in southeast Michigan
The regional water supply system, which is leased from the City of Detroit, covers a vast 1,760 square miles in southeast Michigan. It
provides treated water to all or portions of eight counties. The system is a wholesale enterprise whose articles of incorporation allow
for direct retail service. Residential and business activity within the City of Detroit, has accounted for between 20% and 25% of annual
GLWA revenue over the last five fiscal years (2013-2017). Residents and businesses within Detroit are retail customers of the Detroit
Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD). The remainder of water sales are to 127 suburban customers via 87 wholesale customer
contracts.
Since 2008, 80 of GLWA's wholesale customers signed new model contracts with 30-year terms and automatic 10-year renewal.
Customers must provide notice of intent to terminate five years in advance of the end of the contract term. Effective December 1,
2017 the City of Flint entered into the 30-year model contract, which will provide the city with a stable source of quality treated water.
The contract was signed in conjunction with a master agreement and regional collaboration among the city and GLWA, as well as
the Genesee County Drain Commissioner (GCDC), Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA; A2 stable), and the State of Michigan. The
agreement provides for reciprocal backup water supply from GCDC and GLWA's use of Flint's KWA raw water rights.

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE

Although the creation of the KWA resulted in the exit of GCDC as a wholesale customer, we anticipate the model contracts will ensure
a stable customer base going forward. GCDC had been the water system's third largest customer, accounting for 5.9% of wholesale
customer charges in fiscal 2017. Stabilization of the regional economy should further support the resiliency of the customer base. Since
peaking at 15.1% in 2009, the Detroit MSA's unemployment rate has fallen to 4.4% as of August 2018. Median family income has also
gradually improved, and is now estimated at 101.2% of the national figure.
Similar to many water systems in the Midwest, consumption is falling. From 2008 to 2018 the volume of water billed dropped by
roughly 23%. At the same time, non-revenue volume produced by the water utility remains very high, driven mainly by leaks or major
breaks in the transmission and distribution systems. Over the past five years non-revenue water accounted for approximately 27% of
water produced. Production volumes, however, are not metered, and the recent cost of service study indicates production volumes are
likely overstated.

Declining usage can be traced to several factors, including weather trends and conservation efforts. While this trend may stabilize over
the long term, sustained upticks in usage are unlikely absent the expansion of the system into new wholesale contract communities.
Population in the Detroit MSA fell nearly 4% between 2000 and 2010, and while recent estimates point to flat trends in the service
area since, material growth may be unlikely. GLWA has adjusted its rate structure to increase fixed rate charges, which will continue to
mitigate downward effects of consumption decline.
Debt service coverage and liquidity: financial metrics expected to remain healthy
Debt service and liquidity strengthened in recent years and we expect both to remain healthy. The authority plans to limit annual
growth in its water system revenue requirements by 4%, but is committed to adjusting service charges, as needed, to meet bond
covenants. Each year GLWA conducts an extensive study of both its wholesale service charges and allocated annual revenue
requirement to retail water customers, with the purpose of adjusting revenue to reflect the cost of operations, depreciation expense,
and return on the rate base. Due to positive operating variances in fiscal 2017, GLWA's needed revenue increases fell below 4% in fiscal
2018 and in the adopted fiscal 2019 budget.
Significant growth in retail rates in Detroit could challenge the capacity of some of DWSD’s customers to pay. Delinquent Detroit
retail accounts have remained high, though DWSD has enhanced both collection efforts and customer assistance programs, including
participating in GLWA’s water residential assistance program (WRAP). Additionally, DWSD funds a budget reserve, per the bond
ordinance, to cover shortfalls in retail collections. The significant portion of annual revenue derived from Detroit retail operations
remains a key credit challenge that could affect debt service coverage and liquidity. However, in conjunction with GLWA's commitment
to manageable revenue requirement increases, DWSD’s efforts should limit growth in delinquent retail accounts, especially if moderate
economic growth continues.

Fiscal 2017 marked GLWA's first full year in operation, during which total water revenue grew 3.7%. Growth in revenue supported
2.1x coverage of senior lien debt service, 1.7x coverage on combined senior and second lien debt service, and 1.6x coverage of all
debt service including junior lien state revolving fund payments. Thought audited information is not yet available for fiscal 2018,
management estimates coverage at 2.0x and 1.5x, respectively, of senior lien and total debt service.
Per the master bond ordinance, revenue includes all money collected from the regional wholesale and local retail water customer
payments deposited to a lockbox administered by a third-party trustee. O&M expenses are defined as cash transfers made to the
GLWA's and DWSD's respective operation and maintenance funds. Bifurcated accounting between the GLWA's regional and DWSD's
local operations means adjustments must be made to accurately assess coverage under the master bond ordinance.

LIQUIDITY

The water system's liquidity is strong and will remain so despite planned spending. At the close of fiscal 2017 the water fund had an
unrestricted cash balance of $267.3 million, equivalent to 626 days of O&M. The authority estimates cash increased to $313.2 million
at the close of fiscal 2018. The water fund also has significant restricted cash assets held for budget stabilization, debt service, and
capital. The authority anticipates cash will remain at or above 433 days of operations through 2023. This accounts for up to $350
million of planned capital spending from reserves and surplus revenue over the next five years.
Debt and legal covenants: high debt burden could moderate with sustained revenue growth
Leverage of pledged water revenue is high. Current long-term debt across all liens is 5.3x fiscal 2017 operating revenue. Upcoming
capital needs include improvements to the water delivery infrastructure ($274 million), water treatment plants ($210 million), and
general purpose and central services ($99 million). In addition to financing these improvements with reserves and surplus revenue,
GLWA plans to issue approximately $52.2 million in revenue bond, and $137.2 million in junior lien SRF loans over the next five years.
The increase in debt will be more than offset by the amount paid down over the next five years. Though we expect the system's debt
burden will remain high, sustained revenue growth would make leverage less of a credit challenge going forward.
DEBT STRUCTURE

All water revenue debt of the GLWA is fixed rate. GLWA's rate covenant requires net revenue coverage of debt service equal to 120%
for senior lien bonds, 110% for second lien bonds and 100% for any subordinate lien debt. Senior and second lien bonds benefit from
debt service reserve funds (DSRF) sized at lessor of the standard three-prong test. As of July 1, 2018, approximately 12% and 13%,
respectively, of the senior and second lien DSRF requirements are satisfied with cash. The balances of each are satisfied with various
surety or insurance policies.
DEBT-RELATED DERIVATIVES

GLWA is not party to any derivative agreements associated with its pledge of net water revenue.

PENSIONS AND OPEB

Current employees of GLWA are participants in a defined contribution benefit plan, though many are scheduled to receive accrued
pension benefits from the City of Detroit's frozen defined benefit General Retirement System (GRS). Pursuant to the City of Detroit's
bankruptcy settlement, GLWA will contribute $45.4 million annually to GRS through fiscal 2023 to accelerate amortization of the GRS
unfunded liability associated with GLWA employees. The water enterprise's share of the annual GLWA payment to GRS will be $19.5
million, or approximately 5% of fiscal 2017 gross revenue, not inclusive of operating revenue from DWSD pledged to debt service. Less
than half of the annual GRS payment is considered O&M and senior to debt service.
Beyond 2023, GLWA's payments to GRS will be based on the actuarial needs of the plan and sized to amortize any unfunded liability
associated with GLWA employees. GLWA makes no payments towards accrued retiree healthcare liabilities as the City of Detroit's
bankruptcy settlement eliminated those benefits. GLWA established a new defined contribution retiree healthcare savings plan,
resulting in no potential unfunded liability.
Management and governance: management works to sustain regional cooperation
The management of GLWA has made strides in enhancing operational efficiencies and regional cooperations since its formation.
To that end GLWA dramatically right-sized its work force, reducing full time employees by over 1,000 over the past several years.
Additionally, since system capacity exceeds demand, management has de-rated parts of its treatment plants. This allows the water
system to reduce capital costs while preserving flexibility to put the facilities back to use. Rate structure adjustments and payment
assistance to low-income retail customers should support revenue stability. Additionally, the number of wholesale model contracts
entered into points to increased regional collaboration.

The Great Lakes Water Authority's (GLWA) Sewer Enterprise (A2 stable) has maintained
strong financial metrics in recent years and we expect this to continue. A combination of
GLWA's commitment to raising rates and stabilization of the customer base supports an
expectation of continued and moderate revenue growth. The system's healthy liquidity and
debt service coverage balance a very high debt burden. At the same time, the enterprise has
resources available to support capital spending in ways other than issuing debt. Though we
anticipate more borrowing in the coming years, continued revenue growth should moderate
the system's debt burden. The authority has achieved operating efficiencies by reducing
staff and optimizing treatment facilities. The system's sizable service area and scale of
operations remain credit strengths, though there are and will remain economic weaknesses
in certain areas of the customer base. Activity in the City of Detroit (Ba3 stable) accounts
for a very large share of annual revenue and the retail system in the city, in particular, is still
continuing a strategy to mitigate future combined sewage overflows (CSOs). We do not
expect addressing these challenges will be a significant burden as long as revenue growth and
the underlying economy remain healthy. An economic setback in the region, however, could
intensify operating challenges.
On August 31, 2018 we upgraded to A2 and A3 from A3 and Baa1 GLWA's senior and second
lien sewer revenue debt, respectively.

Credit strengths
» Very large system that provides essential wastewater services to an estimated 2.8 million residents
» Commitment to annual revenue enhancements to support sound debt service coverage and healthy liquidity
» Simplified monthly fixed rate structure mitigates declining usage while providing stable cash flow throughout the year

Credit challenges
» Economic and demographic weaknesses in portions of the service area, including the City of Detroit which accounts for roughly
45% of annual operating revenue
» High leverage will moderate slowly given outstanding capital needs and plans to issue additional debt
» High combined operating needs and fixed costs leave little margin to miss revenue targets in order to maintain strong liquidity and
expand pay-go capital financing

Rating outlook
The stable outlook incorporates our expectation that key financial metrics will remain favorable and mitigate high leverage of pledged
revenue.

Factors that could lead to an upgrade
» Sustained expansion and diversification of the service area’s economic base
» Growth in revenue that continues to outpace borrowing so as to moderate leverage of pledged resources

Factors that could lead to a downgrade
» Renewed economic stress that pressures consumption and revenue trends
» Material reduction to the system’s liquidity or debt service coverage ratios
» Growth in leverage of the sewer system’s net revenue

Profile
The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) is the regional wholesale provider of water and sewer services to southeast Michigan. Fully
established in 2016, GLWA is an incorporated municipal authority operating under the guidance of a six-member board consisting of
one appointee each of the counties of Macomb (Aa1 stable), Oakland (Aaa stable), and Wayne (Baa2 stable), two appointees of the
Mayor of Detroit, and one of the Governor of Michigan (Aa1 stable). The sewer enterprise collects, treats and disposes of wastewater
produced by a service area population of approximately 2.8 million.

Detailed credit considerations
Service area and system characteristics: very large service area in southeast Michigan
The regional sewer system, which is leased from the City of Detroit, covers a vast 944 square miles in southeast Michigan, providing
sewage collection, treatment, and disposal. The system is a wholesale enterprise whose articles of incorporation allow for direct retail
service. Residential and business activity within the City of Detroit has accounted for between 44% and 47% of annual GLWA revenue
over the last five fiscal years (2013-2017). Residents and businesses within Detroit are retail customers of the Detroit Water and
Sewerage Department (DWSD). The remainder of sewer revenue is derived from 76 suburban communities via 18 wholesale customer
contracts.
Since 2009, 11 of GLWA's wholesale customers signed new model contracts with 30-year terms and automatic 10-year renewal.
Customers under the model contract must provide notice of intent to terminate five years in advance of the end of the contract term.
All remaining wholesale customers that are not on the model contract have purchased services from DWSD and subsequently GLWA
since at least 1961. Stabilization of the regional economy should further support the resiliency of the customer base. Since peaking at
15.1% in 2009, the Detroit MSA's unemployment rate has fallen to 4.4% as of August 2018. Median family income has also gradually
improved, and is now estimated at 101.2% of the national figure.

Similar to many older sewer systems, GLWA's wastewater utility has a significant amount of combined sewer infrastructure. As such,
a large degree of treated wastewater volume is related to wet weather events. Over the past ten years only an average of 36% of
total treated wastewater volume has been a result of sanitary volume associated with customer water usage. The remaining 64%
reflects water from runoff of wet weather events and infiltration. Greater ability to control infiltration would likely lead to reductions in
treatment costs.

Debt service coverage and liquidity: financial metrics expected to remain healthy
Debt service and liquidity strengthened in recent years and we expect both to remain healthy. The authority plans to limit annual
growth in its sewer system revenue requirements by 4%, but is committed to adjusting service charges, as needed, to meet bond
covenants. Each year GLWA conducts an extensive study of both its wholesale service charges and allocated annual revenue
requirement to retail sewer customers, with the purpose of adjusting revenue to reflect the cost of operations, depreciation expense,
and return on the rate base. Due to positive operating variances in fiscal 2017, GLWA's needed revenue increases fell below 4% in fiscal
2018 and in the adopted fiscal 2019 budget.
Significant growth in retail rates in Detroit could challenge the capacity of some of DWSD’s customers to pay. Delinquent Detroit
retail accounts have remained high, though DWSD has enhanced both collection efforts and customer assistance programs, including
participating in GLWA’s water residential assistance program (WRAP). Additionally, DWSD funds a budget reserve, per the bond
ordinance, to cover shortfalls in retail collections. The significant portion of annual revenue derived from Detroit retail operations
remains a key credit challenge that could affect debt service coverage and liquidity. However, in conjunction with GLWA's commitment
to manageable revenue requirement increases, DWSD’s efforts should limit growth in delinquent retail accounts, especially if moderate
economic growth continues.
Fiscal 2017 marked GLWA's first full year in operation, during which total sewer revenue grew 4.1%. Growth in revenue supported
2.5x coverage of senior lien debt service, 1.9x coverage on combined senior and second lien debt service, and 1.5x coverage of all
debt service including junior lien state revolving fund payments. Though audited information is not yet available for fiscal 2018,
management estimates coverage at 1.9x and 1.2x, respectively, of senior lien and total debt service.

Per the master bond ordinance, revenue includes all money collected from the regional wholesale and local retail sewer customer
payments deposited to a lockbox administered by a third-party trustee. O&M expenses are defined as cash transfers made to the
GLWA's and DWSD's respective operation and maintenance funds. Bifurcated accounting between the GLWA's regional and DWSD's
local operations means adjustments must be made to accurately assess coverage under the master bond ordinance.
LIQUIDITY

The sewer system's liquidity is strong and will remain so despite planned spending. At the close of fiscal 2017 the sewer fund had an
unrestricted cash balance of $205.2 million, equivalent to 324 days of O&M. The authority estimates cash increased to $208.1 million
at the close of fiscal 2018. The sewer fund also has significant restricted cash assets held for budget stabilization, debt service, and
capital. The authority anticipates total combined cash will remain at or above 342 days of operations through 2023. This accounts for
up to $174 million of planned capital spending from reserves and surplus revenue over the next five years.
Debt and legal covenants: high debt burden could moderate with sustained revenue growth
Leverage of pledged sewer revenue is high. Current long-term debt across all liens is 5.5x fiscal 2017 operating revenue. Upcoming
capital needs include improvements to the water resource recovery facility ($238 million), collection system infrastructure ($143
million), and general purpose, metering, and central services ($148 million). In addition to financing these improvements with reserves
and surplus revenue, GLWA plans to issue approximately $354 million in revenue bonds and $34 million in junior lien SRF loans over
the next five years. The increase in debt will be offset by the amount of outstanding principal paid down over the next five years.
Though we expect the system's debt burden will remain high, sustained revenue growth would make leverage less of a credit challenge
going forward.
DEBT STRUCTURE

GLWA's rate covenant requires net revenue coverage of debt service equal to 120% for senior lien bonds, 110% for second lien bonds
and 100% for any subordinate lien debt. Senior and second lien bonds benefit from debt service reserve funds (DSRF) sized at the lesser
of the standard three-pronged test. As of July 1, 2018, approximately 24% and 42%, respectively, of the senior and second lien DSRF
requirements are satisfied with cash. The balances of each are satisfied with various surety or insurance policies.
With the exception of the outstanding Series 2006D senior lien bonds, all debt paid from net sewer revenue is fixed rate. The Series
2006D bonds are floating rate notes and make up a modest 7% of total debt paid by sewer revenue.
DEBT-RELATED DERIVATIVES

GLWA is not party to any derivative agreements associated with its pledge of net sewer revenue.
PENSIONS AND OPEB

Current employees of GLWA are participants in a defined contribution benefit plan, though many are scheduled to receive accrued
pension benefits from the City of Detroit's frozen defined benefit General Retirement System (GRS). Pursuant to the City of Detroit's
bankruptcy settlement, GLWA will contribute $45.4 million annually to GRS through fiscal 2023 to accelerate amortization of the GRS

unfunded liability associated with GLWA employees. The sewer enterprise's share of the annual GLWA payment to GRS will be $25.9
million, or approximately 4.3% of fiscal 2017 gross revenue, not inclusive of operating revenue from DWSD pledged to debt service.
Less than of the annual GRS payment is considered O&M and senior to debt service.
Beyond 2023, GLWA's payments to GRS will be based on the actuarial needs of the plan and sized to amortize any unfunded liability
associated with GLWA employees. GLWA makes no payments towards accrued retiree healthcare liabilities as the City of Detroit's
bankruptcy settlement eliminated those benefits. GLWA established a new defined contribution retiree healthcare savings plan,
resulting in no potential unfunded liability.
Management and governance: management works to sustain regional cooperation
The management of GLWA has made strides in enhancing operational efficiencies and regional cooperations since its formation.
To that end GLWA dramatically right-sized its work force, reducing full time employees by over 1,000 over the past several years.
Additionally, management's master planning process has focused on leveraging the entire region's existing infrastructure to more
efficiently address wet weather events, utilizing more green technology, and evaluating resource recovery options and energy reduction
opportunities. Rate structure adjustments and payment assistance to low-income retail customers should support revenue stability.
Additionally, the number of wholesale model contracts entered into points to increased regional collaboration.

Long Term Rating

Rationale
S&P Global Ratings has assigned its 'A+' rating to the Great Lakes Water Authority, Mich.'s (GLWA) series 2018 water
supply system refunding second-lien bonds. We have also raised our ratings on the authority's existing senior-lien
bonds three notches to 'AA-' from 'A-' and their existing second lien bonds to 'A+' from 'BBB+'. The outlook is stable.
The upgrade is based on several factors:
• Oversight through an agency relationship and cooperation with the Detroit Water and Sewer Department (DWSD)
and its governing Board of Water Commissioners that we view as strong and supportive of credit quality. Because of
Detroit's economy that we view as very weak and historical collections/bad debt issues, we view both the existence
and continuation of these functions as key to the maintenance of the rating at its current level.
• Overall management and governance functions that we also view as supportive of credit quality at the current rating
level. GLWA management maintains active communication with both the DWSD retail system and its wholesale
customers and has a comprehensive set of internal policies related to, among other things, maintenance of certain
financial targets, key performance indicators for both financial and operational metrics, and internal controls.
• Actual financial performance has continued to exceed projections from prior feasibility studies. Now that GLWA has
two full fiscal years (2017 and 2018) of operating as a separate entity from DWSD, and that various reconciliations
and adjustments related to the separation have already taken place, we would expect that future variances to the
feasibility studies may not be as dramatic. However, given GLWA's comprehensive budgeting practices and strong
budgetary oversight of DWSD's operations, we would expect that future financial performance should be largely
consistent with the most current projections.
• GLWA is not under any regulatory-driven capital costs from consent orders or consent decrees. While we view the
GLWA system as highly leveraged, the fact that all of the capital plan is forward-looking and not mostly being used
to cure regulatory infractions is a key credit strength that is supportive of the current rating level.
• Limited future exposure to pension cost escalation from legacy Detroit obligations resulting from prior bankruptcy
negotiations. It is our understanding that after the 2023 fiscal year, both GLWA and DWSD pension costs related to
legacy pension plans will drop from a total for both water and sewer systems of $45.4 million (which is a mandated
contribution based on Detroit's bankruptcy plan of adjustment) to what is currently projected to be no more than
$9.1 million. These additional payments would be used to retire the remaining unfunded liability from the

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 5, 2018 2

 Great Lakes Water Authority, Michigan; Water/Sewer

closed/legacy pension plans that has arisen after the original payments were determined in 2014.
Additional factors supporting the rating include the following:
• A diverse revenue stream from a large number of wholesale customers;
• Revenues from both wholesale customers and the DWSD retail system that are mostly fixed, which, in our view,
significantly insulate GLWA's financial performance from volatility caused by weather and flow variances.
Offsetting these strengths is Detroit's economy, which we consider very weak and which could continue to place
downward pressure on utility collection rates in the city, and high system leverage, that we do not believe will abate
significantly at least over the two-year outlook horizon.
The ratings also reflect the application of our wholesale utility criteria, but we do not follow a purely weak-link
approach since GLWA has, in our view, additional financial strengths that could be used to support debt payments if a
single participant does not fulfil its payment obligations. These strengths include pledged reserves and unrestricted
liquidity available at the wholesaler GLWA level; the ability to adjust revenue requirements to participants as its cost
structure changes; and strong management policies related to both the regional system and Detroit's local system. The
fact that GLWA's service base is large and serves a large percentage of the state's population also supports our view
that the ratings should reflect that diversity, with overall economic considerations playing a more prominent role in the
credit analysis.

Details Of Legal Framework Relevant To The Credit Rating
The bonds are secured by a statutory lien on pledged assets of the system, prioritized by the lien status, which include
net revenues of GLWA's water supply system, along with investments credited to the water supply and earnings on
those investments. The net revenue pledge is constituted from gross revenues of the DWSD retail and the GLWA
regional systems, which cover both systems' operating and maintenance (O&M) expenses. A rate covenant stipulates
that the GLWA board set rates to produce at least 1.2x coverage of senior-lien debt, 1.1x for second-lien bonds, and 1x
for junior-lien bonds. The ability to issue additional bonds exists if net revenues for the previous fiscal year, or net
revenues adjusted by approved rate increases and system expansion for the current or next fiscal year, produce
coverage of maximum annual debt service (MADS; including the proposed bonds) of at least those levels indicated in
the rate covenant for the particular liens.
There is also a debt service reserve (DSR) for senior-lien bonds equal to MADS or the lesser of the standard
three-prong test, and for second-lien bonds equal to MADS or the lesser of the standard three-prong test. On achieving
approval from at least 51% of senior- and second-lien bondholders and having appropriate senior-lien ratings from at
least two credit rating agencies no lower than 'AA-' or the equivalent, GLWA, through amendments to the master bond
ordinance (MBO), has the option to eliminate this reserve requirement on its outstanding and future bonds on any lien
for which approval has been granted. If this proposed amendment is approved, we currently view the effects as credit
neutral; however, our criteria methodology would indicate that if credit quality deteriorated, the importance of a DSR
becomes a more important credit factor by providing immediate additional liquidity pledged to bondholders. To date,

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 5, 2018 3

 Great Lakes Water Authority, Michigan; Water/Sewer

GLWA has achieved bondholder approval for this amendment from about 33% and 58% of senior- and second-lien
bondholders, respectively.
The statutory lien on pledged assets is well established by state statute under Act 94 of 1933 (as amended).
Under the GLWA master bond ordinance, U.S. Bank N.A. is the trustee.
We view the numerous oversight and control functions that GLWA has over Detroit's retail system as supportive of
both the overall legal framework and the ability of the GLWA regional system to help make the net revenues
originating from Detroit's local system more predictable, which in turn results in an analysis that focuses more on this
framework as opposed to one that benchmarks the rating specifically on our view of DWSD's creditworthiness. The
primary three documents that place parameters around this operating relationship between the two entities are the
water and sewer lease agreements, and both a service agreement and memorandum of understanding (MOU) between
GLWA and the Detroit retail system.
The major provisions of both lease agreements that we view as supportive of the overall legal and operational
framework include the following:
• Explicit language that requires all revenues collected by Detroit be held in segregated accounts in trust and remitted
within five days of receipt to a trustee-held pledged revenue account under the master bond ordinance.
• Requirements that both GLWA and Detroit retail maintain a biennial budget and a five-year capital improvement

• GLWA has the exclusive and direct right to establish all rates and charges, including the retail users within Detroit

Detroit will set retail rates in a fashion that meets GLWA's revenue requirement.
• All responsibilities for discharge permit and other environmental compliance requirements are explicitly allocated
between Detroit retail and GLWA.
• DWSD is required to submit periodic budget and operational reporting requirements to GLWA and discuss these
results at a Reconciliation Committee, which is also the initial mechanism to develop a plan for DWSD to cure any
budget shortfalls it experiences.

 Great Lakes Water Authority, Michigan; Water/Sewer

Economic Conditions And Customer Base
GLWA's water system serves a large population of about 3.8 million across Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties,
which covers about 30% of Michigan's population.
We consider Detroit's economy very weak, but the revenue base for both water and sewer is well diversified
geographically beyond the city limits. The large amount of inactive accounts in Detroit exacerbates the need for
ongoing collection efforts and could affect the large amount of accounts receivable. Management is actively working to
lower its uncollectible accounts, but 48% of Detroit retail accounts are inactive, which we view as a significant number.
We note, however, that collections efforts have increased, in our view, since GLWA was formed in 2016, including the
introduction of payment plans and GLWA's water residential assistance program (WRAP) for low-income residents.
Looking at the metropolitan area as a whole, however, average economic indicators are much better, with median
household effective buying income at 98% of the U.S. average, and according the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the
city of Detroit's annual average unemployment rate was under 10% for 2017, the first time since 2001. We believe the
metrics for a regional utility indicate a better overall economic base for the service area than looking at the city's
economic indicators alone.
A weakening of economic metrics could weaken the credit rating, especially if this were to occur on a more regional
scale. A general regional weakening economy would lessen the positive effects that the more diversified revenue and
customer base has had on the rating profile.

Rate Structure And Collection Issues
The implementation of model contracts and moving wholesale customers' revenue requirements to a higher level of
fixed-cost recovery, is, in our view, a credit strength because it will help prevent revenue fluctuations based on
metered flow and will help stabilize revenue collections. Management has also maintained a wholesale customer
outreach program since 1997.
Management is committed to moderate annual service charge increases intended to produce a 4% increase in overall
annual revenues, instead of the wide swings in rates in the past. We understand it is hoping to achieve this through
additional recovery of fixed costs, continued cost reductions, labor force reductions, and the use of cash for capital
when appropriate.
A credit weakness is the large amount of past due and inactive accounts in Detroit. DWSD management has a
dedicated shut-off program that has been implemented by an outside contractor, although meaningful results will take
time, in our view. One benchmark we will look at is overall budget variances for the DWSD local system as one
indication of the progress DWSD is making on collection efforts.

SEPTEMBER 5, 2018 5

 Great Lakes Water Authority, Michigan; Water/Sewer

Finances And Liquidity
The historical DWSD financial performance has been somewhat volatile, in our view, due primarily to changes in billed
versus budgeted volumes and exacerbated by economic stress. Still, in most years, each system has been able to
generate net revenues that cover fixed costs by at least 1x.
For GLWA, our fixed-charge coverage analysis generally follows the presentation in GLWA's MBO calculation for
junior-lien debt service coverage, with additional revenue offsets due to pension payments made to Detroit for its
frozen general retirement system expenses and additional fixed costs due to pension note payments made to Detroit
for its B and C note payments. Our calculation focuses on how net revenues are covering all of GLWA's fixed costs
instead of reporting coverage based on MBO definitions of operating and nonoperating expenses. We generally view
the historical fixed-charge coverage as adequate to good, with the expectation that coverage will steadily improve due
to the implementation of fixed cost recovery rates and various management initiatives.
Liquidity of the system has fluctuated, but has generally stayed at levels we would consider good. Projections show a
steady unrestricted liquidity position through 2023 of about $166 million, which takes into account operating reserves,
budget stabilization, emergency repair, and improvement and extension fund balances. Because the MBO allows for
any monies in these funds to be used for either O&M expense requirements or debt service shortfalls, we view them as
unrestricted liquidity.

Capital And Debt
The size and scope of the CIP are credit neutral. We expect that capital costs will continue to be distributed between
Detroit's retail system and the regional system as appropriate, and in a manner consistent with the lease and service
agreements' allocate costs.
The water system is highly leveraged (especially since 2012, when DWSD issued bonds to refund its variable-rate debt
portfolio and to terminate its swaps). We do not expect this condition to abate in the near term and generally view the
debt profile as a credit weakness. Debt service also represents about 100% of O&M expenses, and we do not see this
number falling in the near future since additional debt is layered in to fund the CIP.

Outlook
The stable outlook reflects our opinion that the rating should not change, at least over the two-year outlook horizon,
due to several factors, including the following:
• Our expectation that the water supply system's financial metrics should remain at levels generally consistent with
current projections due to the rate structure that provides a large amount of revenue stability;
• DWSD revenue variances should remain low, given both GLWA's and DWSD's continued efforts to improve
collections; and
• Exposure to a large service base that extends beyond the boundaries of the immediate Detroit area, which should

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 5, 2018 6

help continue to support stable usage trends.

Upside scenario
While possible, we currently do not expect to raise the rating in the foreseeable future, absent both financial
performance well above what current projections indicate and economic indicators for Detroit that show significant
improvement. We believe that both current and projected financial performance and service base characteristics are
consistent with the current rating level.

Downside scenario
If economic stress or cost escalations lead to financial results measurably worse than that GLWA currently projects,
then either the outlook, rating, or both could be negatively affected.

Long Term Rating

Rationale
S&P Global Ratings has assigned its 'A+' rating to the Great Lakes Water Authority's (GLWA) series 2018 sewage
disposal system revenue and revenue refunding senior-lien bonds. We have also raised our ratings by two notches on
both GLWA's existing senior-lien bonds to 'A+' from 'A-' and its existing second-lien bonds to 'A' from 'BBB+'. The
outlook is positive.
The upgrade is based on several factors:
• Oversight through an agency relationship and cooperation with the Detroit Water and Sewer Board (DWSD) and its
Board of Water Commissioners that we view as strong and supportive of credit quality. Because of Detroit's
extremely weak overall economic indicators and historical collections/bad debt issues, we view both the existence
and continuation of these functions as key to the maintenance of the rating at its current level.
• Overall management and governance functions that we also view as supportive of credit quality at the current rating
level. GLWA management maintains active communication with both the DWSD retail system and its wholesale
customers and has a comprehensive set of internal policies related to, among other things, maintenance of certain
financial targets, key performance indicators for both financial and operational metrics, and internal controls.
• Actual financial performance has continued to exceed projections from prior feasibility studies. Now that GLWA has
two full fiscal years (2017 and 2018) of operating as a separate entity from DWSD, and that various reconciliations
and adjustments related to the separation have already taken place, we would expect that future variances to the
feasibility studies may not be as dramatic. However, given GLWA's comprehensive budgeting practices and strong
budgetary oversight of DWSD's operations, we would expect that future financial performance should be largely
consistent with the most current projections.
• GLWA is not under any regulatory-driven capital costs from consent orders or consent decrees. While we view the
GLWA system as highly leveraged, the fact that all of the capital plan is forward-looking and not mostly being used
to cure regulatory infractions is a key credit strength that is supportive of the current rating level.

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 5, 2018 2

 Great Lakes Water Authority, Michigan; Water/Sewer

• Limited future exposure to pension cost escalation from legacy Detroit obligations resulting from prior bankruptcy
negotiations. It is our understanding that after the 2023 fiscal year, both GLWA and DWSD pension costs related to
legacy pension plans will drop from a total for both water and sewer systems of $45.4 million (which is a mandated
contribution based on Detroit's bankruptcy plan of adjustment) to what is currently projected to be no more than
$9.1 million. These additional payments would be used to retire the remaining unfunded liability from the
closed/legacy pension plans that has arisen after the original payments were determined in 2014.
Additional factors supporting the rating include the following:
• A diverse revenue stream from a large number of wholesale customers;
• Revenues from both wholesale customers and the DWSD retail system that are fixed, which, in our view,
significantly insulates GLWA's financial performance from volatility caused by weather and flow variances.
Offsetting these strengths are the following factors:
• Ongoing negative revenue variances from the DWSD local sewer system that have, in our view, material effects on
the overall creditworthiness of the GLWA sewage disposal system. GLWA reports that the negative revenue
variance caused by DWSD for the 2018 fiscal year is about $19.8 million. The authority has also experienced
significant negative and positive outflows in the DWSD system since 2016 due to various one-time events, although
GLWA reports that the 2018 variance was most likely attributable to DWSD's implementation of a new drainage
program and related litigation.
• We consider Detroit's economy very weak, which could continue to place downward pressure on utility collection
rates in the city, and high system leverage, that we do not believe will abate significantly at least over the two-year
outlook horizon.
The ratings also reflect the application of our wholesale utility criteria, but we do not follow a purely weak-link
approach since GLWA has, in our view, additional financial strengths that could be used to support debt payments if a
single participant does not fulfil its payment obligations. These strengths include pledged reserves and unrestricted
liquidity available at the wholesaler GLWA level; the ability to adjust revenue requirements to participants as its cost
structure changes; and strong management policies related to both the regional system and Detroit's local system. The
fact that GLWA's service base is large and serves a large percentage of the state's population also supports our view
that the ratings should reflect that diversity, with overall economic considerations playing a more prominent role in the
credit analysis.

Legal Framework Details Relevant To The Credit Rating
The bonds are secured by a statutory lien on pledged assets of the system, prioritized by the lien status, which include
net revenues of GLWA's sewage disposal system, along with investments credited to the sewer system and earnings on
those investments. The net revenue pledge is constituted from gross revenues of the DWSD retail and the GLWA
regional systems, which cover both systems' operating and maintenance (O&M) expenses. A rate covenant stipulates
that the GLWA board set rates to produce at least 1.2x coverage of senior-lien debt, 1.1x for second-lien bonds, and 1x
for junior-lien bonds. The ability to issue additional bonds exists if net revenues for the previous fiscal year, or net

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

SEPTEMBER 5, 2018 3

 Great Lakes Water Authority, Michigan; Water/Sewer

revenues adjusted by approved rate increases and system expansion for the current or next fiscal year, produce
coverage of maximum annual debt service (MADS; including the proposed bonds) of at least those levels indicated in
the rate covenant for the particular liens.
There is also a debt service reserve (DSR) for senior-lien bonds equal to MADS or the lesser of the standard
three-prong test, and for second-lien bonds equal to average annual debt service or the lesser of the three-prong test.
On achieving approval from at least 51% of senior- and second-lien bondholders and having appropriate senior-lien
ratings from two credit rating agencies no lower than 'AA-' or the equivalent, GLWA, through amendments to the
master bond ordinance (MBO), has the option to eliminate this reserve requirement on its outstanding and future
bonds on any lien for which approval has been granted. If this proposed amendment is approved, we currently view
the effects as credit neutral; however, our criteria methodology would indicate that if credit quality deteriorated, the
importance of a DSR becomes a more important credit factor by providing immediate additional liquidity pledged to
bondholders. To date, GLWA has achieved bondholder approval for this amendment from about 7% and 39% of
senior- and second-lien bondholders, respectively.
The statutory lien on pledged assets is well established by state statute under Act 94 of 1933 (as amended).
Under the GLWA master bond ordinance, U.S. Bank N.A. is the trustee.
We view the numerous oversight and control functions that GLWA has over Detroit's retail system as supportive of
both the overall legal framework and the ability of the GLWA regional system to help make the net revenues
originating from Detroit's local system more predictable, which in turn results in an analysis that focuses more on this
framework as opposed to one that benchmarks the rating specifically on our view of DWSD's creditworthiness. The
primary three documents that place parameters around this operating relationship between the two entities are the
water and sewer lease agreements, and both a service agreement and memorandum of understanding (MOU) between
GLWA and the Detroit retail system.
The major provisions of both lease agreements that we view as supportive of the overall legal and operational
framework include the following:
• Explicit language that requires all revenues collected by Detroit be held in segregated accounts in trust and remitted
within five days of receipt to a trustee-held pledged revenue account under the master bond ordinance.
• Requirements that both GLWA and Detroit retail maintain a biennial budget and a five-year capital improvement
plan (CIP).
• In consideration of a lease payment from GLWA for use by the Detroit local system, the use of those funds are
restricted to either repayment of debt or capital projects.
• GLWA has the exclusive and direct right to establish all rates and charges, including the retail users within Detroit
(although through the service agreement, GLWA delegates its right to set rates to DWSD).
• All vendor and employee contracts related to GLWA operations are assigned to the authority.
The major provisions of the service agreement and MOU that we view as supportive of the overall legal and
operational framework include the following:

• If certain performance standards are not met, GLWA can revoke its appointment of Detroit as its agent for
collections of revenue requirements.
• GLWA will set revenue requirements for DWSD that are related to the costs for providing services, and, in turn,
Detroit will set retail rates in a fashion that meets GLWA's revenue requirement.
• All responsibilities for discharge permit and other environmental compliance requirements are explicitly allocated
between Detroit retail and GLWA.
• DWSD is required to submit periodic budget and operational reporting requirements to GLWA and discuss these
results at a Reconciliation Committee, which is also the initial mechanism to develop a plan for DWSD to cure any
budget shortfalls it experiences.
• The service agreement has an explicit mechanism for dispute resolution.

Economic Conditions And Customer Base
GLWA's sewer system serves a large population of about 2.8 million across Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties,
which covers about 30% of Michigan's population.
We consider Detroit's economy very weak, but the revenue base for both water and sewer is well diversified
geographically beyond the city limits. The large amount of inactive accounts in Detroit exacerbates the need for
ongoing collection efforts and could affect the large amount of accounts receivable. Management is actively working to
lower its uncollectible accounts, but 48% of Detroit retail accounts are inactive, which we view as a significant number.
We note, however, that collections efforts have increased, in our view, since GLWA was formed in 2016, including the
introduction of payment plans and GLWA's water residential assistance program (WRAP) for low-income residents.
Looking at the metropolitan area as a whole, however, average economic indicators are much better, with median
household effective buying income at 98% of the U.S. average, and according the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the

metrics for a regional utility indicate a better overall economic base for the service area than looking at the city's

A weakening of economic metrics could weaken the credit rating, especially if this were to occur on a more regional
scale. A general regional weakening economy would lessen the positive effects that the more diversified revenue and
customer base has had on the rating profile.

revenues, instead of the wide swings in rates in the past. We understand it is hoping to achieve this through
implementation of fixed-cost recovery, continued cost reductions, labor force reductions, and the use of cash for
capital when appropriate.
A credit weakness is the large amount of past due and inactive accounts in Detroit. DWSD management has a

budget stabilization, emergency repair, and improvement and extension fund balances. Because the MBO allows for
any monies in these funds to be used for either O&M expense requirements or debt service shortfalls, we view them as
unrestricted liquidity.

Capital And Debt
The size and scope of the CIP are credit neutral. We expect that capital costs will continue to be distributed between
Detroit's retail system and the regional system as appropriate, and in a manner consistent with the lease and service
agreements' allocate costs.
The sewer system is highly leveraged (especially since 2012, when DWSD issued bonds to refund its variable-rate debt
portfolio and to terminate its swaps). We do not expect this condition to abate in the near term and generally view the
debt profile as a credit weakness. Debt service also represents over 80% of O&M expenses, and we do not see this
number falling in the near future since additional debt is layered in to fund the CIP.

Outlook
The positive outlook reflects our expectation that there is at least a one-in-three chance that the rating could improve
over the two-year outlook horizon. The most significant factor we are expecting to lead to an upgrade is resolution of
what we view to be significant revenue variances caused by the DWSD local system. It is our understanding that
progress is being made to resolve these variances, but there could be ongoing revenue pressures depending on how
the drainage program litigation is resolved.
For an upgrade to occur over the next two years, we would also expect the following to occur:
• Continued financial performance that meets or exceeds GLWA's expectations as reflected in the current feasibility
study;
• No large and unforeseen capital needs that would cause either large and sustained reductions in liquidity or
significant increases in fixed costs; and
• Continued demonstration that the relationship with DWSD through the service agreement and MOU is being
successfully used to minimize any future financial disruptions that may occur.

Downside scenario
While the outlook is currently positive, we could revise it to stable without raising the rating if we believe that a
resolution with DWSD related to its ongoing revenue variances is not settled in a fashion that is either sustainable long
term or able to achieve a significant amount of variance reduction. If economic stress or cost escalations lead to
financial results measurably worse than that GLWA currently projects, then either the outlook, rating, or both could be
negatively affected.
