294145 INDEPENDENT REPORT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 6, 2008 from Maria Pappas, Cook
County Treasurer:

Submitting herewith a copy of the Independent Auditor?s Report of the financial
statements of the Cook County Treasurer?s Office as of November 30, 2007 and
2006.

*Referred to the Audit Committee on May 20, 2008.

Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to receive and file
Communication Number 294145. The motion carried.

295908 CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT, Transmitting a communication, dated August
18, 2008, by Dorothy Brown, Clerk of the Circuit Court:

Please find the submitted Fiscal Year 2007 Independent Auditor Report, which
includes the Report of Independent Accountants on Compliance and Internal
Controls for the Of?ce of the Clerk of the Circuit Court. Please accept this report
and refer it to the Cook County Audit Committee for review.

Referred to the Audit Committee on September 3, 2008.
Commissioner Gorman asked if the report contained any ?ndings.

Laura Burman, Cook County Auditor, replied that one finding is detailed on page 36. The
auditors observed unreconciled differences in liability accounts. The differences are being
rectified.

Chairman Daley asked for a further explanation regarding management?s statement that a staff
shortage is the reason why the Clerk of the Circuit Court was not able to reconcile the
discrepancies between general ledgers and auxiliary Iedgers.

Wasiu Fashina, Chief Financial Officer, Clerk of the Circuit Court, stated the 40 budgeted
positions in the Accounting Bookkeeping division for Fiscal Year 2008 are not all Certified
Public Accountant positions. The ledger discrepancy problem goes back many years, and has
proven dIfl? cult to solve. Staff must go to the record storage warehouse to locate old
documents. They will continue working on this problem.

Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to receive and file
Communication Number 295908. The motion carried.

296224 COOK HEALTH FACILITIES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FISCAL
YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2007. Transmitting a Communication, dated
September 15, 2008 from Donna L. Dunnings, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of
Finance:

Subject: Health FaCiIities Financial Statements for the
Fiscal Year ended November 30, 2007

Submitting herewith a copy of Cook County?s Health Facilities Financial Statements
for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007, prepared by the Cook County Bureau
of Health Services and audited by Deloitte Touche, LLP. Respectfully request
that the report be referred to the Cook County Board?s Audit Committee for further
consideration. 

*Referred to the Audit Committee on September 17, 2008.

Chairman Daley informed the Committee that this report is also before the Audit Committee of
the Cook County Health and Hospitals System Board.

Commissioner Goslin asked for an explanation about the statistics showing a decline in the
number of patients who were using Cook County health services in 2007.

David Small, Interim Chief Executive Of?cer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System,
replied that after the Board of Commissioners approved a substantially reduced budget for the
system at that time, the resulting cutback in services caused the decline in patient census
numbers. He further observed that average length of hOSpital stays is declining as part of a
national trend.

John Morales, Cook County Comptroller, discussed ongoing efforts to improve the reporting
capability of the JD Edwards financial management system. It is his belief that the software is
not being utilized to its fullest capacity in the Health and Hospital System. To improve the
program may require an additional cost.

Commissioner Collins said she is reluctant to approve any more spending on technology-related
initiatives until cost savings from previous projects are documented.

Vice Chairman Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to receive and file
Communication Number 296224. The motion carried.

296225 COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT (CAFR) FOR THE FISCAL
YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2007. Transmitting a Communication, dated

request that the report be referred to the Cook County Board?s Audit Committee for
further consideration. 

Referred to the Audit Committee on September 17, 2008.

Chairman Daley stated the Management Letter that traditionally accompanies the CAFR is not
complete, and therefore it may be appropriate to defer this matter.

Ms. Dunnings replied the Management Letter will be complete by October 15, 2008.

Vice Chairman Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved to defer
consideration of Communication Number 296225. The motion carried.

296226 COOK COUNTY ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED
NOVEMBER 30, 2007. Transmitting a Communication, dated September 15, 2008

OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY
October 9, 2008

Honorable John P. Daley

Chairman, Committee on Finance
Cook County Board of Commissioners
118 North Clark Street Room 567
Chicago, Illinois 60602

Dear Chairman Daley:

Thank you for your questions regarding the Clerk of the Circuit Court FY 2007 Independent Audit Report.
Following are our responses to your questions:

1. ?0n Report J, Part II, (pg 11) the statement of operating costs is left blank due to audit
guidelines that do not require its completion. We request that your office complete this
worksheet on a voluntary basis??

The original draft of the Report J, part 1, (pg ll), statement of operating cost submitted by our sta? to the
auditor, Prado Renteria, was ?lled out completely. However, the auditor decided to leave it blank due to
audit guidelines that do not require its completion. Attached herewith (see Exhibit A), is a completed
worksheet.

2. ?Please provide a status update regarding your efforts to reconcile discrepancies between the
general ledger and detailed supporting schedules. Include the current cumulative total of
unidentified differences. (pg. 

As of 10/6/08, our Office has remitted a total amount of $477,070.74 to the Cook County Comptroller. The
amount represents the reconciliation of the civil, tra?ic and criminal accounts (see Exhibit C). The current
cumulative total of un- reconciled accounts is approximately $1 million, representing tra?c accounts in
Suburban Districts. Our Comptroller has assigned additional staff working overtime, to help recreate the
supporting documentation necessary to reconcile these accounts.

3. ?Your office has cited staff shortages as the reason you have not successfully reconciled the
above referenced discrepancies. The General Accounting Bookkeeping office had 45
positions in 2003, 43 in 2006, and is currently budgeted for 40. Please explain why the current
staffing levels are inadequate for the work required??

Please note that out of the forty employees that are budgeted in the General Accounting Bookkeeping
department, only six, Accountant 1 (see Exhibit D) are responsible for the reconciliation of 42 bank
accounts. bank reconciliation has to be completed in a timely manner in order to remit revenue to the
Office of the Cook County Treasurer timely. Hence, these accountants have been working on the un?reconciled
accounts before or after working hours. However, our Comptroller has assigned additional sta? to support the
accountants in order to expedite the reconciliation. The remaining employees budgeted in the General
Accounting Bookkeeping Department are assigned to the Field Audit Unit in the suburban districts, 26m 
California and the various divisions in Municipal One. In addition, some of the remaining employees are
assigned to the Returned Checks unit and Account Receivables/Investment Department. Please note that the
process necessary to reconcile these accounts is highly labor intensive. To facilitate this process, boxes of
yellow receipt tapes must be ordered from the warehouse. We must go through all the boxes prior to FY2000
containing ?nancial records at the warehouse, since we do not know the year or period the liabilities represent.

Honorable John P. Daley

Chairman, Cook County Audit Committee
118 North Clark Street, Fl 3M

Chicago, Illinois 60602

Dear Chairman Daley:

Pursuant to your letter dated October 8, 2008 regarding issues raised by the Treasurer?s
FY2007 Independent Auditors Report discussed at the Audit Committee's October 8,
2008 meeting, please note our responses below:

1. ?Do you project that any surplus above $5 million in the Unknown Heirs Fund
will be available for escheatment into the county general funds during ?scal
year 2009? If so, what is your estimate of that amount?"

The Unknown Heirs Fund balance increases or decreases based on receipt by
the Treasurer's Of?ce of adjudicated court orders. As the Treasurer?s Of?ce
is unable to anticipate the ?ling and adjudication of court cases that would
result in receipts or payouts within the fUnd, we are unable to estimate a
fund balance as of November 30, 2008. The balance in the Unknown Heirs
Fund as of October 8, 2008 is $8,453,740.59.

2. ?Do you project that there will be a surplus in excess of $2 million in the
Indemnity Judgment Fund for Fiscal Year 2009? If so, what amount will be
paid to the County Comptroller?"

As with the Unknown Heirs Fund, payouts from the Tax Sale Indemnity Fund
are based on adjudicated court orders. As the Treasurer's Of?ce is unable to
anticipate the ?ling and adjudication of court cases that would result in
payouts from the fund, the Treasurer's Of?ce is unable to estimate a fund
balance as of November 30, 2008. The balance in the Tax Sale Indemnity
Fund as of October 8, 2008 is $2,313,554.32.

118 North Clark Street, Room 567

Dear Chairman Daley:

This letter is in response to your question regarding the Federal Equitable Sharing
Program Audit Report.

1. The reported interest rate on funds held in the Federal Equitable Sharing account
is What is the current rate on this account? (pg. 5)

Answer: The current interest rate on funds held in the Federal Equitable Sharing
account is 3.04%

2. Please provide justi?cation for expenditures of State Equitable Sharing funds on
salaries, despite a recommendation to the contrary from the State Police. (pg. 7)

Answer: State Equitable Sharing Guidelines do not require State Police approval to
utilize funds. Past practice in the Sheriff?s Of?ce was to request an opinion from the
State Police as to whether or not a speci?c purchase was permissible under the State
Equitable Sharing Guidelines. When the request was made the State recommended
against using the funds to pay for salaries and bene?ts, because we could not sustain
this special fund on a long term basis, based on the annual amounts of monies we
received. We were aware of this and these positions were absorbed into the Police
Department in Fiscal Year 2008.

MEMORANDU 
TO: Chairman John P. Daley, Audit Committee
FROM: Rupert F. Graham, Jr., P.E., Superintendent W9 
DATE: October 14, 2008

SUBJECT: MFT Fund Audit Committee Questionnaire Responses

 

The following is in response to the issues raised by the Audit Committee's
October 8, 2008 meeting:

Q1. IS the transfer of monies from the Motor Fuel Fund to the Public Safety
Fund a permitted use?

A1. The monies ($34,500,000) [from the Motor Fuel Tax Fund to the Public
Safety Fund are transferred by a resolution approved and adopted by the
Board of Cook County Commissioners. Such a transfer ocCurS once in the
County?s fiscal year and is a revenue source in the Public Safety Fund
budget. The use of the Motor Fuel Tax Fund monies by the Public Safety
Fund is permitted by the Article 5, Division 7, Section 5-701.10 of the
Illinois Highway Code, as amended (605 ILCS SIS-701.10 (1993)). The
Illinois Compiled Statute states, ?Any county board in counties
of 1,000,000 or more inhabitants may also use any motor fuel tax money
allotted to it for the purpose of paying any and all expenditures resulting
from the activities conducted by the circuit court located in the 

02. Please explain calculation of a $338 million negative balance in the
obligated account.

A2. The Illinois Department of Transportation calculates the obligated account
balance by subtracting the unobligated account balance from the cash
account balance as submitted by the Highway Department. Since the

. unobligated account balance is larger than the cash account balance, the
obligated account balance iS negative. The cash account balance is the

A3.

amount of unspent MFT funds at the reporting time although most of the
unspent funding is encumbered towards ongoing construction projects.

The Highway Department has met with IDOT since this report was
generated to clarify the misunderstanding in terminology. The Highway
Department reports all funds being spent on projects and all transfers of
funds between the MFT Fund and the General Fund. However, IDOT does
not record the spending or authorize the spending until the project is
closed. Compounding this problem is the fact that IDOT has not

conducted a comprehensive audit of the County?s MFT Fund for past 16
years.

IDOT is stating in the report that transfers such as payments on interest,
transfers to the Public Safety Fund and the Illinois First Fund were
unrecorded by IDOT although they acknowledge the exact amounts of all
those transfers in their report. In those cases, IDOT says we could clarify
those transfers by a letter from the Highway Department along with some
supporting documentation. This action will decrease the unobligated
account balance thereby lowering the deficit in the obligated account
balance. Further reduction in the unobligated account balance will be the

result of the project closing plan as described in our response to question
3.

IDOT assigned a full time on-site auditor for the auditing of the County?s
MFT Fund account through 1992 when the last comprehensive audit
report Was generated. After that year, no comprehensive audit of the MFT
Fund was conducted. The accuracy of the County?s MFT Fund accounting
has never been questioned. Thereafter, IDOT limited the auditing scope to
