So as you can see on the projector,

this meeting is part of a broader timeline in

starting proposed school actions, and as a part
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 10, 2018
Page 6

of this process, CPS began publishing draft

2

guidelines or -- yeah, draft guidelines and

3

school actions on October 1st and then announced

4

proposed school actions on December 1st.

5

followed months of community engagement and

6

input.

7

This

Following this announcement, CPS

8

sent its (inaudible) posts to community meetings

9

and one public hearing to gather additional

10

public feedback, and after the meetings and

11

hearings, we will review all input.

12

CEO Jackson may make a recommendation to the

13

board to vote on the proposed action.

14

the potential recommendation, the board will

15

vote on whether or not to approve the proposed

16

action at the February board meeting.

After this

Following

17

So, as an overview of the proposed

18

school action, CPS is proposing to adjust -- or

19

the community is (inaudible) proposing to adjust

20

the Haugan attendance area grades served to

21

include 7th grade in the 2018-19 school year,

22

which is next year, adjust the Haugan -- that's

23

supposed to be Henry.

24

attendance area grades served to include -- no.

Adjust the Henry

TOOMEY REPORTING

 January 10, 2018
Page 7

Haugan attendance area grades served to include

2

8th grade in the 2019-20 school year.

3

grade next year and then have both 7th and 8th

4

grade the following year.

5

So 7th

In addition, the proposals to

6

adjust the Roosevelt High School attendance area

7

currently serving 7th to 12th grade to serve

8

only 8th to 12th grade in the 2018 and '19

9

school year, and then eliminate the Roosevelt

10

High School attendance area that previously

11

served 8th grade in the 2018-19 school year so

12

that Roosevelt serves 9th to 12th grades in the

13

2019-2020 school year.

14

Here we go.

The next school action is to adjust

15

the Henry attendance area grades served to

16

include 7th grade in the 2018-19 school year and

17

then adjust the Henry attendance area grades

18

served to include 8th grade in the 2019-2020

19

school year.

20

Again, by doing this, they would

21

adjust the Roosevelt High School attendance area

22

currently serving 7th to 12th grade to serve

23

8th, 6th grade, 12th grade in the 2018-2019

24

school year and then eliminate the Roosevelt
TOOMEY REPORTING

High School attendance area that previously

2

served 8th grade in the 2018-2019 school year so

3

that Roosevelt serves 9th through 12th grade in

4

the 2019-2020 school year.

5

So to go over a little bit of

6

(inaudible) and feedback to date, prior to this

7

school year, the school communities of both

8

Henry and Haugan lobbied to expand their

9

enrollment from pre-K to 6th grade to pre-K to

10

8th grade.

11

because of the space availability, and now that

12

enrollment has stabilized, the school

13

communities have continued to voice their

14

support for expansion.

15

These requests were postponed

On October 18th, 2017, Haugan's

16

LEC, with the support of the community at large

17

requested that Haugan be allowed to offer 7th

18

grade by 2018-2019 and 8th grade by the

19

2019-2020 school year.

20

On October 25th, 2017, Henry's LEC,

21

with the support of parents and teachers,

22

renewed a request that Henry be allowed to offer

23

7th grade by the 2018-2019 school year and 8th

24

grade by the 2019 through 2020 school year.

the capability, we have the space, we have the

We already have departmental 6th

So something like that the parents
have been asking me year after year, and this is

a good time for this to happen (inaudible) to

would really, really appreciate to have our 7th

makes sense.

2

I wanted to just make a specific

3

statement to any of the families that currently

4

have students in our 7th and 8th grade program,

5

and that is that we are fully committed to make

6

sure that they have an exemplary either final

year or prior two years with us and are well

prepared for high school.

have students from Haugan apply and be part of

MR. KNISKERN:

We'll split the

4

difference so that we can help our court

reporter also be able to record and hear your

6

thoughts.

7

It will help her to record and hear.
MS. HAYSE:

Also, everybody,

8

there's an old phrase, "eat the mic."

9

you get up here, eat the mic.

10

My name is Carol Hayse.

So when

I'm a

11

retired school social worker.

12

neither for nor against this change, but I have

13

a few comments that express my concern.

I am actually

14

One is I'd like someone tonight to

15

address what impact this will have on Roosevelt

16

on -- Roosevelt teachers on Haugan and Henry and

17

those teachers.

18

that's being addressed by some speaker.

19

So I'd like the teacher impact

The other thing that concerns me

20

about this a little bit as a school social

21

worker, I know that student mobility is

22

generally -- well, in fact, is all negative.

23

Every time a student moves schools, normally

24

they lose five months to one year of
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 10, 2018
Page 18
1

instruction.

2

situation where students will feel displaced,

3

where students will feel that they have lost

4

their previous school culture.

5

hoping for that.

So I am hoping this is not that

Again, I'm just

6

And I want to tell -- for those of

7

you who don't know, I want to tell a little bit

8

of the history here.

9

retired now, but I was around when Haugan

I was around -- I'm

10

parents agitated and agitated and agitated with

11

CPS to get a middle school.

12

overcrowded.

13

school.

14

(inaudible).

15

They were so

So CPS finally built a middle

Yay.

And immediately they had to
Does anybody remember that?

Okay.

CPS has been pursuing a policy of

16

surrounding neighborhood schools with charter

17

schools, depleting the attendance at the

18

neighborhood schools and then saying, "Oh, gosh.

19

This school is underresourced.

20

close it now."

21

We're going to

So I hope that this is not that

22

situation, but I am wondering what's going to

23

happen to the enrollments at Roosevelt as a

24

result of this change and whether CPS will come
TOOMEY REPORTING

way" (inaudible) is that.

have some questions which I hope one of the

speakers will answer.

Good evening.

Right

into the mic.
My name is Kathryn Pusateri.

I am

13

a counselor at Roosevelt, and I -- I was very

14

surprised to hear about this.

15

involvement and community input did not involve

16

Roosevelt, which was unfortunate, because I

17

think that there is a lot of information that

18

parents do not have that would maybe have

19

changed their minds; things like students have

20

so many resources at Roosevelt.

21

clinic so that every student has a free dentist,

22

free doctor -- I'm sorry.

There is a

opportunity to earn high school credits while

2

they're in 7th and 8th grade, as well as

3

in-service learning that applies to their high

4

school graduation requirements.

5

are amazing.

6

of things are schools where you have to test in.

7

Very few settings for 7th and 8th graders get

8

that.

9

because nobody told us that this was happening.

These things

The only place you get these kind

And nobody needs to tell these parents

10

Unfortunate, very unfortunate,

11

because I think that when you think about 7th

12

and 8th graders, you need to think about what's

13

best for them, and -- and that's kind of hard to

14

decide without all the facts.

15

By starting in Roosevelt in 7th

16

grade, they have the opportunity to get some

17

high school credit.

18

do some of the graduation requirements, and

19

then, at the end of their six years, they

20

actually have the opportunity to do school

21

credits.

22

would really hope that 7th and 8th graders in

23

the neighborhood are able to get involved with

24

them.

They get the opportunity to

It's an amazing opportunity, and I

Brian Tomaczek.

I

9

am definitely for this change.

It will

10

definitely be beneficial to our students at

Henry.

12

I

My role as a teacher, I feel, is to

13

create a safe, comfortable atmosphere which I

14

believe makes students more susceptible to

15

learning when they feel comfortable.

16

the students at Henry have been there since

17

kindergarten and are extremely comfortable at

18

Henry, so pulling them away in 7th and 8th

19

grade, which are very important years, is

20

detrimental to their future.

21

to get these kids college ready, especially at

22

Henry, with lower personalized learning, they're

23

making huge strides and gains right now in 5th

24

and 6th grades, and it would hurt them to pull

MR. GUTIERREZ:

I know I said a few

terms of adding 7th and 8th grade.

Henry (inaudible) Henry in terms of that concern

as well.

I was at

So myself, I've been an

administrator now for 11 years.

12

experience (inaudible) a school that has

13

(inaudible) pre-K to 8, so I do have experience

14

meeting students who -- at that age.

15

there are differences in terms of their

16

maturity, their love of it.

17

I do have

I know

But I can tell you this, that once

18

you create a culture in a school where the

19

students are comfortable and safe in a learning

20

environment, that really translates into the

21

other grades, and so it's seamless from that

22

perspective.

23
24

Right now our 6th grade students -I mean, they're a treasure.

They're wonderful.

I do, obviously in the future,

state that, you know, there might be some

do work with our 6th graders very much.

5

actually teach in the 4th, 5th and 6th grade

classrooms once a month, and I think it's very

7

critical that we can welcome back our 7th and

8th grades, and we need to offer SCL support, if

we haven't already, to our 6th grade students

10

different environment and having to transition

not only once, but possibly twice into a high

the students have approached the teachers here

to share our -- give them advice.

had the same experience, I shared with them my

experiences, and I know that the students are

willing and welcome to stay here at Haugan

school to transition to high school through 8th
