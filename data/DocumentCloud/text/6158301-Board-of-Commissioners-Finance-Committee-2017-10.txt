PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT TO REPEAL THE SWEETENED BEVERAGE TAX
WHEREAS, the Sweetened Beverage Tax Ordinance was approved and adopted on November 10, 2016; and
WHEREAS, it has becoming increasingly clear that this is a regressive tax which will cause immediate and
irrevocable hardship to businesses in Cook County and put those businesses in competitive disadvantage to
businesses nearby; and
WHEREAS, the U. S. Census Bureau has reported that from July of 2015 to June of 2016 Cook County has lost
more population than any other county in the entire United States; and
WHEREAS, it has been widely reported that one of the main reasons businesses and residents are moving out of
Cook County is excessive tax regulations; and

 WHEREAS, a lawsuit has been filed questioning the constitutionality of this ordinance and Cook County may
again be forced to spend huge sums to defend a potentially unconstitutional ordinance; and
WHEREAS, Crainâ€™s has reported that a recent poll conducted by a credible organization shows that 87 percent of
Cook County residents are not in favor of the sweetened beverage tax; and
WHEREAS, although this regressive tax has only been in effect a short time, it appears that many consumers are
crossing county borders to purchase items being taxed and are also buying others items leading to an ultimate loss
of tax dollars to our neighboring counties and states; and
WHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the citizens and businesses of Cook County that this regressive tax ordinance
be repealed;
