644 Michigan War of] 812 Bicentennial Commission, request City Council to
authorize the replacement of a Historic Marker describing a War of1812
Burial Ground near the Westin Book-Cadillac.

WI

War of 1812 State of Michigan Historical Marker
Petition to the Detroit City Council
September 21, 2018

On behalf of the National Society of the Daughters of 1812-Michigan Society, the Michigan War of 1812
Bicentennial Commission the Michigan Historical Commission and LaVanway Sign Com, Inc., I am asking
the Detroit City Council to authorize the replacement of a describing a War of 1812 burial ground near the
Westin Book-Cadillac with a new marker providing a more detailed description of Detroit in the War of 1812.

The old weather?wom 1963 ?War of 1812 Dead? contains the same text on both sides. The new 2018
marker, entitled ?The War of 1812 in Detroit? on one side and ?War of 1812 Grave Site? on the other side.
This new text has been approved by all organizations participating in the project.

The old 1963 marker is located at the southwest corner of Michigan Ave. and Washington Blvd., will be
removed and destroyed, as required by the State of Michigan, the owner of the marker. The new marker will
then be installed in the Washington Blvd. median, the north side off Michigan Ave. This site, about 100?
Northeast of the 1963 marker provides an attractive setting across from the Westin Book-Cadillac and 20?
north of a statue of Alexander Macomb, a hero of the War of 1812.

The sponsoring organizations have contracted with LaVanway Sign Company, Inc., 22124 Telegraph Rd,
South?eld, MI 48033. The weather-worn 1963 needs to be replaced with a new marker that tells a more
comprehensive story of Detroit?s role in the War of 1812.

The organizations, with approval from the Detroit City Council, plan to dedicate the new marker on Sunday,

October 14, 2018, at 1:30 pm. Organizations participating in the dedication ceremony include:
Metropolitan Detroit Council NLUS Sea Cadet Color Guard.

Metropolitan Detroit Council, League of the United States

Historic Designation Advisory Board, City of Detroit

WAR OF 1812
GRAVE SITE

1n reaction to Oliver Hazard Perry?s
Lake Erie victory, the British withdrew
from Detroit on September 26, 1813,
setting ?re to the buildings within the
fort and the Citadel. Three days later.
United States troops returned to a city
that lacked housing and food supplies.
A disease. probably cholera. broke out
among the soldiers. By December 1.
1813, an estimated 1,300 of them were
111. The medical supplies were soon
depleted; conditions worsened. When
cof?ns became unobtainable, many
soldiers were buried in a common
grave at this site. Some 700 may have
died before the epidemic ?nally ran its
course. This grave site was identi?ed
in 1987 during an archaeological 
urvey for the People Mover that
found four burials associated with the
War of 1812.
