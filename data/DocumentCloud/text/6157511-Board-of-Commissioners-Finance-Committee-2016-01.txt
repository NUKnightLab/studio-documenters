PROPOSED ORDINANCE
FOR THE LEVY OF TAXES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2016
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners and the Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County, Illinois, have considered the subject of the Annual Tax Levy for the Fiscal Year A.D., 2016, and the several
sums necessary to be levied to meet the needs and requirements of the County of Cook for said fiscal year, and have
recommended that this Ordinance for the Levy of Taxes be adopted; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, Illinois, approved, passed, and adopted the Annual
Appropriation Bill of the County of Cook, for its Fiscal Year 2016, which said Appropriation Bill is hereinafter set
forth and which contains a Revenue Estimate that includes an allocation of the 2016 Tax Levy by Fund together
with additional columns captioned: “ANNUAL TAX LEVY”, “APPROPRIATION ALLOWANCE FOR
UNCOLLECTED TAXES” and "NET TAX LEVY FOR APPROPRIATION "; and
WHEREAS, Cook County and its taxpayers have benefited from Tax Increment Financing Districts (TIFs) by
having the increment generated during the life of the TIFs invest in the specific area generating the increment; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board passed a Resolution on November 15, 2011 outlining that it is the policy of
Cook County to recapture any property taxes at the termination of a TIF; and
WHEREAS, within the County of Cook, certain real-estate parcels, or a portion of the assessed valuation of certain
real-estate parcels, are from time to time identified on the County real-estate tax rolls as deriving from new property,
insofar as they were developed or substantially improved or are the subject of tax incentives that expired since the
most recent assessment of real-estate taxes, the value of which has not heretofore been recaptured; and
WHEREAS, the interests of County taxpayers and the County itself are better served if the taxes on the additional
value of said new property is captured.
THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED AND ORDERED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF COOK
COUNTY, ILLINOIS, that pursuant to its home rule powers, $720,483,542.00 as a base levy amount, plus a TIF
value recapture sum of $15,640,899, an expiring incentives sum of $695,668, and a new-property value capture
sum of $15,137,220, which aggregate amount of these sums is to be collected from the Annual Tax Levy for the
Fiscal Year A.D. 2016 of the County of Cook for the Corporate Fund purposes of said County, and for the Public
Safety Fund purposes of said County, and for the Health Enterprise Fund purposes of said County, and for the
payment of principal and interest on general obligation bonds of said County as represented by the Bond and Interest
fund purposes, and for Cook County Employees Annuity and Benefit Fund purposes, and for the Election Fund
purposes, said aggregate amount being $751,957,329, which is the total amount of appropriations heretofore legally
made from the Annual Tax Levy for the year 2016 and contained in the Annual Appropriation Bill (hereinafter set
forth in the Ordinance) for the Fiscal Year 2016 duly adopted by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County on
November 18, 2015, is hereby levied on and upon all taxable property in the said County of Cook for the Fiscal
Year 2016.
As provided in the Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Appropriation Bill, three percent of the property tax levy revenues
separately allocated to the Public Safety Fund, Corporate Fund, Health Fund, and Election Fund are to be made
available to each Fund for purposes of covering the loss and cost of collecting taxes levied for said Funds, for the
amounts of taxes for which the nonpayment will result in forfeiture of real estate, and for abatements in the amounts
of such taxes as extended upon the collectors’ books. To ensure the County meets its obligations for indebtedness
Page 52 of 58

 as represented by the Bond and Interest Fund, and that the actual collections of property taxes received by the
Annuity and Benefit Fund are commensurate with the amounts so levied, the County Clerk is authorized, in
