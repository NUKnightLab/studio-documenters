Patient Experience Story

Unofficial Experience ~ Elizabeth Allen story told by Dr. Brook Watts

N/A

Updated Structure for
The Office of Patient Experience

1



This was Ms. Allen’s first time being a patient here at MetroHealth. She shared that she felt it was a very
positive experience while at MetroHealth. She expressed she enjoyed the encounters she had with the
trainees/resident/students as they were learning. Ms. Allen also appreciated the amazing care she
received from the nursing staff. She realized how much, as a patient, you interact more with the RN staff
than the physicians. Overall an incredible experience here as a patient.



The domain of OPX ~ Volunteer Services & Arts & Medicine briefly reported to a different domain for a
short period of time and now are back under OPX.
Currently we are in the Strategic Planning phase now partnering with Cindy Gillespie and Elizabeth Clegg.
More updates to come soon regarding the structure for The Office of Patient Experience

Welcome. Listen. Care. Update



Welcome. Listen. Care. is a five-session workshop that guides staff to reflect on their Why and define
welcoming, listening and caring behaviors as it relates to their roles. The workshops also prepare staff to
align with their coworkers to improve the flow of their day-to-day. Welcome. Listen. Care. has been
facilitated at eleven ambulatory sites in 2018. Impact of the workshops are measured by patient
experience surveys in the following domains: Clerks Helpfulness, Nurses Listen Carefully, Nurse Courtesy
and Respect and Would Recommend Office. Eighty-five percent of sites are achieving consistent
improvement with Clerk Helpfulness and fifty-four percent of sites have seen consist improvement with
Nurses Listen Carefully and Nurses Courtesy and Respect. Sustainability efforts have been implemented
to sustain the impact and team engagement. In September, a pilot to include Providers in Welcome.
Listen. Care. was completed at Rocky River Health Center. The triad and primary care leadership support
the inclusion of Providers in Welcome. Listen. Care. moving forward.
