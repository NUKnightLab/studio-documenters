Commissioners agreed to the entry of the subject order during its meeting of July 31, 2007.
On June 18, 2008, the District Court entered an order amending this portion of the TA

was first funded at $800,000.00 on July 22, 2008 and the District Court entered an order
for additional funds of $500,000.00 respectively on December 18, 2008, April 14, 2009,

March 29, 2011, June 30, 2011, November 3, 2011, February 28, 2012 and July 26, 2012.
The Transitional Administrator has now presented invoice payment records evidencing
payments and a balance in the account as of October 9, 2012 in the amount of $129,812.31
which has been reviewed and accepted by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office. The
TA has requested the District Court to enter an order providing for an additional
disbursement of $500,000.00 into the OTA account which was approved by the Court on
October 25, 2012.
Upon approval, the Cook County Comptroller will transfer $500,000.00 from the SelfInsurance Fund to an account managed by the Transitional Administrator in accordance
with the terms of the aforementioned court order. From July 22, 2008 to date, inclusive of
this court order, $7,300,000.00 has been transferred from the Self-Insurance fund to the
Office of the Transitional Administrator.

operational and eligibility reforms before reducing hospital and physician rates that will
result in immediate job cuts and a reduction in access to care for society’s neediest
members; and

state plan amendment to the existing Hospital Assessment program and the 1115 waiver
request that will bring in additional revenue through Federal match; and

WHEREAS, this reimbursement would include any differences in deductibles, coinsurance, co-pays, and employee contributions up to the County’s group plan, so the
County employee will not have any higher out of pocket expenses than they would in the
County’s plan and will save money by not contributing their portion of the County health
care cost.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners directs the Cook County Department of Risk Management to investigate the
potential annual cost savings by implementing a program to encourage County employees,
including retirees, to opt-out of the County’s health care benefits and use their
spouses/domestic partner’s benefits; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Department of Risk Management
report the findings of their investigation to the Cook County Board of Commissioners by
February 28, 2013.
