 EXPLANATION
The Division of Resident Services awarded Contract 8054 to Globetrotters International Inc.
(GII) for the initial term of July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009 to perform services required to
update the status and eligibility of former and existing CHA residents who have a right under
the CHA’s 10/1/99 Relocation Rights Contract. The original not-to-exceed contract amount
was $744,770.00. The original contract was extended for time only for a one year period from
July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010 to continue these services.
The CHA HCVP desires to amend the contract for time and money to extend the term for up to
an additional six months, in an amount not-to-exceed $155,464 to perform similar services for
the Housing Choice Voucher wait list. The contract’s new aggregate not-to-exceed amount will
be $900,234.00.
The CHA HCVP has requested administrative relief from the Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) through its status under the Moving-To-Work Plan to make
changes to the HCV Administrative Plan. Changes proposed to the HCV Administrative Plan
relevant to this request include:
1. Create geographic preferences for Project Based Voucher Wait List Admissions
2. Create an admissions preference for working families
These changes require that the Housing Choice Voucher program update the wait list data to
advise applicants of such changes and to request that they provide updated information to assist
in making a selection from the wait list.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
Pursuant RFP No. 01578, CHA made a contract award to Globetrotters International Inc., which
include a one (1) year contract term and compensation of $744,770. Globetrotters has provided
CHA’s Resident Services Department with the professional services and outreach to the
Relocation Rights Residents (a/k/a 10.1.99 Residents) through: the issuance of individual and
public notices; updates to household information; management of responses to the notices;
providing notification of options; and documenting notice responses, history and supporting
activities.
SCOPE OF SERVICES
The HCV Program will require similar services, including the following:
1. Notification to all HCV Program applicants of the recent changes to the CHA
Administrative Plan
2. Detail the options for geographic preferences
3. Track responses and non-deliverable notifications
4. Collect responses and enter information into a secured database
5. Provide support for requests for Reason Accommodation requiring alternate forms of
communication
6. Document project activities

60 East Van Buren, 12th Floor · Chicago, Illinois 60605 · (312) 913-7282 · www.thecha.org

 Globetrotters has presented a detailed proposal and cost to the CHA for these services. The
proposal details seven areas of activity/deliverables as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

Development of wait list notice and response form
Issuance of wait list notices
Management of Notice Responses (including scans, hardcopies)
Provide bi-weekly reports of response outcomes
Develop Database to monitor activities
Develop electronic filing system
Provide final report of project outcomes and resident status

These activities and deliverables are set forth at equivalent service rates as the current contract,
with a variance of the required number of hours versus the volume and scope of the original
waitlist update efforts, based on the specific target audience of the Housing Choice Voucher
Program.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the Chicago Housing Authority to amend the
contract with Globetrotters International for an additional term for the period from July 1, 2010
through December 31, 2010, and to increase the contract’s compensation in an amount not-toexceed $155,464, for the purposes of updating the CHA HCV tenant and project based waitlist.
