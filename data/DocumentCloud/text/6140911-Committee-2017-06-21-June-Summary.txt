In addition to the benefits granted to members and spouses each month, the Secretary will also be
presenting, for informational purposes only, items of interest that may affect our members. Questions
regarding any member’s specific situation should be addressed directly to the Fund Office.
MONTHLY NEWS AND INFORMATION FROM THE FUND SECRETARY
BRASS BILL
A pension bill expanding the eligibility for exempt positions above career service rank, commonly referred to
as the Brass Bill, was introduced in the Legislature as Senate Bill 364. The Pension Fund’s legislative liaison
informed us that SB364 had little chance of passing because the City strongly opposed it. The City’s
opposition to the expanded Brass Bill is not surprising, seeing as the Pension Board recently sent a demand
letter to the City requesting the $1.6M in funds owed for the 2016 Exempt Rank benefit. The pension code
specifically states that the City’s contribution for the exempt positions above career service rank “shall be in
addition to the tax levy otherwise calculated under section 6-165.” The exact language can be found under
section 5/6-211(g) of our pension code. This payment used to be sent to the Fund as a separate transfer of
funds and clearly identified. The Board contends the City did not make the separate payment in 2016 that is
statutorily required. The City appears to believe the recently passed legislation, found in SB777 and
commonly referred to as the Casino Bill, relieves the City of the separate funding required to support the
exempt rank benefit above the career service rank. If the current City Administration is hesitant to continue
paying for the exempt rank benefits that the previous City Administration granted, they most certainly are
going to oppose expanded exempt rank benefits that would require even more funding. It is for these reasons I
believe the City prevented the expanded ‘Brass Bill’ from being voted out of committee and it was left to die.
The critical issue facing the Pension Fund’s continued sustainability is FUNDING. Every member of this
pension fund should recognize that the most important issue facing our retirement benefits is funding, not
additional benefits. As trustees, your Board is not opposed to supporting new benefits, but the Pension Board
will consistently resist new benefits if they are not properly funded or clearly granted in the pension code.
As previously mentioned, the FABF sent a demand letter to the City Budget Director for the $1.6M required to
support the Brass Bill. The Board discussed a few options: one was to send another demand letter, another
was to file a lawsuit and the third option was to withhold the benefit above career service rank until the Fund
received the monies owed. The Pension Fund is aware that the City Budget Director recently announced her
resignation and that our original demand letter may have been lost in the shuffle and therefore it would be
more prudent to reach out to the City’s corporate counsel for an opinion. The Board directed the Fund’s legal
counsel to attempt to contact the City’s corporate counsel and send another demand letter. The Board will take
up the issue again at the July meeting and depending on what is heard back from the City’s corporate counsel
or the budget director, the Board has discussed either pursuing a lawsuit or holding the benefit above career
service rank for the affected exempt rank, or both. If the Board decides to withhold the exempt rank benefit
above the career service rank because the City isn’t paying the statutorily required amount for that portion of

 the benefit then members currently receiving exempt rank pensions would only receive the benefit earned up
to the amount of their battalion chief career service rank. Local 2 President Jim Tracy, by my invitation,
attended the June meeting and was accompanied by Political Action Director Rob Tebbens. While the Board
generally does not allow public input during discussion of Board actions, we inquired as to what Local 2 felt
about withholding the exempt rank benefit above career service rank; Local 2 was against the idea.
LAWSUITS
The Board also discussed two related lawsuits that have been made against the Pension Board Trustees. Both
lawsuits address the Pension Board’s decision to literally interpret the pension code rather than adopt the intent
expressed by two key legislators. The lawsuits essentially are requesting the court to instruct the Pension
Board to grant the benefits the two legislators indicated they intended to write into the pension code. I have
written before that I believe this may be one of the better options because it could result in a relatively quick
resolution, an authoritative declaration of how the Board should proceed made by a court of law. However, it
remains one of my biggest frustrations that the stakeholders involved in maintaining the health of the Pension
Fund could be so reckless. The language that afforded members, born after 1954 up to and including 1966, a
3% COLA, was written very poorly. I can’t help but wonder how this issue would have unfolded if the
Pension Board did not abide by their fiduciary obligation and instead, without considering the integrity of the
Fund, recklessly granted the benefits due to the pressure that was exerted on them by Local 2. In that case, I
would expect a group of younger pension fund members would have filed suit against the Pension Board
Trustees for abdicating their fiduciary responsibilities and jeopardizing the security of their future benefits by
misappropriating Fund assets if they granted benefits that clearly weren’t provided in the pension code. In
either case, the Pension Board would have been sued over legislation they didn’t write or weren’t consulted
on.
Some members have expressed concern that the Pension Fund and Local 2 are spending money on a lawsuit
against each other and that money could be better spent elsewhere. As I stated before, the Fund would have
been facing a lawsuit either way; it couldn’t win with this botched legislation. It is important that legislation is
properly crafted and that all stakeholders are included in the process. I can tell you that the Fund takes out
insurance for these types of situations and that we have filed a claim against the policy for the legal costs, so
the members can rest assured that the Pension Fund isn’t incurring excessive costs defending the Trustees in
these lawsuits that resulted from poorly crafted legislation.
Local 2 is making a very aggressive push to get these benefits passed down in Springfield and should they
succeed, the lawsuits against the Pension Fund would effectively be a non-issue. I can’t state what the costs
will be to the Fund for these additional benefits because when the actuaries did the impact statement analysis,
they read the language the same was the Pension Fund did and did not include these specific benefits in their
calculations. It is concerning to me that legislators are considering passing legislation affecting our Pension
Fund without knowing the cost implications.

FUNDING RATIO
The Fund’s actuaries, Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company (GRS), have completed their Actuarial Valuation
Report for 2016. There were a few comments in the transmittal letter to the Board that I thought deserve your
attention:
“This is a severely underfunded plan. The funded ratio is only 20.2% (using market value of assets)
and the unfunded liability is approximately $4 billion as of December 31, 2016. The funded ratio is
not projected to even reach 50% funded for another 26 years until 2042.”
“This actuarial valuation assumes that the City will be able to make future contributions on a timely
basis. We did not perform an analysis of the ability of the City to make future contributions. Such an
analysis is not within the scope of our assignment or within our analytical skill set. Failure to receive
City contributions on a timely basis could jeopardize the sustainability of the Fund.”

 “We understand that P.A. 99-0506 defines the amount of City Contributions to the
FABF. Nevertheless, we continue to recommend that the plan sponsor seriously consider making
additional contributions (in excess of the minimum statutory requirement) to ensure that there are
sufficient assets available in the fund in all years to pay the promised benefits.”
The report will be posted on the FABF website, www.fabf.org, shortly, along with the audited financial
statements.
CIO
The administration of our Pension Fund takes on many different aspects and one that gets a considerable
amount of attention is investments. The FABF is often recognized as one of the best run City pension funds in
terms of investments and that is because of our Chief Investment Officer Mike Moran. I am sorry to announce
that Mike has chosen to retire after 22 years diligently and patiently overseeing every aspect of our Fund’s
investments. Mike occasionally makes visits to firehouses with trustees and money managers to help educate
the members on funding and investment issues. Mike truly loved serving the men and woman of the Chicago
Fire Department. Mike is a true Chicagoan; born on the westside and transplanted to the northside as a kid,
Mike is the son of a Chicago policeman and nephew to a Chicago firefighter. He understands first-hand how
dependent families are on these pension funds. Mike also understands that the costs of the pension benefits are
not that expensive to the City if they are properly and timely funded. In my opinion every member of this
Fund, and their families, owe Mike a bit of gratitude; not only was he a savvy, forward thinking steward of our
retirement funds, he was also an eloquent defender of public pensions. His presence and wise counsel was
often present at Board meetings. For the average firefighter jumping on a rig or paramedic responding to a call
day in and day out, the loss of Mike Moran may not be immediately apparent, but it should nevertheless be
considered a loss for us all. Happiness and Health in a well-deserved retirement Mike!

Fraternally,

Timothy McPhillips
Fund Secretary
