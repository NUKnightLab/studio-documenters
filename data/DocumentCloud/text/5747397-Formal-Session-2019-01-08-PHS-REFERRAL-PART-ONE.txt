Memorandum

   

TO: Honorable City Council

FROM: Ericka Savage? Whitley 

Assistant Corporation Counsel
City of Detroit Law Department

DATE: December 6, 2018

RE: Scoop Detroit? Petition No. 567

BACKGROUND

This memorandum was prepared in response to a petition filed by Scoop Detroit
on October 29, 2018. The City Clerk?s Office referred the petition to the Law Department
On November 5, 2018 for a report and recommendation. Scoop Detroit is a Detroit-
based company that was formed on January 18, 2018. The company is requesting City
Council to approve golf cart shuttle services to operate in midtown and downtown Detroit.

SHORT ANSWER

The Law Department recommends that Scoop Detroit?s petition be denied. The
Michigan Vehicle Code does not authorize the City of Detroit to permit golf carts, or
similar off road vehicles, to operate on City streets because it has a population of over
30,000. Even in small cities where golf carts are authorized to operate, in no instance
may a local legislative body permit golf carts to operate on pedestrian sidewalks, 1/2 hour
before sunset to 1/2 hour after sunrise, or on state trunk lines.

LAW ANALYSIS

The Michigan Vehicle Code1 provides for the regulation of certain vehicles
Operated upon the public highways or any other place open to the general public or
generally accessible to motor vehicles. Specifically, MCL 257.657a regulates the
operation of golf carts in a city or state trunk line highway and states in relevant part:

 

1 MCL 257.1 et seq.

   

COLEMAN A. YOUNG MUNICIPAL CENTER
2 WOODWARD AVENUE, SUITE 500
DETROIT, MICHIGAN 48226-3437

PHON 313-224-4550
CITY OF DETROIT 313-224-5505
DEPARTMENT 

 

A village or city having a population of fewer than 30,000
individuals based upon the 2010 decennial census may by
resolution allow the operation of golf carts on the streets of that
village or city, subject to the requirements of this section?

The legislative body of a local unit of government may request the
state transportation department to authorize the local unit of
government to adopt an ordinance authorizing the operation of golf
carts on a state trunk line highway, other than an interstate
highway, located within the local unit of government.3

A golf cart shall not be operated on a sidewalk constructed for the
use of pedestrians.4

A golf cart shall be operated at a speed not to exceed 15 miles per
hour and shall not be operated on a state trunk line highway or a
highway or street with a speed limit of more than 30 miles per hour
except to cross that state trunk line highway or highway or street.5

A golf cart shall not be operated on a state trunk line highway or
the streets of a city, village, or township during the time period
from 1/2 hour before sunset to 1/2 hour after sunrise.6

The Michigan Vehicle Code only allows for the operation of golf carts in cities with a
population of less than 30,000, at no more than 15 miles per hour, during daylight hours,
if approved by local elected officials. Otherwise, Michigan law does not allow drivers to
operate golf carts on local streets.

CONCLUSION

The City of Detroit is prohibited under Michigan law to regulate golf carts, or
similar off road vehicles, on local streets. Therefore, an ordinance allowing golf cart
shuttle services to operate in midtown and downtown Detroit is not legal under current
Michigan law. The Law Department recommends that Scoop Detroit?s petition be
deniedMCL

Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) ?One Water Institute?

The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) has just announced the initiation of its specialized
training program called ?One Water Institute?, as a six-month pilot program beginning in 2019.
The informational handout is attached.

This new program apparently represents an unparalleled opportunity for City Council staff (and
other City employees), and even City Council Members themselves if desired, to learn important
factual information about these vital aspects of City and regional government services. In
particular for City Council employees (who are not technical, hands-on personnel in the fresh- and
waste-water systems), the four ?Basic Water? courses (Page 3 of the attachment near the bottom),
seem to be appropriate:

0 Introduction, Public Water Systems, Hydrologic Cycle, Source Water Assessment and
Wellhead Protection;

0 Basic Water Treatment Course;

0 Basic Distribution Course; and

I Water Quality Monitoring. I

Greater familiarity with the relatively complex ?nuts-and-bolts? of our regional water and
sewer infrastructure and operations would potentially inform policy reforms in this crucial
area of City government operations. If Council Members or staff wish to sign up for any of
these ?One Water Institute? courses, Legislative Policy Division (LPD) staff will facilitate

On October 30, 2018, Council Member Spivey directed the Legislative Policy Division (LPD) to
provide a writing discussing the ability of the City of Detroit to adopt an ordinance allowing for
automated traf?c enforcement in selected locations in the City, such as around schools or
construction sites.

For purposes of this report, the terms ?Automated Traf?c Enforcement? refers to an electronic
system consisting of a photographic, video, or electronic camera and a vehicle sensor installed to
work in conjunction with an of?cial traf?c controller or police department employee to
automatically produce photographs, video or digital images of each vehicle violating a standard
traf?c control device or speed restriction. (De?nition in attached Davenport, Iowa ordinance)

Legality

LPD is unaware of any legal prohibition in Michigan on such technology, or on a local ordinance
regulating it. On the contrary, Sec. 55-1-11 of the City Code states:

?Powers relative to traf?c-control devices and other signs, signals and traf?c-control devices.

The Department of Public Works shall prepare geometric drawings and speci?cations of
traf?c-control devices and designate the type, location, and timing of such devices.

 The Department of Public Works shall install and maintain all traf?c signs, markings, parking
meters, and other traf?c-control devices.

(0) The Department of Public Works shall establish regulations, general standards and
speci?cations for the construction and maintenance of traf?c control signals.?

Similarly, Art. VII, Sec. 29 of the State Constitution af?rms the City?s control over streets and
traf?c control: ?Except as otherwise provided in this constitution the right of all counties,
townships, cities and villages to the reasonable control of their highways, streets, alleys and public
places is hereby reserved to such local units of government.? It is hard for LPD to see, at least in
the absence of speci?c State preemption legislation on the subject of the type that has become
popular lately, any legal impediment to the City adopting an Automated Traf?c Enforcement
Ordinance.

Policy Discussion

preliminary research was unable to reveal much useful or detailed information on this
subject. LPD notes that automated license plate reader technology has been very brie?y discussed
on occasion during Public Health and Safety Standing Committee meetings, and perhaps direct
inquiries to Department of Public Works (DPD) Traf?c Division, or Police Department technology
and grant funding of?ces, would be good places to seek more speci?c, actionable data about the
extent to which the City may already be using such technology, if any, and how or if it should be
expanded. research identi?ed a limited amount of essentially corporate sales materials for
such technology, but relatively little discussion of public policy issues, technical details, or
priorities and considerations for using such technology in a City like Detroit.

In the event that a local ordinance is required in order for the City to employ such technology, the
attached Automated Traf?c Enforcement ordinance from Davenport, Iowa, may serve as a useful
model. As noted in Council Member Spivey?s memorandum itself, questions about where and
how to install such technology would have to be assessed, and in order to adopt an ordinance
modeled on Davenport?s, at a minimum the schedule of violations and ?nes would have to be
tailored to re?ect Michigan law, as well as the particular policy choices of City Council and the
administration in pursuing this initiative.

The very limited literature readily available on the intemet regarding this subject usually focuses
on the danger of selective, racially or economically disparate enforcement, which could burden
low income People of Color communities with additional ?nes and costs, if this powerful new
technology were installed in communities and without safeguards where it overwhelmingly targets
Detroit?s large People of Color and poverty populations. Of course the costs and bene?ts of
purchasing, installing, maintaining and using such equipment would have to be carefully weighed.
Whatever decisions City of?cials ultimately make about such automated traf?c enforcement
technology, traf?c engineers and the Police Department should develop a well-conceived
plan to minimize costs, maximize bene?ts, and avoid unwanted side effects like disproportionately
burdensome enforcement against vulnerable populations.

If Council has any other questions or concerns regarding this subject, LPD will be happy to provide
further research and analysis upon request.

Automated Traf?c Enforcement

City of Davenport

May 29, 2018

10.16.070 Automated traf?c enforcement.

A. General. The city of Davenport, in accordance with the police powers authorized it by the
state of Iowa for governing safe traf?c ?ow, may deploy, erect or cause to have erected an
automated traf?c enforcement system for making video images of vehicles that fail to obey red
light traf?c signals at intersections designated by the city administrator or his designee or fail to
obey speed regulations at other locations in the city. The system may be managed by the private
contractor that owns and operates the requisite equipment with supervisory control vested in the
city's police department. Video images shall be provided to the police department by the
contractor for review. The police department will determine which vehicle owners are in
violation of the city's traf?c control ordinances and are to receive a notice of violation for the

offense.
B. De?nitions.

1. "Automated traf?c enforcement system" shall mean an electronic system consisting of a
photographic, video, or electronic camera and a vehicle sensor installed to work in conjunction
with an of?cial traf?c controller or police department employee to automatically produce
photographs, video or digital images of each vehicle violating aLSEl?daI?d traf?c control device or

speed restriction.

2. "Vehicle owner" shall mean the person or entity identi?ed by the Iowa Department of
Transportation, or registered with any other state vehicle registration of?ce, as the registered

owner of a vehicle.

C. Offense.

l. The vehicle owner shall be liable for a ?ne as imposed below if such vehicle crosses a marked
