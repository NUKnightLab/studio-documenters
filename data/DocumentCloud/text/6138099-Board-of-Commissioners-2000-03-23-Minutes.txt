CAPITAL PROGRAM ITEM
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 16, 2000 from
MICHAELE. LAMONT, Director, Office of Capita l Planning and Policy
In the fall of 1999, repair work began on the Skoki e Courthouse Parking Structure. As you may recall,
this structure had undergone remedial repairs early in its life. The intent of the 1999 work was to correct
deficiencies and spalling of the concrete surface. As the work was being performed, it became evident
that the deteri oration of the structure was not just li mited to the surface of the concrete. According ly, a
structura l engineering consultant was hired to conduct further testing to evaluate the structura l integri ty
and serviceabil ity of the structure and to evaluate the service life of the structure.

1077

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 23, 2000
The consultant's report states that concrete quality is highly variable throughout the structure and that the
rebar and post-tensioning systems are heavily corroded. The structure will continue to deteriorate over
time because the concrete has become infiltrated with salts and chlorides. They indicated that the
structure life could be extended several more years at a cost of $ 1 to 2 million, if intennediate-structural
repairs were made to shored up the structure. They additionally recommended that this strengthening be
completed as qu ickly as possible. The consultant also recommended the most cost-effective long-term
solution to address the deterioration is to replace the structure.
In light of the results of the testing and evaluation efforts by the consultant, we recommend the following
plan of action:
•

Don' t invest repair money on this structure; therefore plan on the permanent replacement of this
structure.

•

Move immediately to acquire and develop on-site and off-site parking capabi lities.

•

Utilize current design professionals and the current general contractors to develop the temporary
surface parking options. Additional funds beyond what is available in the current contract may
need to be identified. Target date is May 15, 2000 for completion of the temporary parking.

•

Attempt to secure additional surface parking from adjacent property owners, if necessary.

•

Plan to close the parking structure as soon as the temporary surface parking is available.

•

Hire a consultant to design a permanent replacement structure and surface parking. Consultant
will provide options on the most cost effective use of structured parking versus surface parking.

•

Request the necessary capital dollars for construction of a new permanent structure in the FY
2001 Budget.

The Office of Capital Planning and Policy requests approval from the Cook County Board of
Commissioners to implement this plan to assure safe operations and to provide for an expedient solution.

Commissioner Carr, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved that the request of the Director of the
Office of Capital Planning and Policy be approved. The motion carried unanimously.

req uesting authorization fo r the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract wi th Barbara Press!,
Chicago, Illinois, to provide consu lting and technical services to ass ist the Cook County

records conflicts with Department of Revenue records and assistance with C lerk's role in
design of MIS computer programs to integrate records with the legis lated requ irement to
bring taxes forward on the warrant records printed in early 2001 .
Reason: Ms. Pressl has over 17 years experience with property tax functions of the county,

knowledge about these matters except for the department managers, whose day-today responsibilities do not permit them to devote the time and attention to the
project that is required.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 23 , 2000

2.

SB 1303 - Property Taxes: Objections in Court

This bill passed out of the Senate and is currently in the House Revenue Comm ittee. Mr. Morrill said
there have been discussions regarding an amendment to the bill that would not make it mandatory but
would provide that the State's Attorney can be rel ieved of the defense.

3.

SB 1276 - Property Taxes: Attorneys before Board of Review

This bill has passed the House and is now in the House Executive Committee.
In response to a question from C hairman Hansen, Julie Starciak, representing Ronan-Potts, lobbyists for

Commissioner Schumann moved to Oppose SB 1276, seconded by Commissioner Sutker, the
motion carried.
Commissioner Collins voted Present on SB 1276.
4.

Commissioner Lechowicz moved to receive and file Senate Bill 1546. Seconded by Commissioner

5.

SB 1645 - Property Taxes: Mortgage Lender Notices

This bill passed the Senate and is pending in the House Revenue Committee.

6.

HB 2976 - FOIA: Litigation Records

This bi ll was defeated and re-referred to the House Rul es Committee.

7.

HB 1137 - Elections: Local Primaries

Mr. Morril l stated that this bill is a vehicle bill to be put in Conference Committee and amended to
contain language pertaining to voting equipment for the Cook County and Chicago Board of Elections.
Prospects are good for passage before the Spring session is over.
Vice Chairman Lechowicz requested a copy of the proposed amendment and asked what the amendment
would allow. Steve Morrill said the language would a llow direct insertion of the ballot in the machine
and a real-time vote count.

1203

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 23, 2000
Vice Chairman Lechowicz asked if there is a back-up procedure if the machine malfunctions. Mr. Morrill
responded that the ballots would be put in a secure storage bin until the machine is repaired or a
replacement machine is delivered. The ballots in storage would be counted separately after the polls
close.
Commissioner Daley stated that the committee was concerned with the possibility ofaj udge not initialing
the ballot as, well as over-count. He continued by stating that two of the selling points of the new election
equipment were that the ballot would be rejected if there were no initials, and also if there was an overcount. Commissioner Daley then asked if these issues were part of an amendment to be offered.
Steve Morrill said that during discussions with members of the Election Committee, there were concerns
regarding automatic return featu res that focused on ballot secrecy. The consensus was to defer the issues
to a later session and to allow the machine to be used in its intended fashion in the upcoming election.
Commissioner Daley remarked that there will be no real testing since those features will not be available.
Steve Morrill responded that the machines will provide quick returns and will spare the judges an hour or
two in the polling place.
Commissioner Sutker asked if there are any other matters holding up using the new equipment as
intended. Steve Morrill said that he does not believe there will be, but it is possible that the Senate will
ask for accommodations from the House to move this Item into the Spring session.
Commissioner Sims expressed concern regarding malfunctioning of voting equipment and placement of
ballots in a storage bin. Steve Morrill reiterated statements made earlier in response to Commissioner
Daley' s question.
Chairman Hansen stated that the committee is committed to the new voting equipment and suggested that
the committee render a vote of support for the HB 1137.

Commissioner Sutker moved to Support HB 1137. Seconded by Commissioner Schumann, the
motion carried.
Vice Chairman Lechowicz asked for a legal opinion from the State's Attorney regarding home rule

COOK COUNTY GUIDELINES FOR SPECIAL STATE'S ATTORNEY'S
WHEREAS, Illinois law provides for the appointment of a Special State's Attorney, in civil or
criminal cases, when the Cook County State's Attorney is sick, absent, unable to attend to a case or has an
interest in a case (see 55 ILCA 5-3-9008); and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook, Illinois ("County") is responsible for the payment of legal fees
generated by a Special State's Attorney and is generally accountable for the satisfaction of monetary
judgments or settlements resulting from the civil matters for which the Special State's Attorney was
appointed; and

1208

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 23, 2000

WHEREAS, the Cook County Guidelines for Special State' s Attorney's ("Guidelines" ) will
enable the County to be fiscally responsible and budget effectively in these matters; and
WHEREAS, the Guidelines were prepared in consultation with the Litigation Subcommittee, the
Cook County State's Attorney's Office and representatives of the legal community in Cook County;

("Board") approve and adopt the Cook County Guidelines for Special State' s Attorney's as follows:
APPLICATION
The party for whom a Special State' s Attorney have been appointed shall provide the Guidelines
to the Special State' s Attorney. When the court appoints a Special State's Attorney, the County directs the
Cook County State's Attorney to ask the court to order the Special State's Attorney to comply with the
Guidelines. The County also directs the Cook County State's Attorney to forward a copy of the
Guidelines to prospective Special State' s Attorneys in a given matter and to advise them of the County' s
request that they comply with the Guidelines if appointed by the court.
There may be circumstances under which the Guidelines require modification due to the
relationship of the Board to the litigation. The Litigation Subcommittee shall examine these situations on
a case-by-case basis and shall modify the Guidelines accordingly.
Moreover, in unusual circumstances in which Special State' s Attorney's believe that strict
compliance with these Guidelines would interfere with the exercise of their professional judgment or
otherwise violate their professional responsibilities, they shall promptly seek appropriate gujdance from
the court. Pending the receipt of such guidance, they shall be relieved of the obligation to comply with
the Guidelines, but only to the extent necessary to avoid the perceived problems that prompted the request
for guidance.

CASE MANAGEMENT
The Special State's Attorney shall submit a Case Summary and Budget to the County Board
through its Litigation Subcommittee within 30 days of the Special State's Attorney's appointment or as

confidential attorney-client communications.
The Subcommittee shall review the Case Summary and Budget. Requiring submission of the
Case Summary and Budget for review does not prohibit the Special State's Attorney from initiating,
immediately upon appointment, legal activities the Special State' s Attorney deems necessary to advance
the legal interests of the represented party. Special State' s Attorney's appointed in criminal matters shall
not be required to submit a Case Summary to the Litigation Subcommittee.
