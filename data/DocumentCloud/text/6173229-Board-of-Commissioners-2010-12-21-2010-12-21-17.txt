GENERAL BACKGROUND
On October 19, 2010, the Board passed Resolution No. 2010-CHA-135 approving contracts with
Humana Healthcare (medical and dental), Davis Vision, Lincoln National Life and Ameriflex for
the CHA Employee Health Benefit Plan for an aggregate amount not-to-exceed $5,882,634.08
for FY 2010 and $6,177,683.08 for FY2012. The specific amount authorized for Davis Vision
was $40,010.93 for both FY2011 and FY2012.
Through an inadvertent error, the Board Letter with respect to Davis Vision, indicated
incorrectly that the new premium rates provided by Davis Vision reflected a 2% decrease in the
premium rates (from the current premium rates) and included an enhanced benefit for contact

 lens users. Although the premium rates would have decreased 2% (from the current rates)
without any changes in benefits, with the enhanced benefit, the premium rates actually increased
by 5.05% over the current premium rates. The enhanced benefit to the FY2011 vision plan
includes: Standard contact lens fitting will be covered at 100% and specialty lens fittings will be
covered up to $60, then 15% discount off balance. Currently, employees who undergo standard
contact lens fittings are charged $40.00, unlike employees who are not charged for standard
eyeglass fittings. The following chart reflects the monthly premium rates provided by Davis
Vision.
Rates for 2009 and 2010
Employee:
$ 4.32
Employee + 1: $ 7.77
Family:
$12.10

Proposed Rates for 2011 &
2012 No Change in Benefit
$ 4.23 (-2%)
$ 7.61 (-2%)
$ 11.86 (-2%)

Proposed Rates for 2011 and
2012 with Enhanced Benefit
$ 4.54 (+5.05%)
$ 8.16 (+5.05%)
$12.71 (+5.05%)

Based upon the above considerations and the recommendation of the CHA’s management to
provide the enhanced benefit for the vision plan, it is in the best interest of the CHA to increase
the funding of the contract with Davis Vision by an amount not-to-exceed $2,878.03 for a
revised contract amount not-to-exceed $42,888.96 for FY 2011 and, subject to funding
availability, a revised amount not-to-exceed $42,888.96 for FY2012. The aggregate amount of
all Employee Health Benefit Plan insurance coverage and the employee flexible spending plan
will be increased by an amount not-to-exceed $2,878.03 for a revised amount not-to-exceed
$5,885,512.11 for FY2011 and subject to funding availability, an aggregate amount not-toexceed $6,180,561.11 for the FY2012 option term.
