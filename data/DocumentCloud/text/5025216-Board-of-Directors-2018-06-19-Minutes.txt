Debt Service Coverage Protections

Ms. Kanalos reviewed the table which was included in the Board agenda book noting that the
current projections show a shortfall of $10,391,000. We have a balance in the debt reserve funds
of $8,599,559 so there is a projected deficit at the end of the term of $1,792,000. She asked the
Board to keep in mind that these are just projections. Anything can happen in revenues??
assessments can go up or we could receive more tax increment financing revenues than
projected.

Ms. Forte asked if nothing happened, what are the options for resoiving the potential deficit. Mr.
Ecklund responded that we are servicing the debt currently. We are releasing these numbers in
your audited financials each year so the market is definitely aware of it. This is an issue coming
into that final year of debt payment. As you took at your taxable value, you can kind of see what
the trend has been. i don?t think you are going to see the answer as the taxable value goes up
so you can capture that deficit. So that would be something that you would be looking to your
parent incorporator to help you service. This will be something over the next three years that will
need to be addressed with the City of Detroit. Whether they want to bite it all off at the very end
or if they want to start putting something away each year, that is an internal financial choice.
Currently, you are getting enough from the State which you are capturing to service the debt.

Ms. Forte questioned how and when does this come before the parties so that they can start to
strategize. Mr. Ecklund stated that it is never too soon to begin to strategize. Mr. Long advised
that we have had discussions with the City's Finance Department and we are trying to identify a

plan B. Basicaliy, the thought process here is to identify another source of economic development
funds to utilize to make up the gap, and we have some candidates for that. Another option would
be to extend the Plan. Obviously, we don?t want to end up with a default and will look at all
options. Staff will continue to work with the City Finance staff to try to finalize this. Ultimately, if
we are able to identify other sources of economic development funds, this Board will be asked to
reprogram fund, to accept funds, from another economic development entity, possibly in the form
of a grant, or possibly in the form of a loan. Again, we can extend the program another year if
necessary. We will have some kind of official ?Plan by October.

Report of Actions Taken Under the Delegation of Authority

Ms. Kanalos advised that in April 2006, the Board approved a Delegation of Authority resolution
allowing staff to enter into contracts under $50,000. On June 13, 2018, staff entered into a
contract with Grace Management Services for the maintenance of the St. Jean Berm landscape
for the summer in the amount of $6,500. This report was for the Board?s information only and no
action was taken.
