Recommended Rescission
Associate Director Givens said that staff recommended rescinding $1,403,100 in FFY13
NARIP funds originally designated to the Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS)
to enhance the integration of disparate systems used by the Illinois State Police to make
the collection, evaluation, and exchange of information timelier and less labor intensive.
This recommendation was made due to a conflict between IDHS’s billing policy and the
Authority’s means of providing funding.
Motion: Ms. Kramer moved to approve the recommended FFY13 NARIP designation
rescission. Ms. Wolff seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice
vote.
Recommended Designation
Associate Director Givens said that staff recommended designating the $1,403,100 in
FFY13 NARIP funds rescinded from IDHS directly to the ISP for the same scope of
work: to enhance integration of its disparate systems, making collection, evaluation, and
exchange of information timelier and less labor intensive.
Motion: Ms. Vollen-Katz moved to approve the recommended FFY13 NARIP
designation rescission. Ms. Wolff seconded the motion and the motion passed by
unanimous voice vote.

2. Recommended Designations
A. Law Enforcement & Prosecutor-Based Victim Assistance Services
Associate Director Givens called attention to the table on Page 2 of the memo describing
$415,322 in recommended FFY14 and FFY15 VOCA designations to support law
enforcement and prosecutor-based victim assistance services. He said the funds would
allow the programs to operate until the end of calendar year 2017 when a new funding
opportunity will open.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended FFY14 and FFY15 VOCA
designation reductions. Ms. Campanelli seconded the motion and the motion passed by
unanimous voice vote, with a recusal by Ms. Kramer.
B. Civil Legal Services for Victims of Domestic Violence
Associate Director Givens called attention to the table on Page 3 of the memo describing
$5,985,738 in recommended FFY15 and FFY16 VOCA designations to support civil
legal services for victims of domestic violence.
Authority Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt called attention to a typographical error in
the table; the Land of Lincoln Legal Assistance Foundation was erroneously listed as
being recommended for both a $528,198 designation in FFY15 funds and a $528,198
designation in FFY16 funds. He said the correct designation recommendation was for
$528,198 in FFY16 funds only and that the FFY15 recommendation was in error.
Associate Director Givens said applicants who were not awarded funding were issued
letters outlining the basic reasons for rejection.
Mr. Reichgelt said applicants who received rejection letters cannot appeal their
application’s score, but they can appeal the review process if they feel the Authority
violated rules set forth for the process.
A discussion ensued regarding VOCA guidelines and program eligibility. Executive
Director Maki said that VOCA funds are only allowed to be used for programming that
addresses victimization, as defined by the Office for Victims of Crime, and therefore
programs that support other aspects of the criminal justice system might not be allowable.
Executive Director Maki said that it is not appropriate for Authority Board members to
advocate for specific applications. Ms. Wolff said that under the Procurement Act no
Board member who will vote on these items should talk specifically about material things
relating to any notice of funding opportunity or recommended designation and, if they do,
they must report themselves under the Procurement Act.

designations. Ms. Wolff seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice
vote.
3. Recommended Designations to Lead Entities
A. Services to Victims of Domestic Violence
Associate Director Givens said that on January 10 and 11, 2017, ICJIA convened the
Victim Services Ad Hoc Committee (VSAHC) to review past priorities and define new
ones for the use of VOCA funds. The VSAHC prioritized strengthening and expansion of
core services. He said funding of core services will be processed through a lead entity
policy established by ICJIA in January 2017 stating lead entities can be used to distribute
funds to sub-grantees to implement federal- and state-supported programs. When a lead
entity is identified by ICJIA, he said, the entity is responsible for the fiscal oversight and
quality assurance of its sub-grants. He added lead entities conduct structured monitoring
and provide subject matter expertise and technical assistance to sub-grantees and that the
Authority monitors lead entity grants through periodic progress reports.
Associate Director Givens said that staff recommended designating $17,300,000 in
FFY15 funds to the Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV). ICADV is a
statewide network of service providers that provides direct services to victims to alleviate
trauma and suffering resulting from domestic violence.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended FFY15 VOCA designation.
Ms. Kramer seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice vote.

trauma and suffering resulting from sexual assault.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended FFY15 VOCA designation.

DATE:

July 27, 2017

RE:

FFY16 Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) Plan Introduction

This memo introduces the FFY16 Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) Plan.
PREA was, “enacted to address the problem of sexual abuse of persons in the custody of
U.S. correctional agencies. PREA calls for Federal, State, and local corrections systems
to have a zero-tolerance policy regarding prison rape (as defined by PREA) in prisons,
jails, police lock-ups, and other confinement facilities (National Institute of Justice,
2014).”
Recommended Designation
IDOC has identified a need for additional cameras at the Illinois River Correctional
Center, which is a medium security adult male correctional facility consisting of a total of
29 buildings, which comprise more than 409,000 square feet. The living units consist of
four X-type housing units, one receiving and orientation unit, one segregation unit and a
15-bed health care unit. In addition, the center has a special management unit, which
provides special security for inmates housed there. This special management unit houses
the 17 and under population that have been committed to IDOC custody.
IDOC has also identified a need for additional cameras at the Logan Correctional Center,
a maximum security correctional center for women. Cameras would be ordered from a
state master contract and installed by staff electricians currently working at the Logan
Correctional Center and the Illinois River Correctional Center. Procurement and
installation of the cameras at the Logan Correctional Center and Illinois River
Correctional Center will take approximately 6 months from ordering to completion.
The locations of Illinois River Correctional Center and the Logan Correctional Center
were chosen for additional cameras mainly because of the sensitive and vulnerable
populations that are housed at both facilities, but also as a result of a facility internal
affairs and operations review of all camera installations. These two locations were

9

 PREA FFY16
July 27, 2017
Page 2

deemed as having the greatest needs for additional cameras after an operations staff
review of current IDOC security camera inventory. This review considered needs for
replacement cameras as well as programs and areas in which cameras were believed to be
necessary.
The Authority’s FFY16 PREA award is $124,797. Staff recommends designating these
funds to the IDOC for its Inmate Sexual Assaults – Prevention and Intervention Program
for the purchase of security cameras and peripheral equipment
Staff will be available at the meeting to answer any questions.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Services to Victims of Domestic Violence/Chicago Domestic Violence Hotline

Funding Source:

VOCA FFY16, $455,000- Total Federal Amount, $113,750-20% Cash Match
Amount

Request Type:

Continuation.

Program Description
The Domestic Violence Hotline is a 24- hour toll free confidential resource that serves as a clearinghouse
providing domestic violence victims with immediate information about their safety planning, available options
and how to access supportive services. Callers can obtain a direct three-way link to domestic violence resources
including shelter, counseling, legal advocacy and children’s services.
Program Activities
The Chicago Metropolitan Battered Women’s Network staffs the Domestic Violence Hotline 24-hours a day,
7 days per week. Trained Victim Information and Referral Advocates (VIRA’s) assist victims, law enforcement,
faith leaders and various community stakeholders with information and referrals to supportive services when
requested. Funding for this initiative will directed towards personnel cost associated with staffing the Domestic
Violence Hotline and includes partial funding of the following positions: the Hotline Director, 3 Supervisors for
each of the shifts; 8-Full-Time VIRA’s; 6-Part-Time VIRA’s; 3-Per Diem VIRA’s; 1 Part-Time Administrative
Assistant and the Executive Director. Funding will also be used to provide training to the Hotline staff to ensure
they are kept abreast of the best practices and industry standards for the provision of crisis intervention services
and assistance.
Goals
To provide direct services to Domestic Violence Victims for the purpose of alleviating trauma and suffering
incurred from victimization.

Priorities
Funding to support the Domestic Violence Hotline corresponds with the Authority identified funding priority of
addressing fundamental needs of victims. When victims’ call the Domestic Violence Hotline for assistance,
they are made aware of the options available to them and are provided safety planning, referrals to shelter,
counseling, legal services and referrals to numerous other forms of assistance and/or services. Additionally,
having access to the Language Line removes a considerable barrier by affording victims the opportunity to
communicate in their native language which provides a measure of relief as they seek to reclaim their lives free
of violence and abuse.

 VOCA / FFY16
July 27, 2017

Funding Prospectus
The Domestic Violence Hotline has consistently provided unparalleled assistance and support to victims of
domestic violence as well as various other stakeholders since its inception in 1998. The Domestic Violence
Hotline remains the only entity capable of directly linking victims to the services they seek by being a single
point of access to assistance. The ability to make one telephone call and obtain emotional support, safety
planning, shelter referrals, legal advocacy as well as referrals to a wide array of other services is critically
important for domestic violence victims as it eliminates many of the barriers they face when seeking to free
themselves and their dependent children from violence. There is no other Hotline in the City of Chicago/State of
Illinois with the depth of experience and quality in providing assistance, information and referrals to services,
concerned family and friends and various other community stakeholders.
The Domestic Violence Hotline has consistently exceeded the goals established for the program based the
volume of calls responded to within the City of Chicago as well as throughout the State of Illinois. During the
current grant period, the Domestic Violence Hotline staff responded to 25,076 calls between 9/1/16-6/30/17.
The projected goal for the grant period of performance was 10,800. Of those calls, 11,951 originated in Chicago
while 13,125 originated from the balance of the State. Additionally, of the total calls (25,076) 13,542 were
direct calls from victims or from third parties on behalf of victims. Victims, concerned family and friends, faith
leaders, law enforcement, and a host of community stakeholders continue to rely on the Domestic Violence
Hotline as the single point of access for domestic violence information, assistance and referrals to services.

Past Performance
In the previous grant performance period of performance (9/1/15-8/31/16) the Domestic Violence Hotline
responded to 29,093 calls. Of these calls, 17,885 originated within the City of Chicago while 11,208 originated
in the balance of the State. Additionally, of the total calls (29,093) 15,754 were direct calls from victims or
from third parties on behalf of victims. The Domestic Violence Hotline has a long standing history of providing
compassionate and comprehensive services to victims of domestic violence.

Program Description
MDT programs are designed to bridge the gaps in service for victims of domestic violence
through the establishment and implementation of model protocols and model guidelines to
enhance the criminal justice response to victims. MDT programs are multi-disciplinary and
require, at minimum, the involvement of prosecutors; law enforcement; probation; victim service
agencies; and an MDT Coordinator who convenes regular meeting of team partners to examine
the operation of team response to victims.
Program Activities
The overall focus of this Domestic Violence MDT expansion project are to identify households
that are at high-risk for future violence, proactively connect families to services, strengthen
investigation and prosecution of domestic violence offenders, provide inter-disciplinary
trainings, and to conduct ongoing self-evaluation to ensure that our pilot program continues to
benefit victims of domestic violence in the communities served.
The MDT partners will be responsible for ongoing monthly case reviews identifying trends from
case reviews that inform practices of all agencies involved, identification of training needs, long
term planning and assuring that leadership from all agencies remain involved and committed to
the MDT approach for addressing domestic violence in the City of Chicago. Various cases will
be reviewed, including cases where charges were not filed, cases that have reached disposition
and cases that have ongoing involvement with Adult Probation. During case review, team
members will have the opportunity to discuss what other evidence may have been considered,
what other questions may have been included in the victim and witness interviews, what other
sanctions may have been effective in terms of sentence and court monitoring as well as
additional services that could have proved beneficial to the survivor. These meetings will be led
by the designated Assistant State’s Attorney on the project and will be confidential in nature.

Goals
To develop and implement, or expand, a program that provides specialized criminal justice and
victim service personnel in the areas of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and
stalking through a Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) Response so that victim services can be
provided in a coordinated fashion and hold offenders accountable.
The Authority has developed standard objectives and performance measures for each component
of the MDT programs.
Priorities
At the 2013 Authority Victim Services Ad-hoc planning meeting, Multi-disciplinary Team
(MDT) Response Programs were identified as a funding priority. In July, 2015, the Authority
issued a Request for Application (RFA) seeking proposals for the development or enhancement
of sexual assault or domestic violence MDTs. Five of the eight submissions met all RFA
requirements and were recommended for funding by the review panel. The projects began
January 1, 2016.

the establishment and implementation of model protocols and model guidelines to enhance the
criminal justice response to victims. MDT programs are multi-disciplinary and require, at
minimum, the involvement of prosecutors; law enforcement; probation; victim service agencies;
and an MDT Coordinator who convenes regular meeting of team partners to examine the
operation of team response to victims. MDTs often also include unfunded partners such as
Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANE).
Program Activities
The Sexual Assault Multidisciplinary team will utilize a model that encompasses a core team for
leadership as well as a broad based multi-disciplinary team (MDT) approach through the Cook
County State’s Attorney’s Office (SAO) Sexual Assault Advisory Group. The core team will
function as a steering committee for the project and will be made up of the SAO, Rape Victim
Advocates (RVA), Chicago Police Department (CPD), The Cook County Probation Department,
Life Span and a designated SANE Nurse. This team will be responsible for ongoing monthly
case reviews (led by the Assistant State’s Attorney), identifying trends from case reviews that
inform practices of all agencies involved, identification of training needs, long term planning and
assuring that leadership from all agencies remain involved and committed to the MDT approach
for addressing sexual assault in the City of Chicago with a primary area of focus on Area North.
This core team will be responsible for ensuring a proactive, results-oriented process that
purposefully achieves the goals of the MDT model.

monthly to discuss issues related to sexual assault and stalking, problem solve, conduct case
reviews, network to build relationships and explore training needs. The focus of the Kankakee
County SART is to heighten sensitivity to victims of sexual assault and stalking while
improving the initial response, evidence collection, victim interviews, victim referrals, and
prosecution and conviction rates. The SART follows the Model Guidelines for Sex Crimes
Investigation Manual for Illinois Law Enforcement which has been updated and expanded on
to accommodate each discipline participating in the SART.

Program Activities
The Peoria County Domestic Violence Multi-Disciplinary Team (PCDV-MDT) is a
coordinated community response to domestic violence in Peoria County. The PCDV-MDT
will be comprised of 17 funded and match positions which will be utilized to assist victims
and deal with domestic violence offenders. The PCDV-MDT has team members co-located
in downtown Peoria, at The Peoria County Family Justice Center. Located across the street
from the Peoria County Courthouse, it co-locates partner agencies creating a confidential,
secure, neutral "One Stop Shop" for victims of domestic violence to access to receive
services and emotional support. The PCDV-MDT initiates contact with victims of domestic
violence as soon as possible after the incidents occur. From the time the domestic violence
occurs, until resolution of the case in civil or criminal court, as well as for the duration
offenders are participating in domestic violence counseling, or on probation, the PCDVMDT provides extensive one on one follow up to victims of domestic violence in Peoria
County. The PCDV-MDT also actively network with community agencies to assist victims

in accessing the resources they require for their safety and wellbeing. The PC-MDT
frequently partners with the Tenth judicial Circuit's Family Violence Coordinating Council
to provide training to law enforcement, courts, prosecution and to community agencies to
enhance and heighten awareness to domestic violence issues facing the community.

Illinois Department of Corrections, Regional Board of Education, Corrective Solutions, St. Clair
County Juvenile Justice Council, St. Clair County Elder Justice Council, East St. Louis Housing
Authority, local colleges and universities, and law enforcement associations.
Through this program expansion, the State’s Attorney’s Office (SAO) will, for the first time,
incorporate sexual assault and related offenses into the MDT grant. All misdemeanor classified
sexual offenses will be transferred to the courtroom that previously only handled domestic
violence and violations of orders of protection misdemeanors to facilitate the targeted
prosecution by attorneys specifically trained in the unique aspects of prosecuting sex crimes.

25

Additionally, a comprehensive training program by prosecutors will be implemented by the SAO
for law enforcement agencies throughout the county on the protocols of investigating cases of
this nature. In addition, law enforcement training will incorporate a partnered approach with
Violence Prevention Center staff and Call for Help, Inc. staff to afford victims of domestic and
sexual violence immediate services whenever possible, which is critical to not only the victims’
safety, but also their continued cooperation in the prosecution of cases.

DATE:

RE:

SFY 2018 CeaseFire
SFY 2018 Community-Based Violence Prevention and Intervention
SFY 2018 Safe From the Start

This memo describes proposed designations for SFY 2018 CeaseFire and Safe From the
Start funds and a proposed Notice of Funding Opportunity for SFY 2018 CommunityBased Violence Intervention and Prevention funds.
1. CeaseFire
The mission of CeaseFire Illinois, a unit at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of
Public Health, is to: a) work with community and government partners to reduce violence
in all forms; and b) help design interventions required to better define what should be
included in a community or city anti-violence plan. CeaseFire is an evidence-informed
public health approach to reduce violence. CeaseFire reverses the spread of violence by
using methods and strategies associated with disease control: identification and detection
of potentially violent events, individuals, and groups; interrupting transmission of
violence and risk reduction; and changing behaviors and social norms of the communities
where violence occurs. Data collection and ongoing evaluation (internal & external) help
to inform and enhance program impact.
$6,094,300 has been made available, via SB-0006, to support CeaseFire (CPP) in SFY18.
Staff recommends designating $$5,484,870 in SFY18 CPP funds to the University of
Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health to support this program.
2. Community-Based Violence Prevention and Intervention
Illinois’s SFY18 State budget includes $8,000,000 for Community-Based Violence
Prevention and Intervention (CB-VIP) grants and administration. Staff recommends that
approximately $6,700,000 – $7,200,000 be made available under a Notice of Funding
Opportunity (NOFO) with grants ranging from $100,000-$1,000,000 to support
programming for an initial 10-month period. The anticipated grant period will be Oct 1,
2017 - June 30, 2018. The NOFO will be open to public and not-for-profit entities
27

 SFY 2018 Appropriations

providing community-based violence prevention and intervention services in Illinois.
This NOFO will not be open to Cure Violence/CeaseFire (University of Illinois at
Chicago) and its sub-grantees for similar activities for the same population because they
received a separate state SFY18 appropriation for this purpose.
The target population will be youth and young adults, including, but not limited to, those
who are identified as being at heightened risk or those who engage in high risk behavior
or violence.
Program Design: ICJIA is interested in funding community-based violence prevention
initiatives. Completed applications must be reflective of the following mandatory
elements:
 Convene or expand an existing community coalition to engage service providers,
governmental agencies (local and/or statewide agencies), law enforcement, faithbased, and general community members. The purpose of the coalition is to ensure
that service providers and all potential participants are aware of violence
prevention resources available in community; to develop collaborative
partnerships to ensure that client’s immediate needs are met; and to provide prosocial activities for the community.
 Educate public about program services through wide distribution and various
types of program materials, public presentations, and awareness events.
 Implementation of at least one of the following direct service categories
(additional points will be given for applications that reflect more than one
category):
o Street Intervention/Interruption-Active Outreach and Engagement –
Programs that target at-risk youth and young adults in order to provide
crisis intervention and de-escalation of high stress situations. Examples of
promising programs include Richmond Comprehensive Homicide
Initiative, CureViolence, Operation Ceasefire, and Safe Streets.
o Counseling and Therapy - Developmentally and culturally appropriate
therapeutic services provided by a mental health professional. Effective
programs incorporate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and/or include
contingency management approaches. These programs are often individual
or family-based, such as Multisystemic Therapy, Functional Family
Therapy, Multidimensional Family Therapy, Aggression Replacement
Training, Assisted Outpatient Treatment, and Coping Power Program,
CBT for Trauma in Schools, and Good Behavior Game.
o Case Management - Supporting youth and their families in identifying and
accessing resources. Individuals at risk for involvement in street-level
violence can be difficult to engage in services. Case management
approaches that actively engage youth and families (i.e., active reaching
out, meeting youth/families in the home, community engagement) are
more effective at long-term client retention and developing trust than more
passive case management approaches (i.e., requiring youth/families to
meet in office locations).[1]

o Youth Development - Engaging young people to develop their emotional,
physical, social and intellectual selves. Program provides opportunities for
youth to practice conflict resolution and prosocial life skills. Promising
programs include the Life Skills Training (LST).
Staffing Requirements - Any staff (or volunteers) that work directly with
participants must be able to document they have received trauma-informed
training. Any staff that provide counseling or therapy must be a licensed
counselor, licensed social worker, or equivalent.
Applicant must budget for one ICJIA-coordinated one full-day meeting in
Chicago.

Applicant must comply with all prescribed assessment tools and reporting requirements.
3. Safe From the Start
The Safe From the Start (SFS) grant program is designed to assist in the development,
implementation, and evaluation of comprehensive and coordinated community-based
models to identify, assess, and serve children, (primarily ages 0-5), who have been
exposed to violence in their home and/or community.
Staff recommends designating a maximum of $1,031,400 in SFY18 SFS funds to entities

Funding Source:

Request Type:

Appropriation

Program Description
The Safe from the Start (SFS) grant program is designed to assist in the development, implementation, and
evaluation of comprehensive and coordinated community-based models to identify, assess, and serve children,
primarily ages 0 to 5, who have been exposed to violence in their home and/or community.
Program Activities
1: Provide assessment, direct services, and evaluation to children and their families who have been exposed to
violence in their home and/or communities.
2: Ensure social service and community engagement in the SFS program through collaboration and training.
3: Provide public awareness regarding children exposed to violence via presentations and community events.
Goals
SFS Program consists of three major components: coalition and collaboration building, direct services, and
public awareness. SFS programs focus on collaborating with state and community agencies to provide
individual, family, and community level supports. It is a unique, multi-disciplinary, research-driven and targeted
intervention that reaches urban, suburban, and rural Illinois families.
Priorities
The financial burden of children’s exposure to violence on other public systems, including child welfare, social
services, law enforcement, juvenile justice, and education is staggering when combined with the loss of
productivity over children’s lifetimes.1 Without intervention, young children exposed to violence are at risk for
cognitive delays and emotional and social difficulties that can lead to additional victimization and later juvenile
justice involvement.

percent of the children scored in the borderline or clinical range, representing a 33-percent CBCL score
improvement.
Following services, the percentage of caregivers scoring at or above the borderline-clinical range on the
total stress subscale of the Parental Stress Inventory (PSI) dropped from 42 percent to 33 percent,
representing a 21 percent improvement on PSI scores.

RE:

Federal Fiscal Year 2017 Residential Substance Abuse Treatment
Plan Introduction

LOCAL FUNDS
Residential Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) guidelines require that a minimum of 10
percent of each federal award must be made available to local correctional facilities. In
2016, ICJIA issued a notice of funding opportunity to solicit applications for local opioid
medication-assisted treatment services using RSAT and JAG local set-aside funds. No
applications were received and the local RSAT set-aside dollars remained unspent.
In May 2017, ICJIA issued a notice of funding opportunity to solicit applications for state
and local correctional treatment and aftercare services to be supported with anticipated
FFY17 RSAT funds and local funds remaining from the FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16
awards. The notice detailed federal RSAT requirements and model RSAT programs and
best practices. Four applications were received from state agencies, but none were
received from local agencies.
ICJIA was able to demonstrate efforts to make RSAT funds available to local programs
and the U.S. Department of Justice approved grant adjustments that removed the set-aside
requirement for the FFY14, FFY15, FFY16, and FFY17 RSAT awards. These
adjustments give the Authority the ability to use the set-aside funds to support programs
at state agencies.
The application for FFY17 RSAT funds was submitted June 28, 2017, and the award is
expected to commence October 1, 2017. ICJIA has not yet been notified of the amount of
the award, but is anticipating an award value similar to what was received in FFY16:
$334,121.

RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
Four applications were received in response to the May 2017 RSAT Notice of Funding
Opportunity. The applications were scored by a team of Authority grant and research
staff, following ICJIA’s GATA-compliant, merit-based review process. Two of the four
met the minimum scoring threshold. The FFY17 designation is contingent on the receipt
of the award. Staff recommend the following designations.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Program

Funding Source:

RSAT FFY14-17: $142,927; 25% Cash Match

Program Description
The goal of federal Resident Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) Program funding is to break
the cycle of drugs and violence by reducing the demand for and use of illegal drugs. RSAT
enhances the capabilities of states and units of local government to provide residential substance
abuse treatment for incarcerated inmates; prepares individuals for their reintegration into the
their communities by incorporating reentry planning activities into treatment programs; and
assists individuals and their communities through the reentry process with community-based
treatment and other broad-based aftercare services.
A notice of funding opportunity was released in in April 2017 inviting eligible agencies to apply
for FFY14, FFY15, FFY16, and FFY17 RSAT grant funds. The Authority conducted a Grants
Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA)–compliant, merit-based review process and
identified two programs for funding. The programs will fund competitively bid substance abuse
treatment services for either juveniles under the control of the Illinois Department of Juvenile
Justice or mentally ill, substance abusing women housed at the Illinois Department of
Corrections Logan Correctional Center.
No applications were received from local agencies.
Program Activities
The funded programs will:







Engage participants for between six and 12 months.
Provide residential treatment facilities set apart from the general correctional population,
either in a completely separate facility or dedicated housing unit in a facility exclusively
for use by RSAT participants.
Focus on the inmate’s substance use diagnosis and addiction-related needs.
Develop the inmate’s cognitive, behavioral, social, vocational, and other skills to solve
the substance use and related problems.
Require urinalysis and/or other proven reliable forms of drug and alcohol testing of
program participants, including both periodic and random testing, and of former
participants while they remain in the custody of the state or local government.
Prepare participants for successful community reintegration, including post-release
referral to appropriate evidence-based aftercare treatment and service providers that
support the use of medication-assisted treatment.

 RSAT FFY14-17
July 25, 2017

Priorities
This program addresses the JAG Corrections priority “to provide resources both to enhance the
safety of correctional facilities, victims and the public by supporting research informed or
promising behavioral change programming informed by proven risk assessment and also to
service offenders with mental illness, developmental disabilities and substance use disorders in
order to reduce reoffending, with an emphasis on programming that allows offenders to safely
remain in their communities and to pay restitution to victims of their crimes.”
Funding Prospectus
Grants initiated through a notice of funding opportunity may be supported for a maximum of
three years. Programs recommended for funding will report quarterly on the following metrics
required by the RSAT fund:






RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
Notice of Funding Opportunity: Comprehensive Law Enforcement Response to Narcotics
At the February 24, 2017, Budget Committee meeting, the committee approved the use of
$4.2 million in then-available FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16 JAG funds to issue a
competitive notice of funding opportunity in the second quarter of 2017 for

37

 JAG FFY13, FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16
July 27, 2017

comprehensive law enforcement responses to narcotics. Proposals were solicited in
March for three types of programing:
1. Police-led substance use diversion/deflection programs.
2. Multijurisdictional large-scale narcotic trafficking enforcement.
3. Multijurisdictional narcotic prosecution programs.
The three-pronged strategy is designed to address both the supply and demand for
narcotics. These three prongs include police-led diversion/deflection, multijurisdictional
large-scale narcotic trafficking enforcement, and multijurisdictional narcotic prosecution
units..
1. Police-Led Diversion/Deflection
Individuals face a range of obstacles to entering or gaining access to treatment, including
uncertainty about how to access to services, shame and stigma, denial of substance use
disorder (SUD) or substance misuse, costs and lack of insurance/Medicaid,
transportation, treatment waiting lists, and prior negative treatment experiences (Appel,
Ellison, Jansky, & Oldak, 2004). Police agencies across the nation have implemented
programs to reduce some of these obstacles. Two promising models are police deflection
and diversion programs.
Police Deflection Initiative Models
One model is “deflection,” in which police serve as a point of contact for individuals
seeking treatment (Charlier, 2015). Deflection programs entail substance users either
voluntarily contacting the police or being contacted via outreach efforts (Police-Assisted
Addiction and Recovery Initiative, 2016). Users are offered SUD treatment without fear
of arrest, and police provide referral and transportation to treatment facilities as well as
linkages to other appropriate support services (Charlier, 2015). Police can immediately
connect individuals to appropriate human and social services, including assessment, case
management, peer mentoring, and treatment, while avoiding potential criminal justice
system entry.
Diversion Initiative Models
Police diversion program models typically engage individuals after they have had
involuntary contact with police officers. The program may be offered pre-arrest or postarrest. Police diversion programs offer community-based treatment, case management,
housing, and job attainment services (Beckett, 2014; Collins, Lonczak, & Clifasefi,
2015).

2. Multijurisdictional Large-Scale Narcotic Trafficking Enforcement
Drug trafficking is the cultivation, manufacture, distribution, and sale of drugs (UNODC,
2016). Trafficking of drugs is a violent enterprise due to the need to exhibit strength and
force to competitors and rivals, as well as for retribution against lower-level distributors
who do not sell (Blumstein, 1995; Johnson, 2003). Despite violence and risk of law
enforcement involvement and punishment, the potentially great monetary rewards tempt
some into drug trafficking. Drug trafficking directly contributes to violent crime,
availability of illicit drugs, growing numbers of drug-users, and increasing numbers of
drug-related hospitalizations and deaths. Therefore, drug trafficking constitutes a major
threat to public health and the well-being of society as a whole.
To combat drug trafficking, states use multijurisdictional drug task forces, which are
made up of law enforcement officers from state, county, and local police departments to
pool resources and more efficiently and effectively combat the drug distribution in
multiple jurisdictions (Mazerolle, Soole, & Rombouts, 2007). Outcome evaluations have
found that multijurisdictional drug task forces are more effective at making more serious
drug arrests than non-drug task force law enforcement (Olson et al., 2002; McGarrell &
Schlegel, 1993; Schlegel & McGarrell, 1991; and Myrent, 2013).
3. Multijurisdictional Narcotic Prosecution Units
Multijurisdictional narcotic prosecution units were designed to address the complexities
of prosecuting drug trafficking crimes. For example, in drug trafficking cases,
prosecution need strong evidence proving the involvement in a single enterprise to
distribute narcotics, as well as an understanding the drug trafficking organization, its dayto-day operations, and links to organized crime and overseas suppliers (Natarajan, 2006).
These narcotics units work with police officers to provide prosecutorial oversight to those
cases so that the evidence will withstand legal challenges and lead to a successful
prosecution. While there is not enough research to draw conclusions on specialized
narcotic prosecution units, research examining other specialized prosecution units
showed the units reduced the likelihood of case rejection; cases were likely to move
forward to the next stage of adjudication (Pyrooz, Wolfe, & Spohn, 2011).
This table compares available fund distribution within the 2017 funding opportunity’s
three categories with how JAG funds were previously distributed to the programs. Staff
requests permission to use its discretion to be able to adjust the distribution in categories
where funds are not used.

Continuations of Current Programs
As Director Maki explained in his January 23, 2017, memorandum to the Board ICJIA
will be using standardized Notice of Funding Opportunities (NOFO) to make JAG
awards, as required by the Grants Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) and
ICJIA’s Strategic Plan for JAG. Given ICJIA’s current staffing levels, it is not possible to
transition all JAG programs simultaneously to NOFO-driven awards; therefore, staff has
grouped the JAG programs into four primary strategic areas and will issue a staggered
series of corresponding NOFOs to which potential grantees will be able to apply over the
next two years per the schedule below.

Rockford Partnerships to Reduce Violent Crime Designation Increase
In August 2016, the Budget Committee approved a designation to the Rockford
Metropolitan Agency for Planning (RMAP) to implement the Illinois Partnerships to
Reduce Violent Crime program. That designation was for nine months of partnership
planning, including completing the Problem-Oriented Policing Scanning, Analysis,
Response and Assessment process, the Violence Reduction Assessment Tool (process,
and building local research and evaluation capacity, and development of plan to
implement procedural justice and focused deterrence. Reports from RMAP indicate that it
will not be able to complete all of these tasks on their accelerated schedule. Staff are
recommending an increase of $25,204 to RMAP’s FFY14 JAG designation to extend its
agreement to the full 12-month period of performance for a total designation of $181,098.
The additional funds will support the program coordinator and software licenses for three
months, as detailed below.

for three types of programs comprising a comprehensive law enforcement response to narcotics:
law enforcement-based deflection and diversion programs, multijurisdictional large-scale
trafficking enforcement programs, and multijurisdictional narcotic prosecution programs. The
goal of this solicitation is to increase public safety and reduce the large social and economic cost
of drugs use through specialized enforcement and prosecution of drug traffickers and the use of
treatment over incarceration for low-level offenders.
The Authority implemented a GATA-compliant merit-based review process in which
applications were reviewed and scored by a team of Authority grant and research staff.
Applicants were screened for GATA compliance and supplanting. Three proposals are
recommended are funded based on this process.
Program Activities
Law enforcement agencies have recognized that arrest and prosecution of low level drug users
does not enhance community safety or effectively reduce demand, as drug users repeatedly cycle
through the criminal justice system but never address their addiction. In response, law
enforcement agencies have crafted new models to reduce demand by deflecting drug users from
involvement in the criminal justice to meaningful treatment, and to divert arrested low level
offenders from prosecution to treatment. The three programs recommended for funding are built
on partnerships with community health care and substance abuse treatment resources as well as
prosecutors that will link drug users with the opportunity for treatment rather than incarceration.
To be eligible for funding, diversion/deflection programs must:




 

Be run by a local law enforcement agency, county sheriff’s department, or a multijurisdictional cooperative law enforcement unit for which an Implementing Agency has
been identified.
Have developed a plan to make potential clients and referral sources aware of the services
available.

July 27, 2017



Have a plan to coordinate program activities with community agencies in the service
area, including substance abuse treatment, medical care and supportive service providers
as well as relevant government agencies.

Goals
To increase public safety and reduce the large social and economic cost of narcotics use through
the use of specialized enforcement and prosecution of drug traffickers and the use of treatment
over incarceration for low-level offenders.
Priorities
The recommended programs address the following JAG Goals/Priority for Drug Enforcement
and Treatment Programs:
Goal: To support research-informed and promising drug enforcement and treatment efforts by
providing resources to programs that break the cycle of system involvement in the criminal
justice system for people who abuse legal and illegal drugs and substances, that ensure the safety
of the crime victim and the public, and that promote the payment of restitution to crime victims
and to support evidence based programs that enhance public safety and reduce the amount of
drugs and substances illegally manufactured and distributed.
Funding Prospectus
Under the Grants Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) grants are initiated through a
Notice of Funding Opportunity process. Grants initiated through a NOFO may be supported for a
maximum of three years.

applications were reviewed and scored by a team of Authority grant and research staff.
Applicants were screened for GATA compliance and supplanting. Three proposals are
recommended are funded based on this process.
Program Activities
In order to combat drug trafficking, states use multijurisdictional drug task forces, which are
made up of law enforcement officers from state, county, and local police departments to pool
resources and more efficiently and effectively combat the drug distribution in multiple
jurisdictions (Mazerolle, Soole, & Rombouts, 2007). Outcome evaluations have found that
multijurisdictional drug task forces are more effective at making more serious drug arrests than
non-drug task force law enforcement (Olson et al., 2002; McGarrell & Schlegel, 1993; Schlegel
& McGarrell, 1991; and Myrent, 2013).
To be eligible for funding, drug trafficking enforcement programs must:
 Be run by a cooperative unit comprised of three or more law enforcement agencies for
which an Implementing Agency has been identified.
 Have a written interagency agreement between all participating agencies defining
activities and responsibilities.
 Have a prosecutor statement demonstrating collaborative involvement with the member
agencies toward meeting the unit’s goals and objectives.
 Have a plan of intelligence sharing via computerized networking.
 Have a plan for forfeiture sharing, including how funds will be used.
 Have a commitment for staffing by all participating agencies.

Applicants were screened for GATA compliance and supplanting. Three proposals are
recommended are funded based on this process.
Program Activities
Drug prosecution units were designed to address the complexities of prosecuting drug trafficking
crimes. For example, in drug trafficking cases, the prosecution needs strong evidence proving the
involvement in a single enterprise to distribute drugs, as well as an understanding the drug
trafficking organization, its day-to-day operations, and links to organized crime and overseas
suppliers (Natarajan, 2006). These drugs units work with law enforcement officers to provide
prosecutorial oversight to those cases so that the evidence will withstand legal challenges and
lead to a successful prosecution. While there is not enough research to draw conclusions on
specialized drug prosecution units, research examining other specialized prosecution units have
shown these units reduce the likelihood of case rejection (Pyrooz, Wolfe, & Spohn, 2011).
To be eligible for funding, drug prosecution programs must:



 

Be run by a county state’s attorney’s office or The Office of the State’s Attorney’s
Appellate Prosecutor.
Have a written statement demonstrating collaborative involvement with one or more drug
trafficking enforcement unit, as defined in Category 3.

Cook County Public Defender’s Office DNA & Digital Evidence Litigation Program

Funding Source:

Federal Fiscal Year 2016 Justice Assistance Grant: $29,355.00

Request Type:

Continuation

Program Description
The Forensic Science DNA and Digital Evidence Litigation Program will allow the Cook County Public
Defender’s Office (CCPDO) to continue to improve its ability to effectively investigate, analyze, and litigate
cases involving DNA and digital evidence. The program will provide training to 12 in two areas of forensic
science: 1) quantitative aspects of DNA litigation and 2) digital evidence.
These attorneys will work with assistant public defenders on DNA and digital forensic science cases. Served by
this program will be indigent persons accused of crimes in Cook County. Their demographic characteristics
resemble individuals who pass through Cook County Jail, of whom approximately 67 percent are African
American, 20 percent are Hispanic, and 13 percent are White. The designation will enable the CCPDO to
provide professional development in a complex field of science, expand the courses available to the public
defenders, and expand the number of speakers for the DNA Conference. Specialized classes will be taught by
professors and/or experts that are considered highly qualified in these fields.
The Cook County Forensic Science Defense program will train forensic science defense (FSD) attorneys,
investigators, and paralegals in the quantitative aspects of forensic DNA analysis and digital forensic science.
This will allow the CCPDO to meet changing needs to effectively represent its clients. In DNA cases, FSD
attorneys will represent clients, consult with other attorneys, and share training with approximately 150 assistant
public defenders throughout the office each year. In digital forensic science cases, the FSD expects to represent
clients, consult with other assistants, and share training with at least 12 assistants over 12 months, and likely a
sizable and growing number more in years to come.
The program will be established and maintained within Cook County and training will be provided for
personnel throughout the State of Illinois. The program also will enable the CCPDO to establish a DNA
conference, which will be approved for Continuing Legal Education (CLE) credit. Guest speakers that are
considered experts in the field will be brought in to cover areas where specialized training is needed.
Program Activities
The requested funding for the proposed grant program will allow the CCPDO to improve its ability to
effectively investigate, analyze, and litigate cases involving forensic evidence litigation for its indigent clients.
CCPDO will create an internal system to sustain and apply the program’s benefits throughout the office via
consultations and trainings for attorneys addressing cases with potential forensic evidence issues.

Goal 2: Train Forensic Science Division attorneys in digital forensic science
Goal 3: Conduct a DNA conference on advanced DNA issues to train more than 100 public defenders, pro bono
attorneys, and others from Cook County and throughout Illinois.
Priorities
This program falls under the JAG Prosecution and Court Program Purpose Area and it addresses the Cook
County Public Defender’s priority to effectively investigate, analyze, and litigate cases involving DNA and
digital evidence. The program will provide professional training in forensic science regarding; quantitative
aspects of DNA litigation, and digital evidence.
Funding Prospectus
Attorneys with the Forensic Science DNA Program will complete monthly statistics and activity reports,
capturing all important indicators. Designated support staff will collect this data in a database, which will be
used to generate quarterly reports of all grant activities. This data will also be used to provide continuous
feedback to staff with the aim of improving performance and assessing the needs of indigent clients. In addition,
the program has all necessary training evaluation forms, pre-tests and post-tests, and other documentation
needed to collect and report all grant activities.
The program offers the unit a unique perspective in addressing many aspects of evidence litigation regarding
DNA and digital evidence. This table outlines successful contributions and attendance during the October 1,

Continuation

Program Description
The Office of the State Appellate Defender is requesting a grant to provide public defenders in counties with
populations of less than 200,000 resources to hire investigators, medical consultants, psychiatrists, and other
experts to assist in the defense of indigent clients.
These services were discontinued when Authority-administered funding for the program was not renewed in
2006. The availability of expert witness and investigative services often determines whether a defendant in a
criminal case receives effective representation yet the resources available to Illinois counties to provide such
services are limited. This program will directly address this problem by providing public defenders the
resources needed to adequately and properly investigate cases and defend indigent clients.
Program Activities
The Rural Defense Services Program will allow public defenders in rural counties to more effectively represent
their indigent clients by making available to them expert witnesses and investigative services.
Goals
The goal of this program is to provide expert consultants and investigator services to public defendants in
counties with populations of less than 200,000.
Priorities
The program addresses the JAG Priority of Courts, Prosecutions, Defense and Community Corrections to
“support and enhance court initiatives, including specialty courts that contribute to the effectiveness and
efficiency of the criminal justice court system in all facets-the judiciary, clerks, prosecution, defense, and

This program was supported with Authority-administered funding from 2003 to 2006.
In the program’s first year, the assistance of experts and investigators were provided in more than 70
cases across 17 counties.
In the second year of the program, investigators, pathologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and DNA
experts were provided in more than 100 cases across 25 counties.
In the program’s third year, investigators, pathologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, pharmacologist,
DNA expert, and crime scene experts were provided in more than 82 cases across 27 counties.
In the fourth and final year of the program, investigators, pathologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, DNA
expert and nine other experts were provided in 55 cases across 27 counties. The final grant period lasted
only 9 months.
During a funded period of 2003 to 2006, the program was successful in accomplishing its goals and
objectives by providing public defenders with investigators and services for indigent clients in more than
300 cases. Public defenders have indicated that the program allowed them to more effectively represent
their clients. The availability of expert witness and investigative services often determines whether a
defendant in a criminal case receives effective representation. The resources available to Illinois counties

Program Name:

Illinois Center of Excellence for Behavioral Health and Justice

Funding Source:

FFY15 Justice Assistance Grant: $164,779.00; $0 Cash Match

Program Description
The need for the Illinois Center of Excellence for Behavioral Health and Justice was identified in a 2008
strategic plan by the Illinois Department of Human Services Division of Mental Health, facilitated by Policy
Research Associates/The GAINS Center to better address the needs of individuals with mental illnesses and cooccurring substance use disorders and criminal justice system involvement. A recommendation was made to
create an institution where learning and resources could be coordinated and disseminated in a strategic way to
promote research, program development, and program expansion. In addition, the Illinois Supreme Court
Special Judicial Advisory Committee for Justice and Mental Health Planning, created in 2010 in part to explore
maximizing the use of court and community resources to rehabilitate accused individuals with mental health
and substance use disorders, recommended the creation of a Center of Excellence (COE) in Illinois.
Program Activities
The criminal justice system is overwhelmed with persons with mental health and substance use disorders that
could be better served in the community. Evidence-based community treatment settings provide cost savings,
reduce recidivism, increase public safety, and increase the quality of life. The COE provides
communities/circuit courts training and technical assistance to increase knowledge on implementing best
practices to divert people with mental illness and substance use from the criminal justice system. Training and
technical assistance is tailored to the jurisdiction based on its unique resources and circumstances.
Priorities
The program focuses on the following six JAG priorities:
#1 Law Enforcement and #4 State Corrections. The COE provides training regarding mental illness, substance
abuse, and trauma for law enforcement and corrections.
#2 Courts, Prosecution, Defense and Community Corrections. The COE provides training and technical
assistance throughout the state on evidenced-based practices, including diversion programs.
#5 Justice Information Sharing. The COE collaborates with many state agencies such as Illinois Criminal
Justice Information Authority, Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts, Illinois Supreme Court, and Illinois
Association of Problem-Solving Courts to ensure the criminal justice system has timely information.
#6 Recidivism Reduction. The COE provides training on evidence-based practices/programs, screening and
assessment tools, and how to implement best practices for problem-solving courts.
#7 Justice Research and Evaluation. The COE works with Adult Redeploy Illinois, Sentencing Police Advisory
Committee and ICJIA to research individuals with mental illness or substance abuse issues, encourage problemsolving courts to provide information and statistics, and make available this knowledge to policy makers and
practitioners.

Program Name:

Be Well Partners in Health, LLC: Therapeutic Diversion

Funding Source:

Federal Fiscal Year 2015 Justice Assistance Grant: $296,071.00; 0% Matching
Funds

Program Description
Be Well care managers assist the Cook County Sheriff’s Department of Mental Health Policy and Advocacy
with mental health screening for all arrestees that are brought to Division 5 receiving at Cook County
Department of Corrections (CCDOC) (pre-bond) Monday through Friday. Arrestees who identify as having a
medical, mental health, and/or substance abuse treatment need are offered community-based care coordination
services in the event they are released on I-Bond or electronic monitoring after bond court.
The collaborative screening process generates a list of potential referrals. The goal is to contact arrestees 24 to
48 hours from time of release to determine motivation to engage in services and complete an initial needs
assessment. Care managers then schedule a meeting with the client in the community to engage the client in the
care coordination process with a more comprehensive behavioral health assessment.
The Be Well Care Coordination Model focuses on the following evidence-based functions: assessment, care
planning, implementation, teaching/coaching, medication management, referral, monitoring and evaluation,
communication, and advocacy. This occurs through in-person meetings, phone contact, at court, or on CCDOC
premises in the event the client becomes incarcerated.
The overall goal of engaging potential clients in the Be Well Care Coordination Model is to understand and
articulate the issues that resulted in incarceration, develop a care plan with reasonable short-term and long-term
goals, teach models of self-care, link with appropriate treatment team members (medical/psychiatric/chemical
dependency/others), and divert them from re-incarceration.
Program Activities
An estimated 33 percent of the Cook County Jail population suffer with a mental illness and more than 70
percent of them have a co-occurring substance abuse disorder. The Therapeutic Diversion Project aims to assist
arrestees with mental health and/or substance treatment needs by providing community-based care coordination
services. Program participants are identified by Be Well care managers and the Cook County Sheriff’s Office’s
Office of Mental Health Policy and Advocacy. Be Well care managers are on site at CCDOC five days per
week helping to provide mental health screens for all arrestees arriving at Division 5 Receiving prior to central
bond court.
Individuals who are identified as needing support in the areas of mental health, substance abuse, and/or primary
care are offered services in the event that they leave the jail on I-Bond or electronic monitoring. Be Well care
managers conduct outreach, engage, and assess these individuals in their communities or at court to provide
support and linkage to medical and/or community-based services with the goal of reducing risks, improving
strengths, and avoiding incarceration.

 JAG / FFY14
August 8, 2016

The strategy is to utilize CCDOC as a care coordination site through a program that includes assessments,
coordinated care planning, implementation, and monitoring/evaluation. This also allows them to provide
intensive support to the 30 percent of their clients that are on electronic monitoring.
Goals
Current goals for program participants are (1) to understand and articulate the issues that lead to
arrest/incarceration; (2) develop a care plan and action plan with reasonable goals; (3) learn models of self-care;
(4) link to treatment providers; (5) obtain & maintain a medication adherence program (when appropriate).
Be Well is on target to meet the goal of outreach and engagement of 500 clients over the course of one year.
Participants that become fully engaged remain in the project for six months. Be Well’s aim is for a reincarceration rate of 50 percent or below among clients fully engaged with the project.
Priorities
The program focuses on the JAG Reentry Services priority. Be Well’s primary goal is to prevent or reduce
recidivism among individuals with mental illness and/or substance abuse disorders through engagement in the
care coordination process. The agency’s community-based model allows it to provide services to participants
while addressing the social and environmental issues that contributed to their arrest.
Funding Prospectus
Renewal of funding for this project is imperative to continue the care coordination process both on-site during
pre-bond assessments and in the community with individuals who lack access to other resources and support.
Key accomplishments of the program to date include:





Rate of incarceration for active clients is 12% (cumulative), well below the 50% target.
A large volume of referrals from the pre-bond screening process totaling more than 750 from between
October 2016 and June 2017. This demonstrates a clear service need.
Be Well care coordinators have conducted outreach, engagement, and/or assessment to more than 400
individuals between October 2016 and June 2017.
As of June 30, Be Well care coordinators had fully engaged 104 clients in the assessment and care
planning process.

As part of the Cook County Sheriff’s Enhanced Discharge Initiative, Be Well care coordinators have been
referred to detainees who have requested assistance with discharge planning and community-based care
coordination upon community reentry. Be Well staff works alongside Cook County Sheriff Office (CCSO) staff
to build rapport with potential clients, increasing the likelihood that those individuals will engage in reentry
services upon release. This referral process was initiated in March 2017 with 15 detainees referred to Be Well
for assessment and engaged in services while still detained at CCDOC.
The participants with whom Be Well engaged this project are living in the community, awaiting court dates, and
have limited access to resources or knowledge of the health care system. Be Well has city-wide network of
partnering providers that are willing and available to provide medical, mental health, and substance abuse
services to justice-involved individuals. Be Well’s community-based care coordination model, implemented by
licensed care managers, allows Be Well to provide comprehensive assessment, care planning and therapeutic

support while they work on aligning the participant to the appropriate service provider. Be Well’s involvement
in pre-bond mental health screens has allowed CCSO to offer services to any arrestee who indicates that he or
she is in need of community-based assistance. The confounding legal, medical, mental health, substance use,
social, financial and environmental variables clients face place them at risk for recidivism and creates an intense
service need.

Program Description
The Haymarket Center Women’s Residential Treatment Program began in FFY09 with American Recovery &
Reinvestment Act Justice Assistance Grant funding. When that funding period ended, Justice Assistance Grant
(JAG) funds were made available to continue the program.
Program Activities
Haymarket Center provides comprehensive treatment and support services in an eight-bed recovery home to
women identified by the Cook County Sheriff’s Women’s Justice Programs (SWJP) and the Cook County
Sheriff’s Police Department Vice Unit as victims of human trafficking and/or prostitution. Transitional housing
and services are provided for up to 90 days per client.
Goals
Goal #1
Reduce incarceration among women referred by the Sheriff’s Women’s Justice Programs (SWJP) through
provision of supported transitional housing.
Goal #2
Improve public safety and reduce recidivism among women referred by SWJP through provision of counseling
and supportive services designed to address barriers to maintaining stability and a crime-free life in the
community.
Priorities
The program addresses the JAG Prevention and Intervention priority to “support proven and innovative
prevention and intervention programs for young people at risk of involvement in the criminal justice system.
These programs should address recognized risk factors, enhance protective factors and help young people avoid
involvement with violent crime, drugs, gangs, guns and other criminal behavior. In setting priorities for JAG

Request Type:

Continuation

Program Description
The need for this program was identified at the Authority’s 2000 statewide planning summit. The program was
first funded through the Edward Byrne Memorial Anti-Drug Abuse Act and has been continued with Justice
Assistance Grant (JAG) funding.
Program Activities
The Community-Based Residential Treatment for Adults pre-release program design provides for a structured
environment that includes strict expectations for behavior, participation, and active involvement during
substance abuse treatment programming at an Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) Adult Transition
Center (ATC). Treatment services focus on the reintegration of the offender into the greater community, with a
particular emphasis on employment and confinement. Treatment is specific to maintaining abstinence and
preventing relapse and vigorously promotes personal responsibility and positive character change.
After release from the ATC, participants receive individualized case management. They receive referrals and
linkages to community-based agencies and services. Post-release, case managers may assist participants with
appointments, goal setting, acquiring identification, job search, housing, admittance to educational or vocational
programs, childcare, transportation, and other services as needed on an individual basis. They work to create
linkages to services, supports, and resources in the community, including recovery home beds, and facilitate
admission to treatment and other support programs.
Goals
Goal #1:
The overall goal of this project is to reduce drug use/abuse and criminal behavior through substance abuse
interventions and community-based reentry programming. It is expected that this program will help restore exoffenders to full citizenship, including participation in and responsibility for their families and fellow
community residents. The ultimate goal will be to restore the ex-offenders’ sense of self-worth, revitalize family
ties and obligations, and bring about social reintegration.
