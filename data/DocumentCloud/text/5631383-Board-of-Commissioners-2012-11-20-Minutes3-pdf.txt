 There being no questions or discussion, Chairwoman Scott thereupon declared said Motion
carried and said resolutions adopted.
In the absence of Committee Chair Young, Commissioner Mildred Harris, presented the report
for the Tenant Services Committee. Per Commissioner Harris, the Tenant Services Committee
Meeting was held on Wednesday, November 14, 2012 at approximately 1:20 p.m. at the 60 East
Van Buren Corporate Offices.
Commissioner Harris then presented a Motion for approval of the resolutions for Items D1 and
D2 discussed, voted and recommended for approval by the Tenant Services Committee
members.
(Item D1)
The resolution for Item D1 approves the third one-year option of contracts with Service
Providers Centers for New Horizons (CNH), Employment and Employers Services (EES),
Heartland Human Care Services (HHCS), Metropolitan Family Services (MFS) and Uhlich
Children’s Advantage Network (UCAN). This resolution also approves award of contract to
Brinshore Michaels Taylor LLC (BMT), Eastlake Management, LR ABLA LLC, Stateway
Associates and Holsten Real Estate Development Corporation as Service Providers. Resident
Services previously entered into contracts with the ten agencies for service provision in 2012.
Five of these contracts were initiated through a non-competitive procurement based on the
Master Development Agreements (MDA) with the developers at mixed income sites (BMT,
Eastlake, Holsten, LR ABLA and Stateway). The other five were initiated based on a
competitive procurement completed in 2009 for the FamilyWorks program (CNH, EES, HHCS,
MFS and UCAN). As part of CHA’s strategic planning process, Resident Services desires to
begin implementing its reimagined service model in 2013. Major changes to the service model
include segmenting the resident population to ensure services better address the individual needs
of families based on their circumstances, instead of providing the same case management
services for all public housing families. These changes will create capacity for service providers
to begin providing additional services to the Housing Choice Voucher population. By exercising
a remaining option year with the FamilyWorks providers and entering into new contracts with
the mixed-income providers identified through the MDAs, changes to the reimagined service
model may be implemented quickly and efficiently. This will allow the new program areas to
take hold while causing minimal disruption to residents. During 2013, a new RFP will be
released to fully transition to the new model for services in 2014. Service providers will work
closely with CHA staff and property management to facilitate communication and coordination
of resident needs. The ten agencies are assigned to specific zip codes and/or mixed-income
properties throughout the City of Chicago and will be available to provide various levels of
service to more than 10,000 CHA families in 2013.
RESOLUTION NO. 2012-CHA-93

These awards are subject to each Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance
requirements.

(Item D2)
As part of CHA’s Section 3 policy, CHA is required to do business with Section 3 Business
Concerns, which include Resident Owned Businesses. When fulfilling Section 3 goals through
contracting, CHA can contract directly with a Section 3 business or contract with vendors that
subcontract to a Section 3 business. CHA encourages Section 3 Business Concerns (including
Resident Owned Businesses) to apply for contracting opportunities through the competitive
procurement process. Accordingly, the CHA advertised a Request for Proposal for a Business
Entrepreneurship Development Program for CHA Residents. The Business Development
Program will support CHA’s commitment to Section 3 business concerns. Through the Program,
participants will develop the skills necessary to fully execute a business plan, learn how to
network with other business owners, successfully market their business, and apply for
contracting opportunities throughout the city of Chicago and surrounding area. Based on the
recommendation of the evaluation team, Chicago Urban League was determined to be the lowest
responsive and responsible bidder. Accordingly, the resolution for Item D2 approves contract
award to the Chicago Urban League. It is anticipated that 80 residents will participate in this
program during the two-year base term. Since 2007 the Chicago Urban League has successfully
provided business development and entrepreneurial training for Chicago-land residents.
Through the recommended contract, the Urban League will increase capacity of its existing
programs and provide participants with access to its vast network of available services.
RESOLUTION NO. 2012-CHA-94
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated November 14,
2012 entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A TWO-YEAR

(Item E4 – THIS NUMBER NOT USED)
(Item E5)
The resolution for Item E5 approves the 2nd of two one-year options on a and Lease Agreement
between the CHA and Sinai Health Center for the 2600 and 2700 Block of Ogden and the 2600
Block of 13th Place. The former Lawndale Complex/Ogden Courts residential development were
demolished in 2001 and 2006, respectively. Both developments are now vacant land. Sinai
Health System proposed and entered into a lease to build and maintain a Sinai staff parking lot
on approximately 75% of the Lawndale Complex/Ogden Courts site. The purpose of
constructing the parking lot was to reduce the traffic and parking congestion in the community.
Adjacent to the leased parking lot site on land formerly owned by the City of Chicago and a
portion of the Lawndale Complex site is Park Douglas, a 137 unit mixed income development.
The purpose of this lease is to improve the quality of life for public housing residents, Sinai staff
and visitors, and residents residing in the area surrounding the site. The site is being leased at
less than fair market value; however, there is an additional commensurate benefit to the Park
Douglas community due to the fact that Sinai provides family support and medical services,
training and employment opportunities for CHA residents. Jobs were generated for the
construction of the parking lot, the operation of the parking lot and for hospital support duties.
RESOLUTION NO. 2012-CHA-98
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated November 14,
2012, requesting authorization to execute the second of two one-year options on a
land lease agreement with Sinai Health System on CHA’s vacant Lawndale

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee
to execute the 2nd of two one-year options on a land lease agreement with Sinai
Health System on CHA’s vacant Lawndale Complex and Ogden Courts property
sites located at the 2600 and the 2700 block of Ogden Avenue and 2600 block of
13th Place.

Nays:

There being no questions or discussion, Chairwoman Scott thereupon declared said Motion
carried and said resolutions adopted.
Commissioner Adela Cepeda, Chairwoman of the Finance Committee, then presented her report.
Per Commissioner Cepeda, the Finance Committee meeting was held on Wednesday, November
14, 2012 at approximately 2:45 p.m. at the 60 E. Van Buren Corporate Offices. Linda Riley
Mitchell, Chief Financial Officer and staff presented the Committee with the September 30, 2012
Interim financial Report and the October 2012 Treasury and Cash Flow Report.
Commissioner Cepeda then presented an Omnibus Motion for the following three items
discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Finance Committee.
(Item F1)
The CHA’s business processes have evolved considerably since the initial document
management implementation of the FileNet system and the system’s configured indexes no
longer align optimally with changes to the CHA’s business processes. As a result, the CHA
reviewed the actual use of the document management system and solicited possible
enhancements that might be needed and work flow requirements from the CHA’s user
community. In order to better manage its information assets and achieve efficiencies in its
business processes, the CHA seeks to implement a new SharePoint Enterprise Content
Management System solution that provides the complete functionality of automated records
management systems (capture, index, store, track, retrieve, archive, dispose and report) and
transforms enterprise-based, manual processes into automated flows. The CHA advertised a
Request for Proposal in May 2012 for the implementation of a Sharepoint Enterprise Content
Management System Solution. The RFB was advertised in area newspapers and on CHA’s
website. Of the four proposals received, Catalyst Consulting Group was deemed to be the most
responsive and responsible bidder. Accordingly, the resolution for Item F1 awards a contract to
Catalyst Consulting Group, not-to-exceed $4,231,168, to implement a Sharepoint Enterprise
Content Management System Solution.
RESOLUTION NO. 2012-CHA-99
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated November 14,
2012, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH
CATALYST CONSULTING GROUP TO IMPLEMENT A SHAREPOINT
ENTERPRISE CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM”;

11

 THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners (“Board”) authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or
his designee to enter into a contract with Catalyst Consulting Group to implement
a SharePoint Enterprise Content Management System in an amount not to exceed
$4,231,168.00, including two (2) one year maintenance and support options.
These awards are subject to each Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance
requirements.

(Item F2)
The resolution for Item F2 approves a one year extension of the agreement with IBM for FileNet
Maintenance and support service, not-to-exceed $117,551.94. The CHA utilizes the EDMS /
FileNet application extensively in our daily operations. EDMS supports departments such as
Housing Choice Voucher, Finance, Development Management and Resident Services by
providing the ability to store, maintain, retrieve and archive electronic records. To date over 7
million documents are stored in the CHA’s EDMS repository. Prudent business practices dictate
having maintenance agreements in place with the system’s developer in order to obtain
preventative and remedial maintenance. Maintenance support typically consists of software
upgrades, bug fixes and remote telephonic and electronic support. Having a maintenance
agreement in effect decreases the risks of potentially adverse impact from a system outage by
reducing restoration time and increasing system availability.

RESOLUTION NO. 2012-CHA-100
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated November 14,
2012 entitled,” AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A ONE (1) YEAR
EXTENSION OF THE AGREEMENT WITH IBM FOR FILENET
MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT SERVICES”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a one (1) year extension of the Software Support Agreement
with IBM for FileNet maintenance and support services on a fixed rate basis and
schedule for additional compensation not to exceed $117,551.94 for the one year
term.
These awards are subject to each Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance
requirements.

(Item F3)
The CHA’s current contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) for employee healthcare plan
benefits (medical and dental) will terminate on December 31, 2012. Accordingly, the resolution
for Item F3 approves amendment and extension of Contract No. 11070, not-to-exceed
$6,274,012.00, with BCBS for the CHA Employees Health Benefit Plans. HUD has previously
authorized the CHA to utilize its insurance Broker of Record to solicit competitive insurance
12

 bids on behalf of the CHA. Although CHA did not receive guaranteed medical premium rates
for FY 2013, CHA estimated an increase of $450,000 for FY 2013 for an amount not-to-exceed
$5,400,000.00 based on projected increases in medical insurance premiums for FY2013 for all
BCBS clients and a possible enrollment increase during the plan year for 2013. Essentially,
medical renewal rates are based on claims experience, promptness of payment of premiums, the
size of the group and the number of months of claims experience used to evaluate renewals. The
trend factor for BCBS renewals are currently averaging at 12.5% across organizational size
similar to CHA. However, after experiencing $1.2 million in “shock” claims and the migration of
42 participants from the HMO to PPO plan, CHA’s costs increased by 21%. The not-to-exceed
amounts of $6,274,012.00 for both medical and dental benefit plans reflect the total amount of
premiums needed to cover the projected headcount of CHA’s eligible participants and the
eligible participants of CHA’s affiliates. As in previous years, CHA’s affiliates will reimburse
CHA for 100% of the premiums needed to cover their eligible participating employees for the
above referenced Employee Health Benefit Plans during the term of these contracts, which will
be an offset to the total not-to-exceed amount of premiums.
RESOLUTION NO. 2012-CHA-101
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated November 14,
2012 entitled “ AUTHORIZATION TO AMEND AND EXTEND CONTRACT
NO. 11070 WITH BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD (MEDICAL AND DENTAL)
FOR THE CHA’S EMPLOYEE HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners (1) authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to amend and extend Contract No. 11070 with Blue Cross Blue Shield
for one year extension for FY2013 for medical benefits and employee dental
benefits and (2) approves funding therefor in an amount not to exceed
$5,985,074.00 and $288,938.00 for medical and dental benefits, respectively, for
an aggregate amount of $6,274,012.00 for FY2013, covering eligible participants
of the CHA and eligible participants of the CHA affiliates.

There being no questions or discussion, Chairwoman Scott thereupon declared said Motion
