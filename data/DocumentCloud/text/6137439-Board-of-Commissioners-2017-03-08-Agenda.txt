PROPOSED RESOLUTION
URGING THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO PASS A PROPERTY TAX FREEZE
WHEREAS, the national average residential effective property tax rate is only about 1.5%, even in
urban areas, and
WHEREAS, homeowners in Illinois have the second-highest property taxes in the nation; and
WHEREAS, local spending is increasing at alarming rates, contributing to the debts across the State of
Illinois; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has not increased its property tax levy since 1994; and
WHEREAS, property taxes are increasing while home values are still lower than 2007 values; and
WHEREAS, a property tax freeze would give local control over property tax levies, taxing bodies
would increase property taxes through
voter referendum, and local taxing bodies would be held
accountable and be forced to control their spending; and
WHEREAS, a property tax freeze would alleviate some of the struggles homeowners experience with
homeownership; and
WHEREAS, high property taxes in Illinois disproportionately hurt the poor and minorities; and
WHEREAS, in Maywood, the effective residential property tax rate is 5.29%, in Bellwood, the effective
residential property tax rate is 5.21%, and in south suburban Riverdale a home owner that sold their
home for $7,500 paid a $2,825 per year property tax bill, which is an effective tax rate of 38 percent, and
over ten years that home owner would pay three times what their property is worth in property taxes; and
WHEREAS, over a sixteen year period from 2007 to 2023, homeowners in five south suburban
communities would have paid more than twice their home’s full value in property taxes; and
WHEREAS, over that same sixteen year period 35 other communities will have paid more than 100
percent of their home’s value in property taxes; and
WHEREAS, in suburban Cook County nine of the ten worst housing markets are in the south suburbs;
and

WHEREAS, a total of 21 of 51 south Cook County suburbs now have median sale prices of less than
$100,000; while no suburb had a median sales price below $100,000 in 2007; and since 2007 the south
suburbs of Riverdale, Harvey, Phoenix, Crestwood, Markham, Robbins, Calumet City, Dixmoor, Sauk
Village, Posen, Hometown, and South Chicago Heights have seen their property values diminish by over
50%; and
WHEREAS, high property taxes are a major factor for families leaving Illinois, a property tax freeze
would encourage residents to stay in Illinois, and further benefit the state’s economy; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby urge the Governor’s office, and the Illinois General Assembly to support, and pass a property tax
freeze in order to ease the burden of Illinois residents, especially those that are disproportionately
affected by the high tax rates in poor communities...end

Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location: City of Palos Hills
Volume and Property Index Number:
151, 23-14-400-039-0000.
Summary: As the City Attorney, I have been directed by the City Council of Palos Hills to request
participation in the 2017 No Cash Bid Program. The following is submitted for your consideration. One
parcel is sought by the City. The property is improved with an old racquet club, which has been
abandoned and unoccupied for over 15 years. The terrible condition of the building poses a significant
risk to the safety of children living in the area. The City intends to demolish the building, restore the land
and keep and maintain it as open land or a park for the benefit of the community.

The City will file for tax exempt status because the property will be for municipal use. There are no third
party requests for the parcel. Also, the City will pay all costs associated with this acquisition, including
my fees as City Attorney. It will submit a description of the status of the parcel to the Cook County
Planning & Development Department as required by the Cook County No Cash Bid Ordinance. This
report will be filed each year for the next five years or until development is complete, whatever occurs
last.

The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: The Cook County Department of Environmental Control requests authorization for the Chief
Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a contract with Primera Engineers, Ltd. for a feasibility
and engineering analyses on public and private properties, as part of the work under a U.S. Department
of Energy (DOE) Solar Market Pathways (SMP) SunShot III grant.
This grant project includes
developing case studies for a number of demonstration pilot sites that can potentially host community
solar arrays.

Primera Engineers, Ltd. will conduct a structural assessment of the rooftop or land parcel to determine
the suitability for solar photovoltaic arrays, as well as a detailed financial analysis that includes solar
photovoltaics system design, site preparation, installation, interconnection, operations and maintenance
planning, as well as system generation output and existing load analysis for each proposed site. While
the SMP grant cannot be used for installation, it is paying for financial modeling of possible community
solar pilots, and analysis of regional impact if those pilots were scaled up and this type of project became
widespread in the Chicago area. The information provided by this Technical Feasibility Analysis will
become inputs to the larger SMP project.
This is a Comparable Government Procurement pursuant to Section 34-140 of the Cook County
Procurement Code. Primera Engineers, Ltd was previously awarded a contract by the City of Chicago
through a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) process. Cook County wishes to leverage this procurement
effort.

months, have been purchased for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest;
and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
